Benjamin Disraeli

Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, (21 December 1804 – 19 April 1881), was a British statesman of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> who twice served as <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>. He played a central role in the creation of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">modern Conservative Party</a>, defining its policies and its broad outreach. Disraeli is remembered for his influential voice in world affairs, his political battles with the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> leader <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>, and his <a href="one-nation%20conservatism">one-nation conservatism</a> or "Tory democracy". He made the Conservatives the party most identified with the glory and power of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. He is the only British prime minister to have been <a href="British%20Jews">of Jewish birth</a>. He was also a novelist, publishing works of fiction even as prime minister.

Disraeli was born in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>, then a part of <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>. His father left Judaism after a dispute at his <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>; young Benjamin became an <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> at the age of 12. After several unsuccessful attempts, Disraeli entered the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> in 1837. In 1846 the Prime Minister at the time, <a href="Robert%20Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a>, split the party over his proposal to repeal the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a>, which involved ending the tariff on imported grain. Disraeli clashed with Peel in the House of Commons. Disraeli became a major figure in the party. When <a href="Edward%20Smith-Stanley%2C%2014th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a>, the party leader, thrice formed governments in the 1850s and 1860s, Disraeli served as <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a> and <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons">Leader of the House of Commons</a>.

Upon Derby's retirement in 1868, Disraeli became Prime Minister briefly before losing that year's general election. He returned to the Opposition, before leading the party to winning a majority in the 1874 general election. He maintained a close friendship with <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, who in 1876 appointed him Earl of Beaconsfield. Disraeli's second term was dominated by the <a href="Eastern%20Question">Eastern Question</a>—the slow decay of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and the desire of other European powers, such as Russia, to gain at its expense. Disraeli arranged for the British to purchase a major interest in the <a href="Suez%20Canal%20Company">Suez Canal Company</a> (in Ottoman-controlled Egypt). In 1878, faced with Russian victories against the Ottomans, he worked at the <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> to obtain peace in the Balkans at terms favourable to Britain and unfavourable to Russia, its longstanding enemy. This diplomatic victory over Russia established Disraeli as one of Europe's leading statesmen.

World events thereafter moved against the Conservatives. Controversial wars in <a href="Second%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Afghanistan</a> and <a href="Anglo-Zulu%20War">South Africa</a> undermined his public support. He angered British farmers by refusing to reinstitute the Corn Laws in response to poor harvests and cheap imported grain. With Gladstone conducting <a href="Midlothian%20campaign">a massive speaking campaign</a>, his Liberals bested Disraeli's Conservatives at <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201880">the 1880 general election</a>. In his final months, Disraeli led the Conservatives in Opposition. He had throughout his career written novels, beginning in 1826, and he published his last completed novel, "<a href="Endymion%20%28Disraeli%20novel%29">Endymion</a>", shortly before he died at the age of 76.

Disraeli was born on 21 December 1804 at 6 King's Road, Bedford Row, <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>, London, the second child and eldest son of <a href="Isaac%20D%27Israeli">Isaac D'Israeli</a>, a literary critic and historian, and Maria (Miriam), "née" Basevi. The family was of <a href="Sephardic%20Jew">Sephardic Jew</a>ish Italian mercantile background. All Disraeli's grandparents and great-grandparents were born in Italy; Isaac's father, <a href="Benjamin%20D%27Israeli%20%28merchant%29">Benjamin</a>, moved to England from <a href="Venice">Venice</a> in 1748. Disraeli later romanticised his origins, claiming that his father's family was of grand Spanish and Venetian descent; in fact Isaac's family was of no great distinction, but on Disraeli's mother's side, in which he took no interest, there were some distinguished forebears. Historians differ on Disraeli's motives for rewriting his family history: Bernard Glassman argues that it was intended to give him status comparable to that of England's ruling elite; <a href="Sarah%20Bradford">Sarah Bradford</a> believes "his dislike of the commonplace would not allow him to accept the facts of his birth as being as middle-class and undramatic as they really were".
Disraeli's siblings were Sarah (1802–1859), Naphtali (born and died 1807), Ralph (1809–1898), and James ("Jem") (1813–1868). He was close to his sister, and on affectionate but more distant terms with his surviving brothers. Details of his schooling are sketchy. From the age of about six he was a <a href="day%20pupil">day boy</a> at a <a href="dame%20school">dame school</a> in <a href="Islington">Islington</a> that one of his biographers later described as "for those days a very high-class establishment". Two years later or so—the exact date has not been ascertained—he was sent as a boarder to Rev John Potticary's <a href="St%20Piran%27s%20%28school%29">St Piran's school</a> at <a href="Blackheath%2C%20London">Blackheath</a>. While he was there events at the family home changed the course of Disraeli's education and of his whole life: his father renounced Judaism and had the four children baptised into the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> in July and August 1817.

Isaac D'Israeli had never taken religion very seriously, but had remained a conforming member of the <a href="Bevis%20Marks%20Synagogue">Bevis Marks Synagogue</a>. His father, the elder Benjamin, was a prominent and devout member; it was probably from respect for him that Isaac did not leave when he fell out with the synagogue authorities in 1813. After Benjamin senior died in 1816 Isaac felt free to leave the congregation following a second dispute. Isaac's friend <a href="Sharon%20Turner">Sharon Turner</a>, a solicitor, convinced him that although he could comfortably remain unattached to any formal religion it would be disadvantageous to the children if they did so. Turner stood as godfather when Benjamin was baptised, aged twelve, on 31 July 1817.

Conversion to Christianity enabled Disraeli to contemplate a career in politics. Britain in the early-nineteenth century was not a greatly anti-Semitic society, and there had been <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%23United%20Kingdom">Members of Parliament</a> (MPs) from Jewish families since <a href="Sampson%20Eardley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Eardley">Samson Gideon</a> in 1770. But until 1858, MPs were required to take the oath of allegiance "on the true faith of a Christian", necessitating at least nominal conversion. It is not known whether Disraeli formed any ambition for a parliamentary career at the time of his baptism, but there is no doubt that he bitterly regretted his parents' decision not to send him to <a href="Winchester%20College">Winchester College</a>. As one of the great <a href="Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public schools</a> of England, Winchester consistently provided recruits to the political elite. His two younger brothers were sent there, and it is not clear why Isaac D'Israeli chose to send his eldest son to a much less prestigious school. The boy evidently held his mother responsible for the decision; Bradford speculates that "Benjamin's delicate health and his obviously Jewish appearance may have had something to do with it." The school chosen for him was run by <a href="Eliezer%20Cogan">Eliezer Cogan</a> at <a href="Higham%20Hill">Higham Hill</a> in <a href="Walthamstow">Walthamstow</a>. He began there in the autumn term of 1817; he later recalled his education:
In November 1821, shortly before his seventeenth birthday, Disraeli was <a href="Articled%20clerk">articled</a> as a clerk to a firm of <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a>s—Swain, Stevens, Maples, Pearse and Hunt—in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. T F Maples was not only the young Disraeli's employer and friend of his father's, but also his prospective father-in-law: Isaac and Maples entertained the possibility that the latter's only daughter might be a suitable match for Benjamin. A friendship developed, but there was no romance. The firm had a large and profitable business, and as the biographer R W Davis observes, the clerkship was "the kind of secure, respectable position that many fathers dream of for their children". Although biographers including <a href="Robert%20Blake%2C%20Baron%20Blake">Robert Blake</a> and Bradford comment that such a post was incompatible with Disraeli's romantic and ambitious nature, he reportedly gave his employers satisfactory service, and later professed to have learned a good deal from his time with the firm. He recalled, "I had some scruples, for even then I dreamed of Parliament. My father's refrain always was '<a href="Philip%20Carteret%20Webb">Philip Carteret Webb</a>', who was the most eminent solicitor of his boyhood and who was an MP. It would be a mistake to suppose that the two years and more that I was in the office of our friend were wasted. I have often thought, though I have often regretted the University, that it was much the reverse."
The year after joining Maples' firm, Benjamin changed his surname from D'Israeli to Disraeli. His reasons for doing so are unknown, but the biographer Bernard Glassman surmises that it was to avoid being confused with his father. Disraeli's sister and brothers adopted the new version of the name; Isaac and his wife retained the older form.

Disraeli toured Belgium and the <a href="Rhine">Rhine Valley</a> with his father in the summer of 1824; he later wrote that it was while travelling on the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> that he decided to abandon his position: "I determined when descending those magical waters that I would not be a lawyer." On their return to England he left the solicitors, at the suggestion of Maples, with the aim of qualifying as a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>. He enrolled as a student at <a href="Lincoln%27s%20Inn">Lincoln's Inn</a> and joined the <a href="Chambers%20%28law%29">chambers</a> of his uncle, Nathaniel Basevy, and then those of Benjamin Austen, who persuaded Isaac that Disraeli would never make a barrister and should be allowed to pursue a literary career. He had made a tentative start: in May 1824 he submitted a manuscript to his father's friend, the publisher <a href="John%20Murray%20%281778%E2%80%931843%29">John Murray</a>, but withdrew it before Murray could decide whether to publish it. Released from the law, Disraeli did some work for Murray, but turned most of his attention not to literature but to speculative dealing on the <a href="stock%20exchange">stock exchange</a>.

There was at the time a boom in shares in South American mining companies. Spain was losing its South American colonies in the face of rebellions. At the urging of <a href="George%20Canning">George Canning</a> the British government recognised the new independent governments of Argentina (1824), Colombia and Mexico (both 1825). With no money of his own, Disraeli borrowed money to invest. He became involved with the financier <a href="John%20Diston%20Powles">J. D. Powles</a>, who was prominent among those encouraging the mining boom. In the course of 1825, Disraeli wrote three anonymous pamphlets for Powles, promoting the companies. The pamphlets were published by John Murray, who invested heavily in the boom.

Murray had for some time had ambitions to establish a new morning paper to compete with "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>". In 1825 Disraeli convinced him that he should proceed. The new paper, "<a href="The%20Representative%20%28newspaper%29">The Representative</a>", promoted the mines and those politicians who supported them, particularly Canning. Disraeli impressed Murray with his energy and commitment to the project, but he failed in his key task of persuading the eminent writer <a href="John%20Gibson%20Lockhart">John Gibson Lockhart</a> to edit the paper. After that, Disraeli's influence on Murray waned, and to his resentment he was sidelined in
the affairs of "The Representative". The paper survived for only six months, partly because the mining <a href="Stock%20market%20bubble">bubble</a> burst in late 1825, and partly because, according to Blake, the paper was "atrociously edited", and would have failed regardless.

The bursting of the mining bubble was ruinous for Disraeli. By June 1825 he and his business partners had lost £7,000. Disraeli could not pay off the last of his debts from this debacle until 1849. He turned to writing, motivated partly by his desperate need for money, and partly by a wish for revenge on Murray and others by whom he felt slighted. There was a vogue for what was called "silver-fork fiction"—novels depicting aristocratic life, usually by anonymous authors, read avidly by the aspirational middle classes. Disraeli's first novel, "<a href="Vivian%20Grey">Vivian Grey</a>", published anonymously in four volumes in 1826–27, was a thinly veiled re-telling of the affair of "The Representative". It sold well, but caused much offence in influential circles when the authorship was discovered. Disraeli, then just 23 years old, did not move in high society, as the numerous <a href="solecism">solecism</a>s in his book made obvious. Reviewers were sharply critical on these grounds of both the author and the book. Furthermore, Murray and Lockhart, men of great influence in literary circles, believed that Disraeli had caricatured them and abused their confidence—an accusation denied by the author but repeated by many of his biographers. In later editions Disraeli made many changes, softening his satire, but the damage to his reputation proved long-lasting.

Disraeli's biographer Jonathan Parry writes that the financial failure and personal criticism that Disraeli suffered in 1825 and 1826 were probably the trigger for a serious nervous crisis affecting him over the next four years: "He had always been moody, sensitive, and solitary by nature, but now became seriously depressed and lethargic." He was still living with his parents in London, but in search of the "change of air" recommended by the family's doctors Isaac took a succession of houses in the country and on the coast, before Disraeli sought wider horizons.

Together with his sister's fiancé, William Meredith, Disraeli travelled widely in southern Europe and beyond in 1830–31. The trip was financed partly by another high society novel, "The Young Duke", written in 1829–30. The tour was cut short suddenly by Meredith's death from smallpox in Cairo in July 1831. Despite this tragedy, and the need for treatment for a sexually transmitted disease on his return, Disraeli felt enriched by his experiences. He became, in Parry's words, "aware of values that seemed denied to his insular countrymen. The journey encouraged his self-consciousness, his moral relativism, and his interest in Eastern racial and religious attitudes." Blake regards the tour as one of the formative experiences of Disraeli's whole career: "[T]he impressions that it made on him were life-lasting. They conditioned his attitude toward some of the most important political problems which faced him in his later years—especially the Eastern Question; they also coloured many of his novels."

Disraeli wrote two novels in the aftermath of the tour. "<a href="Contarini%20Fleming">Contarini Fleming</a>" (1832) was avowedly a self-portrait. It is subtitled "a psychological autobiography", and depicts the conflicting elements of its hero's character: the duality of northern and Mediterranean ancestry, the dreaming artist and the bold man of action. As Parry observes, the book ends on a political note, setting out Europe's progress "from feudal to federal principles". "<a href="The%20Wondrous%20Tale%20of%20Alroy">The Wondrous Tale of Alroy</a>" the following year portrayed the problems of a medieval Jew in deciding between a small, exclusively Jewish state and a large empire embracing all.
After the two novels were published, Disraeli declared that he would "write no more about myself". He had already turned his attention to politics in 1832, during the great crisis over the <a href="Reform%20Bill%20of%201832">Reform Bill</a>. He contributed to an anti-<a href="Whigs%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> pamphlet edited by <a href="John%20Wilson%20Croker">John Wilson Croker</a> and published by Murray entitled "England and France: or a cure for Ministerial Gallomania". The choice of a <a href="Tories%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Tory</a> publication was regarded as strange by Disraeli's friends and relatives, who thought him more of a <a href="Radicals%20%28UK%29">Radical</a>. Indeed, he had objected to Murray about Croker's inserting "high Tory" sentiment: Disraeli remarked, "it is quite impossible that anything adverse to the general measure of Reform can issue from my pen." Moreover, at the time "Gallomania" was published, Disraeli was electioneering in <a href="Wycombe%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">High Wycombe</a> in the Radical interest.

Disraeli's politics at the time were influenced both by his rebellious streak and by his desire to make his mark. At that time, the politics of the nation were dominated by members of the aristocracy, together with a few powerful commoners. The Whigs derived from the coalition of Lords who had forced through the <a href="Bill%20of%20Rights%201689">Bill of Rights</a> in 1689 and in some cases were their actual descendants, not merely spiritual. The Tories tended to support King and Church, and sought to thwart political change. A small number of Radicals, generally from northern constituencies, were the strongest advocates of continuing reform. In the early-1830s the Tories and the interests they represented appeared to be a lost cause. The other great party, the Whigs, were anathema to Disraeli: "Toryism is worn out & I cannot condescend to be a Whig." There were two general elections in 1832; Disraeli unsuccessfully stood as a Radical at High Wycombe in each.

Disraeli's political views embraced certain Radical policies, particularly democratic reform of the electoral system, and also some Tory ones, including <a href="protectionism">protectionism</a>. He began to move in Tory circles. In 1834 he was introduced to the former <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="John%20Copley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lyndhurst">Lord Lyndhurst</a>, by Henrietta Sykes, wife of <a href="Sir%20Francis%20William%20Sykes%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir Francis Sykes</a>. She was having an affair with Lyndhurst, and began another with Disraeli. Disraeli and Lyndhurst took an immediate liking to each other. Lyndhurst was an indiscreet gossip with a fondness for intrigue; this appealed greatly to Disraeli, who became his secretary and go-between. In 1835 Disraeli stood for the last time as a Radical, unsuccessfully contesting High Wycombe once again.
In April 1835, Disraeli fought a <a href="by-election">by-election</a> at <a href="Taunton%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Taunton</a> as a Tory candidate. The Irish MP <a href="Daniel%20O%27Connell">Daniel O'Connell</a>, misled by inaccurate press reports, thought Disraeli had slandered him while electioneering at Taunton; he launched an outspoken attack, referring to Disraeli as:
Disraeli's public exchanges with O'Connell, extensively reproduced in "The Times", included a demand for a duel with the 60-year-old O'Connell's son (which resulted in Disraeli's temporary detention by the authorities), a reference to "the inextinguishable hatred with which [he] shall pursue [O'Connell's] existence", and the accusation that O'Connell's supporters had a "princely revenue wrung from a starving race of fanatical slaves". Disraeli was highly gratified by the dispute, which propelled him to general public notice for the first time. He did not defeat the incumbent Whig member, <a href="Henry%20Labouchere%2C%201st%20Baron%20Taunton">Henry Labouchere</a>, but the Taunton constituency was regarded as unwinnable by the Tories. Disraeli kept Labouchere's majority down to 170, a good showing that put him in line for a winnable seat in the near future.

With Lyndhurst's encouragement Disraeli turned to writing propaganda for his newly adopted party. His "Vindication of the English Constitution", was published in December 1835. It was couched in the form of an open letter to Lyndhurst, and in Bradford's view encapsulates a political philosophy that Disraeli adhered to for the rest of his life. Its themes were the value of benevolent aristocratic government, a loathing of political dogma, and the modernisation of Tory policies. The following year he wrote a series of satires on politicians of the day, which he published in "The Times" under the pen-name "Runnymede". His targets included the Whigs, collectively and individually, Irish nationalists, and political corruption. One essay ended:

Disraeli was now firmly in the Tory camp. He was elected to the exclusively Tory <a href="Carlton%20Club">Carlton Club</a> in 1836, and was also taken up by the party's leading hostess, <a href="Frances%20Vane%2C%20Marchioness%20of%20Londonderry">Lady Londonderry</a>. In June 1837 <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">WilliamIV</a> died, the young <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, his niece, succeeded him, and parliament was dissolved. On the recommendation of the Carlton Club, Disraeli was adopted as a Tory parliamentary candidate at the ensuing <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201837">general election</a>.

In the election in July 1837 Disraeli won a seat in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a> as one of two members, both Tory, for the constituency of <a href="Maidstone%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Maidstone</a>. The other was <a href="Wyndham%20Lewis%20%28politician%29">Wyndham Lewis</a>, who helped finance Disraeli's election campaign, and who died the following year. In the same year Disraeli published a novel, "Henrietta Temple", which was a love story and social comedy, drawing on his affair with Henrietta Sykes. He had broken off the relationship in late 1836, distraught that she had taken yet another lover. His other novel of this period is "<a href="Venetia%20%28Disraeli%20novel%29">Venetia</a>", a romance based on the characters of <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Shelley</a> and <a href="Lord%20Byron">Byron</a>, written quickly to raise much-needed money.

Disraeli made his <a href="maiden%20speech">maiden speech</a> in Parliament on 7 December 1837. He followed O'Connell, whom he sharply criticised for the latter's "long, rambling, jumbling, speech". He was shouted down by O'Connell's supporters. After this unpromising start Disraeli kept a low profile for the rest of the parliamentary session. He was a loyal supporter of the party leader <a href="Robert%20Peel">Sir Robert Peel</a> and his policies, with the exception of a personal sympathy for the <a href="Chartism">Chartist</a> movement that most Tories did not share.
In 1839 Disraeli married <a href="Mary%20Anne%20Disraeli">Mary Anne Lewis</a>, the widow of Wyndham Lewis. Twelve years Disraeli's senior, Mary Lewis had a substantial income of £5,000 a year. His motives were generally assumed to be mercenary, but the couple came to cherish one another, remaining close until she died more than three decades later. "Dizzy married me for my money", his wife said later, "But, if he had the chance again, he would marry me for love."

Finding the financial demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for <a href="Shrewsbury%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Shrewsbury</a>, winning one of the constituency's two seats at the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201841">1841 general election</a>, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election was a massive defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at being left on the <a href="Backbencher">back benches</a>, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.

Although a Tory (or Conservative, as some in the party now called themselves) Disraeli was sympathetic to some of the aims of Chartism, and argued for an alliance between the <a href="landed%20nobility">landed aristocracy</a> and the working class against the increasing power of the merchants and new industrialists in the middle class. After Disraeli won widespread acclaim in March 1842 for worsting the formidable <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> in debate, he was taken up by a small group of idealistic new Tory MPs, with whom he formed the <a href="Young%20England">Young England</a> group. They held that the landed interests should use their power to protect the poor from exploitation by middle-class businessmen.

For many years in his parliamentary career Disraeli hoped to forge a paternalistic Tory-Radical alliance, but he was unsuccessful. Before the <a href="Reform%20Act%201867">Reform Act 1867</a>, the working class did not possess the vote and therefore had little political power. Although Disraeli forged a personal friendship with <a href="John%20Bright">John Bright</a>, a Lancashire manufacturer and leading Radical, Disraeli was unable to persuade Bright to sacrifice his distinct position for parliamentary advancement. When Disraeli attempted to secure a Tory-Radical cabinet in 1852, Bright refused.

Disraeli gradually became a sharp critic of Peel's government, often deliberately taking positions contrary to those of his nominal chief. The best known of these stances were over the <a href="Maynooth%20Grant">Maynooth Grant</a> in 1845 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. But the young MP had attacked his leader as early as 1843 on Ireland and then on foreign policy interventions. In a letter of February 1844, he slighted the Prime Minister for failing to send him a Policy Circular. He laid into the Whigs as freebooters, swindlers and conmen but Peel's own Free Trade policies were directly in the firing line.

The <a href="President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a>, <a href="William%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, resigned from the cabinet over the Maynooth Grant. The Corn Laws imposed a tariff on imported wheat, protecting British farmers from foreign competition, but making the cost of bread artificially high. Peel hoped that the repeal of the Corn Laws and the resultant influx of cheaper wheat into Britain would relieve the condition of the poor, and in particular the suffering caused by successive failure of potato crops in Ireland—the <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Great Famine</a>.

The first months of 1846 were dominated by a battle in Parliament between the free traders and the protectionists over the repeal of the Corn Laws, with the latter rallying around Disraeli and <a href="Lord%20George%20Bentinck">Lord George Bentinck</a>. The landowning interest in the Party, under its leader, <a href="Sir%20William%20Miles%2C%201st%20Baronet">William Miles</a> MP for <a href="East%20Somerset%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">East Somerset</a>, had called upon Disraeli to lead the Party. Disraeli had declined, though pledged support to the Country Gentlemen's Interes, as Bentink had offered to lead if he had Disraeli's support. Disraeli stated, in a letter to Sir William Miles of 11 June 1860, that he wished to help "because, from my earliest years, my sympathies had been with the landed interest of England".

An alliance of free-trade Conservatives (the "<a href="Peelites">Peelites</a>"), Radicals, and Whigs carried repeal, and the Conservative Party split: the Peelites moved towards the Whigs, while a "new" Conservative Party formed around the protectionists, led by Disraeli, Bentinck, and <a href="Edward%20Smith-Stanley%2C%2014th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Stanley</a> (later Lord Derby).

The split in the Tory party over the repeal of the Corn Laws had profound implications for Disraeli's political career: almost every Tory politician with experience of office followed Peel, leaving the rump bereft of leadership. In Blake's words, "[Disraeli] found himself almost the only figure on his side capable of putting up the oratorical display essential for a parliamentary leader." Looking on from the House of Lords, the <a href="George%20Campbell%2C%208th%20Duke%20of%20Argyll">Duke of Argyll</a> wrote that Disraeli "was like a <a href="subaltern">subaltern</a> in a great battle where every superior officer was killed or wounded". If the Tory Party could muster the electoral support necessary to form a government, then Disraeli now seemed to be guaranteed high office. However, he would take office with a group of men who possessed little or no official experience, who had rarely felt moved to speak in the House of Commons, and who, as a group, remained hostile to Disraeli on a personal level. In the event the matter was not put to the test, as the Tory split soon had the party out of office, not regaining power until 1852. The Conservatives would not again have a majority in the House of Commons until 1874.

Peel successfully steered the repeal of the Corn Laws through Parliament, and was then defeated by an alliance of all his enemies on the issue of Irish law and order; he resigned in June 1846. The Tories remained split and the Queen sent for <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Russell">Lord John Russell</a>, the Whig leader. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201847">1847 general election</a>, Disraeli stood, successfully, for the <a href="Buckinghamshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Buckinghamshire</a> constituency. The new House of Commons had more Conservative than Whig members, but the depth of the Tory schism enabled Russell to continue to govern. The Conservatives were led by Bentinck in the Commons and Stanley in the Lords.
In 1847 a small political crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from the leadership and highlighted Disraeli's differences with his own party. In that year's general election, <a href="Lionel%20de%20Rothschild">Lionel de Rothschild</a> had been returned for the <a href="City%20of%20London%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">City of London</a>. As a practising Jew he could not take the oath of allegiance in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.

Disraeli spoke in favour of the measure, arguing that Christianity was "completed Judaism", and asking the House of Commons "Where is your Christianity if you do not believe in their Judaism?" Russell and Disraeli's future rival Gladstone thought it brave of him to speak as he did; the speech was badly received by his own party. The Tories and the Anglican establishment were hostile to the bill. <a href="Samuel%20Wilberforce">Samuel Wilberforce</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Oxford">Bishop of Oxford</a>, spoke strongly against the measure and implied that Russell was paying off the Jews for helping elect him. With the exception of Disraeli, every member of the future protectionist cabinet then in Parliament voted against the measure. One who was not yet an MP, <a href="John%20Manners%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Rutland">Lord John Manners</a>, stood against Rothschild when the latter re-submitted himself for election in 1849. Disraeli, who had attended the Protectionists dinner at the Merchant Taylors Hall, joined Bentinck in speaking and voting for the bill, although his own speech was a standard one of toleration. The measure was voted down.

In the aftermath of the debate Bentinck resigned the leadership and was succeeded by <a href="Charles%20Manners%2C%206th%20Duke%20of%20Rutland">Lord Granby</a>; Disraeli's own speech, thought by many of his own party to be blasphemous, ruled him out for the time being. While these intrigues played out, Disraeli was working with the Bentinck family to secure the necessary financing to purchase <a href="Hughenden%20Manor">Hughenden Manor</a>, in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>. The possession of a country house, and incumbency of a county constituency were regarded as essential for a Tory with ambitions to lead the party. Disraeli and his wife alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London for the rest of their marriage. The negotiations were complicated by Bentinck's sudden death on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of £25,000 from Bentinck's brothers <a href="Lord%20Henry%20Bentinck">Lord Henry Bentinck</a> and <a href="William%20Cavendish-Scott-Bentinck%2C%205th%20Duke%20of%20Portland">Lord Titchfield</a>.

Within a month of his appointment Granby resigned the leadership in the Commons, feeling himself inadequate to the post, and the party functioned without a leader in the Commons for the rest of the parliamentary session. At the start of the next session, affairs were handled by a triumvirate of Granby, Disraeli, and <a href="John%20Charles%20Herries">John Charles Herries</a>—indicative of the tension between Disraeli and the rest of the party, who needed his talents but mistrusted him. This confused arrangement ended with Granby's resignation in 1851; Disraeli effectively ignored the two men regardless.

In March 1851, Lord John Russell's <a href="Whig%20government%2C%201846%E2%80%931852">government</a> was defeated over a bill to equalise the county and borough franchises, mostly because of divisions among his supporters. He resigned, and the Queen sent for Stanley, who felt that a minority government could do little and would not last long, so Russell remained in office. Disraeli regretted this, hoping for an opportunity, however brief, to show himself capable in office. Stanley, on the other hand, deprecated his inexperienced followers as a reason for not assuming office, "These are not names I can put before the Queen."

At the end of June 1851, Stanley's father died, and he succeeded to his title as <a href="Earl%20of%20Derby">Earl of Derby</a>. The Whigs were wracked by internal dissensions during the second half of 1851, much of which Parliament spent in recess. Russell dismissed <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a> from the cabinet, leaving the latter determined to deprive the Prime Minister of office as well. Palmerston did so within weeks of Parliament's reassembly on 4 February 1852, his followers combining with Disraeli's Tories to defeat the government on a Militia Bill, and Russell resigned. Derby had either to take office or risk damage to his reputation and he accepted the Queen's commission as Prime Minister. Palmerston declined any office; Derby had hoped to have him as <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>. Disraeli, his closest ally, was his second choice and accepted, though disclaiming any great knowledge in the financial field. Gladstone refused to join the government. Disraeli may have been attracted to the office by the £5,000 per year salary, which would help pay his debts. Few of the new cabinet had held office before; when Derby tried to inform the <a href="Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> of the names of the Queen's new ministers, the old Duke, who was somewhat deaf, inadvertently branded the new government by incredulously repeating "Who? Who?"

In the following weeks, Disraeli served as Leader of the House (with Derby as Prime Minister in the Lords) and as Chancellor. He wrote regular reports on proceedings in the Commons to Victoria, who described them as "very curious" and "much in the style of his books". Parliament was <a href="Legislative%20session%23Procedure%20in%20Commonwealth%20realms">prorogued</a> on 1 July 1852 as the Tories could not govern for long as a minority; Disraeli hoped that they would gain a majority of about 40. Instead, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201852">the election</a> later that month had no clear winner, and the Derby government held to power pending the meeting of Parliament.

Disraeli's task as Chancellor was to devise a budget which would satisfy the protectionist elements who supported the Tories, without uniting the free-traders against it. His proposed budget, which he presented to the Commons on 3 December, lowered the taxes on malt and tea, provisions designed to appeal to the working class. To make his budget revenue-neutral, as funds were needed to provide defences against the French, he doubled the house tax and continued the income tax. Disraeli's overall purpose was to enact policies which would benefit the working classes, making his party more attractive to them. Although the budget did not contain protectionist features, the opposition was prepared to destroy it—and Disraeli's career as Chancellor—in part out of revenge for his actions against Peel in 1846. MP <a href="Sidney%20Herbert%2C%201st%20Baron%20Herbert%20of%20Lea">Sidney Herbert</a> predicted that the budget would fail because "Jews make no converts".
Disraeli delivered the budget on 3 December 1852, and prepared to wind up the debate for the government on 16 December—it was customary for the Chancellor to have the last word. A massive defeat for the government was predicted. Disraeli attacked his opponents individually, and then as a force, "I face a Coalition ... This, too, I know, that England does not love coalitions." His speech of three hours was quickly seen as a parliamentary masterpiece. As MPs prepared to divide, Gladstone rose to his feet and began an angry speech, despite the efforts of Tory MPs to shout him down. The interruptions were fewer, as Gladstone gained control of the House, and in the next two hours painted a picture of Disraeli as frivolous and his budget as subversive. The government was defeated by 19 votes, and Derby resigned four days later. He was replaced by the Peelite <a href="George%20Hamilton-Gordon%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Aberdeen">Earl of Aberdeen</a>, with Gladstone as his Chancellor. Because of Disraeli's unpopularity among the Peelites, no party reconciliation was possible while he remained Tory leader in the House of Commons.

With the fall of the government, Disraeli and the Conservatives returned to the opposition benches. Disraeli would spend three-quarters of his 44-year parliamentary career in opposition. Derby was reluctant to seek to unseat the government, fearing a repetition of the Who? Who? Ministry and knowing that despite his lieutenant's strengths, shared dislike of Disraeli was part of what had formed the governing coalition. Disraeli, on the other hand, was anxious to return to office. In the interim, Disraeli, as Conservative leader in the Commons, opposed the government on all major measures.

In June 1853 Disraeli was awarded an honorary degree by <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a>. He had been recommended for it by Lord Derby, the university's <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Oxford%20University">Chancellor</a>. The start of the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> in 1854 caused a lull in party politics; Disraeli spoke patriotically in support. The British military efforts were marked by bungling, and in 1855 a restive Parliament considered a resolution to establish a committee on the conduct of the war. The Aberdeen government chose to make this a <a href="motion%20of%20confidence">motion of confidence</a>; Disraeli led the opposition to defeat the government, 305 to 148. Aberdeen resigned, and the Queen sent for Derby, who to Disraeli's frustration refused to take office. Palmerston was deemed essential to any Whig ministry, and he would not join any he did not head. The Queen reluctantly asked Palmerston to form a government. Under Palmerston, the war went better, and was ended by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281856%29">Treaty of Paris</a> in early 1856. Disraeli was early to call for peace, but had little influence on events.

When <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">a rebellion</a> broke out in India in 1857, Disraeli took a keen interest in affairs, having been a member of a <a href="select%20committee">select committee</a> in 1852 which considered how best to rule the subcontinent, and had proposed eliminating the governing role of the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a>. After peace was restored, and Palmerston in early 1858 brought in legislation for direct rule of India by the Crown, Disraeli opposed it. Many Conservative MPs refused to follow him and the bill passed the Commons easily.

Palmerston's grip on the premiership was weakened by his response to the <a href="Orsini%20affair">Orsini affair</a>, in which an attempt was made to assassinate the French Emperor <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> by an Italian revolutionary with a bomb made in Birmingham. At the request of the French ambassador, Palmerston put forward amendments to the <a href="conspiracy%20to%20murder">conspiracy to murder</a> statute, proposing to make creating an <a href="bomb">infernal device</a> a felony rather than a misdemeanour. He was defeated by 19 votes on the second reading, with many Liberals crossing the aisle against him. He immediately resigned, and Lord Derby returned to office.

Derby took office at the head of a purely "Conservative" administration, not in coalition with any other faction. He again offered a place to Gladstone, who declined. Disraeli was once more leader of the House of Commons and returned to the Exchequer. As in 1852, Derby led a <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a>, dependent on the division of its opponents for survival. As Leader of the House, Disraeli resumed his regular reports to Queen Victoria, who had requested that he include what she "could not meet in newspapers".

During its brief life of just over a year, the Derby government proved moderately progressive. The <a href="Government%20of%20India%20Act%201858">Government of India Act 1858</a> ended the role of the East India Company in governing the subcontinent. It also passed the Thames Purification Bill, which funded the construction of much larger sewers for London. Disraeli had supported efforts <a href="Emancipation%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">to allow Jews to sit in Parliament</a>—the oaths required of new members could only be made in good faith by a Christian. Disraeli had a bill passed through the Commons allowing each house of Parliament to determine what oaths its members should take. This was grudgingly agreed to by the House of Lords, with a minority of Conservatives joining with the opposition to pass it. In 1858, Baron Lionel de Rothschild became the first MP to profess the Jewish faith.

Faced with a vacancy, Disraeli and Derby tried yet again to bring Gladstone, still nominally a Conservative MP, into the government, hoping to strengthen it. Disraeli wrote a personal letter to Gladstone, asking him to place the good of the party above personal animosity: "Every man performs his office, and there is a Power, greater than ourselves, that disposes of all this." In responding to Disraeli, Gladstone denied that personal feelings played any role in his decisions then and previously whether to accept office, while acknowledging that there were differences between him and Derby "broader than you may have supposed".

The Tories pursued a Reform Bill in 1859, which would have resulted in a modest increase to the franchise. The Liberals were healing the breaches between those who favoured Russell and the Palmerston loyalists, and in late March 1859, the government was defeated on a Russell-sponsored amendment. Derby dissolved Parliament, and the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201859">ensuing general election</a> resulted in modest Tory gains, but not enough to control the Commons. When Parliament assembled, Derby's government was defeated by 13 votes on an amendment to the <a href="speech%20from%20the%20throne">Address from the Throne</a>. He resigned, and the Queen reluctantly sent for Palmerston again.

After Derby's second ejection from office, Disraeli faced dissension within Conservative ranks from those who blamed him for the defeat, or who felt he was disloyal to Derby—the former Prime Minister warned Disraeli of some MPs seeking his removal from the front bench. Among the conspirators were <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Robert Cecil</a>, a young Conservative MP who would a quarter century later become Prime Minister as Lord Salisbury; he wrote that having Disraeli as leader in the Commons decreased the Conservatives' chance of holding office. When <a href="James%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Cecil's father</a> objected, Lord Robert stated, "I have merely put into print what all the country gentlemen were saying in private."
Disraeli led a toothless opposition in the Commons—seeing no way of unseating Palmerston, Derby had privately agreed not to seek the government's defeat. Disraeli kept himself informed on foreign affairs, and on what was going on in cabinet, thanks to a source within it. When the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> began in 1861, Disraeli said little publicly, but <a href="United%20Kingdom%20and%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">like most Englishmen</a> expected the South to win. Less reticent were Palmerston, Gladstone (again Chancellor) and Russell, whose statements in support of the South contributed to years of hard feelings in the United States. In 1862, Disraeli met Prussian Count <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a> for the first time and said of him, "be careful about that man, he means what he says".

The party truce ended in 1864, with Tories outraged over Palmerston's handling of the territorial dispute between the <a href="German%20Confederation">German Confederation</a> and Denmark known as the <a href="Schleswig-Holstein%20Question">Schleswig-Holstein Question</a>. Disraeli had little help from Derby, who was ill, but he united the party enough on a no-confidence vote to limit the government to a majority of 18—Tory defections and absentees kept Palmerston in office. Despite rumours about Palmerston's health as he passed his eightieth birthday, he remained personally popular, and the Liberals increased their margin in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201865">July 1865 general election</a>. In the wake of the poor election results, Derby predicted to Disraeli that neither of them would ever hold office again.

Political plans were thrown into disarray by Palmerston's death on 18 October 1865. Russell became Prime Minister again, with Gladstone clearly the Liberal Party's leader-in-waiting, and as Leader of the House Disraeli's direct opponent. One of Russell's early priorities was a Reform Bill, but the proposed legislation that Gladstone announced on 12 March 1866 divided his party. The Conservatives and the <a href="Adullamites">dissident Liberals</a> repeatedly attacked Gladstone's bill, and in June finally defeated the government; Russell resigned on 26 June. The dissidents were unwilling to serve under Disraeli in the House of Commons, and Derby formed a third Conservative minority government, with Disraeli again as Chancellor. In 1867, the Conservatives introduced a Reform Bill. Without a majority in the Commons, the Conservatives had little choice but to accept amendments that considerably liberalised the legislation, though Disraeli refused to accept any from Gladstone.

The <a href="Reform%20Act%201867">Reform Act 1867</a> passed that August, extending the franchise by 938,427—an increase of 88%—by giving the vote to male householders and male lodgers paying at least £10 for rooms. It eliminated <a href="rotten%20borough">rotten borough</a>s with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants, and granted constituencies to 15 unrepresented towns, with extra representation to large municipalities such as Liverpool and Manchester. This act was unpopular with the right wing of the Conservative Party, most notably <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%203rd%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Cranborne</a> (as Robert Cecil was by then known), who resigned from the government and spoke against the bill, accusing Disraeli of "a political betrayal which has no parallel in our Parliamentary annals". Cranborne, however, was unable to lead an effective rebellion against Derby and Disraeli. Disraeli gained wide acclaim and became a hero to his party for the "marvellous parliamentary skill" with which he secured the passage of Reform in the Commons.

Derby had long suffered from attacks of <a href="gout">gout</a> which sent him to his bed, unable to deal with politics. As the new session of Parliament approached in February 1868, he was bedridden at his home, <a href="Knowsley%20Hall">Knowsley Hall</a>, near Liverpool. He was reluctant to resign, reasoning that he was only 68, much younger than either Palmerston or Russell at the end of their premierships. Derby knew that his "attacks of illness would, at no distant period, incapacitate me from the discharge of my public duties"; doctors had warned him that his health required his resignation from office. In late February, with Parliament in session and Derby absent, he wrote to Disraeli asking for confirmation that "you will not shrink from the additional heavy responsibility". Reassured, he wrote to the Queen, resigning and recommending Disraeli as "only he could command the cordial support, en masse, of his present colleagues". Disraeli went to <a href="Osborne%20House">Osborne House</a> on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, where the Queen asked him to form a government. The monarch wrote to her daughter, <a href="Victoria%2C%20Princess%20Royal">Prussian Crown Princess Victoria</a>, "Mr. Disraeli is Prime Minister! A proud thing for a man 'risen from the people' to have obtained!" The new Prime Minister told those who came to congratulate him, "I have climbed to the top of the greasy pole."

The Conservatives remained a minority in the House of Commons and the passage of the Reform Bill required the calling of a new election once the new voting register had been compiled. Disraeli's term as Prime Minister, which began in February 1868, would therefore be short unless the Conservatives won the general election. He made only two major changes in the cabinet: he replaced <a href="Frederic%20Thesiger%2C%201st%20Baron%20Chelmsford">Lord Chelmsford</a> as <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> with <a href="Hugh%20Cairns%2C%201st%20Earl%20Cairns">Lord Cairns</a>, and brought in <a href="George%20Ward%20Hunt">George Ward Hunt</a> as Chancellor of the Exchequer. Derby had intended to replace Chelmsford once a vacancy in a suitable sinecure developed. Disraeli was unwilling to wait, and Cairns, in his view, was a far stronger minister.

Disraeli's first premiership was dominated by the heated debate over the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>. Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the <a href="established%20church">established church</a> and was funded by direct taxation, which was greatly resented by the Catholic majority. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with <a href="Henry%20Edward%20Manning">Archbishop Manning</a> the establishment of a Roman Catholic university in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> foundered in March when Gladstone moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal united the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberals</a> under Gladstone's leadership, while causing divisions among the Conservatives.

The Conservatives remained in office because the new electoral register was not yet ready; neither party wished a poll under the old roll. Gladstone began using the Liberal majority in the House of Commons to push through resolutions and legislation. Disraeli's government survived until the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201868">December general election</a>, at which the Liberals were returned to power with a majority of about 110.

Despite its short life, the first Disraeli government succeeded in passing a number of pieces of legislation of a politically noncontentious sort. It ended public executions, and the <a href="Corrupt%20Practices%20Act%201868">Corrupt Practices Act</a> did much to end electoral bribery. It authorised an early version of <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a>, having the Post Office buy up the telegraph companies. Amendments to the school law, the Scottish legal system, and the railway laws were passed. Disraeli sent the successful <a href="1868%20Expedition%20to%20Abyssinia">expedition</a> against <a href="Tewodros%20II">Tewodros II</a> of Ethiopia under <a href="Robert%20Napier%2C%201st%20Baron%20Napier%20of%20Magdala">Sir Robert Napier</a>.

With Gladstone's Liberal majority dominant in the Commons, Disraeli could do little but protest as the government advanced legislation. Accordingly, he chose to await Liberal mistakes. Having leisure time as he was not in office, he wrote a new novel, "<a href="Lothair%20%28novel%29">Lothair</a>" (1870). A work of fiction by a former Prime Minister was a new thing for Britain, and the book became a best seller.

By 1872 there was dissent in the Conservative ranks over the failure to challenge Gladstone and his Liberals. This was quieted as Disraeli took steps to assert his leadership of the party, and as divisions among the Liberals became clear. Public support for Disraeli was shown by cheering at a thanksgiving service in 1872 on the recovery of <a href="Edward%20VII">the Prince of Wales</a> from illness, while Gladstone was met with silence. Disraeli had supported the efforts of party manager <a href="John%20Eldon%20Gorst">John Eldon Gorst</a> to put the administration of the Conservative Party on a modern basis. On Gorst's advice, Disraeli gave a speech to a mass meeting in Manchester that year. To roaring approval, he compared the Liberal front bench to "a range of exhausted volcanoes. Not a flame flickers on a single pallid crest. But the situation is still dangerous. There are occasional earthquakes and ever and again the dark rumbling of the sea." Gladstone, Disraeli stated, dominated the scene and "alternated between a menace and a sigh".

At his first departure from <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a> in 1868, Disraeli had had Victoria create Mary Anne Viscountess of Beaconsfield in her own right in lieu of a peerage for himself. Through 1872 the eighty-year-old peeress was suffering from stomach cancer. She died on 15 December. Urged by a clergyman to turn her thoughts to Jesus Christ in her final days, she said she could not: "You know Dizzy is my J.C." After she died, Gladstone, who always had a liking for Mary Anne, sent her widower a letter of condolence.

In 1873, Gladstone brought forward legislation to establish a Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to questions as to whether he had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.

In January 1874, Gladstone called a general election, convinced that if he waited longer, he would do worse at the polls. Balloting was spread over two weeks, beginning on 1 February. Disraeli devoted much of his campaign to decrying the Liberal programme of the past five years. As the constituencies voted, it became clear that the result would be a Conservative majority, the first since 1841. In Scotland, where the Conservatives were perennially weak, they increased from seven seats to nineteen. Overall, they won 350 seats to 245 for the Liberals and 57 for the Irish <a href="Home%20Rule%20League">Home Rule League</a>. The Queen sent for Disraeli, and he became Prime Minister for the second time.

Disraeli's cabinet of twelve, with six peers and six commoners, was the smallest since <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Reform</a>. Of the peers, five of them had been in Disraeli's 1868 cabinet; the sixth, Lord Salisbury, was reconciled to Disraeli after negotiation and became <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20India">Secretary of State for India</a>. Lord Stanley (who had succeeded his father, the former Prime Minister, as Earl of Derby) became Foreign Secretary and <a href="Stafford%20Northcote%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Iddesleigh">Sir Stafford Northcote</a> the Chancellor.

In August 1876, Disraeli was elevated to the House of Lords as <a href="Earl%20of%20Beaconsfield">Earl of Beaconsfield</a> and Viscount Hughenden. The Queen had offered to ennoble him as early as 1868; he had then declined. She did so again in 1874, when he fell ill at <a href="Balmoral%20Castle">Balmoral</a>, but he was reluctant to leave the Commons for a house in which he had no experience. Continued ill health during his second premiership caused him to contemplate resignation, but his lieutenant, Derby, was unwilling, feeling that he could not manage the Queen. For Disraeli, the Lords, where the debate was less intense, was the alternative to resignation from office. Five days before the end of the 1876 session of Parliament, on 11 August, Disraeli was seen to linger and look around the chamber before departing the Commons. Newspapers reported his ennoblement the following morning.

In addition to the viscounty bestowed on Mary Anne Disraeli; the earldom of Beaconsfield was to have been bestowed on <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a> in 1797, but he had died before receiving it. The name <a href="Beaconsfield">Beaconsfield</a>, a town near Hughenden, also was given to a minor character in "Vivian Grey". Disraeli made various statements about his elevation, writing to Selina, Lady Bradford on 8 August 1876, "I am quite tired of that place [the Commons]" but when asked by a friend how he liked the Lords, replied, "I am dead; dead but in the Elysian fields."

Under the stewardship of <a href="Richard%20Assheton%20Cross">Richard Assheton Cross</a>, the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, Disraeli's new government enacted many reforms, including the <a href="Artisans%27%20and%20Labourers%27%20Dwellings%20Improvement%20Act%201875">Artisans' and Labourers' Dwellings Improvement Act 1875</a>, which made inexpensive loans available to towns and cities to construct working-class housing. Also enacted were the <a href="Public%20Health%20Act%201875">Public Health Act 1875</a>, modernising sanitary codes through the nation, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act (1875), and the Education Act (1876).

Disraeli's government also introduced a new <a href="Factory%20Act">Factory Act</a> meant to protect workers, the <a href="Conspiracy%2C%20and%20Protection%20of%20Property%20Act%201875">Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875</a>, which allowed peaceful picketing, and the Employers and Workmen Act (1875) to enable workers to sue employers in the civil courts if they broke legal contracts. As a result of these social reforms the <a href="Liberal-Labour%20%28UK%29">Liberal-Labour</a> MP <a href="Alexander%20Macdonald%20%28Lib%E2%80%93Lab%20politician%29">Alexander Macdonald</a> told his constituents in 1879, "The Conservative party have done more for the working classes in five years than the Liberals have in fifty."

Gladstone in 1870 had sponsored an <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a>, introducing <a href="competitive%20examination">competitive examination</a> into <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Civil%20Service">the Civil Service</a>, diminishing the political aspects of government hiring. Disraeli did not agree, and while he did not seek to reverse the order, his actions often frustrated its intent. For example, Disraeli made political appointments to positions previously given to career civil servants. In this, he was backed by his party, hungry for office and its emoluments after almost thirty years with only brief spells in government. Disraeli gave positions to hard-up Conservative leaders, even—to Gladstone's outrage—creating one office at £2,000 per year. Nevertheless, Disraeli made fewer peers (only 22, and one of those one of Victoria's sons) than had Gladstone—the Liberal leader had arranged for the bestowal of 37 peerages during his just over five years in office.

As he had in government posts, Disraeli rewarded old friends with clerical positions, making <a href="Sydney%20Turner">Sydney Turner</a>, son of a good friend of Isaac D'Israeli, <a href="Dean%20of%20Ripon">Dean of Ripon</a>. He favoured <a href="Low%20church">Low church</a> clergymen in promotion, disliking other movements in Anglicanism for political reasons. In this, he came into disagreement with the Queen, who out of loyalty to her late husband, <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Albert, Prince Consort</a>, preferred <a href="Broad%20church">Broad church</a> teachings. One controversial appointment had occurred shortly before the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201868">1868 election</a>. When the position of <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> fell vacant, Disraeli reluctantly agreed to the Queen's preferred candidate, <a href="Archibald%20Tait">Archibald Tait</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. To fill Tait's vacant see, Disraeli was urged by many people to appoint <a href="Samuel%20Wilberforce">Samuel Wilberforce</a>, the former <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and leading figure in London society. Disraeli disliked Wilberforce and instead appointed <a href="John%20Jackson%20%28bishop%29">John Jackson</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>. Blake suggested that, on balance, these appointments cost Disraeli more votes than they gained him.

Disraeli always considered foreign affairs to be the most critical and most interesting part of statesmanship. Nevertheless, his biographer Robert Blake doubts that his subject had specific ideas about foreign policy when he took office in 1874. He had rarely travelled abroad; since his youthful tour of the Middle East in 1830–1831, he had left Britain only for his honeymoon and three visits to Paris, the last of which was in 1856. As he had criticised Gladstone for a do-nothing foreign policy, he most probably contemplated what actions would reassert Britain's place in Europe. His brief first premiership, and the first year of his second, gave him little opportunity to make his mark in foreign affairs.

The <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>, opened in 1869, cut weeks and thousands of miles off the journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. Built by French interests, much of the ownership and bonds in the canal remained in their hands, though some of the stock belonged to <a href="Isma%27il%20Pasha">Isma'il Pasha</a>, the <a href="Khedive%20of%20Egypt">Khedive of Egypt</a>, who was noted for his profligate spending. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Lesseps">Ferdinand de Lesseps</a>, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and had also attracted Disraeli's attention. The Khedive governed Egypt under the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>; as in the Crimea, the issue of the Canal raised the <a href="Eastern%20Question">Eastern Question</a> of what to do about the decaying empire governed from <a href="Istanbul">Constantinople</a>. With much of the pre-canal trade and communications between Britain and India passing through the Ottoman Empire, Britain had done its best to prop up the Ottomans against the threat that Russia would take Constantinople, cutting those communications, and giving Russian ships unfettered access to the Mediterranean. The French might also threaten those lines from colonies in Syria. Britain had had the opportunity to purchase shares in the canal but had declined to do so.

Disraeli had passed near Suez in his tour of the Middle East in his youth, and on taking office, recognising the British interest in the canal as a gateway to India, he sent the Liberal MP <a href="Nathan%20Rothschild%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rothschild">Nathan Rothschild</a> to Paris to enquire about buying de Lesseps's shares. On 14 November 1875, the editor of the "<a href="Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">Pall Mall Gazette</a>", <a href="Frederick%20Greenwood">Frederick Greenwood</a>, learned from London banker Henry Oppenheim that the Khedive was seeking to sell his shares in the <a href="Suez%20Canal%20Company">Suez Canal Company</a> to a French firm. Greenwood quickly told Lord Derby, the Foreign Secretary, who notified Disraeli. The Prime Minister moved immediately to secure the shares. On 23 November, the Khedive offered to sell the shares for 100,000,000 <a href="French%20franc">francs</a>. Rather than seek the aid of the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a>, Disraeli asked Lionel de Rothschild to loan funds. Rothschild did so and controversially took a commission on the deal. The banker's capital was at risk as Parliament could have refused to ratify the transaction. The contract for purchase was signed at Cairo on 25 November and the shares deposited at the British consulate the following day.

Disraeli told the Queen, "it is settled; you have it, madam!" The public saw the venture as a daring British statement of its dominance of the seas. <a href="Ian%20Malcolm%20%28politician%29">Sir Ian Malcolm</a> described the Suez Canal share purchase as "the greatest romance of Mr. Disraeli's romantic career". In the following decades, the security of the Suez Canal, as the pathway to India, became a major focus of British foreign policy. A later Foreign Secretary, <a href="George%20Curzon%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Curzon%20of%20Kedleston">Lord Curzon</a>, described the canal in 1909 as "the determining influence of every considerable movement of British power to the east and south of the Mediterranean".

Although initially curious about Disraeli when he entered Parliament in 1837, Victoria came to detest him over his treatment of Peel. Over time, her dislike softened, especially as Disraeli took pains to cultivate her. He told <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a>, "Everybody likes flattery; and, when you come to royalty, you should lay it on with a trowel". Disraeli's biographer, <a href="Adam%20Kirsch">Adam Kirsch</a>, suggests that Disraeli's obsequious treatment of his queen was part flattery, part belief that this was how a queen should be addressed by a loyal subject, and part awe that a middle-class man of Jewish birth should be the companion of a monarch. By the time of his second premiership, Disraeli had built a strong relationship with Victoria, probably closer to her than any of her Prime Ministers except her first, <a href="Lord%20Melbourne">Lord Melbourne</a>. When Disraeli returned as Prime Minister in 1874 and went to <a href="kiss%20hands">kiss hands</a>, he did so literally, on one knee; and, according to Richard Aldous in his book on the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone, "for the next six years Victoria and Disraeli would exploit their closeness for mutual advantage."

Victoria had long wished to have an imperial title, reflecting Britain's expanding domain. She was irked when Czar <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II</a> held a higher rank than her as an emperor, and was appalled that her daughter, the Prussian Crown Princess, would outrank her when <a href="Frederick%20III%2C%20German%20Emperor">her husband</a> came to the throne. She also saw an imperial title as proclaiming Britain's increased stature in the world. The title "<a href="Empress%20of%20India">Empress of India</a>" had been used informally with respect to Victoria for some time and she wished to have that title formally bestowed on her. The Queen prevailed upon Disraeli to introduce a Royal Titles Bill, and also told of her intent to <a href="State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament">open Parliament</a> in person, which during this time she did only when she wanted something from legislators. Disraeli was cautious in response, as careful soundings of MPs brought a negative reaction, and declined to place such a proposal in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Speech">Queen's Speech</a>.

Once the desired bill was prepared, Disraeli's handling of it was not adept. He neglected to notify either the Prince of Wales or the opposition, and was met by irritation from the prince and a full-scale attack from the Liberals. An old enemy of Disraeli, former Liberal Chancellor <a href="Robert%20Lowe">Robert Lowe</a>, alleged during the debate in the Commons that two previous Prime Ministers had refused to introduce such legislation for the Queen. Gladstone immediately stated that he was not one of them, and the Queen gave Disraeli leave to quote her saying she had never approached a Prime Minister with such a proposal. According to Blake, Disraeli "in a brilliant oration of withering invective proceeded to destroy Lowe", who apologised and never held office again. Disraeli said of Lowe that he was the only person in London with whom he would not shake hands and, "he is in the mud and there I leave him."

Fearful of losing, Disraeli was reluctant to bring the bill to a vote in the Commons, but when he eventually did, it passed with a majority of 75. Once the bill was formally enacted, Victoria began signing her letters "Victoria R & I" (, that is, Queen and Empress). According to Aldous, "the unpopular <a href="Royal%20Titles%20Act%201876">Royal Titles Act</a>, however, shattered Disraeli's authority in the House of Commons".

In July 1875 Serb populations in <a href="Bosnia">Bosnia</a> and <a href="Herzegovina">Herzegovina</a>, then provinces of the Ottoman Empire, rose <a href="Herzegovina%20Uprising%20%281875%E2%80%9377%29">in revolt</a> against their Turkish masters, alleging religious persecution and poor administration. The following January, Sultan <a href="Abd%C3%BClaziz">Abdülaziz</a> agreed to reforms proposed by Hungarian statesman <a href="Julius%20Andr%C3%A1ssy">Julius Andrássy</a>, but the rebels, suspecting they might win their freedom, continued their uprising, joined by militants in Serbia <a href="April%20Uprising">and Bulgaria</a>. The Turks suppressed the Bulgarian uprising harshly, and when reports of these actions escaped, Disraeli and Derby stated in Parliament that they did not believe them. Disraeli called them "coffee-house babble" and dismissed allegations of torture by the Ottomans since "Oriental people usually terminate their connections with culprits in a more expeditious fashion".

Gladstone, who had left the Liberal leadership and retired from public life, was appalled by reports of <a href="Batak%20massacre">atrocities in Bulgaria</a>, and in August 1876, penned a hastily written pamphlet arguing that the Turks should be deprived of Bulgaria because of what they had done there. He sent a copy to Disraeli, who called it "vindictive and ill-written ... of all the Bulgarian horrors perhaps the greatest". Gladstone's pamphlet became an immense best-seller and rallied the Liberals to urge that the Ottoman Empire should no longer be a British ally. Disraeli wrote to Lord Salisbury on 3 September, "Had it not been for these unhappy 'atrocities', we should have settled a peace very honourable to England and satisfactory to Europe. Now we are obliged to work from a new point of departure, and dictate to Turkey, who has forfeited all sympathy." In spite of this, Disraeli's policy favoured Constantinople and the territorial integrity of its empire.
Disraeli and the cabinet sent Salisbury as lead British representative to the <a href="Constantinople%20Conference">Constantinople Conference</a>, which met in December 1876 and January 1877. In advance of the conference, Disraeli sent Salisbury private word to seek British military occupation of Bulgaria and Bosnia, and British control of the <a href="Ottoman%20Army">Ottoman Army</a>. Salisbury ignored these instructions, which his biographer, <a href="Andrew%20Roberts%20%28historian%29">Andrew Roberts</a> deemed "ludicrous". Nevertheless, the conference failed to reach agreement with the Turks.

Parliament opened in February 1877, with Disraeli now in the Lords as Earl of Beaconsfield. He spoke only once there in the 1877 session on the Eastern Question, stating on 20 February that there was a need for stability in the Balkans, and that forcing Turkey into territorial concessions would do nothing to secure it. The Prime Minister wanted a deal with the Ottomans whereby Britain would temporarily occupy strategic areas to deter the Russians from war, to be returned on the signing of a peace treaty, but found little support in his cabinet, which favoured partition of the Ottoman Empire. As Disraeli, by then in poor health, continued to battle within the cabinet, Russia invaded Turkey on 21 April, beginning the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%9378%29">Russo-Turkish War</a>.

The Russians pushed through Ottoman territory and by December 1877 had captured the strategic Bulgarian town of <a href="Pleven">Plevna</a>; their march on Constantinople seemed inevitable. The war divided the British, but the Russian success caused some to forget the atrocities and call for intervention on the Turkish side. Others hoped for further Russian successes. The fall of Plevna was a major story for weeks in the newspapers, and Disraeli's warnings that Russia was a threat to British interests in the eastern Mediterranean were deemed prophetic. The <a href="jingoism">jingoistic</a> attitude of many Britons increased Disraeli's political support, and the Queen acted to help him as well, showing her favour by visiting him at Hughenden—the first time she had visited the country home of her Prime Minister since <a href="Second%20Melbourne%20ministry">the Melbourne ministry</a>. At the end of January 1878, the Ottoman Sultan appealed to Britain to save Constantinople. Amid war fever in Britain, the government asked Parliament to vote £6,000,000 to prepare the <a href="British%20Army">Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Navy</a> for war. Gladstone, who had involved himself again in politics, opposed the measure, but less than half his party voted with him. Popular opinion was with Disraeli, though some thought him too soft for not immediately declaring war on Russia.
With the Russians close to Constantinople, the Turks yielded and in March 1878, signed the <a href="Treaty%20of%20San%20Stefano">Treaty of San Stefano</a>, <a href="Liberation%20of%20Bulgaria">conceding a Bulgarian state</a> which would cover a large part of the Balkans. It would be initially Russian-occupied and many feared that it would give them a <a href="client%20state">client state</a> close to Constantinople. Other Ottoman possessions in Europe would become independent; additional territory was to be ceded directly to Russia. This was unacceptable to the British, who protested, hoping to get the Russians to agree to attend an international conference which German Chancellor Bismarck proposed to hold at Berlin. The cabinet discussed Disraeli's proposal to position Indian troops at Malta for possible transit to the Balkans and call out reserves. Derby resigned in protest, and Disraeli appointed Salisbury as Foreign Secretary. Amid British preparations for war, the Russians and Turks agreed to discussions at Berlin.

In advance of the meeting, confidential negotiations took place between Britain and Russia in April and May 1878. The Russians were willing to make changes to the big Bulgaria, but were determined to retain their new possessions, <a href="Bessarabia">Bessarabia</a> in Europe and <a href="Batum">Batum</a> and <a href="Kars">Kars</a> on the east coast of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>. To counterbalance this, Britain required a possession in the Eastern Mediterranean where it might base ships and troops, and negotiated with the Ottomans for the cession of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>. Once this was secretly agreed, Disraeli was prepared to allow Russia's territorial gains.
The <a href="Congress%20of%20Berlin">Congress of Berlin</a> was held in June and July 1878, the central relationship in it that between Disraeli and Bismarck. In later years, the German chancellor would show visitors to his office three pictures on the wall: "the portrait of my Sovereign, there on the right that of my wife, and on the left, there, that of Lord Beaconsfield". Disraeli caused an uproar in the congress by making his opening address in English, rather than in French, hitherto accepted as the international language of diplomacy. By one account, the British ambassador in Berlin, <a href="Odo%20Russell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Ampthill">Lord Odo Russell</a>, hoping to spare the delegates Disraeli's awful French accent, told Disraeli that the congress was hoping to hear a speech in the English tongue by one of its masters.

Disraeli left much of the detailed work to Salisbury, concentrating his efforts on making it as difficult as possible for the broken-up big Bulgaria to reunite. Disraeli did not have things all his own way: he intended that Batum be demilitarised, but the Russians obtained their preferred language, and in 1886, fortified the town. Nevertheless, the <a href="Cyprus%20Convention">Cyprus Convention</a> ceding the island to Britain was announced during the congress, and again made Disraeli a sensation.

Disraeli gained agreement that Turkey should retain enough of its European possessions to safeguard the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a>. By one account, when met with Russian intransigence, Disraeli told his secretary to order a special train to return them home to begin the war. Although Russia yielded, Czar Alexander II later described the congress as "a European coalition against Russia, under Bismarck".

The <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berlin%20%281878%29">Treaty of Berlin</a> was signed on 13 July 1878 at the <a href="Reich%20Chancellery">Radziwill Palace</a> in Berlin. Disraeli and Salisbury returned home to heroes' receptions at Dover and in London. At the door of <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a>, Disraeli received flowers sent by the Queen. There, he told the gathered crowd, "Lord Salisbury and I have brought you back peace—but a peace I hope with honour." The Queen offered him a dukedom, which he declined, though accepting <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">the Garter</a>, as long as Salisbury also received it. In Berlin, word spread of Bismarck's admiring description of Disraeli, ""Der alte Jude, das ist der Mann!" "

In the weeks after Berlin, Disraeli and the cabinet considered calling a general election to capitalise on the public applause he and Salisbury had received. Parliaments were then for a seven-year term, and it was the custom not to go to the country until the sixth year unless forced to by events. Only four and a half years had passed since the last general election. Additionally, they did not see any clouds on the horizon that might forecast Conservative defeat if they waited. This decision not to seek re-election has often been cited as a great mistake by Disraeli. Blake, however, pointed out that results in local elections had been moving against the Conservatives, and doubted if Disraeli missed any great opportunity by waiting.

As successful invasions of India generally came through Afghanistan, the British had observed and sometimes intervened there since the 1830s, hoping to keep the Russians out. In 1878 the Russians sent a mission to Kabul; it was not rejected by the Afghans, as the British had hoped. The British then proposed to send their own mission, insisting that the Russians be sent away. The <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy</a>, <a href="Robert%20Bulwer-Lytton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Lytton">Lord Lytton</a>, concealed his plans to issue this ultimatum from Disraeli, and when the Prime Minister insisted he take no action, went ahead anyway. When the Afghans made no answer, the British advanced against them in the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Afghan%20War">Second Anglo-Afghan War</a>, and under <a href="Frederick%20Roberts%2C%201st%20Earl%20Roberts">Lord Roberts</a> easily defeated them. The British installed a new ruler, and left a mission and garrison in Kabul.

British policy in South Africa was to encourage federation between the British-run <a href="Cape%20Colony">Cape Colony</a> and <a href="Colony%20of%20Natal">Natal</a>, and the <a href="Boer">Boer</a> republics, the <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal</a> (annexed by Britain in 1877) and the <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a>. The governor of Cape Colony, <a href="Bartle%20Frere">Sir Bartle Frere</a>, believing that the federation could not be accomplished until the native tribes acknowledged British rule, made demands on the <a href="Zulu%20people">Zulu</a> and their king, <a href="Cetewayo">Cetewayo</a>, which they were certain to reject. As Zulu troops could not marry until they had washed their spears in blood, they were eager for combat. Frere did not send word to the cabinet of what he had done until the ultimatum was about to expire. Disraeli and the cabinet reluctantly backed him, and in early January 1879 resolved to send reinforcements. Before they could arrive, on 22 January, a Zulu "<a href="impi">impi</a>", or army, moving with great speed and stealth, ambushed and destroyed a British encampment in South Africa in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Isandlwana">Battle of Isandlwana</a>. Over a thousand British and colonial troops were killed. Word of the defeat did not reach London until 12 February. Disraeli wrote the next day, "the terrible disaster has shaken me to the centre". He reprimanded Frere, but left him in charge, attracting fire from all sides. Disraeli sent General <a href="Garnet%20Wolseley%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Wolseley">Sir Garnet Wolseley</a> as High Commissioner and Commander in Chief, and Cetewayo and the Zulus were crushed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ulundi">Battle of Ulundi</a> on 4 July 1879.

On 8 September 1879 <a href="Pierre%20Louis%20Napoleon%20Cavagnari">Sir Louis Cavagnari</a>, in charge of the mission in Kabul, was killed with his entire staff by rebelling Afghan soldiers. Roberts undertook a successful punitive expedition against the Afghans over the next six weeks.

Gladstone, in the 1874 election, had been returned for <a href="Greenwich%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Greenwich</a>, finishing second behind a Conservative in the two-member constituency, a result he termed more like a defeat than a victory. In December 1878, he was offered the Liberal nomination at the next election for <a href="Edinburghshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Edinburghshire</a>, a constituency popularly known as Midlothian. The small Scottish electorate was dominated by two noblemen, the Conservative <a href="Walter%20Montagu%20Douglas%20Scott%2C%205th%20Duke%20of%20Buccleuch">Duke of Buccleuch</a> and the Liberal <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Earl of Rosebery</a>. The Earl, a friend of both Disraeli and Gladstone who would succeed the latter after his final term as Prime Minister, had journeyed to the United States to view politics there, and was convinced that aspects of American electioneering could be translated to the United Kingdom. On his advice, Gladstone accepted the offer in January 1879, and later that year began his <a href="Midlothian%20campaign">Midlothian campaign</a>, speaking not only in Edinburgh, but across Britain, attacking Disraeli, to huge crowds.

Conservative chances of re-election were damaged by the poor weather, and consequent effects on agriculture. Four consecutive wet summers through 1879 had led to poor harvests in the United Kingdom. In the past, the farmer had the consolation of higher prices at such times, but with bumper crops cheaply transported from the United States, grain prices remained low. Other European nations, faced with similar circumstances, opted for protection, and Disraeli was urged to reinstitute the Corn Laws. He declined, stating that he regarded the matter as settled. Protection would have been highly unpopular among the newly enfranchised urban working classes, as it would raise their cost of living. Amid an economic slump generally, the Conservatives lost support among farmers.

Disraeli's health continued to fail through 1879. Owing to his infirmities, Disraeli was three-quarters of an hour late for the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London%23Role">Lord Mayor's Dinner</a> at the <a href="Guildhall%2C%20London">Guildhall</a> in November, at which it is customary that the Prime Minister speaks. Though many commented on how healthy he looked, it took him great effort to appear so, and when he told the audience he expected to speak to the dinner again the following year, attendees chuckled—Gladstone was then in the midst of his campaign. Despite his public confidence, Disraeli recognised that the Conservatives would probably lose the next election, and was already contemplating his <a href="Prime%20Minister%27s%20Resignation%20Honours">Resignation Honours</a>.

Despite this pessimism, Conservatives hopes were buoyed in early 1880 with successes in by-elections the Liberals had expected to win, concluding with victory in <a href="Southwark%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Southwark</a>, normally a Liberal stronghold. The cabinet had resolved to wait before dissolving Parliament; in early March they reconsidered, agreeing to go to the country as soon as possible. Parliament was dissolved on 24 March; the first borough constituencies began voting a week later.

Disraeli took no public part in the electioneering, it being deemed improper for peers to make speeches to influence Commons elections. This meant that the chief Conservatives—Disraeli, Salisbury, and India Secretary <a href="Gathorne%20Gathorne-Hardy%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Cranbrook">Lord Cranbrook</a>—would not be heard from. The election was thought likely to be close. Once returns began to be announced, it became clear that the Conservatives were being decisively beaten. The final result gave the Liberals an absolute majority of about 50.

Disraeli refused to cast blame for the defeat, which he understood was likely to be final for him. He wrote to Lady Bradford that it was just as much work to end a government as to form one, without any of the fun. Queen Victoria was bitter at his departure as Prime Minister. Among the honours he arranged before resigning as Prime Minister on 21 April 1880 was one for his private secretary, <a href="Montagu%20Corry%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rowton">Montagu Corry</a>, who became Baron Rowton.
Returning to Hughenden, Disraeli brooded over his electoral dismissal, but also resumed work on "<a href="Endymion%20%28Disraeli%20novel%29">Endymion</a>", which he had begun in 1872 and laid aside before the 1874 election. The work was rapidly completed and published by November 1880. He carried on a correspondence with Victoria, with letters passed through intermediaries. When Parliament met in January 1881, he served as Conservative leader in the Lords, attempting to serve as a moderating influence on Gladstone's legislation.

Suffering from asthma and gout, Disraeli went out as little as possible, fearing more serious episodes of illness. In March, he fell ill with bronchitis, and emerged from bed only for a meeting with Salisbury and other Conservative leaders on the 26th. As it became clear that this might be his final sickness, friends and opponents alike came to call. Disraeli declined a visit from the Queen, saying, "She would only ask me to take a message to Albert." Almost blind, when he received the last letter from Victoria of which he was aware on 5 April, he held it momentarily, then had it read to him by <a href="George%20Barrington%2C%207th%20Viscount%20Barrington">Lord Barrington</a>, a <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Councillor</a>. One card, signed "A Workman", delighted its recipient, "Don't die yet, we can't do without you."

Despite the gravity of Disraeli's condition, the doctors concocted optimistic bulletins, for public consumption. The Prime Minister, Gladstone, called several times to enquire about his rival's condition, and wrote in his diary, "May the Almighty be near his pillow." There was intense public interest in the former Prime Minister's struggles for life. Disraeli had customarily taken the <a href="Anglican%20sacraments">sacrament</a> at Easter; when this day was observed on 17 April, there was discussion among his friends and family if he should be given the opportunity, but those against, fearing that he would lose hope, prevailed. On the morning of the following day, Easter Monday, he became incoherent, then comatose. Disraeli's last confirmed words before dying at his home on 19 <a href="Curzon%20Street">Curzon Street</a> in the early morning of 19 April were "I had rather live but I am not afraid to die". The anniversary of Disraeli's death is now commemorated in the United Kingdom as <a href="Primrose%20Day">Primrose Day</a>.

Disraeli's executors decided against a public procession and funeral, fearing that too large crowds would gather to do him honour. The chief mourners at the service at Hughenden on 26 April were his brother Ralph and nephew Coningsby, to whom Hughenden would eventually pass. Queen Victoria was prostrated with grief, and considered ennobling Ralph or Coningsby as a memorial to Disraeli (without children, his titles became extinct with his death) but decided against it on the ground that their means were too small for a peerage. Protocol forbade her attending Disraeli's funeral (this would not be changed until 1965, when <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> attended the rites for the former Prime Minister <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Sir Winston Churchill</a>) but she sent <a href="Primrose%20Day">primroses</a> ("his favourite flowers") to the funeral, and visited the burial vault to place a wreath of china blooms four days later.

Disraeli is buried with his wife in a vault beneath the <a href="St%20Michael%20and%20All%20Angels%20Church%2C%20Hughenden">Church of St Michael and All Angels</a> which stands in the grounds of his home, Hughenden Manor, accessed from the churchyard. There is also a memorial to him in the chancel in the church, erected in his honour by Queen Victoria. His <a href="literary%20executor">literary executor</a> was his private secretary, Lord Rowton. The Disraeli vault also contains the body of <a href="Sarah%20Brydges%20Willyams">Sarah Brydges Willyams</a>, the wife of James Brydges Willyams of <a href="St%20Mawgan">St Mawgan</a> in Cornwall. Disraeli carried on a long correspondence with Mrs. Willyams, writing frankly about political affairs. At her death in 1865, she left him a large legacy, which helped clear up his debts. His will was proved at £84,000.

Disraeli has a memorial in <a href="Burials%20and%20memorials%20in%20Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. This monument was erected by the nation on the motion of Gladstone in his memorial speech on Disraeli in the House of Commons. Gladstone had absented himself from the funeral, with his plea of the press of public business met with public mockery. His speech was widely anticipated, if only because his dislike for Disraeli was well known, and caused the Prime Minister much worry. In the event, the speech was a model of its kind, in which he avoided comment on Disraeli's politics, while praising his personal qualities.

Disraeli's literary and political career interacted over his lifetime and fascinated Victorian Britain, making him "one of the most eminent figures in Victorian public life", and occasioned a large output of commentary. Critic <a href="Shane%20Leslie">Shane Leslie</a> noted three decades after his death that "Disraeli's career was a romance such as no Eastern vizier or Western plutocrat could tell. He began as a pioneer in dress and an aesthete of words... Disraeli actually made his novels come true."

Blake comments that Disraeli "produced an epic poem, unbelievably bad, and a five-act blank verse tragedy, if possible worse. Further he wrote a discourse on political theory and a political biography, the "Life of Lord George Bentinck", which is excellent ... remarkably fair and accurate." But it is on his novels that Disraeli's literary achievements are generally judged. They have from the outset divided critical opinion. The writer R. W. Stewart observed that there have always been two criteria for judging Disraeli's novels—one political and the other artistic. The critic Robert O'Kell, concurring, writes, "It is after all, even if you are a Tory of the staunchest blue, impossible to make Disraeli into a first-rate novelist. And it is equally impossible, no matter how much you deplore the extravagances and improprieties of his works, to make him into an insignificant one."

Disraeli's early "silver fork" novels "Vivian Grey" (1826) and "<a href="The%20Young%20Duke%20%28Disraeli%20novel%29">The Young Duke</a>" (1831) featured romanticised depictions of aristocratic life (despite his ignorance of it) with character sketches of well-known public figures lightly disguised. In some of his early fiction Disraeli also portrayed himself and what he felt to be his Byronic dual nature: the poet and the man of action. His most autobiographical novel was "Contarini Fleming" (1832), an avowedly serious work that did not sell well. The critic William Kuhn suggests that Disraeli's fiction can be read as "the memoirs he never wrote", revealing the inner life of a politician for whom the norms of Victorian public life appeared to represent a social straitjacket—particularly with regard to what Kuhn sees as the author's "ambiguous sexuality".

Of the other novels of the early 1830s, "Alroy" is described by Blake as "profitable but unreadable", and "The Rise of Iskander" (1833), "The Infernal Marriage" and "Ixion in Heaven" (1834) made little impact. "Henrietta Temple" (1837) was Disraeli's next major success. It draws on the events of his affair with Henrietta Sykes to tell the story of a debt-ridden young man torn between a mercenary loveless marriage and a passionate love-at-first-sight for the eponymous heroine. "Venetia" (1837) was a minor work, written to raise much-needed cash.

In the 1840s Disraeli wrote a trilogy of novels with political themes. With "Coningsby; or, The New Generation" (1844), Disraeli, in Blake's view, "infused the novel genre with political sensibility, espousing the belief that England's future as a world power depended not on the complacent old guard, but on youthful, idealistic politicians." "Coningsby" was followed by "Sybil; or, The Two Nations" (1845), another <a href="political%20fiction">political novel</a>, which was less idealistic and more clear-eyed than "Coningsby"; the "two nations" of its sub-title referred to the huge economic and social gap between the privileged few and the deprived working classes. The last in Disraeli's political novel trilogy was "Tancred; or, The New Crusade" (1847), promoting the Church of England's role in reviving Britain's flagging spirituality.

Disraeli's last completed novels were "Lothair" (1870) and "Endymion" (1880). The first, described by <a href="Daniel%20R.%20Schwarz">Daniel R Schwarz</a> as "Disraeli's ideological "<a href="The%20Pilgrim%27s%20Progress">Pilgrim's Progress</a>"", is a story of political life with particular regard to the roles of the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. "Endymion", despite having a Whig as hero, is a last exposition of the author's economic policies and political beliefs. Disraeli continued to the last to pillory his enemies in barely disguised caricatures: the character St Barbe in "Endymion" is widely seen as a parody of <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">Thackeray</a>, who had offended Disraeli more than thirty years earlier by lampooning him in "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" as "Codlingsby". Disraeli left an unfinished novel in which the priggish central character, Falconet, is unmistakably a caricature of Gladstone.

In the years after Disraeli's death, as Salisbury began his reign of more than twenty years over the Conservatives, the party emphasised the late leader's "<a href="One%20nation%20conservatism">One Nation</a>" views, that the Conservatives at root shared the beliefs of the working classes, with the Liberals the party of the urban élite. Disraeli had, for example, stressed the need to improve the lot of the urban labourer. The memory of Disraeli was used by the Conservatives to appeal to the working classes, with whom he was said to have had a rapport. This aspect of his policies has been re-evaluated by historians in the 20th and 21st centuries. In 1972 BHAbbott stressed that it was not Disraeli but <a href="Lord%20Randolph%20Churchill">Lord Randolph Churchill</a> who invented the term "Tory democracy", though it was Disraeli who made it an essential part of Conservative policy and philosophy. In 2007 Parry wrote, "The tory democrat myth did not survive detailed scrutiny by professional historical writing of the 1960s [which] demonstrated that Disraeli had very little interest in a programme of social legislation and was very flexible in handling parliamentary reform in 1867." Despite this, Parry sees Disraeli, rather than Peel, as the founder of the modern Conservative party. The Conservative politician and writer <a href="Douglas%20Hurd">Douglas Hurd</a> wrote in 2013, "[Disraeli] was not a one-nation Conservative—and this was not simply because he never used the phrase. He rejected the concept in its entirety."

Disraeli's enthusiastic propagation of the British Empire has also been seen as appealing to working class voters. Before his leadership of the Conservative Party, imperialism was the province of the Liberals, most notably Palmerston, with the Conservatives murmuring dissent across the aisle. Disraeli made the Conservatives the party that most loudly supported both the Empire and military action to assert its primacy. This came about in part because Disraeli's own views stemmed that way, in part because he saw advantage for the Conservatives, and partially in reaction against Gladstone, who disliked the expense of empire. Blake argued that Disraeli's imperialism "decisively orientated the Conservative party for many years to come, and the tradition which he started was probably a bigger electoral asset in winning working-class support during the last quarter of the century than anything else". Some historians have commented on a romantic impulse behind Disraeli's approach to Empire and foreign affairs: Abbott writes, "To the mystical Tory concepts of Throne, Church, Aristocracy and People, Disraeli added Empire." Others have identified a strongly pragmatic aspect to his policies. Gladstone's biographer <a href="Philip%20Magnus-Allcroft">Philip Magnus</a> contrasted Disraeli's grasp of foreign affairs with that of Gladstone, who "never understood that high moral principles, in their application to foreign policy, are more often destructive of political stability than motives of national self-interest." In Parry's view, Disraeli's foreign policy "can be seen as a gigantic castle in the air (as it was by Gladstone), or as an overdue attempt to force the British commercial classes to awaken to the realities of European politics."

During his lifetime Disraeli's opponents, and sometimes even his friends and allies, questioned whether he sincerely held the views he propounded, or whether they were adopted by him as essential to one who sought to spend his life in politics, and were mouthed by him without conviction. Lord John Manners, in 1843 at the time of Young England, wrote, "could I only satisfy myself that D'Israeli believed all that he said, I should be more happy: his historical views are quite mine, but does he believe them?" Blake (writing in 1966) suggested that it is no more possible to answer that question now than it was then. Nevertheless, <a href="Paul%20Smith%20%28historian%29">Paul Smith</a>, in his journal article on Disraeli's politics, argues that Disraeli's ideas were coherently argued over a political career of nearly half a century, and "it is impossible to sweep them aside as a mere bag of burglar's tools for effecting felonious entry to the British political pantheon."
<a href="Stanley%20Weintraub">Stanley Weintraub</a>, in his biography of Disraeli, points out that his subject did much to advance Britain towards the 20th century, carrying one of the two great Reform Acts of the 19th despite the opposition of his Liberal rival, Gladstone. "He helped preserve constitutional monarchy by drawing the Queen out of mourning into a new symbolic national role and created the climate for what became '<a href="One-nation%20conservatism">Tory democracy</a>'. He articulated an imperial role for Britain that would last into World War II and brought an intermittently self-isolated Britain into the concert of Europe."

Frances Walsh comments on Disraeli's multifaceted public life:
The debate about his place in the Conservative pantheon has continued since his death. Disraeli fascinated and divided contemporary opinion; he was seen by many, including some members of his own party, as an adventurer and a charlatan and by others as a far-sighted and patriotic statesman. As an actor on the political stage he played many roles: Byronic hero, man of letters, social critic, parliamentary virtuoso, squire of Hughenden, royal companion, European statesman. His singular and complex personality has provided historians and biographers with a particularly stiff challenge.

Historical writers have often played Disraeli and Gladstone against each other as great rivals. Roland Quinault, however, cautions us not to exaggerate the confrontation:they were not direct antagonists for most of their political careers. Indeed initially they were both loyal to the Tory party, the Church and the landed interest. Although their paths diverged over the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 and later over fiscal policy more generally, it was not until the later 1860s that their differences over parliamentary reform, Irish and Church policy assumed great partisan significance. Even then their personal relations remained fairly cordial until their dispute over the Eastern Question in the later 1870s.

Historian Michael Diamond reports that for British music hall patrons in the 1880s and 1890s, "xenophobia and pride in empire" were reflected in the halls' most popular political heroes: all were Conservatives and Disraeli stood out above all, even decades after his death, while Gladstone was used as a villain. Film historian Roy Armes has argued that historical films helped maintain the political status quo in Britain in the 1920s and 1930s by imposing an establishment viewpoint that emphasized the greatness of monarchy, empire, and tradition. The films created "a facsimile world where existing values were invariably validated by events in the film and where all discord could be turned into harmony by an acceptance of the status quo." Steven Fielding has argued that Disraeli was an especially popular film hero: "historical dramas favoured Disraeli over Gladstone and, more substantively, promulgated an essentially deferential view of democratic leadership." Stage and screen actor <a href="George%20Arliss">George Arliss</a> was known for his portrayals of Disraeli, winning the Oscar as best actor for 1929's "<a href="Disraeli%20%281929%20film%29">Disraeli</a>". Fielding says Arliss "personified the kind of paternalistic, kindly, homely statesmanship that appealed to a significant proportion of the cinema audience...Even workers attending Labour party meetings deferred to leaders with an elevated social background who showed they cared.".

Battle of Ramillies

The Battle of Ramillies (), fought on 23 May 1706, was a battle of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. For the <a href="Grand%20Alliance%20%28League%20of%20Augsburg%29">Grand Alliance</a> – Austria, England, and the Dutch Republic – the battle had followed an indecisive campaign against the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a> armies of King <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV of France</a> in 1705. Although the Allies had <a href="Siege%20of%20Barcelona%20%281705%29">captured Barcelona</a> that year, they had been forced to abandon their campaign on the <a href="Moselle%20River">Moselle</a>, had stalled in the <a href="Spanish%20Netherlands">Spanish Netherlands</a> and suffered defeat in northern Italy. Yet despite his opponents' setbacks Louis XIV wanted peace, but on reasonable terms. Because of this, as well as to maintain their momentum, the French and their allies took the offensive in 1706.

The campaign began well for Louis XIV's generals: in Italy Marshal <a href="Louis%20Joseph%2C%20Duke%20of%20Vend%C3%B4me">Vendôme</a> defeated the Austrians at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Calcinato">Battle of Calcinato</a> in April, while in <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> Marshal <a href="Claude%20Louis%20Hector%20de%20Villars">Villars</a> forced the <a href="Louis%20William%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Baden-Baden">Margrave of Baden</a> back across the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a>. Encouraged by these early gains Louis XIV urged Marshal <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Neufville%2C%20duc%20de%20Villeroi">Villeroi</a> to go over to the offensive in the Spanish Netherlands and, with victory, gain a 'fair' peace. Accordingly, the French Marshal set off from <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> ("Louvain") at the head of 60,000 men and marched towards <a href="Tienen">Tienen</a> ("Tirlemont"), as if to threaten <a href="Zoutleeuw">Zoutleeuw</a> ("Léau"). Also determined to fight a major engagement, the <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a>, commander-in-chief of Anglo-Dutch forces, assembled his army – some 62,000 men – near <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>, and marched past Zoutleeuw. With both sides seeking battle, they soon encountered each other on the dry ground between the <a href="Mehaigne">Mehaigne</a> and Petite Gheete rivers, close to the small village of <a href="Ramillies%2C%20Belgium">Ramillies</a>.

In less than four hours Marlborough's <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">English</a>, and <a href="Denmark-Norway">Danish</a> forces overwhelmed Villeroi's and <a href="Maximilian%20II%20Emanuel%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Max Emanuel</a>'s Franco-Spanish-Bavarian army. The Duke's subtle moves and changes in emphasis during the battle – something his opponents failed to realise until it was too late – caught the French in a tactical vice. With their foe broken and routed, the Allies were able to fully exploit their victory. Town after town fell, including <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a> and <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>; by the end of the campaign Villeroi's army had been driven from most of the Spanish Netherlands. With Prince <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Eugene</a>'s subsequent success at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Turin">Battle of Turin</a> in northern Italy, the Allies had imposed the greatest loss of territory and resources that Louis XIV would suffer during the war. Thus, the year 1706 proved, for the Allies, to be an "<a href="annus%20mirabilis">annus mirabilis</a>".

After their disastrous defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Blenheim">Blenheim</a> in 1704, the next year brought the French some respite. The <a href="John%20Churchill%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Marlborough">Duke of Marlborough</a> had intended the 1705 campaign – an invasion of France through the <a href="Moselle%20River">Moselle</a> valley – to complete the work of Blenheim and persuade King <a href="Louis%20XIV%20of%20France">Louis XIV</a> to make peace but the plan had been thwarted by friend and foe alike. The reluctance of his Dutch allies to see their frontiers denuded of troops for another gamble in Germany had denied Marlborough the initiative but of far greater importance was the <a href="Louis%20William%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Baden-Baden">Margrave of Baden</a>’s pronouncement that he could not join the Duke in strength for the coming offensive. This was in part due to the sudden switching of troops from the Rhine to reinforce <a href="Prince%20Eugene%20of%20Savoy">Prince Eugene</a> in Italy and part due to the deterioration of Baden’s health brought on by the re-opening of a severe foot wound he had received at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Schellenberg">storming of the Schellenberg</a> the previous year. Marlborough had to cope with the death of <a href="Leopold%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Leopold I</a> in May and the accession of <a href="Joseph%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Joseph I</a>, which unavoidably complicated matters for the Grand Alliance.

The resilience of the French King and the efforts of his generals, also added to Marlborough’s problems. Marshal <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Neufville%2C%20duc%20de%20Villeroi">Villeroi</a>, exerting considerable pressure on the Dutch commander, Count <a href="Henry%20de%20Nassau%2C%20Lord%20Overkirk">Overkirk</a>, along the <a href="Meuse%20River">Meuse</a>, took <a href="Huy">Huy</a> on 10 June before pressing on towards <a href="Li%C3%A8ge%20%28city%29">Liège</a>. With Marshal Villars sitting strong on the <a href="Moselle">Moselle</a>, the Allied commander – whose supplies had by now become very short – was forced to call off his campaign on 16 June. "What a disgrace for Marlborough," exulted Villeroi, "to have made false movements without any result!" With Marlborough's departure north, the French transferred troops from the Moselle valley to reinforce Villeroi in Flanders, while Villars marched off to the Rhine.

The Anglo-Dutch forces gained minor compensation for the failed Moselle campaign with the success at <a href="Battle%20of%20Elixheim">Elixheim</a> and the crossing of the <a href="Lines%20of%20Brabant">Lines of Brabant</a> in the Spanish Netherlands (Huy was also retaken on 11 July) but a chance to bring the French to a decisive engagement eluded Marlborough. The year 1705 proved almost entirely barren for the Duke, whose military disappointments were only partly compensated by efforts on the diplomatic front where, at the courts of <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>, <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> and <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>, Marlborough sought to bolster support for the Grand Alliance and extract promises of prompt assistance for the following year's campaign.

On 11 January 1706, Marlborough finally reached <a href="London">London</a> at the end of his diplomatic tour but he had already been planning his strategy for the coming season. The first option (although it is debatable to what extent the Duke was committed to such an enterprise) was a plan to transfer his forces from the Spanish Netherlands to northern Italy; once there, he intended linking up with Prince Eugene in order to defeat the French and safeguard <a href="Duchy%20of%20Savoy">Savoy</a> from being overrun. Savoy would then serve as a gateway into France by way of the mountain passes or an invasion with naval support along the Mediterranean coast via <a href="Nice">Nice</a> and <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a>, in connexion with redoubled Allied efforts in Spain. It seems that the Duke's favoured scheme was to return to the Moselle valley (where Marshal <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Marsin">Marsin</a> had recently taken command of French forces) and once more attempt an advance into the heart of France. But these decisions soon became academic. Shortly after Marlborough landed in the Dutch Republic on 14 April, news arrived of big Allied setbacks in the wider war.

Determined to show the Grand Alliance that France was still resolute, Louis XIV prepared to launch a double surprise in <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> and northern Italy. On the latter front Marshal <a href="Louis%20Joseph%20de%20Bourbon%2C%20duc%20de%20Vend%C3%B4me">Vendôme</a> defeated the Imperial army at <a href="Battle%20of%20Calcinato">Calcinato</a> on 19 April, pushing the Imperialists back in confusion (French forces were now in a position to prepare for the long-anticipated siege of <a href="Turin">Turin</a>). In Alsace, Marshal Villars took Baden by surprise and captured <a href="Haguenau">Haguenau</a>, driving him back across the Rhine in some disorder, thus creating a threat on <a href="Landau">Landau</a>. With these reverses, the Dutch refused to contemplate Marlborough's ambitious march to Italy or any plan that denuded their borders of the Duke and their army. In the interest of coalition harmony, Marlborough prepared to campaign in the Low Countries.

The Duke left <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> on 9 May. "God knows I go with a heavy heart," he wrote six days later to his friend and political ally in England, Lord <a href="Sidney%20Godolphin%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Godolphin">Godolphin</a>, "for I have no hope of doing anything considerable, unless the French do what I am very confident they will not … " – in other words, court battle. On 17 May the Duke concentrated his Dutch and English troops at <a href="Tongeren">Tongeren</a>, near <a href="Maastricht">Maastricht</a>. The Hanoverians, Hessians and Danes, despite earlier undertakings, found, or invented, pressing reasons for withholding their support. Marlborough wrote an appeal to the <a href="Carl%20Rudolf%2C%20Duke%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg-Neuenstadt">Duke of Württemberg</a>, the commander of the Danish contingent – "I send you this express to request your Highness to bring forward by a double march your cavalry so as to join us at the earliest moment …" Additionally, the King "in" Prussia, <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick I</a>, had kept his troops in quarters behind the Rhine while his personal disputes with Vienna and the <a href="States%20General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">States General</a> at The Hague remained unresolved. Nevertheless, the Duke could think of no circumstances why the French would leave their strong positions and attack his army, even if Villeroi was first reinforced by substantial transfers from Marsin's command. But in this he had miscalculated. Although Louis XIV wanted peace he wanted it on reasonable terms; for that, he needed victory in the field and to convince the Allies that his resources were by no means exhausted.

Following the successes in Italy and along the Rhine, Louis XIV was now hopeful of similar results in Flanders. Far from standing on the defensive therefore – and unbeknown to Marlborough – Louis XIV was persistently goading his marshal into action. "[Villeroi] began to imagine," wrote <a href="Louis%20de%20Rouvroy%2C%20duc%20de%20Saint-Simon">St Simon</a>, "that the King doubted his courage, and resolved to stake all at once in an effort to vindicate himself." Accordingly, on 18 May, Villeroi set off from <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> at the head of 70 <a href="battalion">battalion</a>s, 132 <a href="Squadron%20%28cavalry%29">squadron</a>s and 62 <a href="cannon">cannon</a> – comprising an overall force of some 60,000 troops – and crossed the river <a href="Dijle">Dyle</a> to seek battle with the enemy. Spurred on by his growing confidence in his ability to out-general his opponent, and by <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a>’ determination to avenge Blenheim, Villeroi and his generals anticipated success.

Neither opponent expected the clash at the exact moment or place where it occurred. The French moved first to <a href="Tienen">Tienen</a>, (as if to threaten <a href="Zoutleeuw">Zoutleeuw</a>, abandoned by the French in October 1705), before turning southwards, heading for <a href="Jodoigne">Jodoigne</a> – this line of march took Villeroi’s army towards the narrow aperture of dry ground between the <a href="Mehaigne">Mehaigne</a> and Petite Gheete rivers close to the small villages of Ramillies and Taviers; but neither commander quite appreciated how far his opponent had travelled. Villeroi still believed (on 22 May) the Allies were a full day’s march away when in fact they had camped near Corswaren waiting for the Danish squadrons to catch up; for his part, Marlborough deemed Villeroi still at Jodoigne when in reality he was now approaching the plateau of Mont St. André with the intention of pitching camp near Ramillies (see map at right). However, the Prussian infantry was not there. Marlborough wrote to <a href="Thomas%20Wentworth%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Strafford%20%281672%E2%80%931739%29">Lord Raby</a>, the English resident at Berlin: "If it should please God to give us victory over the enemy, the Allies will be little obliged to the King [Frederick] for the success."

The following day, at 01:00, Marlborough dispatched <a href="William%20Cadogan%2C%201st%20Earl%20Cadogan">Cadogan</a>, his Quartermaster-General, with an advanced guard to reconnoitre the same dry ground that Villeroi's army was now heading toward, country that was well known to the Duke from previous campaigns. Two hours later the Duke followed with the main body: 74 battalions, 123 squadrons, 90 pieces of artillery and 20 mortars, totalling 62,000 troops. At about 08:00, after Cadogan had just passed Merdorp, his force made brief contact with a party of French <a href="hussar">hussar</a>s gathering forage on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. After a brief exchange of shots the French retired and Cadogan's dragoons pressed forward. With a short lift in the mist, Cadogan soon discovered the smartly ordered lines of Villeroi's advance guard some off; a galloper hastened back to warn Marlborough. Two hours later the Duke, accompanied by the Dutch field commander Field Marshal <a href="Henry%20de%20Nassau%2C%20Lord%20Overkirk">Overkirk</a>, General Daniel Dopff, and the Allied staff, rode up to Cadogan where on the horizon to the westward he could discern the massed ranks of the French army deploying for battle along the front. Marlborough later told Bishop Burnet that, ‘the French army looked the best of any he had ever seen’.

The battlefield of Ramillies is very similar to that of Blenheim, for here too there is an immense area of arable land unimpeded by woods or hedges. Villeroi's right rested on the villages of Franquenée and Taviers, with the river Mehaigne protecting his flank. A large open plain, about wide, lay between Taviers and Ramillies, but unlike Blenheim, there was no stream to hinder the cavalry. His centre was secured by Ramillies itself, lying on a slight eminence which gave distant views to the north and east. The French left flank was protected by broken country, and by a stream, the Petite Gheete, which runs deep between steep and slippery slopes. On the French side of the stream the ground rises to Offus, the village which, together with Autre-Eglise farther north, anchored Villeroi's left flank. To the west of the Petite Gheete rises the plateau of Mont St. André; a second plain, the plateau of Jandrenouille – upon which the Anglo-Dutch army amassed – rises to the east.

At 11:00, the Duke ordered the army to take standard battle formation. On the far right, towards Foulz, the British battalions and squadrons took up their posts in a double line near the Jeuche stream. The centre was formed by the mass of Dutch, German, Protestant Swiss and Scottish infantry – perhaps 30,000 men – facing Offus and Ramillies. Also facing Ramillies Marlborough placed a powerful battery of thirty 24-pounders, dragged into position by a team of oxen; further batteries were positioned overlooking the Petite Gheete. On their left, on the broad plain between Taviers and Ramillies – and where Marlborough thought the decisive encounter must take place – Overkirk drew the 69 squadrons of the Dutch and Danish horse, supported by 19 battalions of Dutch infantry and two artillery pieces.

Meanwhile, Villeroi deployed his forces. In Taviers on his right, he placed two battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment, with a smaller force forward in Franquenée; the whole position was protected by the boggy ground of the Mehaigne river, thus preventing an Allied flanking movement. In the open country between Taviers and Ramillies, he placed 82 squadrons under General de Guiscard supported by several interleaved brigades of French, Swiss and Bavarian infantry. Along the Ramillies–Offus–Autre Eglise ridge-line, Villeroi positioned Walloon and Bavarian infantry, supported by the <a href="Maximilian%20II%20Emanuel%2C%20Elector%20of%20Bavaria">Elector of Bavaria's</a> 50 squadrons of Bavarian and Walloon cavalry placed behind on the plateau of Mont St. André. Ramillies, Offus and Autre-Eglise were all packed with troops and put in a state of defence, with alleys barricaded and walls loop-holed for <a href="muskets">muskets</a>. Villeroi also positioned powerful batteries near Ramillies. These guns (some of which were of the three barrelled kind first seen at Elixheim the previous year) enjoyed good arcs of fire, able to fully cover the approaches of the plateau of Jandrenouille over which the Allied infantry would have to pass.

Marlborough, however, noticed several important weaknesses in the French dispositions. Tactically, it was imperative for Villeroi to occupy Taviers on his right and Autre-Eglise on his left, but by adopting this posture he had been forced to over-extend his forces. Moreover, this disposition – concave in relation to the Allied army – gave Marlborough the opportunity to form a more compact line, drawn up in a shorter front between the ‘horns’ of the French crescent; when the Allied blow came it would be more concentrated and carry more weight. Additionally, the Duke's disposition facilitated the transfer of troops across his front far more easily than his foe, a tactical advantage that would grow in importance as the events of the afternoon unfolded. Although Villeroi had the option of enveloping the flanks of the Allied army as they deployed on the plateau of Jandrenouille – threatening to encircle their army – the Duke correctly gauged that the characteristically cautious French commander was intent on a defensive battle along the ridge-line.

At 13:00 the batteries went into action; a little later two Allied columns set out from the extremities of their line and attacked the flanks of the Franco-Bavarian army. To the south the <a href="Dutch%20Blue%20Guards">Dutch Guards</a>, under the command of Colonel Wertmüller, came forward with their two field guns to seize the hamlet of Franquenée. The small Swiss garrison in the village, shaken by the sudden onslaught and unsupported by the battalions to their rear, were soon compelled back towards the village of Taviers. Taviers was of particular importance to the Franco-Bavarian position: it protected the otherwise unsupported flank of General de Guiscard's cavalry on the open plain, while at the same time, it allowed the French infantry to pose a threat to the flanks of the Dutch and Danish squadrons as they came forward into position. But hardly had the retreating Swiss rejoined their comrades in that village when the Dutch Guards renewed their attack. The fighting amongst the alleys and cottages soon deteriorated into a fierce bayonet and clubbing "mêlée", but the superiority in Dutch firepower soon told. The accomplished French officer, Colonel de la Colonie, standing on the plain nearby remembered – "this village was the opening of the engagement, and the fighting there was almost as murderous as the rest of the battle put together." By about 15:00 the Swiss had been pushed out of the village into the marshes beyond.

Villeroi's right flank fell into chaos and was now open and vulnerable. Alerted to the situation de Guiscard ordered an immediate attack with 14 squadrons of French dragoons currently stationed in the rear. Two other battalions of the Greder Suisse Régiment were also sent, but the attack was poorly co-ordinated and consequently went in piecemeal. The Anglo-Dutch commanders now sent dismounted Dutch dragoons into Taviers, which, together with the Guards and their field guns, poured concentrated musketry- and canister-fire into the advancing French troops. Colonel d’Aubigni, leading his regiment, fell mortally wounded.

As the French ranks wavered, the leading squadrons of Württemberg's Danish horse – now unhampered by enemy fire from either village – were also sent into the attack and fell upon the exposed flank of the Franco-Swiss infantry and dragoons. De la Colonie, with his Grenadiers Rouge regiment, together with the Cologne Guards who were brigaded with them, was now ordered forward from his post south of Ramillies to support the faltering counter-attack on the village. But on his arrival, all was chaos – "Scarcely had my troops got over when the dragoons and Swiss who had preceded us, came tumbling down upon my battalions in full flight … My own fellows turned about and fled along with them." De La Colonie managed to rally some of his grenadiers, together with the remnants of the French dragoons and Greder Suisse battalions, but it was an entirely peripheral operation, offering only fragile support for Villeroi's right flank.

While the attack on Taviers went on the <a href="George%20Hamilton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Orkney">Earl of Orkney</a> launched his first line of English across the Petite Gheete in a determined attack against the barricaded villages of Offus and Autre-Eglise on the Allied right. Villeroi, posting himself near Offus, watched anxiously the redcoats' advance, mindful of the counsel he had received on 6 May from Louis XIV – "Have particular care to that part of the line which will endure the first shock of the English troops." Heeding this advice the French commander began to transfer battalions from his centre to reinforce the left, drawing more foot from the already weakened right to replace them.

As the English battalions descended the gentle slope of the Petite Gheete valley, struggling through the boggy stream, they were met by Major General de la Guiche's disciplined Walloon infantry sent forward from around Offus. After concentrated volleys, exacting heavy casualties on the redcoats, the Walloons reformed back to the ridgeline in good order. The English took some time to reform their ranks on the dry ground beyond the stream and press on up the slope towards the cottages and barricades on the ridge. The vigour of the English assault, however, was such that they threatened to break through the line of the villages and out onto the open plateau of Mont St André beyond. This was potentially dangerous for the Allied infantry who would then be at the mercy of the Elector's Bavarian and Walloon squadrons patiently waiting on the plateau for the order to move.

Although <a href="Henry%20Lumley">Henry Lumley</a>’s English cavalry had managed to cross the marshy ground around the Petite Gheete, it was soon evident to Marlborough that sufficient cavalry support would not be practicable and that the battle could not be won on the Allied right. The Duke, therefore, called off the attack against Offus and Autre-Eglise. To make sure that Orkney obeyed his order to withdraw, Marlborough sent his Quartermaster-General in person with the command. Despite Orkney's protestations, Cadogan insisted on compliance and, reluctantly, Orkney gave the word for his troops to fall back to their original positions on the edge of the plateau of Jandrenouille. It is still not clear how far Orkney's advance was planned only as a feint; according to historian David Chandler it is probably more accurate to surmise that Marlborough launched Orkney in a serious probe with a view to sounding out the possibilities of the sector. Nevertheless, the attack had served its purpose. Villeroi had given his personal attention to that wing and strengthened it with large bodies of horse and foot that ought to have been taking part in the decisive struggle south of Ramillies.

Meanwhile, the Dutch assault on Ramillies was gaining pace. Marlborough's younger brother, General of Infantry, <a href="Charles%20Churchill%20%28British%20Army%20general%29">Charles Churchill</a>, ordered four brigades of foot to attack the village. The assault consisted of 12 battalions of Dutch infantry commanded by Major Generals Schultz and Spaar; two brigades of Saxons under <a href="Johann%20Matthias%20von%20der%20Schulenburg">Count Schulenburg</a>; a Scottish brigade in Dutch service led by the <a href="John%20Campbell%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Argyll">2nd Duke of Argyle</a>; and a small brigade of Protestant Swiss. The 20 French and Bavarian battalions in Ramillies, supported by the Irish dragoons who had left Ireland in the <a href="Flight%20of%20the%20Wild%20Geese">Flight of the Wild Geese</a> to join <a href="Clare%27s%20Dragoons">Clare's Dragoons</a> and a small brigade of Cologne and Bavarian Guards under the <a href="Alessandro%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Maffei">Marquis de Maffei</a>, put up a determined defence, initially driving back the attackers with severe losses as commemorated in the song "Clare's Dragoons":
<poem>
When on Ramillies' bloody field
The baffled French were forced to yield,
The victor Saxon backward reeled
Before the charge of Clare's Dragoons.

"Viva là, the new brigade!"
"Viva là the old one too!"
"Viva là, the Rose shall fade"
"The Shamrock shine forever new!"
</poem>
Seeing that Schultz and Spaar were faltering, Marlborough now ordered Orkney's second-line British and Danish battalions (who had not been used in the assault on Offus and Autre-Eglise) to move south towards Ramillies. Shielded as they were from observation by a slight fold in the land, their commander, Brigadier-General Van Pallandt, ordered the regimental colours to be left in place on the edge of the plateau to convince their opponents they were still in their initial position. Therefore, unbeknown to the French who remained oblivious to the Allies’ real strength and intentions on the opposite side of the Petite Gheete, Marlborough was throwing his full weight against Ramillies and the open plain to the south. Villeroi meanwhile, was still moving more reserves of infantry in the opposite direction towards his left flank; crucially, it would be some time before the French commander noticed the subtle change in emphasis of the Allied dispositions.

At around 15:30, Overkirk advanced his massed squadrons on the open plain in support of the infantry attack on Ramillies. Overkirk's squadrons – 48 Dutch, supported on their left by 21 Danish – steadily advanced towards the enemy (taking care not to prematurely tire the horses), before breaking into a trot to gain the impetus for their charge. The <a href="Antoine%20de%20Pas%20de%20Feuqui%C3%A8res">Marquis de Feuquières</a> writing after the battle described the scene – "They advanced in four lines … As they approached they advanced their second and fourth lines into the intervals of their first and third lines; so that when they made their advance upon us, they formed only one front, without any intermediate spaces."

The initial clash favoured the Dutch and Danish squadrons. The disparity of numbers – exacerbated by Villeroi stripping their ranks of infantry to reinforce his left flank – enabled Overkirk's cavalry to throw the first line of French horse back in some disorder towards their second-line squadrons. This line also came under severe pressure and, in turn, was forced back to their third-line of cavalry and the few battalions still remaining on the plain. But these French horsemen were amongst the best in Louis XIV's army – the "<a href="Maison%20militaire%20du%20roi%20de%20France">Maison du Roi</a>", supported by four elite squadrons of Bavarian Cuirassiers. Ably led by de Guiscard, the French cavalry rallied, thrusting back the Allied squadrons in successful local counterattacks. On Overkirk's right flank, close to Ramillies, ten of his squadrons suddenly broke ranks and were scattered, riding headlong to the rear to recover their order, leaving the left flank of the Allied assault on Ramillies dangerously exposed. Notwithstanding the lack of infantry support, de Guiscard threw his cavalry forward in an attempt to split the Allied army in two.

A crisis threatened the centre, but from his vantage point Marlborough was at once aware of the situation. The Allied commander now summoned the cavalry on the right wing to reinforce his centre, leaving only the English squadrons in support of Orkney. Thanks to a combination of battle-smoke and favourable terrain, his redeployment went unnoticed by Villeroi who made no attempt to transfer any of his own 50 unused squadrons. While he waited for the fresh reinforcements to arrive, Marlborough flung himself into the "mêlée", rallying some of the Dutch cavalry who were in confusion. But his personal involvement nearly led to his undoing. A number of French horsemen, recognising the Duke, came surging towards his party. Marlborough's horse tumbled and the Duke was thrown – "Milord Marlborough was rid over," wrote Orkney some time later. It was a critical moment of the battle. "Major-General Murray," recalled one eyewitness, " … seeing him fall, marched up in all haste with two Swiss battalions to save him and stop the enemy who were hewing all down in their way." Fortunately Marlborough's newly appointed aide-de-camp, <a href="Richard%20Molesworth%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Molesworth">Richard Molesworth</a>, galloped to the rescue, mounted the Duke on his horse and made good their escape, before Murray's disciplined ranks threw back the pursuing French troopers.

After a brief pause, Marlborough's equerry, Colonel Bringfield (or Bingfield), led up another of the Duke's spare horses; but while assisting him onto his mount, the unfortunate Bringfield was hit by an errant cannonball that sheared off his head. One account has it that the cannonball flew between the Captain-General's legs before hitting the unfortunate colonel, whose torso fell at Marlborough's feet – a moment subsequently depicted in a lurid set of contemporary playing cards. Nevertheless, the danger passed, enabling the Duke to attend to the positioning of the cavalry reinforcements feeding down from his right flank – a change of which Villeroi remained blissfully unaware.

The time was about 16:30, and the two armies were in close contact across the whole front, from the skirmishing in the marshes in the south, through the vast cavalry battle on the open plain; to the fierce struggle for Ramillies at the centre, and to the north, where, around the cottages of Offus and Autre-Eglise, Orkney and de la Guiche faced each other across the Petite Gheete ready to renew hostilities.

The arrival of the transferring squadrons now began to tip the balance in favour of the Allies. Tired, and suffering a growing list of casualties, the numerical inferiority of Guiscard's squadrons battling on the plain at last began to tell. After earlier failing to hold or retake Franquenée and Taviers, Guiscard's right flank had become dangerously exposed and a fatal gap had opened on the right of their line. Taking advantage of this breach, Württemberg's Danish cavalry now swept forward, wheeling to penetrate the flank of the Maison du Roi whose attention was almost entirely fixed on holding back the Dutch. Sweeping forwards, virtually without resistance, the 21 Danish squadrons reformed behind the French around the area of the Tomb of Ottomond, facing north across the plateau of Mont St André towards the exposed flank of Villeroi's army.

The final Allied reinforcements for the cavalry contest to the south were at last in position; Marlborough's superiority on the left could no longer be denied, and his fast-moving plan took hold of the battlefield. Now, far too late, Villeroi tried to redeploy his 50 unused squadrons, but a desperate attempt to form line facing south, stretching from Offus to Mont St André, floundered amongst the baggage and tents of the French camp carelessly left there after the initial deployment. The Allied commander ordered his cavalry forward against the now heavily outnumbered French and Bavarian horsemen. De Guiscard's right flank, without proper infantry support, could no longer resist the onslaught and, turning their horses northwards, they broke and fled in complete disorder. Even the squadrons currently being scrambled together by Villeroi behind Ramillies could not withstand the onslaught. "We had not got forty yards on our retreat," remembered Captain Peter Drake, an Irishmen serving with the French – "when the words "sauve qui peut" went through the great part, if not the whole army, and put all to confusion"

In Ramillies the Allied infantry, now reinforced by the English troops brought down from the north, at last broke through. The Régiment de Picardie stood their ground but were caught between Colonel Borthwick's Scots-Dutch regiment and the English reinforcements. Borthwick was killed, as was <a href="Charles%20O%27Brien%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Clare">Charles O’Brien</a>, the Irish Viscount Clare in French service, fighting at the head of his regiment. The Marquis de Maffei attempted one last stand with his Bavarian and Cologne Guards, but it proved in vain. Noticing a rush of horsemen fast approaching from the south, he later recalled – " … I went towards the nearest of these squadrons to instruct their officer, but instead of being listened to [I] was immediately surrounded and called upon to ask for quarter."

The roads leading north and west were choked with fugitives. Orkney now sent his English troops back across the Petite Gheete stream to once again storm Offus where de la Guiche's infantry had begun to drift away in the confusion. To the right of the infantry Lord John Hay's <a href="Royal%20Scots%20Greys">‘Scots Greys’</a> also picked their way across the stream and charged the Régiment du Roi within Autre-Eglise. "Our dragoons," wrote John Deane, "pushing into the village … made terrible slaughter of the enemy." The Bavarian Horse Grenadiers and the Electoral Guards withdrew and formed a shield about Villeroi and the Elector but were scattered by Lumley's cavalry. Stuck in the mass of fugitives fleeing the battlefield, the French and Bavarian commanders narrowly escaped capture by General Cornelius Wood who, unaware of their identity, had to content himself with the seizure of two Bavarian Lieutenant-Generals. Far to the south, the remnants of de la Colonie's brigade headed in the opposite direction towards the French held fortress of <a href="Namur%20%28city%29">Namur</a>."

The retreat became a rout. Individual Allied commanders drove their troops forward in pursuit, allowing their beaten enemy no chance to recover. Soon the Allied infantry could no longer keep up, but their cavalry were off the leash, heading through the gathering night for the crossings on the Dyle river. At last, however, Marlborough called a halt to the pursuit shortly after midnight near Meldert, from the field. "It was indeed a truly shocking sight to see the miserable remains of this mighty army," wrote Captain Drake, "… reduced to a handful."

What was left of Villeroi's army was now broken in spirit; the imbalance of the casualty figures amply demonstrates the extent of the disaster for Louis XIV's army: ("<a href="%23Casualties">see below</a>"). In addition, hundreds of French soldiers were fugitives, many of whom would never remuster to the <a href="Colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">colours</a>. Villeroi also lost 52 artillery pieces and his entire engineer <a href="Pontoon%20bridge">pontoon</a> train. In the words of Marshal Villars, the French defeat at Ramillies was – "The most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs."

Town after town now succumbed to the Allies. <a href="Leuven">Leuven</a> fell on 25 May 1706; three days later, the Allies entered <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, the capital of the Spanish Netherlands. Marlborough realised the great opportunity created by the early victory of Ramillies: "We now have the whole summer before us," wrote the Duke from Brussels to <a href="Robert%20Harley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Oxford%20and%20Earl%20Mortimer">Robert Harley</a>, "and with the blessing of God I shall make the best use of it." <a href="Mechelen">Malines</a>, <a href="Lier%2C%20Belgium">Lierre</a>, <a href="Ghent">Ghent</a>, <a href="Aalst%2C%20Belgium">Alost</a>, <a href="Damme">Damme</a>, <a href="Oudenaarde">Oudenaarde</a>, <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, and on 6 June <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, all subsequently fell to Marlborough's victorious army and, like Brussels, proclaimed the Austrian candidate for the Spanish throne, the <a href="Charles%20VI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Archduke Charles</a>, as their sovereign. Villeroi was helpless to arrest the process of collapse. When Louis XIV learnt of the disaster he recalled Marshal Vendôme from northern Italy to take command in Flanders; but it would be weeks before the command changed hands.

As news spread of the Allies’ triumph, the Prussians, Hessians and Hanoverian contingents, long delayed by their respective rulers, eagerly joined the pursuit of the broken French and Bavarian forces. "This," wrote Marlborough wearily, "I take to be owing to our late success." Meanwhile, Overkirk took the port of <a href="Ostend">Ostend</a> on 4 July thus opening a direct route to the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a> for communication and supply, but the Allies were making scant progress against <a href="Dendermonde">Dendermonde</a> whose governor, the <a href="Marquis%20de%20Val%C3%A9e">Marquis de Valée</a>, was stubbornly resisting. Only later when Cadogan and Churchill went to take charge did the town's defences begin to fail.

Vendôme formally took over command in Flanders on 4 August; Villeroi would never again receive a major command – "I cannot foresee a happy day in my life save only that of my death." Louis XIV was more forgiving to his old friend – "At our age, Marshal, we must no longer expect good fortune." In the meantime, Marlborough invested the elaborate fortress of <a href="Menen">Menin</a> which, after a costly siege, capitulated on 22 August. Dendermonde finally succumbed on 6 September followed by <a href="Ath">Ath</a> – the last conquest of 1706 – on 2 October. By the time Marlborough had closed down the Ramillies campaign he had denied the French most of the Spanish Netherlands west of the <a href="Meuse%20River">Meuse</a> and north of the <a href="Sambre">Sambre</a> – it was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English Duke but once again it was not decisive as these gains did not defeat France.

The immediate question for the Allies now was how to deal with the Spanish Netherlands, a subject which the Austrians and the Dutch were diametrically opposed. Emperor Joseph I, acting on behalf of his younger brother King ’Charles III’, absent in Spain, claimed that reconquered Brabant and Flanders should be put under immediate possession of a governor named by himself. The Dutch, however, who had supplied the major share of the troops and money to secure the victory (the Austrians had produced nothing of either) claimed the government of the region till the war was over, and that after the peace they should continue to garrison Barrier Fortresses stronger than those which had fallen so easily to Louis XIV's forces in 1701. Marlborough mediated between the two parties but favoured the Dutch position. To sway the Duke's opinion, the Emperor offered Marlborough the governorship of the Spanish Netherlands. It was a tempting offer, but in the name of Allied unity, it was one he refused. In the end England and the Dutch Republic took control of the newly won territory for the duration of the war; after which it was to be handed over to the direct rule of ‘Charles III’, subject to the reservation of a Dutch Barrier, the extent and nature of which had yet to be settled.

Meanwhile, on the Upper Rhine, Villars had been forced onto the defensive as battalion after battalion had been sent north to bolster collapsing French forces in Flanders; there was now no possibility of his undertaking the re-capture of Landau. Further good news for the Allies arrived from northern Italy where, on 7 September, Prince Eugene had routed a French army before the <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a>ese capital, <a href="Battle%20of%20Turin">Turin</a>, driving the Franco-Spanish forces from northern Italy. Only from Spain did Louis XIV receive any good news where <a href="Ant%C3%B3nio%20Lu%C3%ADs%20de%20Sousa%2C%202nd%20Marquess%20of%20Minas">Das Minas</a> and <a href="Henri%20de%20Massue%2C%20Earl%20of%20Galway">Galway</a> had been forced to retreat from <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> towards <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>, allowing <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Spain">Philip V</a> to re-enter his capital on 4 October. All in all though, the situation had changed considerably and Louis XIV began to look for ways to end what was fast becoming a ruinous war for France. For <a href="Queen%20Anne%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a> also, the Ramillies campaign had one overriding significance – "Now we have God be thanked so hopeful a prospect of peace." Instead of continuing the momentum of victory, however, cracks in Allied unity would enable Louis XIV to reverse some of the major setbacks suffered at Turin and Ramillies.

The total number of French casualties cannot be calculated precisely, so complete was the collapse of the Franco-Bavarian army that day. <a href="David%20G.%20Chandler">David G. Chandler</a>’s "Marlborough as Military Commander" and "A Guide to the Battlefields of Europe" are consistent with regards to French casualty figures i.e., 12,000 dead and wounded plus some 7,000 taken prisoner. James Falkner, in "Ramillies 1706: Year of Miracles," also notes 12,000 dead and wounded and states ‘up to 10,000’ taken prisoner. In "The Collins Encyclopaedia of Military History", Dupuy puts Villeroi's dead and wounded at 8,000, with a further 7,000 captured. Neil Litten, using French archives, suggests 7,000 killed and wounded and 6,000 captured, with a further 2,000 choosing to desert. John Millner's memoirs – "Compendious Journal" (1733) – is more specific, recording 12,087 of Villeroi's army were killed or wounded, with another 9,729 taken prisoner. In "Marlborough", however, <a href="Correlli%20Barnett">Correlli Barnett</a> puts the total casualty figure as high as 30,000 – 15,000 dead and wounded with an additional 15,000 taken captive. Trevelyan estimates Villeroi's casualties at 13,000, but adds, ‘his losses by desertion may have doubled that number’. La Colonie omits a casualty figure in his "Chronicles of an old Campaigner"; but Saint-Simon in his "Memoirs" states 4,000 killed, adding 'many others were wounded and many important persons were taken prisoner'. <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, however, in "Histoire du siècle du Louis XIV" records, 'the French lost there twenty thousand men'.

Big Bang

The Big Bang <a href="Scientific%20theory">theory</a> is the prevailing <a href="Physical%20cosmology">cosmological</a> <a href="Scientific%20modelling">model</a> for the <a href="observable%20universe">observable universe</a> from the <a href="Planck%20units%23Cosmology">earliest known periods</a> through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model describes how the universe <a href="Expansion%20of%20the%20universe">expanded</a> from a very high-density and high-temperature state, and offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of phenomena, including the abundance of <a href="light%20element">light element</a>s, the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a> (CMB), <a href="Large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20cosmos">large scale structure</a> and <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a> (the farther away galaxies are, the faster they are moving away from Earth). If the observed conditions are extrapolated backwards in time using the known laws of physics, the prediction is that just before a period of very high density there was a <a href="Gravitational%20singularity">singularity</a> which is typically associated with the Big Bang. Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 <a href="1%2C000%2C000%2C000%20%28number%29">billion</a> years ago, which is thus considered the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a>. After its initial expansion, the universe cooled sufficiently to allow the formation of <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s, and later simple <a href="atom">atom</a>s. Giant clouds of these primordial elements (mostly <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, with some <a href="helium">helium</a> and <a href="lithium">lithium</a>) later coalesced through <a href="gravity">gravity</a>, eventually forming early <a href="star">star</a>s and <a href="Galaxy">galaxies</a>, the descendants of which are visible today. Astronomers also observe the gravitational effects of <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> surrounding galaxies. Though most of the mass in the universe seems to be in the form of dark matter, Big Bang theory and various observations seem to indicate that it is not made out of conventional <a href="baryonic%20matter">baryonic matter</a> (protons, neutrons, and electrons) but it is unclear exactly what it "is" made out of.

Since <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a> first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the <a href="Steady%20State%20theory">Steady State theory</a>, but a wide range of <a href="empirical%20evidence">empirical evidence</a> has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted. In 1929, from analysis of galactic <a href="redshift">redshift</a>s, <a href="Edwin%20Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a> concluded that galaxies are drifting apart; this is important observational evidence consistent with the hypothesis of an expanding universe. In 1964, the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> was discovered, which was crucial evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, since that theory predicted the existence of background radiation throughout the universe before it was discovered. More recently, measurements of the redshifts of supernovae indicate that the <a href="Accelerating%20expansion%20of%20the%20universe">expansion of the universe is accelerating</a>, an observation attributed to <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>'s existence. The known <a href="physical%20law">physical laws of nature</a> can be used to calculate the characteristics of the universe in detail back in time to an initial state of extreme <a href="density">density</a> and <a href="temperature">temperature</a>.

The Belgian astronomer and Catholic priest <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a> proposed on theoretical grounds that the <a href="Metric%20expansion%20of%20space">universe is expanding</a>, which was observationally confirmed soon afterwards by <a href="Edwin%20Hubble">Edwin Hubble</a>. In 1927 in the "Annales de la Société Scientifique de Bruxelles" ("Annals of the Scientific Society of Brussels") under the title "Un Univers homogène de masse constante et de rayon croissant rendant compte de la vitesse radiale des nébuleuses extragalactiques" ("A homogeneous Universe of constant mass and growing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extragalactic nebulae"), he presented his new idea that the universe is expanding and provided the first observational estimation of what is known as the <a href="Hubble%20constant">Hubble constant</a>. What later will be known as the "Big Bang theory" of the origin of the <a href="universe">universe</a>, he called his "hypothesis of the <a href="primeval%20atom">primeval atom</a>" or the "Cosmic Egg".

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their <a href="redshift">redshift</a>s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction. Assuming the <a href="Copernican%20principle">Copernican principle</a> (that the Earth is not the center of the universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into <a href="high-energy%20physics">high energy regimes</a>. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.

The first <a href="subatomic%20particle">subatomic particle</a>s to be formed included <a href="proton">proton</a>s, <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s, and <a href="electron">electron</a>s. Though simple <a href="big%20bang%20nucleosynthesis">atomic nuclei formed</a> within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first <a href="Recombination%20%28cosmology%29">electrically neutral atoms formed</a>. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, along with <a href="helium">helium</a> and traces of <a href="lithium">lithium</a>. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through <a href="gravity">gravity</a> to form <a href="star">star</a>s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either <a href="Stellar%20nucleosynthesis">within stars</a> or <a href="supernova%20nucleosynthesis">during supernovae</a>.

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">CMB</a>, <a href="Large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20cosmos">large scale structure</a>, and <a href="Hubble%27s%20Law">Hubble's Law</a>. The framework for the Big Bang model relies on <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>'s theory of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> and on simplifying assumptions such as <a href="homogeneity%20%28physics%29%23Translation%20invariance">homogeneity</a> and <a href="isotropy">isotropy</a> of space. The governing equations were formulated by <a href="Alexander%20Friedmann">Alexander Friedmann</a>, and similar solutions were worked on by <a href="Willem%20de%20Sitter">Willem de Sitter</a>. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its <a href="Parametric%20equation">parametrization</a> as the <a href="Lambda-CDM%20model">Lambda-CDM model</a> serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model is the current "standard model" of Big Bang cosmology, <a href="Scientific%20consensus">consensus</a> is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and <a href="Observational%20cosmology">observations relevant to cosmology</a>.

Extrapolation of the expansion of the universe backwards in time using general relativity yields an <a href="Infinity%23Physics">infinite</a> <a href="density">density</a> and temperature at a finite time in the past. This <a href="Gravitational%20singularity">singularity</a> indicates that <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a> is not an adequate description of the <a href="laws%20of%20physics">laws of physics</a> in this regime. Models based on general relativity alone can not extrapolate toward the singularity beyond the end of the <a href="Planck%20epoch">Planck epoch</a>.

This primordial singularity is itself sometimes called "the Big Bang", but the term can also refer to a more generic early hot, dense phase of the universe. In either case, "the Big Bang" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the "birth" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a <a href="Equation%20of%20state%20%28cosmology%29">regime</a> where the laws of physics as we understand them (specifically general relativity and the <a href="Standard%20Model">standard model of particle physics</a>) work. Based on measurements of the expansion using <a href="Type%20Ia%20supernova">Type Ia supernova</a>e and measurements of temperature fluctuations in the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a>, the time that has passed since that event — otherwise known as the "<a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a>" — is 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years. The agreement of independent measurements of this age supports the <a href="Lambda-CDM%20model">ΛCDM model</a> that describes in detail the characteristics of the universe.

Despite being extremely <a href="density">dense</a> at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for <a href="gravitational%20collapse">gravitational collapse</a> are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as <a href="star">star</a>s, and do not apply to <a href="metric%20expansion%20of%20space">rapidly expanding space</a> such as the Big Bang.

The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled <a href="Homogeneity%20and%20heterogeneity">homogeneously</a> and <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a>ally with a very high <a href="energy%20density">energy density</a> and huge temperatures and <a href="pressure">pressure</a>s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10 seconds into the expansion, a <a href="phase%20transition">phase transition</a> caused a <a href="cosmic%20inflation">cosmic inflation</a>, during which the universe grew <a href="exponential%20growth">exponentially</a> during which time <a href="Quantum%20fluctuation">density fluctuations</a> that occurred because of the <a href="uncertainty%20principle">uncertainty principle</a> were amplified into the seeds that would later form the <a href="Structure%20formation">large-scale structure</a> of the universe. After inflation stopped, reheating occurred until the universe obtained the temperatures required for the <a href="Pair%20production">production</a> of a <a href="quark%E2%80%93gluon%20plasma">quark–gluon plasma</a> as well as all other <a href="elementary%20particle">elementary particle</a>s. Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at <a href="Special%20relativity">relativistic</a> <a href="Relativistic%20speed">speeds</a>, and <a href="Antimatter">particle–antiparticle pairs</a> of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions. At some point, an unknown reaction called <a href="baryogenesis">baryogenesis</a> violated the conservation of <a href="baryon%20number">baryon number</a>, leading to a very small excess of <a href="quark">quark</a>s and <a href="lepton">lepton</a>s over antiquarks and antileptons—of the order of one part in 30 million. This resulted in the predominance of <a href="matter">matter</a> over <a href="antimatter">antimatter</a> in the present universe.

The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. <a href="Explicit%20symmetry%20breaking">Symmetry breaking</a> phase transitions put the <a href="fundamental%20force">fundamental force</a>s of physics and the parameters of <a href="elementary%20particles">elementary particles</a> into their present form. After about 10 seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s. At about 10 seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form <a href="baryon">baryon</a>s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10 of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by <a href="photon">photon</a>s (with a minor contribution from <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a> and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> and helium <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> in a process called <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>. Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.

As the universe cooled, the <a href="rest%20mass">rest mass</a> energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">radiation</a>. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a>. The <a href="Biochemistry">chemistry of life</a> may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, <a href="Age%20of%20the%20universe">13.8 billion years ago</a>, during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.

Over a long period of time, the slightly denser regions of the nearly uniformly distributed matter gravitationally attracted nearby matter and thus grew even denser, forming gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and the other astronomical structures observable today. The details of this process depend on the amount and type of matter in the universe. The four possible types of matter are known as <a href="cold%20dark%20matter">cold dark matter</a>, <a href="warm%20dark%20matter">warm dark matter</a>, <a href="hot%20dark%20matter">hot dark matter</a>, and <a href="baryonic%20matter">baryonic matter</a>. The best measurements available, from <a href="Wilkinson%20Microwave%20Anisotropy%20Probe">Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> (WMAP), show that the data is well-fit by a Lambda-CDM model in which dark matter is assumed to be cold (warm dark matter is ruled out by early <a href="reionization">reionization</a>), and is estimated to make up about 23% of the matter/energy of the universe, while baryonic matter makes up about 4.6%. In an "extended model" which includes hot dark matter in the form of <a href="neutrino">neutrino</a>s, then if the "physical baryon density" formula_1 is estimated at about 0.023 (this is different from the 'baryon density' formula_2 expressed as a fraction of the total matter/energy density, which as noted above is about 0.046), and the corresponding cold dark matter density formula_3 is about 0.11, the corresponding neutrino density formula_4 is estimated to be less than 0.0062.

Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the <a href="Cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">CMB</a> imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>, which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">expansion of the universe</a> to slowly begin to accelerate.

Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a> term in <a href="Einstein%27s%20field%20equation">Einstein's field equation</a>s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its <a href="equation%20of%20state%20%28cosmology%29">equation of state</a> and relationship with the <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a> of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.

All of this cosmic evolution after the <a href="inflationary%20epoch">inflationary epoch</a> can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10 seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravitation</a> is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest <a href="unsolved%20problems%20in%20physics">unsolved problems in physics</a>.

The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of <a href="physical%20law">physical law</a>s and the <a href="cosmological%20principle">cosmological principle</a>. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is <a href="Homogeneous%20space">homogeneous</a> and <a href="isotropy">isotropic</a>.

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the <a href="fine%20structure%20constant">fine structure constant</a> over much of the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a> is of order 10. Also, general relativity has passed stringent <a href="tests%20of%20general%20relativity">tests</a> on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler <a href="Copernican%20principle">Copernican principle</a>, which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10 via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.

General relativity describes spacetime by a <a href="metric%20tensor">metric</a>, which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a <a href="coordinate%20chart">coordinate chart</a> or "grid" that is laid down over all <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be <a href="Homogeneous%20space">homogeneous</a> and <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a> on large scales, which uniquely singles out the <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric</a> (FLRW metric). 
This metric contains a <a href="scale%20factor">scale factor</a>, which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a <a href="coordinate%20system">coordinate system</a> to be made, called <a href="comoving%20coordinates">comoving coordinates</a>. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their "coordinate" distance (<a href="comoving%20distance">comoving distance</a>) remains constant, the "physical" distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the <a href="scale%20factor">scale factor</a> of the universe.

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, <a href="metric%20expansion%20of%20space">space itself expands</a> with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion "in space", but rather an expansion "of space". Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.

An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of <a href="particle%20horizon">particle horizon</a>s. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a "past horizon" on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a "future horizon", which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">FLRW</a> model that describes our universe.

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times <a href="Big%20Bang%23Horizon%20problem">suggests</a> that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to <a href="accelerating%20universe">accelerate</a>, there is a future horizon as well.

English astronomer <a href="Fred%20Hoyle">Fred Hoyle</a> is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying: "These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past."

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "<a href="steady%20state%20universe">steady state</a>" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative, but Hoyle explicitly denied this and said it was just a striking image meant to highlight the difference between the two models.

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912, <a href="Vesto%20Slipher">Vesto Slipher</a> measured the first <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a> of a "<a href="spiral%20nebula">spiral nebula</a>" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was <a href="Shapley%E2%80%93Curtis%20debate">highly controversial</a> whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. Ten years later, <a href="Alexander%20Friedmann">Alexander Friedmann</a>, a <a href="Russia">Russia</a>n <a href="physical%20cosmology">cosmologist</a> and <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a>, derived the <a href="Friedmann%20equations">Friedmann equations</a> from <a href="Einstein%20equation">Albert Einstein's equations of general relativity</a>, showing that the universe might be expanding in contrast to the <a href="static%20universe">static universe</a> model advocated by Einstein at that time. In 1924 Edwin Hubble's measurement of the great distance to the nearest spiral nebulae showed that these systems were indeed other galaxies. Independently deriving Friedmann's equations in 1927, <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a>, a Belgian physicist, proposed that the inferred recession of the nebulae was due to the expansion of the universe.

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the <a href="cosmic%20distance%20ladder">cosmic distance ladder</a>, using the <a href="Hooker%20telescope">Hooker telescope</a> at <a href="Mount%20Wilson%20Observatory">Mount Wilson Observatory</a>. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a>. Lemaître had already shown that this was expected, given the <a href="cosmological%20principle">cosmological principle</a>.

In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal <a href="Steady%20state%20theory">steady state</a> universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory. This perception was enhanced by the fact that the originator of the Big Bang theory, <a href="Georges%20Lema%C3%AEtre">Georges Lemaître</a>, was a Roman Catholic priest. <a href="Arthur%20Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a> agreed with <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> that the universe did not have a beginning in time, "viz"., that <a href="Arguments%20for%20eternity%23Argument%20from%20the%20nature%20of%20matter">matter is eternal</a>. A beginning in time was "repugnant" to him. Lemaître, however, thought thatIf the world has begun with a single <a href="Quantum%20mechanics">quantum</a>, the notions of space and time would altogether fail to have any meaning at the beginning; they would only begin to have a sensible meaning when the original quantum had been divided into a sufficient number of quanta. If this suggestion is correct, the beginning of the world happened a little before the beginning of space and time.

During the 1930s other ideas were proposed as <a href="non-standard%20cosmologies">non-standard cosmologies</a> to explain Hubble's observations, including the <a href="Milne%20model">Milne model</a>, the <a href="oscillatory%20universe">oscillatory universe</a> (originally suggested by Friedmann, but advocated by Albert Einstein and <a href="Richard%20Tolman">Richard Tolman</a>) and <a href="Fritz%20Zwicky">Fritz Zwicky</a>'s <a href="tired%20light">tired light</a> hypothesis.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, two distinct possibilities emerged. One was Fred Hoyle's <a href="steady%20state%20model">steady state model</a>, whereby new matter would be created as the universe seemed to expand. In this model the universe is roughly the same at any point in time. The other was Lemaître's Big Bang theory, advocated and developed by <a href="George%20Gamow">George Gamow</a>, who introduced <a href="big%20bang%20nucleosynthesis">big bang nucleosynthesis</a> (BBN) and whose associates, <a href="Ralph%20Alpher">Ralph Alpher</a> and <a href="Robert%20Herman">Robert Herman</a>, predicted the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">CMB</a>. Ironically, it was Hoyle who coined the phrase that came to be applied to Lemaître's theory, referring to it as "this "big bang" idea" during a <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a> broadcast in March 1949. For a while, support was split between these two theories. Eventually, the observational evidence, most notably from radio <a href="source%20counts">source counts</a>, began to favor Big Bang over Steady State. The discovery and confirmation of the CMB in 1964 secured the Big Bang as the best theory of the origin and evolution of the universe. Much of the current work in cosmology includes understanding how galaxies form in the context of the Big Bang, understanding the physics of the universe at earlier and earlier times, and reconciling observations with the basic theory.

In 1968 and 1970 <a href="Roger%20Penrose">Roger Penrose</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>, and <a href="George%20F.%20R.%20Ellis">George F. R. Ellis</a> published papers where they showed that <a href="mathematical%20singularities">mathematical singularities</a> were an inevitable initial condition of <a href="General%20Relativity">general relativistic</a> models of the Big Bang. Then, from the 1970s to the 1990s, cosmologists worked on characterizing the features of the Big Bang universe and resolving outstanding problems. In 1981, <a href="Alan%20Guth">Alan Guth</a> made a breakthrough in theoretical work on resolving certain outstanding theoretical <a href="%23Problems">problems in the Big Bang theory</a> with the introduction of an epoch of rapid expansion in the early universe he called "<a href="cosmic%20inflation">inflation</a>". Meanwhile, during these decades, two questions in <a href="observational%20cosmology">observational cosmology</a> that generated much discussion and disagreement were over the precise values of the <a href="Hubble%20Constant">Hubble Constant</a> and the matter-density of the universe (before the discovery of <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>, thought to be the key predictor for the eventual <a href="fate%20of%20the%20universe">fate of the universe</a>).

In the mid-1990s, observations of certain <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a>s appeared to indicate that they were about 15 billion years old, which <a href="cosmic%20age%20problem">conflicted</a> with most then-current estimates of the age of the universe (and indeed with the age measured today). This issue was later resolved when new computer simulations, which included the effects of mass loss due to <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a>s, indicated a much younger age for globular clusters. While there still remain some questions as to how accurately the ages of the clusters are measured, globular clusters are of interest to cosmology as some of the oldest objects in the universe.

Significant progress in Big Bang cosmology has been made since the late 1990s as a result of advances in <a href="telescope">telescope</a> technology as well as the analysis of data from satellites such as <a href="Cosmic%20Background%20Explorer">COBE</a>, the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and <a href="WMAP">WMAP</a>. Cosmologists now have fairly precise and accurate measurements of many of the parameters of the Big Bang model, and have made the unexpected discovery that the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating.

The earliest and most direct observational evidence of the validity of the theory are the expansion of the universe according to <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a> (as indicated by the redshifts of galaxies), discovery and measurement of the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a> and the relative abundances of light elements produced by <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>. More recent evidence includes observations of <a href="galaxy%20formation%20and%20evolution">galaxy formation and evolution</a>, and the distribution of <a href="large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20cosmos">large-scale cosmic structures</a>, These are sometimes called the "four pillars" of the Big Bang theory.

Precise modern models of the Big Bang appeal to various exotic physical phenomena that have not been observed in terrestrial laboratory experiments or incorporated into the <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a> of <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a>. Of these features, <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> is currently subjected to the most active laboratory investigations. Remaining issues include the <a href="cuspy%20halo%20problem">cuspy halo problem</a> and the <a href="dwarf%20galaxy%20problem">dwarf galaxy problem</a> of cold dark matter. Dark energy is also an area of intense interest for scientists, but it is not clear whether direct detection of dark energy will be possible. <a href="Inflation%20%28cosmology%29">Inflation</a> and baryogenesis remain more speculative features of current Big Bang models. Viable, quantitative explanations for such phenomena are still being sought. These are currently <a href="list%20of%20unsolved%20problems%20in%20physics">unsolved problems in physics</a>.

Observations of distant galaxies and <a href="quasar">quasar</a>s show that these objects are redshifted—the <a href="light">light</a> emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a <a href="frequency%20spectrum">frequency spectrum</a> of an object and matching the <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> pattern of <a href="emission%20line">emission line</a>s or <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a>s corresponding to <a href="atom">atom</a>s of the <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a>s interacting with the light. These redshifts are <a href="Homogeneity%20%28physics%29">uniformly</a> isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional <a href="velocity">velocity</a> of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the <a href="cosmic%20distance%20ladder">cosmic distance ladder</a>. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:
formula_5
where

<a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a> has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the <a href="Copernican%20principle">Copernican principle</a>—or the universe is <a href="Metric%20expansion%20of%20space">uniformly expanding</a> everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922 and Georges Lemaître in 1927, well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker</a>.

The theory requires the relation formula_9 to hold at all times, where formula_7 is the <a href="comoving%20distance">comoving distance</a>, "v" is the <a href="recessional%20velocity">recessional velocity</a>, and formula_6, formula_12, and formula_7 vary as the universe expands (hence we write formula_8 to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the <a href="observable%20universe">observable universe</a>, the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity formula_6. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.

That <a href="Metric%20expansion%20of%20space">space is undergoing metric expansion</a> is shown by direct observational evidence of the <a href="Cosmological%20principle">Cosmological principle</a> and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a> and <a href="Homogeneity%20%28physics%29%23Translation%20invariance">homogeneous</a>, supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">cosmic microwave background radiation</a> on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

In 1964 <a href="Arno%20Penzias">Arno Penzias</a> and <a href="Robert%20Woodrow%20Wilson">Robert Wilson</a> serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the <a href="microwave">microwave</a> band. Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725 K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> in 1978.

The "surface of last scattering" corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after "<a href="Recombination%20%28cosmology%29">recombination</a>", the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable. Prior to this, the universe comprised a hot dense photon-baryon plasma sea where photons were quickly <a href="Thomson%20scattering">scattered</a> from free charged particles. Peaking at around , the mean free path for a photon becomes long enough to reach the present day and the universe becomes transparent.
In 1989, <a href="NASA">NASA</a> launched the <a href="Cosmic%20Background%20Explorer%20satellite">Cosmic Background Explorer satellite</a> (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the CMB frequency spectrum is an almost perfect <a href="blackbody">blackbody</a> with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 10, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726 K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255 K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 10. <a href="John%20C.%20Mather">John C. Mather</a> and <a href="George%20Smoot">George Smoot</a> were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably <a href="BOOMERanG%20experiment">BOOMERanG</a>, found the <a href="shape%20of%20the%20universe">shape of the universe</a> to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.

In early 2003, the first results of the <a href="WMAP">Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe</a> (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific <a href="cosmic%20inflation">cosmic inflation</a> models, but are consistent with the <a href="inflation%20theory">inflation theory</a> in general. The <a href="Planck%20%28spacecraft%29">Planck</a> space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based <a href="List%20of%20cosmic%20microwave%20background%20experiments">cosmic microwave background experiments</a> are ongoing.

Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of <a href="helium-4">helium-4</a>, <a href="helium-3">helium-3</a>, deuterium, and <a href="lithium-7">lithium-7</a> in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen. The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of <a href="photon">photon</a>s to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">CMB</a> fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for <chem>^4He/H</chem>, about 10 for <chem>^2H/H</chem>, about 10 for <chem>^3He/H</chem> and about 10 for <chem>^7Li/H</chem>.

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for <chem>^4He</chem>, and off by a factor of two for <chem>^7Li</chem>; in the latter two cases there are substantial <a href="systematic%20error">systematic uncertainties</a>. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium. Indeed, there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than <chem>^3He</chem>, and in constant ratios, too.

Detailed observations of the <a href="Galaxy%20morphological%20classification">morphology</a> and <a href="Large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20cosmos">distribution</a> of galaxies and <a href="quasars">quasars</a> are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as <a href="galaxy%20clusters">galaxy clusters</a> and <a href="supercluster">supercluster</a>s.

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of <a href="star%20formation">star formation</a>, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium. Since the clouds of gas have no heavy elements, they likely formed in the first few minutes after the Big Bang, during <a href="Big%20Bang%20nucleosynthesis">Big Bang nucleosynthesis</a>.

The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background%20radiation">CMB</a> is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of <a href="stellar%20evolution">stellar evolution</a> to <a href="globular%20clusters">globular clusters</a> and through <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a> of individual <a href="Population%20II">Population II</a> stars.

The prediction that the CMB temperature was higher in the past has been experimentally supported by observations of very low temperature absorption lines in gas clouds at high redshift. This prediction also implies that the amplitude of the <a href="Sunyaev%E2%80%93Zel%27dovich%20effect">Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect</a> in <a href="clusters%20of%20galaxies">clusters of galaxies</a> does not depend directly on redshift. Observations have found this to be roughly true, but this effect depends on cluster properties that do change with cosmic time, making precise measurements difficult.

Future <a href="Gravitational-wave%20observatory">gravitational waves observatories</a> might be able to detect primordial gravitational waves, relics of the early universe, up to less than a second after the Big Bang.

As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the <a href="horizon%20problem">horizon problem</a>, the <a href="magnetic%20monopole%20problem">magnetic monopole problem</a>, and the <a href="flatness%20problem">flatness problem</a> are most commonly resolved with <a href="Cosmic%20inflation">inflationary theory</a>, but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven. What follows are a list of the mysterious aspects of the Big Bang theory still under intense investigation by cosmologists and astrophysicists.

It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the <a href="Sakharov%20conditions">Sakharov conditions</a> must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that <a href="C-symmetry">C-symmetry</a> and <a href="CP-symmetry">CP-symmetry</a> are violated and that the universe depart from <a href="thermodynamic%20equilibrium">thermodynamic equilibrium</a>. All these conditions occur in the <a href="Standard%20Model">Standard Model</a>, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

Measurements of the <a href="redshift">redshift</a>–<a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> relation for <a href="type%20Ia%20supernova">type Ia supernova</a>e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been <a href="accelerating%20universe">accelerating</a> since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large <a href="equation%20of%20state%20%28cosmology%29">negative pressure</a>, dubbed "dark energy".

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the <a href="cosmic%20microwave%20background">cosmic microwave background</a> indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the <a href="Critical%20density%20%28cosmology%29">critical density</a> of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density. Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of <a href="gravitational%20lens">gravitational lens</a>es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the <a href="large-scale%20structure%20of%20the%20universe">large-scale structure</a> as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of <a href="vacuum%20energy">vacuum energy</a>, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the <a href="far%20future">far future</a> as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a> but also extending to more exotic forms of <a href="Quintessence%20%28physics%29">quintessence</a> or other modified gravity schemes. A <a href="cosmological%20constant%20problem">cosmological constant problem</a>, sometimes called the "most embarrassing problem in physics", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from <a href="Planck%20units">Planck units</a>.

During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal <a href="baryon">baryon</a>ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, <a href="galaxy%20cluster">galaxy cluster</a> velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, <a href="gravitational%20lensing">gravitational lensing</a> studies, and <a href="X-ray%20astronomy">X-ray measurements</a> of galaxy clusters.

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many <a href="particle%20physics">particle physics</a> candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.

Additionally, there are outstanding problems associated with the currently favored <a href="cold%20dark%20matter">cold dark matter</a> model which include the <a href="dwarf%20galaxy%20problem">dwarf galaxy problem</a> and the <a href="cuspy%20halo%20problem">cuspy halo problem</a>. Alternative theories have been proposed that do not require a large amount of undetected matter, but instead modify the laws of gravity established by Newton and Einstein; yet no alternative theory has been as successful as the cold dark matter proposal in explaining all extant observations.

The <a href="horizon%20problem">horizon problem</a> results from the premise that information cannot travel <a href="faster%20than%20light">faster than light</a>. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the <a href="particle%20horizon">particle horizon</a>—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in <a href="causality%20%28physics%29">causal</a> contact. The observed isotropy of the <a href="Cosmic%20microwave%20background">CMB</a> is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by <a href="inflationary%20theory">inflationary theory</a> in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.

<a href="Heisenberg%27s%20uncertainty%20principle">Heisenberg's uncertainty principle</a> predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be <a href="primordial%20fluctuations">quantum thermal fluctuations</a>, which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe. Inflation predicts that the <a href="primordial%20fluctuations">primordial fluctuations</a> are nearly <a href="Scale%20invariance">scale invariant</a> and <a href="Normal%20distribution">Gaussian</a>, which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before <a href="electroweak%20symmetry%20breaking">electroweak symmetry breaking</a> occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the <a href="electroweak%20vacuum">electroweak vacuum</a> since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the <a href="electroweak%20epoch">electroweak epoch</a> ended.

The <a href="magnetic%20monopole">magnetic monopole</a> objection was raised in the late 1970s. <a href="Grand%20unified%20theory">Grand unified theories</a> predicted <a href="topological%20defect">topological defect</a>s in space that would manifest as <a href="magnetic%20monopole">magnetic monopole</a>s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by <a href="cosmic%20inflation">cosmic inflation</a>, which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.

The <a href="flatness%20problem">flatness problem</a> (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric</a> (FLRW). The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial <a href="curvature">curvature</a> depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the <a href="Critical%20density%20%28cosmology%29">critical density</a>; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be "flat".

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat. Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the <a href="Planck%20time">Planck time</a>, 10 seconds, the fact that the universe has reached neither a <a href="heat%20death%20of%20the%20universe">heat death</a> nor a <a href="Big%20Crunch">Big Crunch</a> after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 10 of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.

Physics may conclude that <a href="time">time</a> did not 'exist' before the Big Bang, but 'started' with the Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause', and, instead, the pre-Big Bang universe always existed. <a href="Quantum%20fluctuation">Quantum fluctuation</a>s, or other laws of physics that may have existed at the start of the Big Bang could then create the conditions for matter to occur.

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass <a href="density">density</a> of the universe were greater than the <a href="Critical%20density%20%28cosmology%29">critical density</a>, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a>s, <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s, and <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a>s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach <a href="absolute%20zero">absolute zero</a>—a <a href="Big%20Freeze">Big Freeze</a>. Moreover, if the proton were <a href="proton%20decay">unstable</a>, then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting <a href="Hawking%20radiation">Hawking radiation</a>. The <a href="entropy">entropy</a> of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our <a href="event%20horizon">event horizon</a> and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a>. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called <a href="phantom%20energy">phantom energy</a> theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called <a href="Big%20Rip">Big Rip</a>.

The following is a partial list of misconceptions about the Big Bang model:

"The Big Bang as the origin of the universe:" One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.

"The Big Bang was "small"": It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.

"<a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble's law</a> violates the <a href="Special%20relativity">special theory of relativity</a>": Hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond <a href="Hubble%27s%20law">Hubble Distance</a> recede <a href="Faster-than-light">faster than the speed of light</a>. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion "of" space, rather than "through" space.

"<a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler redshift</a> vs <a href="Cosmological%20redshift">cosmological red-shift</a>": Astronomers often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift, which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a <a href="essential%20singularity">singularity</a> at the origin of cosmic time; this <a href="infinity%23Physics">infinite</a> <a href="energy%20density">energy density</a> is regarded as impossible in <a href="experimental%20physics">physics</a>. Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the <a href="Planck%20temperature">Planck temperature</a>, and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. "(Also see <a href="Planck%20epoch">Planck epoch</a>.)"

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of <a href="quantum%20gravity">quantum gravity</a>.

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of <a href="cosmogony">cosmogony</a>.

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:

Proposals in the last two categories see the Big Bang as an event in either a much larger and <a href="Roger%20Penrose%23An%20earlier%20universe">older universe</a> or in a <a href="multiverse">multiverse</a>.

As a description of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing on religion and philosophy. As a result, it has become one of the liveliest areas in the discourse between <a href="Relationship%20between%20religion%20and%20science">science and religion</a>. Some believe the Big Bang implies a creator, and some see its mention in their holy books, while others argue that Big Bang cosmology makes the notion of a creator superfluous.

The extended-range 767-200ER and 767-300ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988, respectively, while a production <a href="Cargo%20aircraft">freighter</a> version, the 767-300F, debuted in 1995. Conversion programs have modified passenger 767-200 and 767-300 series aircraft for cargo use, while military derivatives include the <a href="Boeing%20E-767">E-767</a> <a href="Airborne%20early%20warning%20and%20control">surveillance</a> aircraft, the <a href="Boeing%20KC-767">KC-767</a> and <a href="Boeing%20KC-46">KC-46</a> aerial <a href="aerial%20refueling">tankers</a>, and VIP transports. Engines featured on the 767 include the <a href="General%20Electric%20CF6">General Electric CF6</a>, <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT9D">Pratt & Whitney JT9D</a> and <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW4000">PW4000</a>, and <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211</a> turbofans.

<a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and <a href="Transcontinental%20flight%20across%20the%20United%20States">transcontinental</a> routes, during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design. The 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to be used on extended overseas flights in 1985. The aircraft was then used to expand <a href="Non-stop%20flight">non-stop</a> service on <a href="Flight%20length">medium- to long-haul</a> intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the development of the <a href="Boeing%20777">777</a>, a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for <a href="transatlantic%20flight">transatlantic flight</a>s between <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and <a href="Europe">Europe</a>.

The 767 is the first twinjet wide-body type to reach 1,000 aircraft delivered. , Boeing has received 1,244 orders for the 767 from 74 customers with 1,135 delivered. A total of 742 of these aircraft were in service in July 2018. The most popular variant is the 767-300ER with 583 delivered. <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> is the largest operator with 77 aircraft. Competitors have included the <a href="Airbus%20A300">Airbus A300</a>, <a href="Airbus%20A310">A310</a>, and <a href="Airbus%20A330">A330-200</a>. Non-passenger variants of the 767 remain in production while the passenger variant's successor, the <a href="Boeing%20787%20Dreamliner">787</a>, entered service in 2011.

In 1970, Boeing's 747 became the first wide-body jetliner to enter service. The 747 was the first passenger jet wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin. Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the <a href="Boeing%20707">707</a> and other early generation narrow-body jets. The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10">McDonnell Douglas DC-10</a>, and <a href="Lockheed%20L-1011%20TriStar">Lockheed L-1011 TriStar</a> wide-bodies. To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation <a href="Aeritalia">Aeritalia</a> and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies. This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation. The initial 7X7 was conceived as a <a href="STOL">short take-off and landing</a> airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner. At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a <a href="T-tail">T-tail</a>.
By 1976, a twinjet layout, similar to the one which had debuted on the <a href="Airbus%20A300">Airbus A300</a>, became the baseline configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including <a href="high-bypass%20turbofan">high-bypass-ratio turbofan</a> engines, new flight deck systems, <a href="aerodynamic">aerodynamic</a> improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.

In January 1978, Boeing announced a major extension of its <a href="Boeing%20Everett%20Factory">Everett factory</a>—which was then dedicated to manufacturing the 747—to accommodate its new wide-body family. In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation, and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a <a href="trijet">trijet</a> 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes. The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes. The 767 was officially launched on July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a> and Delta Air Lines later that year. The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity was too close to the 757's seating, while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration.

In the late 1970s, <a href="operating%20cost">operating cost</a> replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized <a href="fuel%20efficiency">fuel efficiency</a> from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30 percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used <a href="computer-aided%20design">computer-aided design</a> for over a third of the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a> tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including <a href="avionics">avionics</a>, <a href="flight%20management%20system">flight management system</a>s, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4 billion.
Early 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt & Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans, marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner. Both jet engine models had a maximum output of of <a href="Jet%20engine%23Thrust">thrust</a>. The engines were mounted approximately one-third the length of the wing from the fuselage, similar to previous wide-body trijets. The larger wings were designed using an <a href="Supercritical%20airfoil">aft-loaded</a> shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed <a href="lift%20%28force%29">lift</a> more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer's previous aircraft. The wings provided higher-altitude <a href="Cruise%20%28flight%29">cruise</a> performance, added fuel capacity, and expansion room for future stretched variants. The initial 767-200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic, and would be capable of operating routes up to .

The 767's fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at . While it was narrower than previous wide-body designs, seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted, and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag. The fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide-body <a href="unit%20load%20device">unit load device</a>s side-by-side, so a smaller container, the LD2, was created specifically for the 767. Using a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section, providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft.
The 767 was the first Boeing wide-body to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit. <a href="Cathode%20ray%20tube">Cathode ray tube</a> (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the <a href="flight%20engineer">flight engineer</a> by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly. Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft. The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a US presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets. A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models. <a href="Ansett%20Australia">Ansett Australia</a> ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured. The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course, and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types. Although nominally similar in control design, flying the 767 feels different from the 757. The 757's controls are heavy, similar to the 727 and 747; the control yoke can be rotated to 90 degrees in each direction. The 767 has far lighter control feel in pitch and roll, and the control yoke has approximately 2/3 the rotation travel.

To produce the 767, Boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC. The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, <a href="Boeing%20Rotorcraft%20Systems">Boeing Vertol</a> made the <a href="leading%20edge">leading edge</a> for the wings, and <a href="Spirit%20AeroSystems">Boeing Wichita</a> produced the forward fuselage. The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely <a href="Fuji%20Heavy%20Industries">Fuji Heavy Industries</a> (<a href="Aircraft%20fairing">wing fairings</a> and gear doors), <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> (center fuselage), and <a href="Mitsubishi%20Heavy%20Industries">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</a> (rear fuselage, doors, and tail). Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory. For expedited production of wing <a href="Spar%20%28aviation%29">spars</a>, the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received <a href="robot">robot</a>ic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting <a href="fastener">fastener</a>s. This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747. Final assembly of the first aircraft began in July 1979.
The prototype aircraft, <a href="aircraft%20registration">registered</a> N767BA and equipped with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981. By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a>, <a href="All%20Nippon%20Airways">All Nippon Airways</a>, <a href="Britannia%20Airways">Britannia Airways</a>, <a href="Transbrasil">Transbrasil</a>, and <a href="Trans%20World%20Airlines">Trans World Airlines</a> (TWA). On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its <a href="maiden%20flight">maiden flight</a> under the command of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit. The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> because of a <a href="Hydraulics">hydraulic</a> fluid leak. The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.

The 10-month 767 flight test program utilized the first six aircraft built. The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines. The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance, while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights. During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets. Following 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the US <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) and the UK <a href="Civil%20Aviation%20Authority%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Civil Aviation Authority</a> (CAA) in July 1982. The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines. The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.

The 767 entered service with United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first commercial flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service three months later with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, <a href="China%20Airlines">China Airlines</a>, and <a href="El%20Al">El Al</a> began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater <a href="Dispatch%20%28logistics%29">dispatch</a> <a href="Reliability%20engineering">reliability</a> than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1 percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an <a href="evacuation%20slide">evacuation slide</a> latch, and the repair of a <a href="tailplane">tailplane</a> pivot to match production specifications.
Seeking to capitalize on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, in its first year of service. <a href="Ethiopian%20Airlines">Ethiopian Airlines</a> placed the first order for the type in December 1982. Featuring increased <a href="gross%20weight">gross weight</a> and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier <a href="Payload%20%28air%20and%20space%20craft%29">payloads</a> at distances up to , and was targeted at overseas customers. The 767-200ER entered service with <a href="El%20Al">El Al</a> Airline on March 27, 1984. The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.

In the mid-1980s, the 767 spearheaded the growth of twinjet flights across the northern Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (<a href="ETOPS">ETOPS</a>) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines. Before the 767, overwater flight paths of twinjets could be no more than 90 minutes away from <a href="diversion%20airport">diversion airport</a>s. In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria. This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land. The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines. The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration, and all available engines received approval by 1993. Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.

Forecasting airline interest in larger-capacity models, Boeing announced the stretched 767-300 in 1983 and the extended-range 767-300ER in 1984. Both models offered a 20 percent passenger capacity increase, while the extended-range version was capable of operating flights up to . <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a> placed the first order for the 767-300 in September 1983. Following its first flight on January 30, 1986, the type entered service with Japan Airlines on October 20, 1986. The 767-300ER completed its first flight on December 9, 1986, but it was not until March 1987 that the first firm order, from American Airlines, was placed. The type entered service with American Airlines on March 3, 1988. The 767-300 and 767-300ER gained popularity after entering service, and came to account for approximately two-thirds of all 767s sold.

After the debut of the first stretched 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for greater capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the "Hunchback of Mukilteo" (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage. In 1986, Boeing proposed the 767-X, a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin, but received little interest. By 1988, the 767-X had evolved into an all-new twinjet, which revived the <a href="Boeing%20777">777</a> designation. Until the 777's 1995 debut, the 767-300 and 767-300ER remained Boeing's second-largest wide-bodies behind the 747.
Buoyed by a recovering global economy and ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By the end of the decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of <a href="Point-to-point%20transit">point-to-point</a> flights which bypassed major <a href="airline%20hub">airline hub</a>s in favor of <a href="direct%20flight">direct routes</a>. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The increased number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional <a href="Spoke-hub%20distribution%20paradigm">hub-and-spoke</a> model.

In February 1990, the first 767 equipped with <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211</a> turbofans, a 767-300, was delivered to <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a>. Six months later, the carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in the <a href="hardpoint">engine pylons</a> of several aircraft. The cracks were related to the extra weight of the RB211 engines, which are heavier than other 767 engines. During the grounding, interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components, and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks. Boeing also performed a structural reassessment, resulting in production changes and modifications to the engine pylons of all 767s in service.
In January 1993, following an order from <a href="UPS%20Airlines">UPS Airlines</a>, Boeing launched a freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995. The 767-300F featured a main deck cargo hold, upgraded landing gear, and strengthened wing structure. In November 1993, the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the , an <a href="Airborne%20Early%20Warning%20and%20Control">Airborne Early Warning and Control</a> (AWACS) variant based on the 767-200ER. The first two , featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance <a href="radar">radar</a> and other monitoring equipment, were delivered in 1998 to the <a href="Japan%20Self-Defense%20Forces">Japan Self-Defense Forces</a>.

In November 1995, after abandoning development of a smaller version of the 777, Boeing announced that it was revisiting studies for a larger 767. The proposed 767-400X, a second stretch of the aircraft, offered a 12 percent capacity increase versus the 767-300, and featured an upgraded flight deck, enhanced interior, and greater wingspan. The variant was specifically aimed at Delta Air Lines' pending replacement of its aging Lockheed L-1011 TriStars, and faced competition from the A330-200, a shortened derivative of the Airbus A330. In March 1997, Delta Air Lines launched the 767-400ER when it ordered the type to replace its L-1011 fleet. In October 1997, <a href="Continental%20Airlines">Continental Airlines</a> also ordered the 767-400ER to replace its McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fleet. The type completed its first flight on October 9, 1999, and entered service with Continental Airlines on September 14, 2000.

In the early 2000s, cumulative 767 deliveries approached 900, but new sales declined during an airline industry downturn. In 2001, Boeing dropped plans for a longer-range model, the 767-400ERX, in favor of the proposed <a href="Boeing%20Sonic%20Cruiser">Sonic Cruiser</a>, a new jetliner which aimed to fly 15 percent faster while having comparable fuel costs as the 767. The following year, Boeing announced the <a href="Boeing%20KC-767%23International%20programs">KC-767 Tanker Transport</a>, a second military derivative of the 767-200ER. Launched with an order in October 2002 from the <a href="Italian%20Air%20Force">Italian Air Force</a>, the KC-767 was intended for the dual role of refueling other aircraft and carrying cargo. The Japanese government became the second customer for the type in March 2003. In May 2003, the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) announced its intent to lease KC-767s to replace its aging <a href="Boeing%20KC-135%20Stratotanker">KC-135</a> tankers. The plan was suspended in March 2004 amid a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> <a href="Boeing%20KC-767%23USAF%20lease%20and%20cancellation">scandal</a>, resulting in multiple US government investigations and the departure of several Boeing officials, including <a href="Philip%20M.%20Condit">Philip Condit</a>, the company's <a href="chief%20executive%20officer">chief executive officer</a>, and <a href="chief%20financial%20officer">chief financial officer</a> Michael Sears. The first KC-767s were delivered in 2008 to the Japan Self-Defense Forces.

In late 2002, after airlines expressed reservations about its emphasis on speed over cost reduction, Boeing halted development of the Sonic Cruiser. The following year, the manufacturer announced the 7E7, a mid-size 767 successor made from <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a>s which promised to be 20 percent more fuel efficient. The new jetliner was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the <a href="Boeing%20Yellowstone%20Project">Boeing Yellowstone Project</a>. Customers embraced the 7E7, later renamed 787 Dreamliner, and within two years it had become the fastest-selling airliner in the company's history. In 2005, Boeing opted to continue 767 production despite record Dreamliner sales, citing a need to provide customers waiting for the 787 with a more readily available option. Subsequently, the 767-300ER was offered to customers affected by 787 delays, including All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines. Some aging 767s, exceeding 20 years in age, were also kept in service past planned retirement dates due to the delays. To extend the operational lives of older aircraft, airlines increased heavy maintenance procedures, including <a href="Aircraft%20maintenance%20checks">D-check</a> teardowns and inspections for <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>, a recurring issue on aging 767s. The first 787s entered service with All Nippon Airways in October 2011, 42 months behind schedule.

In 2007, the 767 received a production boost when UPS and <a href="DHL%20Aviation">DHL Aviation</a> placed a combined 33 orders for the 767-300F. Renewed freighter interest led Boeing to consider enhanced versions of the 767-200 and 767-300F with increased gross weights, 767-400ER wing extensions, and 777 avionics. Net orders for the 767 declined from 24 in 2008 to just three in 2010. During the same period, operators upgraded aircraft already in service; in 2008, the first 767-300ER retrofitted with blended <a href="Wingtip%20device">winglets</a> from <a href="Aviation%20Partners%20Inc.">Aviation Partners Incorporated</a> debuted with American Airlines. The manufacturer-sanctioned winglets, at in height, improved fuel efficiency by an estimated 6.5 percent. Other carriers including All Nippon Airways and Delta Air Lines also ordered winglet kits.

On February 2, 2011, the 1,000th 767 rolled out, destined for All Nippon Airways. The aircraft was the 91st 767-300ER ordered by the Japanese carrier, and with its completion the 767 became the second wide-body airliner to reach the thousand-unit milestone after the 747. The 1,000th aircraft also marked the last model produced on the original 767 assembly line. Beginning with the 1,001st aircraft, production moved to another area in the Everett factory which occupied about half of the previous floor space. The new assembly line made room for 787 production and aimed to boost manufacturing efficiency by over twenty percent.

At the inauguration of its new assembly line, the 767's order backlog numbered approximately 50, only enough for production to last until 2013. Despite the reduced backlog, Boeing officials expressed optimism that additional orders would be forthcoming. On February 24, 2011, the USAF announced its selection of the KC-767 Advanced Tanker, an upgraded variant of the KC-767, for its <a href="KC-X">KC-X</a> fleet renewal program. The selection followed two rounds of tanker competition between Boeing and <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a> parent <a href="EADS">EADS</a>, and came eight years after the USAF's original 2003 announcement of its plan to lease KC-767s. The tanker order encompassed 179 aircraft and was expected to sustain 767 production past 2013.

In December 2011, <a href="FedEx%20Express">FedEx Express</a> announced a 767-300F order for 27 aircraft to replace its DC-10 freighters, citing the USAF tanker order and Boeing's decision to continue production as contributing factors. FedEx Express agreed to buy 19 more of the −300F variant in June 2012. In June 2015, FedEx said it was accelerating retirements of planes both to reflect demand and to modernize its fleet, recording charges of $276 million. On July 21, 2015 FedEx announced an order for 50 767-300F with options on another 50, the largest order for the type. With the announcement FedEx confirmed that it has firm orders for 106 of the freighters for delivery between 2018 and 2023. In February 2018, UPS announced that they were ordering 4 more 767-300Fs, increasing their total order to 63. Deliveries are scheduled from 2017 through 2022.

With its successor, the <a href="Boeing%20New%20Midsize%20Airplane">Boeing New Midsize Airplane</a>, planned for at least a 2025 introduction, and the 787 being much larger, Boeing could restart a passenger 767-300ER production to bridge the gap. A demand for 50 to 60 aircraft could have to be satisfied. Having to replace its 40 767s, <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> requested a price quote for other widebodies. In November 2017, Boeing CEO <a href="Dennis%20Muilenburg">Dennis Muilenburg</a> cited interest beyond military and freighter uses. Boeing Commercial Airplanes VP of marketing <a href="Randy%20Tinseth">Randy Tinseth</a> stated in early 2018 that the company did not intend to resume passenger variant production.

In its first quarter of 2018 <a href="earnings">earnings</a> report, Boeing plan to increase its production from 2.5 to 3 monthly beginning in January 2020 due to increased demand in the <a href="cargo%20aircraft">cargo</a> market, as FedEx had 56 on order, UPS has four, and an unidentified customer has three on order. This rate could rise to 3.5 per month in July 2020 and 4 per month in January 2021, then would come down to 3 per month in January 2025 and 2 per month in July.

The 767 is a low-wing <a href="Cantilever%20wing">cantilever monoplane</a> with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder. The wings are swept at 31.5 degrees and optimized for a cruising speed of <a href="Mach%20number">Mach</a> 0.8 (). Each wing features a <a href="supercritical%20airfoil">supercritical airfoil</a> cross-section and is equipped with six-panel <a href="leading%20edge%20slat">leading edge slat</a>s, single- and double-slotted <a href="Flap%20%28aircraft%29">flaps</a>, inboard and outboard <a href="aileron">aileron</a>s, and six <a href="Spoiler%20%28aeronautics%29">spoilers</a>. The <a href="airframe">airframe</a> further incorporates <a href="Carbon-fiber-reinforced%20polymer">Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer</a> <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a> wing surfaces, <a href="Kevlar">Kevlar</a> <a href="Aircraft%20fairing">fairings</a> and access panels, plus improved <a href="aluminium%20alloy">aluminum alloys</a>, which together reduce overall weight by versus preceding aircraft.

To distribute the aircraft's weight on the ground, the 767 has a retractable <a href="tricycle%20landing%20gear">tricycle landing gear</a> with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear. The original wing and gear design accommodated the stretched 767-300 without major changes. The 767-400ER features a larger, more widely spaced main gear with 777 wheels, tires, and brakes. To prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff, 767-300 and 767-400ER models are fitted with a retractable <a href="tailstrike">tailskid</a>. The 767 has left-side exit doors near the front and rear of the aircraft.

In addition to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 uses the same <a href="auxiliary%20power%20unit">auxiliary power unit</a>, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common <a href="type%20rating">type rating</a> to operate the 757 and share the same <a href="seniority">seniority</a> roster with pilots of either aircraft.

The original 767 flight deck uses six <a href="Rockwell%20Collins">Rockwell Collins</a> CRT screens to display <a href="Electronic%20flight%20instrument%20system">Electronic flight instrument system</a> (EFIS) and <a href="Electronic%20flight%20instrument%20system%23Engine%20indications%20and%20crew%20alerting%20system%20%28EICAS%29%20/%20electronic%20centralized%20aircraft%20monitoring%20%28ECAM%29">engine indication and crew alerting system</a> (EICAS) information, allowing pilots to handle monitoring tasks previously performed by the flight engineer. The CRTs replace conventional <a href="electromechanics">electromechanical</a> instruments found on earlier aircraft. An enhanced flight management system, improved over versions used on early 747s, automates navigation and other functions, while an <a href="Autoland">automatic landing</a> system facilitates <a href="Instrument%20landing%20system">CAT IIIb</a> instrument landings in low visibility situations. The 767 became the first aircraft to receive CAT IIIb certification from the FAA for landings with minimum visibility in 1984. On the 767-400ER, the cockpit layout is simplified further with six Rockwell Collins <a href="liquid%20crystal%20display">liquid crystal display</a> (LCD) screens, and adapted for similarities with the 777 and the <a href="Boeing%20737%20Next%20Generation">Next Generation 737</a>. To retain operational <a href="Fleet%20commonality">commonality</a>, the LCD screens can be programmed to display information in the same manner as earlier 767s. In 2012, Boeing and Rockwell Collins launched a further 787-based cockpit upgrade for the 767, featuring three landscape-format LCD screens that can display two windows each.

The 767 is equipped with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A <a href="ram%20air%20turbine">ram air turbine</a> provides power for basic controls in the event of an emergency. An early form of <a href="fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a> is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.

The 767 features a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in <a href="business%20class">business class</a> and seven across in <a href="economy%20class">economy</a>. The standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87 percent of all seats at a window or aisle. As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats need to be filled, and each passenger is no more than one seat from the aisle. It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration, but this is less common.

The 767 interior introduced larger <a href="Airliner%23Overhead%20bins">overhead bins</a> and more lavatories per passenger than previous aircraft. The bins are wider to accommodate <a href="garment%20bag">garment bag</a>s without folding, and strengthened for heavier carry-on items. A single, large <a href="Galley%20%28kitchen%29">galley</a> is installed near the aft doors, allowing for more efficient meal service and simpler ground resupply. Passenger and service doors are an overhead <a href="Plug%20door">plug</a> type, which retract upwards, and commonly used doors can be equipped with an <a href="electric%20motor">electric-assist</a> system.

In 2000, a 777-style interior, known as the Boeing Signature Interior, debuted on the 767-400ER. Subsequently, adopted for all new-build 767s, the Signature Interior features even larger overhead bins, indirect lighting, and sculpted, curved panels. The 767-400ER also received larger windows derived from the 777. Older 767s can be retrofitted with the Signature Interior. Some operators have adopted a simpler modification known as the Enhanced Interior, featuring curved ceiling panels and indirect lighting with minimal modification of cabin architecture, as well as aftermarket modifications such as the NuLook 767 package by Heath Tecna.

The 767 has been produced in three fuselage lengths. These debuted in progressively larger form as the 767-200, 767-300, and 767-400ER. Longer-range variants include the 767-200ER and 767-300ER, while cargo models include the 767-300F, a production freighter, and conversions of passenger 767-200 and 767-300 models.

When referring to different variants, Boeing and airlines often collapse the model number (767) and the variant designator (e.g. –200 or –300) into a truncated form (e.g. "762" or "763"). Subsequent to the capacity number, designations may append the range identifier. The <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) aircraft type designator system uses a similar numbering scheme, but adds a preceding manufacturer letter; all variants based on the 767-200 and 767-300 are classified under the codes "B762" and "B763"; the 767-400ER receives the designation of "B764".

The 767-200 was the original model and entered service with <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> in 1982. The type has been used primarily by <a href="Mainline%20%28flight%29">mainline</a> U.S. carriers for domestic routes between major hub centers such as Los Angeles to Washington. The 767-200 was the first aircraft to be used on transatlantic <a href="ETOPS">ETOPS</a> flights, beginning with TWA on February 1, 1985 under 90-minute diversion rules. Deliveries for the variant totaled 128 aircraft. There were 52 passenger and freighter conversions of the model in commercial service . The type's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310. The 767-200 variant was the only varaint in the series to use <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT9D">Pratt & Whitney JT9D</a> engines, as all other models used the newer <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW4000">Pratt & Whitney PW4000</a> engines.

The 767-200 was produced until 1987 when production switched to the extended-range 767-200ER. Some early 767-200s were subsequently upgraded to extended-range specification. In 1998, Boeing began offering 767-200 conversions to 767-200SF (Special Freighter) specification for cargo use, and <a href="Israel%20Aerospace%20Industries">Israel Aerospace Industries</a> has been licensed to perform cargo conversions since 2005. The conversion process entails the installation of a side cargo door, strengthened main deck floor, and added freight monitoring and safety equipment. The 767-200SF was positioned as a replacement for <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a> freighters.

A commercial freighter version of the Boeing 767-200 with wings from the -300 series and an updated flightdeck was first flown on 29 December 2014. A military tanker variant of the Boeing 767-2C is being developed for the USAF as the KC-46. Boeing is building two aircraft as commercial freighters which will be used to obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification, a further two Boeing 767-2Cs will be modified as military tankers. , Boeing does not have customers for the freighter.

The 767-200ER was the first extended-range model and entered service with <a href="El%20Al">El Al</a> in 1984. The type's increased range is due to an additional center fuel tank and a higher <a href="maximum%20takeoff%20weight">maximum takeoff weight</a> (MTOW) of up to . The type was originally offered with the same engines as the 767-200, while more powerful <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW4000">Pratt & Whitney PW4000</a> and <a href="General%20Electric%20CF6">General Electric CF6</a> engines later became available. The 767-200ER was the first 767 to complete a non-stop <a href="Transatlantic%20flight">transatlantic</a> journey, and broke the flying distance record for a twinjet airliner on April 17, 1988 with an <a href="Air%20Mauritius">Air Mauritius</a> flight from Halifax, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> to Port Louis, <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, covering . The 767-200ER has been acquired by international operators seeking smaller wide-body aircraft for long-haul routes such as New York to Beijing. Deliveries of the type totaled 121 with no unfilled orders. As of July 2018, 21 examples of passenger and freighter conversion versions were in airline service. The type's main competitors of the time included the <a href="Airbus%20A300-600">Airbus A300-600</a>R and the <a href="Airbus%20A310-300">A310-300</a>.

The 767-300, the first stretched version of the aircraft, entered service with <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a> in 1986. The type features a fuselage extension over the 767-200, achieved by additional sections inserted before and after the wings, for an overall length of . Reflecting the growth potential built into the original 767 design, the wings, engines, and most systems were largely unchanged on the 767-300. An optional mid-cabin exit door is positioned ahead of the wings on the left, while more powerful Pratt & Whitney PW4000 and <a href="Rolls-Royce%20RB211">Rolls-Royce RB211</a> engines later became available. The 767-300's increased capacity has been used on high-density routes within Asia and Europe. The 767-300 was produced from 1986 until 2000. Deliveries for the type totaled 104 aircraft with no unfilled orders remaining. As of July 2018, 34 of the variant were in airline service. The type's main competitor was the Airbus A300.

The 767-300ER, the extended-range version of the 767-300, entered service with American Airlines in 1988. The type's increased range was made possible by greater fuel tankage and a higher MTOW of . Design improvements allowed the available MTOW to increase to by 1993. Power is provided by Pratt & Whitney PW4000, General Electric CF6, or Rolls-Royce RB211 engines. the 767-300ER comes in three exit configurations: the baseline configuration has four main cabin doors and four over-wing window exits, the second configuration has six main cabin doors and two over-wing window exits; and the third configuration has six main cabin doors, as well as two smaller doors that are located behind the wings. Typical routes for the type include <a href="Los%20Angeles%20International%20Airport">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="Frankfurt%20Airport">Frankfurt</a>. The combination of increased capacity and range offered by the 767-300ER has been particularly attractive to both new and existing 767 operators. It is the most successful version of the aircraft, with more orders placed than all other variants combined. , 767-300ER deliveries stand at 583 with no unfilled orders. There were 376 examples in service . The type's main competitor is the <a href="Airbus%20A330-200">Airbus A330-200</a>.

At its 1990s peak, a new 767-300ER was valued at $85 million, dipping to around $12 million in 2018 for a 1996 build.

The 767-300F, the production freighter version of the 767-300ER, entered service with UPS Airlines in 1995. The 767-300F can hold up to 24 standard <a href="pallet">pallet</a>s on its main deck and up to 30 LD2 <a href="unit%20load%20device">unit load device</a>s on the lower deck, with a total cargo volume of . The freighter has a main deck cargo door and crew exit, while the lower deck features two port-side cargo doors and one starboard cargo door. A general market version with onboard freight-handling systems, <a href="refrigeration">refrigeration</a> capability, and crew facilities was delivered to <a href="Asiana%20Airlines">Asiana Airlines</a> on August 23, 1996. , 767-300F deliveries stand at 144 with 68 unfilled orders. Airlines operated 222 examples of the freighter variant and freighter conversions in July 2018.

In June 2008, All Nippon Airways took delivery of the first 767-300BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter), a modified passenger-to-freighter model. The conversion work was performed in Singapore by <a href="ST%20Aerospace%23Subsidiaries/Divisions">ST Aerospace Services</a>, the first supplier to offer a 767-300BCF program, and involved the addition of a main deck cargo door, strengthened main deck floor, and additional freight monitoring and safety equipment. Since then, Boeing, Israel Aerospace Industries, and Wagner Aeronautical have also offered passenger-to-freighter conversion programs for 767-300 series aircraft.

The 767-400ER, the first Boeing wide-body jet resulting from two fuselage stretches, entered service with Continental Airlines in 2000. The type features a stretch over the 767-300, for a total length of . The wingspan is also increased by through the addition of <a href="raked%20wingtips">raked wingtips</a>. The exit configuration uses six main cabin doors and two smaller exit doors behind the wings, similar to certain 767-300ER's. Other differences include an updated cockpit, redesigned landing gear, and 777-style Signature Interior. Power is provided by uprated Pratt & Whitney PW4000 or General Electric CF6 engines.

The FAA granted approval for the 767-400ER to operate 180-minute <a href="ETOPS">ETOPS</a> flights before it entered service. Because its fuel capacity was not increased over preceding models, the 767-400ER has a range of , less than previous extended-range 767s. This is roughly the distance from Shenzhen to Seattle. No 767-400 version was developed, while a longer-range version, the 767-400ERX, was offered for sale in 2000 before it was cancelled a year later, leaving the 767-400ER as the sole version of the largest 767. Boeing dropped the 767-400ER and the -200ER from its pricing list in 2014. A total of 37 aircraft were delivered to the variant's two airline customers, <a href="Continental%20Airlines">Continental Airlines</a> (now merged with <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a>) and <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>, with no unfilled orders. All 37 examples of the -400ER were in service in July 2018. One additional example was produced as a military testbed, and later sold as a VIP transport. The type's closest competitor is the Airbus A330-200.

Versions of the 767 serve in a number of military and government applications, with responsibilities ranging from airborne surveillance and refueling to cargo and VIP transport. Several military 767s have been derived from the 767-200ER, the longest-range version of the aircraft.

Boeing offered the 767-400ERX, a longer-range version of the largest 767 model, in 2000. Introduced concurrently with the <a href="Boeing%20747-8%23Background">747X</a>, the type was to be powered by the 747X's engines, the <a href="Engine%20Alliance%20GP7000">Engine Alliance GP7000</a> and the <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Trent">Rolls-Royce Trent 600</a>. An increased range of was specified. <a href="Kenya%20Airways">Kenya Airways</a> provisionally ordered three 767-400ERXs to supplement its 767 fleet, but after Boeing cancelled the type's development in 2001, switched the order to the 777-200ER.

The <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20E-10%20MC2A">Northrop Grumman E-10 MC2A</a> was to be a 767-400ER-based replacement for the USAF's 707-based E-3 Sentry AWACS, <a href="Northrop%20Grumman%20E-8%20Joint%20STARS">Northrop Grumman E-8 Joint STARS</a>, and <a href="Boeing%20RC-135">RC-135</a> <a href="SIGINT">SIGINT</a> aircraft. The E-10 MC2A would have included an all-new AWACS system, with a powerful <a href="active%20electronically%20scanned%20array">active electronically scanned array</a> (AESA) that was also capable of jamming enemy aircraft or missiles. One 767-400ER aircraft was produced as a testbed for systems integration, but the program was terminated in January 2009 and the prototype was sold to Bahrain as a VIP transport.

In July 2018, 742 aircraft were in airline service: 73 -200s, 632 -300 and 37 -400 with 65 -300F on order; the largest operators are <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> (77), <a href="FedEx%20Express">FedEx</a> (60; largest cargo operator), <a href="UPS%20Airlines">UPS Airlines</a> (59), <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> (51), <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a> (35), <a href="All%20Nippon%20Airways">All Nippon Airways</a> (34). The type's competitors included the Airbus A300 and A310.

The largest customers are Delta Air Lines with 117 orders, <a href="FedEx%20Express">FedEx Express</a> (119), All Nippon Airways (96), American Airlines (88) and United Airlines (82). Delta and United are the only customers of all -200, -300 and -400 passenger variants. In July 2015, FedEx placed a firm order for 50 Boeing 767 freighters with deliveries from 2018 to 2023.

Boeing 767 orders and deliveries (cumulative, by year): 



, the Boeing 767 has been in 46 <a href="Aviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents">aviation occurrences</a>, including 17 <a href="Hull%20loss">hull-loss</a> accidents. Seven fatal crashes, including three <a href="Aircraft%20hijacking">hijackings</a>, have resulted in a total of 854 occupant fatalities.

The 767's first incident was <a href="Gimli%20Glider">Air Canada Flight 143</a>, a 767-200, on July 23, 1983. The airplane ran out of fuel in-flight and had to glide with both engines out for almost to an emergency landing at <a href="Gimli%2C%20Manitoba">Gimli, Manitoba</a>, Canada. The pilots used the aircraft's <a href="ram%20air%20turbine">ram air turbine</a> to power the <a href="Hydraulics">hydraulic</a> systems for aerodynamic control. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries. This aircraft was nicknamed "Gimli Glider" after its landing site. The aircraft, registered C-GAUN, continued flying for <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a> until its retirement in January 2008.

The airliner's first fatal crash, <a href="Lauda%20Air%20Flight%20004">Lauda Air Flight 004</a>, occurred near Bangkok on May 26, 1991, following the in-flight deployment of the left engine <a href="Thrust%20reversal">thrust reverser</a> on a 767-300ER; none of the 223 aboard survived; as a result of this accident all 767 thrust reversers were deactivated until a redesign was implemented. Investigators determined that an electronically controlled valve, common to late-model Boeing aircraft, was to blame. A new locking device was installed on all affected jetliners, including 767s.

On October 31, 1999, <a href="EgyptAir%20Flight%20990">EgyptAir Flight 990</a>, a 767-300ER, crashed off <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a>, Massachusetts, in <a href="international%20waters">international waters</a> killing all 217 people on board. The United States <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a> (NTSB) concluded "not determined", but determined the probable cause to be due to a deliberate action by the first officer; Egypt disputed this conclusion. On April 15, 2002, <a href="Air%20China%20Flight%20129">Air China Flight 129</a>, a 767-200ER, <a href="controlled%20flight%20into%20terrain">crashed into a hill</a> amid inclement weather while trying to land at <a href="Gimhae%20International%20Airport">Gimhae International Airport</a> in Busan, South Korea. The crash resulted in the death of 129 of the 166 people on board, and the cause was attributed to <a href="pilot%20error">pilot error</a>.

The 767 has been involved in six hijackings, three resulting in loss of life, for a combined total of 282 occupant fatalities. On November 23, 1996, <a href="Ethiopian%20Airlines%20Flight%20961">Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961</a>, a 767-200ER, was hijacked and crash-landed in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> near the <a href="Comoro%20Islands">Comoro Islands</a> after running out of fuel, killing 125 out of the 175 persons on board; survivors have been rare among instances of land-based aircraft ditching on water. Two 767s were involved in the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> on the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973%E2%80%932001%29">World Trade Center</a> in 2001, resulting in the <a href="Collapse%20of%20the%20World%20Trade%20Center">collapse of its two main towers</a>. <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%2011">American Airlines Flight 11</a>, a 767-200ER, crashed into the North Tower, killing all 92 people on board, and <a href="United%20Airlines%20Flight%20175">United Airlines Flight 175</a>, a 767-200, crashed into the South Tower, with the death of all 65 on board. In addition, more than 2,600 people were killed in the towers or on the ground. A foiled <a href="2001%20shoe%20bomb%20attempt">2001 shoe bomb attempt</a> involving an American Airlines 767-300ER resulted in passengers being required to remove their shoes for scanning at U.S. security checkpoints.

On November 1, 2011, <a href="LOT%20Polish%20Airlines%20Flight%2016">LOT Polish Airlines Flight 16</a>, a 767-300ER, safely landed at <a href="Warsaw%20Chopin%20Airport">Warsaw Chopin Airport</a> in Warsaw, Poland after a mechanical failure of the landing gear forced an emergency landing with the landing gear up. There were no injuries, but the aircraft involved was damaged and subsequently written off. At the time of the incident, aviation analysts speculated that it may have been the first instance of a complete landing gear failure in the 767's service history. Subsequent investigation determined that while a damaged hose had disabled the aircraft's primary landing gear extension system, an otherwise functional backup system was inoperative due to an accidentally deactivated <a href="circuit%20breaker">circuit breaker</a>.

In January 2014, the U.S. <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> issued a directive that ordered inspections of the elevators on more than 400 767s beginning in March 2014; the focus was on <a href="fastener">fastener</a>s and other parts that can fail and cause the elevators to jam. The issue was first identified in 2000 and has been the subject of several Boeing service bulletins. The inspections and repairs are required to be completed within six years. The aircraft has also had multiple occurrences of "uncommanded escape slide inflation" during maintenance or operations, and during flight. In late 2015, the FAA issued a preliminary directive to address the issue.

On October 28, 2016, <a href="American%20Airlines%20Flight%20383%20%282016%29">American Airlines Flight 383</a>, a 767-300ER with 161 passengers and 9 crew members, aborted takeoff at Chicago O'Hare Airport following an <a href="Uncontained%20engine%20failure">uncontained failure</a> of the right GE CF6-80C2 engine.

Babe Ruth

George Herman "Babe" Ruth Jr. (February 6, 1895 – August 16, 1948) was an American professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> player whose career in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) spanned 22 seasons, from 1914 through 1935. Nicknamed "The Bambino" and "The Sultan of Swat", he began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a> for the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> for the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a>. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including career <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s (714), <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBIs) (2,213), <a href="bases%20on%20balls">bases on balls</a> (2,062), <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> (.690), and <a href="on-base%20plus%20slugging">on-base plus slugging</a> (OPS) (1.164); the latter two still stand . Ruth is regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20States">American culture</a> and is considered by many to be the greatest baseball player of all time. In 1936, Ruth was elected into the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> as one of its <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201936">"first five"</a> inaugural members.

At age 7, Ruth was sent to <a href="Cardinal%20Gibbons%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys</a>, a <a href="Reform%20school">reformatory</a> where he learned life lessons and baseball skills from Brother Matthias Boutlier of the <a href="Xaverian%20Brothers">Xaverian Brothers</a>, the school's disciplinarian and a capable baseball player. In 1914, Ruth was signed to play <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor-league</a> baseball for the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles%20%28minor%20league%29">Baltimore Orioles</a> but was soon sold to the Red Sox. By 1916, he had built a reputation as an outstanding pitcher who sometimes hit long home runs, a feat unusual for any player in the pre-1920 <a href="dead-ball%20era">dead-ball era</a>. Although Ruth twice <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">won</a> 23 games in a season as a pitcher and was a member of three <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> championship teams with the Red Sox, he wanted to play every day and was allowed to convert to an outfielder. With regular playing time, he broke the <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20progressive%20single-season%20home%20run%20leaders">MLB single-season home run record</a> in 1919.

After that season, Red Sox owner <a href="Harry%20Frazee">Harry Frazee</a> sold Ruth to the Yankees amid controversy. The trade fueled Boston's subsequent 86 year championship drought and popularized the "<a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Bambino">Curse of the Bambino</a>" superstition. In his 15 years with the Yankees, Ruth helped the team win seven <a href="List%20of%20American%20League%20pennant%20winners">American League (AL) pennants</a> and four World Series championships. His big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only drew fans to the ballpark and boosted the sport's popularity but also helped usher in baseball's <a href="live-ball%20era">live-ball era</a>, which evolved from a low-scoring game of strategy to a sport where the home run was a major factor. As part of the Yankees' vaunted "<a href="Murderers%27%20Row">Murderers' Row</a>" lineup of 1927, Ruth hit 60 home runs, which extended his MLB single-season record by a single home run. Ruth's last season with the Yankees was 1934; he retired from the game the following year, after a short stint with the <a href="Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29">Boston Braves</a>. During his career, Ruth led the AL in home runs during a season 12 times.

Ruth's legendary power and charismatic personality made him a larger-than-life figure during the <a href="Roaring%20Twenties">Roaring Twenties</a>. During his career, he was the target of intense press and public attention for his baseball exploits and off-field penchants for drinking and womanizing. His often reckless lifestyle was tempered by his willingness to do good by visiting children at hospitals and orphanages. After his retirement as a player, he was denied the opportunity to manage a major league club, most likely due to poor behavior during parts of his playing career. In his final years, Ruth made many public appearances, especially in support of American efforts in World War II. In 1946, he became ill with <a href="esophageal%20cancer">esophageal cancer</a> and died from it two years later. Ruth remains a part of American culture and in 2018, President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> posthumously awarded him the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>.

George Herman Ruth Jr. was born in 1895 at 216 Emory Street in the <a href="Pigtown%2C%20Baltimore">Pigtown</a> section of <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, Maryland. Ruth's parents, Katherine (Schamberger) and George Herman Ruth Sr., were both of <a href="German%20Americans">German ancestry</a>. According to the 1880 census, his parents were born in Maryland. His paternal grandparents were from Prussia and Hanover. Ruth Sr. worked a series of jobs that included <a href="lightning%20rod">lightning rod</a> salesman and <a href="streetcar">streetcar</a> operator. The elder Ruth then became a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon business on Frederick Street. George Ruth Jr. was born in the house of his maternal grandfather, Pius Schamberger, a German immigrant and trade unionist. Only one of young George's seven siblings, his younger sister Mamie, survived infancy.

Many details of Ruth's childhood are unknown, including the date of his parents' marriage. As a child, Ruth spoke <a href="German%20language">German</a>. When young George was a toddler, the family moved to 339 South Woodyear Street, not far from the rail yards; by the time the boy was 6, his father had a saloon with an upstairs apartment at 426 West Camden Street. Details are equally scanty about why young George was sent at the age of 7 to <a href="Cardinal%20Gibbons%20School%20%28Baltimore%2C%20Maryland%29">St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys</a>, a reformatory and orphanage. As an adult, Babe Ruth reminisced that as a youth he had been running the streets and rarely attending school, as well was drinking beer when his father was not looking. Some accounts say that following a violent incident at his father's saloon, the city authorities decided that this environment was unsuitable for a small child. George, Jr. entered St. Mary's on June 13, 1902. He was recorded as "incorrigible" and spent much of the next 12 years there.
Although St. Mary's boys received an education, students were also expected to learn work skills and help operate the school, particularly once the boys turned 12. Ruth became a shirtmaker and was also proficient as a carpenter. He would adjust his own shirt collars, rather than having a tailor do so, even during his well-paid baseball career. The boys, aged 5 to 21, did most work around the facility, from cooking to shoemaking, and renovated St. Mary's in 1912. The food was simple, and the <a href="Xaverian%20Brothers">Xaverian Brothers</a> who ran the school insisted on strict discipline; corporal punishment was common. Ruth's nickname there was "Niggerlips", as he had large facial features and was darker than most boys at the all-white reformatory.

Ruth was sometimes allowed to rejoin his family or was placed at St. James's Home, a supervised residence with work in the community, but he was always returned to St. Mary's. He was rarely visited by his family; his mother died when he was 12 and by some accounts, he was permitted to leave St. Mary's only to attend the funeral. How Ruth came to play baseball there is uncertain: according to one account, his placement at St. Mary's was due in part to repeatedly breaking Baltimore's windows with long <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a> while playing <a href="stickball">street ball</a>; by another, he was told to join a team on his first day at St. Mary's by the school's athletic director, Brother Herman, becoming a <a href="catcher">catcher</a> even though left-handers rarely play that position. During his time there he also played <a href="third%20base">third base</a> and <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a>, again unusual for a left-hander, and was forced to wear mitts and gloves made for right-handers. He was encouraged in his pursuits by the school's Prefect of Discipline, Brother Matthias Boutlier, a native of <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. A large man, Brother Matthias was greatly respected by the boys both for his strength and for his fairness. For the rest of his life, Ruth would praise Brother Matthias, and his running and hitting styles closely resembled his teacher's. Ruth stated, "I think I was born as a hitter the first day I ever saw him hit a baseball." The older man became a mentor and role model to George; biographer <a href="Robert%20W.%20Creamer">Robert W. Creamer</a> commented on the closeness between the two:

The school's influence remained with Ruth in other ways. He was a lifelong <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> who would sometimes attend Mass after carousing all night, and he became a well-known member of the <a href="Knights%20of%20Columbus">Knights of Columbus</a>. He would visit orphanages, schools, and hospitals throughout his life, often avoiding publicity. He was generous to St. Mary's as he became famous and rich, donating money and his presence at fundraisers, and spending $5,000 to buy Brother Matthias a Cadillac in 1926—subsequently replacing it when it was destroyed in an accident. Nevertheless, his biographer Leigh Montville suggests that many of the off-the-field excesses of Ruth's career were driven by the deprivations of his time at St. Mary's.

Most of the boys at St. Mary's played baseball in organized leagues at different levels of proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions at one time or another (including <a href="infield">infield</a> positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a <a href="pitcher">pitcher</a>. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn from the community. He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s.

In early 1914, Ruth signed a professional baseball contract with <a href="Jack%20Dunn%20%28baseball%29">Jack Dunn</a>, who owned and managed the <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor-league</a> <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles%20%28minor%20league%29">Baltimore Orioles</a>, an <a href="International%20League">International League</a> team. The circumstances of Ruth's signing are not known with certainty; historical fact is obscured by stories that cannot all be true. By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, <a href="Mount%20St.%20Mary%27s%20University">Mount St. Mary's College</a>. Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to return in time to be punished, and then pitching St. Mary's to victory as Dunn watched. Others have <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> pitcher <a href="Joe%20Engel">Joe Engel</a>, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, then told Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was signed. According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there were legal difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21.
The train journey to spring training in <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Fayetteville, North Carolina</a>, in early March was likely Ruth's first outside the Baltimore area. The rookie ballplayer was the subject of various pranks by the veterans, who were probably also the source of his famous nickname. There are various accounts of how Ruth came to be called "Babe," but most center on his being referred to as "Dunnie's babe" or a variant. "Babe" was, at that time, a common nickname in baseball, with perhaps the most famous to that point being <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> pitcher and <a href="1909%20World%20Series">1909 World Series</a> hero <a href="Babe%20Adams">Babe Adams</a>, who appeared younger than is actual age.

Ruth made his first appearance as a professional ballplayer in an inter-squad game on March 7, 1914. He played shortstop and pitched the last two <a href="inning">inning</a>s of a 15–9 victory. In his second at-bat, Ruth hit a long home run to right field; the blast was locally reported to be longer than a legendary shot hit by <a href="Jim%20Thorpe">Jim Thorpe</a> in Fayetteville. Ruth made his first appearance against a team in <a href="organized%20baseball">organized baseball</a> in an exhibition game versus the major-league <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a>. Ruth pitched the middle three innings and gave up two runs in the fourth, but then settled down and pitched a scoreless fifth and sixth innings. In a game against the Phillies the following afternoon, Ruth entered during the sixth inning and did not allow a run the rest of the way. The Orioles scored seven runs in the bottom of the eighth inning to overcome a 6–0 deficit, and Ruth was the winning pitcher.

Once the regular season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also dangerous at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A third major league, the <a href="Federal%20League">Federal League</a>, had begun play, and the local franchise, the <a href="Baltimore%20Terrapins">Baltimore Terrapins</a>, restored that city to the major leagues for the first time since 1902. Few fans visited <a href="Oriole%20Park">Oriole Park</a>, where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.

The competition from the Terrapins caused Dunn to sustain large losses. Although by late June the Orioles were in first place, having won over two-thirds of their games, the paid attendance dropped as low as 150. Dunn explored a possible move by the Orioles to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>, as well as the sale of a minority interest in the club. These possibilities fell through, leaving Dunn with little choice other than to sell his best players to major league teams to raise money. He offered Ruth to the reigning <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> champions, <a href="Connie%20Mack">Connie Mack</a>'s <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>, but Mack had his own financial problems. The <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> and <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> expressed interest in Ruth, but Dunn sold his contract, along with those of pitchers <a href="Ernie%20Shore">Ernie Shore</a> and <a href="Ben%20Egan">Ben Egan</a>, to the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> of the <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) on July 4. The sale price was announced as $25,000 but other reports lower the amount to half that, or possibly $8,500 plus the cancellation of a $3,000 loan. Ruth remained with the Orioles for several days while the Red Sox completed a road trip, and reported to the team in Boston on July 11.

On July 11, 1914, Ruth arrived in Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later told the story of how that morning he had met Helen Woodford, who was the girl that would be his first wife. She was a 16-year-old waitress at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of when he began to woo his first wife, he won his first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4–3, over the <a href="Cleveland%20Naps">Cleveland Naps</a>. His catcher was <a href="Bill%20Carrigan">Bill Carrigan</a>, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a <a href="Starting%20pitcher">start</a> by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. In his major league debut as a batter, Ruth went <a href="batting%20average">0-for-2</a> against left-hander <a href="Willie%20Mitchell%20%28baseball%29">Willie Mitchell</a>, <a href="Strikeout">striking out</a> in his first <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>, before being removed for a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hitter</a> in the seventh inning. Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the <a href="Boston%20Braves%20%28baseball%29">Braves</a>, begin <a href="1914%20Boston%20Braves%20season">a legendary comeback</a> that would take them from last place on the Fourth of July to the <a href="1914%20World%20Series">1914 World Series</a> championship.

Egan was traded to Cleveland after two weeks on the Boston roster. During his time as a Red Sox, he kept an eye on the inexperienced Ruth, much as Dunn had in Baltimore. When he was traded, no one took his place as supervisor. Ruth's new teammates considered him brash, and would have preferred him, as a rookie, to remain quiet and inconspicuous. When Ruth insisted on taking batting practice despite being both a rookie who did not play regularly, and a pitcher, he arrived to find his bats sawn in half. His teammates nicknamed him "the Big Baboon", a name the swarthy Ruth, who had disliked the nickname "Niggerlips" at St. Mary's, detested. Ruth had received a raise on promotion to the major leagues, and quickly acquired tastes for fine food, liquor, and women, among other temptations.

Manager Carrigan allowed Ruth to pitch two <a href="exhibition%20game">exhibition game</a>s in mid-August. Although Ruth won both against minor-league competition, he was not restored to the pitching rotation. It is uncertain why Carrigan did not give Ruth additional opportunities to pitch. There are legends—filmed for the screen in "<a href="The%20Babe%20Ruth%20Story">The Babe Ruth Story</a>" (1948)—that the young pitcher had a habit of signaling his intent to throw a <a href="curveball">curveball</a> by sticking out his tongue slightly, and that he was easy to hit until this changed. Creamer pointed out that it is common for inexperienced pitchers to display such habits, and the need to break Ruth of his would not constitute a reason to not use him at all. The biographer suggested that Carrigan was unwilling to use Ruth due to poor behavior by the rookie.
On July 30, 1914, Boston owner <a href="Joseph%20Lannin">Joseph Lannin</a> had purchased the minor-league <a href="Providence%20Grays%20%28minor%20league%29">Providence Grays</a>, members of the International League. The Providence team had been owned by several people associated with the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>, including star hitter <a href="Ty%20Cobb">Ty Cobb</a>, and as part of the transaction, a Providence pitcher was sent to the Tigers. To soothe Providence fans upset at losing a star, Lannin announced that the Red Sox would soon send a replacement to the Grays. This was intended to be Ruth, but his departure for Providence was delayed when Cincinnati Reds owner <a href="Garry%20Herrmann">Garry Herrmann</a> <a href="Waivers%20%28MLB%29">claimed him off waivers</a>. After Lannin wrote to Herrmann explaining that the Red Sox wanted Ruth in Providence so he could develop as a player, and would not release him to a major league club, Herrmann allowed Ruth to be sent to the minors. Carrigan later stated that Ruth was not sent down to Providence to make him a better player, but to help the Grays win the International League <a href="pennant%20%28sports%29">pennant</a> (league championship).

Ruth joined the Grays on August 18, 1914. After Dunn's deals, the Baltimore Orioles managed to hold on to first place until August 15, after which they continued to fade, leaving the pennant race between Providence and <a href="Rochester%20Red%20Wings">Rochester</a>. Ruth was deeply impressed by Providence manager <a href="Bill%20Donovan">"Wild Bill" Donovan</a>, previously a star pitcher with a 25–4 <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">win–loss record</a> for Detroit in 1907; in later years, he credited Donovan with teaching him much about pitching. Ruth was often called upon to pitch, in one stretch starting (and winning) four games in eight days. On September 5 at <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Park">Maple Leaf Park</a> in Toronto, Ruth pitched a one-hit 9–0 victory, and hit his first professional home run, his only one as a minor leaguer, off <a href="Ellis%20Johnson%20%28baseball%29">Ellis Johnson</a>. Recalled to Boston after Providence finished the season in first place, he pitched and won a game for the Red Sox against the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> on October 2, getting his first major league hit, a <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a>. Ruth finished the season with a record of 2–1 as a major leaguer and 23–8 in the International League (for Baltimore and Providence). Once the season concluded, Ruth married Helen in <a href="Ellicott%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ellicott City, Maryland</a>. Creamer speculated that they did not marry in Baltimore, where the newlyweds boarded with George Ruth Sr., to avoid possible interference from those at St. Mary's—both bride and groom were not yet of age and Ruth remained on parole from that institution until his 21st birthday.

In March 1915, Ruth reported to <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a> for his first major league <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a>. Despite a relatively successful first season, he was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who already had two stellar left-handed pitchers: the established stars <a href="Dutch%20Leonard%20%28left-handed%20pitcher%29">Dutch Leonard</a>, who had broken the record for the lowest <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA) in a single season; and <a href="Ray%20Collins%20%28baseball%29">Ray Collins</a>, a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914. Ruth was ineffective in his first start, taking the loss in the third game of the season. Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave Ruth another chance, and after some good <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief</a> appearances, Carrigan allowed Ruth another start, and he won a rain-shortened seven inning game. Ten days later, the manager had him start against the New York Yankees at the <a href="Polo%20Grounds">Polo Grounds</a>. Ruth took a 3–2 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4–3 in 13 innings. Ruth, hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck in <a href="right%20fielder">right field</a> off of <a href="Jack%20Warhop">Jack Warhop</a>. At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd. The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher to give up a home run to Babe Ruth.
Carrigan was sufficiently impressed by Ruth's pitching to give him a spot in the starting rotation. Ruth finished the 1915 season 18–8 as a pitcher; as a hitter, he batted .315 and had four home runs. The Red Sox won the <a href="List%20of%20American%20League%20pennant%20winners">AL pennant</a>, but with the pitching staff healthy, Ruth was not called upon to pitch in the <a href="1915%20World%20Series">1915 World Series</a> against the Philadelphia Phillies. Boston won in five games; Ruth was used as a pinch hitter in Game Five, but <a href="Ground%20out%20%28baseball%29">grounded out</a> against Phillies ace <a href="Grover%20Cleveland%20Alexander">Grover Cleveland Alexander</a>. Despite his success as a pitcher, Ruth was acquiring a reputation for long home runs; at <a href="Sportsman%27s%20Park">Sportsman's Park</a> against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Browns">St. Louis Browns</a>, a Ruth hit soared over Grand Avenue, breaking the window of a <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> dealership.

In 1916, there was attention focused on Ruth for his pitching, as he engaged in repeated pitching duels with the ace of the Washington Senators, <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a>. The two met five times during the season, with Ruth winning four and Johnson one (Ruth had a <a href="Win%E2%80%93loss%20record%20%28pitching%29">no decision</a> in Johnson's victory). Two of Ruth's victories were by the score of 1–0, one in a 13-inning game. Of the 1–0 <a href="Shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutout</a> decided without extra innings, AL President <a href="Ban%20Johnson">Ban Johnson</a> stated, "That was one of the best ball games I have ever seen." For the season, Ruth went 23–12, with a 1.75 ERA and nine shutouts, both of which led the league. Ruth's nine shutouts in 1916 set a league record for left-handers that would remain unmatched until <a href="Ron%20Guidry">Ron Guidry</a> tied it in 1978. The Red Sox won the pennant and <a href="1916%20World%20Series">World Series</a> again, this time defeating the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Robins</a> (as the Dodgers were then known) in five games. Ruth started and won Game 2, 2–1, in 14 innings. Until another game of that length was played in <a href="2005%20World%20Series">2005</a>, this was the longest World Series game, and Ruth's pitching performance is still the longest postseason <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a> victory.

Carrigan retired as player and manager after 1916, returning to his native Maine to be a businessman. Ruth, who played under four managers who are in the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a>, always maintained that Carrigan, who is not enshrined there, was the best skipper he ever played for. There were other changes in the Red Sox organization that offseason, as Lannin sold the team to a three-man group headed by New York theatrical promoter <a href="Harry%20Frazee">Harry Frazee</a>. <a href="Jack%20Barry%20%28baseball%29">Jack Barry</a> was hired by Frazee as manager.

Ruth went 24–13 with a 2.01 ERA and six shutouts in 1917, but the Sox finished in second place in the league, nine <a href="games%20behind">games behind</a> the <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> in the standings. On June 23 at Washington, Ruth made a memorable pitching start. When home plate umpire '<a href="Brick%20Owens">Brick' Owens</a> called the first four pitches as balls, Ruth threw a punch at him, and was ejected from the game and later suspended for ten days and fined $100. Ernie Shore was called in to relieve Ruth, and was allowed eight warm-up pitches. The runner who had reached base on the <a href="base%20on%20balls">walk</a> was <a href="caught%20stealing">caught stealing</a>, and Shore retired all 26 batters he faced to win the game. Shore's feat was listed as a <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a> for many years; in 1991, <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>'s (MLB) Committee on Statistical Accuracy caused it to be listed as a combined <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a>. In 1917, Ruth was little-used as a batter, other than for his <a href="plate%20appearance">plate appearance</a>s while pitching, and hit .325 with two home runs.
The entry of the United States into <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> occurred at the start of the season and overshadowed the sport. Conscription was introduced in September 1917, and most baseball players in the big leagues were of draft age. This included Barry, who was a player-manager, and who joined the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Reserve">Naval Reserve</a> in an attempt to avoid the draft, only to be called up after the 1917 season. Frazee hired International League President <a href="Ed%20Barrow">Ed Barrow</a> as Red Sox manager. Barrow had spent the previous 30 years in a variety of baseball jobs, though he never played the game professionally. With the major leagues shorthanded due to the war, Barrow had many holes in the Red Sox lineup to fill.

Ruth also noticed these vacancies in the lineup; he was dissatisfied in the role of a pitcher who appeared every four or five days and wanted to play every day at another position. Barrow used Ruth at <a href="first%20baseman">first base</a> and in the <a href="outfield">outfield</a> during the exhibition season, but he restricted him to pitching as the team moved towards Boston and the season opener. At the time, Ruth was possibly the best left-handed pitcher in baseball, and allowing him to play another position was an experiment that could have backfired.

Inexperienced as a manager, Barrow had player <a href="Harry%20Hooper">Harry Hooper</a> advise him on baseball game strategy. Hooper urged his manager to allow Ruth to play another position when he was not pitching, arguing to Barrow, who had invested in the club, that the crowds were larger on days when Ruth played, as they were attracted by his hitting. Barrow gave in early in May; Ruth promptly hit home runs in four consecutive games (one an exhibition), the last off of Walter Johnson. For the first time in his career (disregarding pinch-hitting appearances), Ruth was assigned a place in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28baseball%29">batting order</a> higher than ninth.

Although Barrow predicted that Ruth would beg to return to pitching the first time he experienced a batting slump, that did not occur. Barrow used Ruth primarily as an outfielder in the war-shortened 1918 season. Ruth hit .300, with 11 home runs, enough to secure him a share of the <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20annual%20home%20run%20leaders">major league home run title</a> with <a href="Tilly%20Walker">Tilly Walker</a> of the Philadelphia Athletics. He was still occasionally used as a pitcher, and had a 13–7 record with a 2.22 ERA.

In 1918, the Red Sox won their third pennant in four years and faced the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> in the <a href="1918%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, which began on September 5, the earliest date in history. The season had been shortened because the government had ruled that baseball players who were eligible for the military would have to be inducted or work in critical war industries, such as armaments plants. Ruth pitched and won Game One for the Red Sox, a 1–0 shutout. Before Game Four, Ruth injured his left hand in a fight; he pitched anyway. He gave up seven hits and six walks, but was helped by outstanding fielding behind him and by his own batting efforts, as a fourth-inning <a href="Triple%20%28baseball%29">triple</a> by Ruth gave his team a 2–0 lead. The Cubs tied the game in the eighth inning, but the Red Sox scored to take a 3–2 lead again in the bottom of that inning. After Ruth gave up a hit and a walk to start the ninth inning, he was relieved on the mound by <a href="Bullet%20Joe%20Bush">Joe Bush</a>. To keep Ruth and his bat in the game, he was sent to play <a href="left%20fielder">left field</a>. Bush retired the side to give Ruth his second win of the Series, and the third and last World Series pitching victory of his career, against no defeats, in three pitching appearances. Ruth's effort gave his team a three-games-to-one lead, and two days later the Red Sox won their third Series in four years, four-games-to-two. Before allowing the Cubs to score in Game Four, Ruth pitched consecutive scoreless innings, a record for the World Series that stood for more than 40 years until 1961, broken by <a href="Whitey%20Ford">Whitey Ford</a> after Ruth's death. Ruth was prouder of that record than he was of any of his batting feats.
With the World Series over, Ruth gained exemption from the war draft by accepting a nominal position with a Pennsylvania steel mill. Many industrial establishments took pride in their baseball teams and sought to hire major leaguers. The end of the war in November set Ruth free to play baseball without such contrivances.

During the 1919 season, Ruth was used as a pitcher in only 17 of his 130 games and compiled an 8–5 record. Barrow used him as a pitcher mostly in the early part of the season, when the Red Sox manager still had hopes of a second consecutive pennant. By late June, the Red Sox were clearly out of the race, and Barrow had no objection to Ruth concentrating on his hitting, if only because it drew people to the ballpark. Ruth had hit a home run against the Yankees on Opening Day, and another during a month-long batting slump that soon followed. Relieved of his pitching duties, Ruth began an unprecedented spell of slugging home runs, which gave him widespread public and press attention. Even his failures were seen as majestic—one sportswriter noted, "When Ruth misses a swipe at the ball, the stands quiver".

Two home runs by Ruth on July 5, and one in each of two consecutive games a week later, raised his season total to 11, tying his career best from 1918. The first record to fall was the AL single-season mark of 16, set by <a href="Socks%20Seybold">Ralph "Socks" Seybold</a> in 1902. Ruth matched that on July 29, then pulled ahead toward the <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20progressive%20single-season%20home%20run%20leaders">major league record</a> of 24, set by <a href="Buck%20Freeman">Buck Freeman</a> in 1899. Ruth reached this on September 8, by which time, writers had discovered that <a href="Ned%20Williamson">Ned Williamson</a> of the 1884 <a href="Chicago%20White%20Stockings%20%281870%E2%80%9389%29">Chicago White Stockings</a> had hit 27—though in a ballpark where the distance to right field was only . On September 20, "Babe Ruth Day" at Fenway Park, Ruth won the game with a home run in the bottom of the ninth inning, tying Williamson. He broke the record four days later against the Yankees at the Polo Grounds, and hit one more against the Senators to finish with 29. The home run at Washington made Ruth the first major league player to hit a home run at all eight ballparks in his league. In spite of Ruth's hitting heroics, the Red Sox finished sixth, games behind the league champion White Sox.

As an out-of-towner from New York City, Frazee had been regarded with suspicion by Boston's sportswriters and baseball fans when he bought the team. He won them over with success on the field and a willingness to build the Red Sox by purchasing or trading for players. He offered the Senators $60,000 for Walter Johnson, but Washington owner <a href="Clark%20Griffith">Clark Griffith</a> was unwilling. Even so, Frazee was successful in bringing other players to Boston, especially as replacements for players in the military. This willingness to spend for players helped the Red Sox secure the 1918 title. The 1919 season saw record-breaking attendance, and Ruth's home runs for Boston made him a national sensation. In March 1919 Ruth was reported as having accepted a three-year contract for a total of $27,000, after protracted negotiations. Nevertheless, on December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Ruth's contract to the New York Yankees.
Not all of the circumstances concerning the sale are known, but brewer and former congressman <a href="Jacob%20Ruppert">Jacob Ruppert</a>, the New York team's principal owner, reportedly asked Yankee manager <a href="Miller%20Huggins">Miller Huggins</a> what the team needed to be successful. "Get Ruth from Boston", Huggins supposedly replied, noting that Frazee was perennially in need of money to finance his theatrical productions. In any event, there was precedent for the Ruth transaction: when Boston pitcher <a href="Carl%20Mays">Carl Mays</a> left the Red Sox in a 1919 dispute, Frazee had settled the matter by selling Mays to the Yankees, though over the opposition of AL President Johnson.

According to one of Ruth's biographers, Jim Reisler, "why Frazee needed cash in 1919—and large infusions of it quickly—is still, more than 80 years later, a bit of a mystery". The often-told story is that Frazee needed money to finance the musical "<a href="No%2C%20No%2C%20Nanette">No, No, Nanette</a>", which was a Broadway hit and brought Frazee financial security. That play did not open until 1925, however, by which time Frazee had sold the Red Sox. Still, the story may be true in essence: "No, No, Nanette" was based on a Frazee-produced play, "My Lady Friends", which opened in 1919.

There were other financial pressures on Frazee, despite his team's success. Ruth, fully aware of baseball's popularity and his role in it, wanted to renegotiate his contract, signed before the 1919 season for $10,000 per year through 1921. He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as $125,000 from the purchase of the club.

Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel <a href="Tillinghast%20L%27Hommedieu%20Huston">Tillinghast Huston</a>, were both wealthy, and had aggressively purchased and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build a winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.

Frazee sold the rights to Babe Ruth for $100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player. The deal also involved a $350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The $100,000 price included $25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash.

The transaction was contingent on Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly accomplished—Ruth agreed to fulfill the remaining two years on his contract, but was given a $20,000 bonus, payable over two seasons. The deal was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston was mixed: some fans were embittered at the loss of Ruth; others conceded that the slugger had become difficult to deal with. "The New York Times" suggested presciently, "The short right field wall at the Polo Grounds should prove an easy target for Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would not be surprising if Ruth surpassed his home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer." According to Reisler, "The Yankees had pulled off the sports steal of the century."

According to Marty Appel in his history of the Yankees, the transaction, "changed the fortunes of two high-profile franchises for decades". The Red Sox, winners of five of the first sixteen World Series, those played between 1903 and 1919, would not win another pennant until 1946, or another World Series until <a href="2004%20World%20Series">2004</a>, a drought attributed in baseball superstition to Frazee's sale of Ruth and sometimes dubbed the "<a href="Curse%20of%20the%20Bambino">Curse of the Bambino</a>". The Yankees, on the other hand, had not won the AL championship prior to their acquisition of Ruth. They won seven AL pennants and four World Series with Ruth, and lead baseball with 40 pennants and 27 World Series titles in their history.

When Ruth signed with the Yankees, he completed his transition from a pitcher to a power-hitting outfielder. His fifteen-season Yankee career consisted of over 2,000 games, and Ruth broke many batting records while making only five widely scattered appearances on the mound, winning all of them.

At the end of April 1920, the Yankees were 4–7, with the Red Sox leading the league with a 10–2 mark. Ruth had done little, having injured himself swinging the bat. Both situations began to change on May 1, when Ruth hit a tape measure home run that sent the ball completely out of the Polo Grounds, a feat believed to have been previously accomplished only by <a href="Shoeless%20Joe%20Jackson">Shoeless Joe Jackson</a>. The Yankees won, 6–0, taking three out of four from the Red Sox. Ruth hit his second home run on May 2, and by the end of the month had set a major league record for home runs in a month with 11, and promptly broke it with 13 in June. Fans responded with record attendance figures. On May 16, Ruth and the Yankees drew 38,600 to the Polo Grounds, a record for the ballpark, and 15,000 fans were turned away. Large crowds jammed stadiums to see Ruth play when the Yankees were on the road.
The home runs kept on coming. Ruth tied his own record of 29 on July 15 and broke it with home runs in both games of a doubleheader four days later. By the end of July, he had 37, but his pace slackened somewhat after that. Nevertheless, on September 4, he both tied and broke the organized baseball record for home runs in a season, snapping <a href="Perry%20Werden">Perry Werden</a>'s 1895 mark of 44 in the minor <a href="Western%20League%20%28original%29">Western League</a>. The Yankees played well as a team, battling for the league lead early in the summer, but slumped in August in the AL pennant battle with Chicago and Cleveland. The pennant and the <a href="1920%20World%20Series">World Series</a> were won by Cleveland, who surged ahead after the <a href="Black%20Sox%20Scandal">Black Sox Scandal</a> broke on September 28 and led to the suspension of many of Chicago's top players, including Shoeless Joe Jackson. The Yankees finished third, but drew 1.2 million fans to the Polo Grounds, the first time a team had drawn a seven-figure attendance. The rest of the league sold 600,000 more tickets, many fans there to see Ruth, who led the league with 54 home runs, 158 <a href="Run%20%28baseball%29">runs</a>, and 137 <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBIs).

In 1920 and afterwards, Ruth was aided in his power hitting by the fact that A.J. Reach Company—the maker of baseballs used in the major leagues—was using a more efficient machine to wind the yarn found within the baseball. The new baseballs went into play in 1920 and ushered the start of the <a href="live-ball%20era">live-ball era</a>; the number of home runs across the major leagues increased by 184 over the previous year. Baseball statistician <a href="Bill%20James">Bill James</a> pointed out that while Ruth was likely aided by the change in the baseball, there were other factors at work, including the gradual abolition of the <a href="spitball">spitball</a> (accelerated after the death of <a href="Ray%20Chapman">Ray Chapman</a>, struck by a pitched ball thrown by Mays in August 1920) and the more frequent use of new baseballs (also a response to Chapman's death). Nevertheless, James theorized that Ruth's 1920 explosion might have happened in 1919, had a full season of 154 games been played rather than 140, had Ruth refrained from pitching 133 innings that season, and if he were playing at any other home field but Fenway Park, where he hit only 9 of 29 home runs.
Yankees business manager Harry Sparrow had died early in the 1920 season. Ruppert and Huston hired Barrow to replace him. The two men quickly made a deal with Frazee for New York to acquire some of the players who would be mainstays of the early Yankee pennant-winning teams, including catcher <a href="Wally%20Schang">Wally Schang</a> and pitcher <a href="Waite%20Hoyt">Waite Hoyt</a>. The 21-year-old Hoyt became close to Ruth:

Ruth hit home runs early and often in the 1921 season, during which he broke <a href="Roger%20Connor">Roger Connor</a>'s mark for home runs in a career, 138. Each of the almost 600 home runs Ruth hit in his career after that extended his own record. After a slow start, the Yankees were soon locked in a tight pennant race with Cleveland, winners of the <a href="1920%20World%20Series">1920 World Series</a>. On September 15, Ruth hit his 55th home run, shattering his year-old single season record. In late September, the Yankees visited Cleveland and won three out of four games, giving them the upper hand in the race, and clinched their first pennant a few days later. Ruth finished the regular season with 59 home runs, batting .378 and with a <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> of .846.

The Yankees had high expectations when they met the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> in the <a href="1921%20World%20Series">1921 World Series</a>, every game of which was played in the Polo Grounds. The Yankees won the first two games with Ruth in the lineup. However, Ruth badly scraped his elbow during Game 2 when he slid into third base (he had walked and <a href="stolen%20base">stolen</a> both second and third bases). After the game, he was told by the team physician not to play the rest of the series. Despite this advice, he did play in the next three games, and pinch-hit in Game Eight of the best-of-nine series, but the Yankees lost, five games to three. Ruth hit .316, drove in five runs and hit his first World Series home run.
After the Series, Ruth and teammates <a href="Bob%20Meusel">Bob Meusel</a> and <a href="Bill%20Piercy">Bill Piercy</a> participated in a <a href="barnstorm%20%28athletics%29">barnstorming</a> tour in the Northeast. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the offseason, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from replicating the Series and undermining its value. <a href="Baseball%20Commissioner">Baseball Commissioner</a> <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> suspended the trio until May 20, 1922, and fined them their 1921 World Series checks. In August 1922, the rule was changed to allow limited barnstorming for World Series participants, with Landis's permission required.

On March 6, 1922, Ruth signed a new contract for three years at $52,000 a year. This was the largest sum ever paid to a ballplayer up to that point, and it represented 40% of the team's player payroll. Despite his suspension, Ruth was named the Yankees' new on-field captain prior to the <a href="1922%20New%20York%20Yankees%20season">1922 season</a>. During the suspension, he worked out with the team in the morning and played exhibition games with the Yankees on their off days. He and Meusel returned on May 20 to a sellout crowd at the Polo Grounds, but Ruth batted 0-for-4 and was booed. On May 25, he was thrown out of the game for throwing dust in umpire <a href="George%20Hildebrand">George Hildebrand</a>'s face, then climbed into the stands to confront a heckler. Ban Johnson ordered him fined, suspended, and stripped of position as team captain. In his shortened season, Ruth appeared in 110 games, batted .315, with 35 home runs, and drove in 99 runs, but the 1922 season was a disappointment in comparison to his two previous dominating years. Despite Ruth's off-year, the Yankees managed to win the pennant and faced the New York Giants in the <a href="1922%20World%20Series">World Series</a> for the second consecutive year. In the Series, Giants manager John McGraw instructed his pitchers to throw him nothing but curveballs, and Ruth never adjusted. Ruth had just two hits in seventeen at bats, and the Yankees lost to the Giants for the second straight year, by 4–0 (with one tie game). Sportswriter <a href="Joe%20Vila">Joe Vila</a> called him, "an exploded phenomenon".

After the season, Ruth was a guest at an <a href="Elks%20Club">Elks Club</a> banquet, set up by Ruth's agent with Yankee team support. There, each speaker, concluding with future New York mayor <a href="Jimmy%20Walker">Jimmy Walker</a>, censured him for his poor behavior. An emotional Ruth promised reform, and, to the surprise of many, followed through. When he reported to spring training, he was in his best shape as a Yankee, weighing only .

The Yankees' status as tenants of the Giants at the Polo Grounds had become increasingly uneasy, and in 1922, Giants owner <a href="Charles%20Stoneham">Charles Stoneham</a> stated that the Yankees' lease, expiring after that season, would not be renewed. Ruppert and Huston had long contemplated a new stadium, and had taken an option on property at 161st Street and River Avenue in <a href="the%20Bronx">the Bronx</a>. <a href="Yankee%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Yankee Stadium</a> was completed in time for the home opener on April 18, 1923, at which the Babe hit the first home run in what was quickly dubbed "the House that Ruth Built". The ballpark was designed with Ruth in mind: although the venue's left-field fence was further from home plate than at the Polo Grounds, Yankee Stadium's right-field fence was closer, making home runs easier to hit for left-handed batters. To spare Ruth's eyes, right field–his defensive position–was not pointed into the afternoon sun, as was traditional; left fielder Meusel was soon suffering headaches from squinting toward home plate.

During the 1923 season, The Yankees were never seriously challenged and won the AL pennant by 17 games. Ruth finished the season with a career-high .393 batting average and 41 home runs, which tied <a href="Cy%20Williams">Cy Williams</a> for the most in the major-leagues that year. Ruth hit a career high 45 doubles in 1923, and he reached base 379 times, then a major league record. For the third straight year, the Yankees faced the Giants in the <a href="1923%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, which Ruth dominated. He batted .368, walked eight times, scored eight runs, hit three home runs and slugged 1.000 during the series, as the Yankees christened their new stadium with their first World Series championship, four games to two.

In 1924, the Yankees were favored to become the first team to win four consecutive pennants. Plagued by injuries, they found themselves in a battle with the Senators. Although the Yankees won 18 of 22 at one point in September, the Senators beat out the Yankees by two games. Ruth hit .378, winning his only AL <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20batting%20champions">batting title</a>, with a league-leading 46 home runs.

Ruth had kept up his efforts to stay in shape in 1923 and 1924, but by early 1925 weighed nearly . His annual visit to <a href="Hot%20Springs%2C%20Arkansas">Hot Springs, Arkansas</a>, where he exercised and took saunas early in the year, did him no good as he spent much of the time carousing in the resort town. He became ill while there, and suffered relapses during spring training. Ruth collapsed in <a href="Asheville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Asheville, North Carolina</a>, as the team journeyed north. He was put on a train for New York, where he was briefly hospitalized. A rumor circulated that he had died, prompting British newspapers to print <a href="List%20of%20premature%20obituaries">a premature obituary</a>. In New York, Ruth collapsed again and was found unconscious in his hotel bathroom. He was taken to a hospital where he suffered multiple convulsions. After sportswriter <a href="W.%20O.%20McGeehan">W. O. McGeehan</a> wrote that Ruth's illness was due to binging on hot dogs and soda pop before a game, it became known as "the bellyache heard 'round the world". However, the exact cause of his ailment has never been confirmed and remains a mystery. Glenn Stout, in his history of the Yankees, notes that the Ruth legend is "still one of the most sheltered in sports"; he suggests that alcohol was at the root of Ruth's illness, pointing to the fact that Ruth remained six weeks at <a href="St.%20Vincent%27s%20Hospital%20%28Manhattan%29">St. Vincent's Hospital</a> but was allowed to leave, under supervision, for workouts with the team for part of that time. He concludes that the hospitalization was behavior-related. Playing just 98 games, Ruth had his worst season as a Yankee; he finished with a .290 average and 25 home runs. The Yankees finished next to last in the AL with a 69–85 record, their last season with a losing record until 1965.

Ruth spent part of the offseason of 1925–26 working out at <a href="Artie%20McGovern">Artie McGovern</a>'s gym, where he got back into shape. Barrow and Huggins had rebuilt the team and surrounded the veteran core with good young players like <a href="Tony%20Lazzeri">Tony Lazzeri</a> and <a href="Lou%20Gehrig">Lou Gehrig</a>, but the Yankees were not expected to win the pennant.

Ruth returned to his normal production during 1926, when he batted .372 with 47 home runs and 146 RBIs. The Yankees built a 10-game lead by mid-June and coasted to win the pennant by three games. The <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> had won the National League with the lowest winning percentage for a pennant winner to that point (.578) and the Yankees were expected to win the <a href="1926%20World%20Series">World Series</a> easily. Although the Yankees won the opener in New York, St. Louis took Games Two and Three. In Game Four, Ruth hit three home runs—the first time this had been done in a World Series game—to lead the Yankees to victory. In the fifth game, Ruth caught a ball as he crashed into the fence. The play was described by baseball writers as a defensive gem. New York took that game, but <a href="Grover%20Cleveland%20Alexander">Grover Cleveland Alexander</a> won Game Six for St. Louis to tie the Series at three games each, then got very drunk. He was nevertheless inserted into Game Seven in the seventh inning and shut down the Yankees to win the game, 3–2, and win the Series. Ruth had hit his fourth home run of the Series earlier in the game and was the only Yankee to reach base off Alexander; he walked in the ninth inning before being thrown out to end the game when he attempted to steal second base. Although Ruth's attempt to steal second is often deemed a baserunning blunder, Creamer pointed out that the Yankees' chances of tying the game would have been greatly improved with a runner in scoring position.
The 1926 World Series was also known for Ruth's promise to <a href="Johnny%20Sylvester">Johnny Sylvester</a>, a hospitalized 11-year-old boy. Ruth promised the child that he would hit a home run on his behalf. Sylvester had been injured in a fall from a horse, and a friend of Sylvester's father gave the boy two autographed baseballs signed by Yankees and Cardinals. The friend relayed a promise from Ruth (who did not know the boy) that he would hit a home run for him. After the Series, Ruth visited the boy in the hospital. When the matter became public, the press greatly inflated it, and by some accounts, Ruth allegedly saved the boy's life by visiting him, emotionally promising to hit a home run, and doing so.

The 1927 New York Yankees team is considered one of the greatest squads to ever take the field. Known as <a href="Murderers%27%20Row">Murderers' Row</a> because of the power of its lineup, the team clinched first place on Labor Day, won a then-AL-record 110 games and took the AL pennant by 19 games. There was no suspense in the pennant race, and the nation turned its attention to Ruth's pursuit of his own single-season home run record of 59 round trippers. Ruth was not alone in this chase. Teammate Lou Gehrig proved to be a slugger who was capable of challenging Ruth for his home run crown; he tied Ruth with 24 home runs late in June. Through July and August, the dynamic duo was never separated by more than two home runs. Gehrig took the lead, 45–44, in the first game of a doubleheader at Fenway Park early in September; Ruth responded with two blasts of his own to take the lead, as it proved permanently—Gehrig finished with 47. Even so, as of September 6, Ruth was still several games off his 1921 pace, and going into the final series against the Senators, had only 57. He hit two in the first game of the series, including one off of <a href="Paul%20Hopkins%20%28baseball%29">Paul Hopkins</a>, facing his first major league batter, to tie the record. The following day, September 30, he broke it with his 60th homer, in the eighth inning off <a href="Tom%20Zachary">Tom Zachary</a> to break a 2–2 tie. "Sixty! Let's see some son of a bitch try to top that one", Ruth exulted after the game. In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted .356, drove in 164 runs and slugged .772. In the <a href="1927%20World%20Series">1927 World Series</a>, the Yankees swept the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> in four games; the National Leaguers were disheartened after watching the Yankees take batting practice before Game One, with ball after ball leaving <a href="Forbes%20Field">Forbes Field</a>. According to Appel, "The 1927 New York Yankees. Even today, the words inspire awe ... all baseball success is measured against the '27 team."
The following season started off well for the Yankees, who led the league in the early going. But the Yankees were plagued by injuries, erratic pitching and inconsistent play. The <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>, rebuilding after some lean years, erased the Yankees' big lead and even took over first place briefly in early September. The Yankees, however, regained first place when they beat the Athletics three out of four games in a pivotal series at Yankee Stadium later that month, and clinched the pennant in the final weekend of the season. Ruth's play in 1928 mirrored his team's performance. He got off to a hot start and on August 1, he had 42 home runs. This put him ahead of his 60 home run pace from the previous season. He then slumped for the latter part of the season, and he hit just twelve home runs in the last two months. Ruth's batting average also fell to .323, well below his career average. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 54 home runs. The Yankees swept the favored Cardinals in four games in the <a href="1928%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, with Ruth batting .625 and hitting three home runs in Game Four, including one off Alexander.

Before the 1929 season, Ruppert (who had bought out Huston in 1923) announced that the Yankees would wear uniform numbers to allow fans at cavernous Yankee Stadium to easily identify the players. The Cardinals and Indians had each experimented with uniform numbers; the Yankees were the first to use them on both home and away uniforms. Ruth batted third and was given number 3. According to a long-standing baseball legend, the Yankees adopted their now-iconic pinstriped uniforms in hopes of making Ruth look slimmer. In truth, though, they had been wearing pinstripes since Ruppert bought the team in 1915.

Although the Yankees started well, the Athletics soon proved they were the better team in 1929, splitting two series with the Yankees in the first month of the season, then taking advantage of a Yankee losing streak in mid-May to gain first place. Although Ruth performed well, the Yankees were not able to catch the Athletics—Connie Mack had built another great team. Tragedy struck the Yankees late in the year as manager Huggins died at 51 of <a href="erysipelas">erysipelas</a>, a bacterial skin infection, on September 25, only ten days after he had last directed the team. Despite their past differences, Ruth praised Huggins and described him as a "great guy". The Yankees finished second, 18 games behind the Athletics. Ruth hit .345 during the season, with 46 home runs and 154 RBIs.

On October 17, the Yankees hired <a href="Bob%20Shawkey">Bob Shawkey</a> as manager; he was their fourth choice. Ruth had politicked for the job of player-manager, but Ruppert and Barrow never seriously considered him for the position. Stout deemed this the first hint Ruth would have no future with the Yankees once he retired as a player. Shawkey, a former Yankees player and teammate of Ruth, would prove unable to command the slugger's respect.

On January 7, 1930, salary negotiations between the Yankees and Ruth quickly broke down. Having just concluded a three-year contract at an annual salary of $70,000, Ruth promptly rejected both the Yankees' initial proposal of $70,000 for one year and their 'final' offer of two years at seventy-five—the latter figure equalling the annual salary of then US President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a>; instead, Ruth demanded at least $85,000 and three years. When asked why he thought he was "worth more than the President of the United States," Ruth responded: "Say, if I hadn't been sick last summer, I'd have broken hell out of that home run record! Besides, the President gets a four-year contract. I'm only asking for three." Exactly two months later, a compromise was reached, with Ruth settling for two years at an unprecedented $80,000 per year.

In 1930, Ruth hit .359 with 49 home runs (his best in his years after 1928) and 153 RBIs, and pitched his first game in nine years, a complete game victory. Nevertheless, the Athletics won their second consecutive pennant and <a href="1930%20World%20Series">World Series</a>, as the Yankees finished in third place, sixteen games back. At the end of the season, Shawkey was fired and replaced with Cubs manager <a href="Joe%20McCarthy%20%28manager%29">Joe McCarthy</a>, though Ruth again unsuccessfully sought the job.

McCarthy was a disciplinarian, but chose not to interfere with Ruth, and the slugger for his part did not seek conflict with the manager. The team improved in 1931, but was no match for the Athletics, who won 107 games, games in front of the Yankees. Ruth, for his part, hit .373, with 46 home runs and 163 RBIs. He had 31 doubles, his most since 1924. In the 1932 season, the Yankees went 107–47 and won the pennant. Ruth's effectiveness had decreased somewhat, but he still hit .341 with 41 home runs and 137 RBIs. Nevertheless, he was sidelined twice due to injuries during the season.

The Yankees faced the Cubs, McCarthy's former team, in the <a href="1932%20World%20Series">1932 World Series</a>. There was bad blood between the two teams as the Yankees resented the Cubs only awarding <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason%23Postseason%20bonuses">half a World Series share</a> to <a href="Mark%20Koenig">Mark Koenig</a>, a former Yankee. The games at Yankee Stadium had not been sellouts; both were won by the home team, with Ruth collecting two singles, but scoring four runs as he was walked four times by the Cubs pitchers. In Chicago, Ruth was resentful at the hostile crowds that met the Yankees' train and jeered them at the hotel. The crowd for Game Three included New York Governor <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, the Democratic candidate for president, who sat with Chicago Mayor <a href="Anton%20Cermak">Anton Cermak</a>. Many in the crowd threw lemons at Ruth, a sign of derision, and others (as well as the Cubs themselves) shouted abuse at Ruth and other Yankees. They were briefly silenced when Ruth hit a three-run home run off <a href="Charlie%20Root">Charlie Root</a> in the first inning, but soon revived, and the Cubs tied the score at 4–4 in the fourth inning. When Ruth came to the plate in the top of the fifth, the Chicago crowd and players, led by pitcher <a href="Guy%20Bush">Guy Bush</a>, were screaming insults at Ruth. With the <a href="Count%20%28baseball%29">count</a> at two balls and one strike, Ruth gestured, possibly in the direction of <a href="center%20fielder">center field</a>, and after the next pitch (a strike), may have pointed there with one hand. Ruth hit the fifth pitch over the center field fence; estimates were that it traveled nearly . Whether or not Ruth intended to indicate where he planned to (and did) hit the ball, the incident has gone down in legend as <a href="Babe%20Ruth%27s%20called%20shot">Babe Ruth's called shot</a>. The Yankees won Game Three, and the following day clinched the Series with another victory. During that game, Bush hit Ruth on the arm with a pitch, causing words to be exchanged and provoking a game-winning Yankee rally.

Ruth remained productive in 1933. He batted .301, with 34 home runs, 103 RBIs, and a league-leading 114 walks, as the Yankees finished in second place, seven games behind the Senators. Athletics manager <a href="Connie%20Mack">Connie Mack</a> selected him to play right field in the first <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">Major League Baseball All-Star Game</a>, held on July 6, 1933, at <a href="Comiskey%20Park">Comiskey Park</a> in Chicago. He hit the first home run in the All-Star Game's history, a two-run blast against <a href="Bill%20Hallahan">Bill Hallahan</a> during the third inning, which helped the AL win the game 4–2. During the final game of the 1933 season, as a publicity stunt organized by his team, Ruth was called upon and pitched a complete game victory against the Red Sox, his final appearance as a pitcher. Despite unremarkable pitching numbers, Ruth had a 5–0 record in five games for the Yankees, raising his career totals to 94–46.

In 1934, Ruth played in his last full season with the Yankees. By this time, years of high living were starting to catch up with him. His conditioning had deteriorated to the point that he could no longer field or run. He accepted a pay cut to $35,000 from Ruppert, but he was still the highest-paid player in the major leagues. He could still handle a bat and recorded a .288 batting average with 22 home runs; these were statistics that Reisler described as "merely mortal". Ruth was selected to the AL All-Star team for the second consecutive year, even though he was in the twilight of his career. During the game, New York Giants pitcher <a href="Carl%20Hubbell">Carl Hubbell</a> struck out Ruth and four other future <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall-of-Famers</a> consecutively. The Yankees finished second again, seven games behind the Tigers.

Although Ruth knew he was nearly finished as a player, he desired to remain in baseball as a manager. He was often spoken of as a possible candidate as managerial jobs opened up, but in 1932, when he was mentioned as a contender for the Red Sox position, Ruth stated that he was not yet ready to leave the field. There were rumors that Ruth was a likely candidate each time when the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, and <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> were looking for a manager, but nothing came of them.

Just before the 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth the manager of the Yankees' top minor-league team, the <a href="Newark%20Bears%20%28International%20League%29">Newark Bears</a>, but he was talked out of it by his wife, <a href="Claire%20Merritt%20Ruth">Claire</a>, and his business manager, Christy Walsh. Shortly afterward, Tigers owner <a href="Frank%20Navin">Frank Navin</a> made a proposal to Ruppert and Barrow—if the Yankees traded Ruth to Detroit, Navin would name Ruth player-manager. Navin believed Ruth would not only bring a winning attitude to a team that had not finished higher than third since 1923, but would also revive the Tigers' sagging attendance figures. Navin asked Ruth to come to Detroit for an interview. However, Ruth balked, since Walsh had already arranged for him to take part in a celebrity golf tournament in Hawaii. Ruth and Navin negotiated over the phone while Ruth was in Hawaii, but those talks foundered when Navin refused to give Ruth a portion of the Tigers' box office proceeds.

Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned to become the Yankees manager. However, the Yankee job was never a serious possibility. Ruppert always supported McCarthy, who would remain in his position for another 12 seasons. The relationship between Ruth and McCarthy had been lukewarm at best and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their interpersonal relations. By the end of the season, Ruth hinted that he would retire unless Ruppert named him manager of the Yankees. When the time came, Ruppert wanted his slugger to leave the team without drama or hard feelings.

During the 1934–35 offseason, Ruth circled the world with his wife; the trip included a barnstorming tour of the Far East. At his final stop in the United Kingdom before returning home, Ruth was introduced to cricket by Australian player <a href="Alan%20Fairfax">Alan Fairfax</a>, and after having little luck in a cricketer's stance, he stood as a baseball batter and launched some massive shots around the field, destroying the bat in the process. Although Fairfax regretted that he could not have the time to make Ruth a cricket player, Ruth had lost any interest in such a career upon learning that the best batsmen made only about $40 per week.

Also during the offseason, Ruppert had been sounding out the other clubs in hopes of finding one that would be willing to take Ruth as a manager and/or a player. However, the only serious offer came from Athletics owner-manager Connie Mack, who gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth. However, Mack later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over.

While the barnstorming tour was underway, Ruppert began negotiating with Boston Braves owner Judge <a href="Emil%20Fuchs%20%28baseball%29">Emil Fuchs</a>, who wanted Ruth as a gate attraction. The Braves had enjoyed modest recent success, finishing fourth in the National League in both 1933 and 1934, but the team drew poorly at the box office. Unable to afford the rent at <a href="Braves%20Field">Braves Field</a>, Fuchs had considered holding dog races there when the Braves were not at home, only to be turned down by Landis. After a series of phone calls, letters, and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935. Ruppert had stated that he would not release Ruth to go to another team as a full-time player. For this reason, it was announced that Ruth would become a team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions, in addition to playing. He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper <a href="Bill%20McKechnie">Bill McKechnie</a>. In a long letter to Ruth a few days before the press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team. Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth succeeding McKechnie as manager, perhaps as early as 1936. Ruppert called the deal "the greatest opportunity Ruth ever had".

There was considerable attention as Ruth reported for spring training. He did not hit his first home run of the spring until after the team had left Florida, and was beginning the road north in Savannah. He hit two in an exhibition game against the Bears. Amid much press attention, Ruth played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years. Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, including five of New England's six state governors, Ruth accounted for all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 defeat of the <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a>, hitting a two-run home run, singling to drive in a third run and later in the inning scoring the fourth. Although age and weight had slowed him, he made a running catch in left field that sportswriters deemed the defensive highlight of the game.

Ruth had two hits in the second game of the season, but it quickly went downhill both for him and the Braves from there. The season soon settled down to a routine of Ruth performing poorly on the few occasions he even played at all. As April passed into May, Ruth's physical deterioration became even more pronounced. While he remained productive at the plate early on, he could do little else. His conditioning had become so poor that he could barely trot around the bases. He made so many errors that three Braves pitchers told McKechnie that they would not take the mound if he was in the lineup. Before long, Ruth stopped hitting as well. He grew increasingly annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his advice. For his part, McKechnie later said that Ruth's huge salary and refusal to stay with the team while on the road made it nearly impossible to enforce discipline. The Braves' deterioration mirrored that of Ruth's; their Opening Day win was the only time they were above .500 all year.

Ruth soon realized that Fuchs had deceived him, and had no intention of making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties. He later stated that his only duties as vice president consisted of making public appearances and autographing tickets. Ruth also found out that far from giving him a share of the profits, Fuchs wanted him to invest some of "his" money in the team in a last-ditch effort to improve its balance sheet. As it turned out, Fuchs and Ruppert had both known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.

By the end of the first month of the season, Ruth concluded he was finished even as a part-time player. As early as May 12, he asked Fuchs to let him retire. Ultimately, Fuchs persuaded Ruth to remain at least until after the <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> doubleheader in Philadelphia. In the interim was a western road trip, at which the rival teams had scheduled days to honor him. In Chicago and St. Louis, Ruth performed poorly, and his batting average sank to .155, with only two additional home runs for a total of three on the season so far. In the first two games in Pittsburgh, Ruth had only one hit, though a long fly caught by <a href="Paul%20Waner">Paul Waner</a> probably would have been a home run in any other ballpark besides <a href="Forbes%20Field">Forbes Field</a>.

Ruth played in the third game of the Pittsburgh series on May 25, 1935, and added one more tale to his playing legend. Ruth went 4-for-4, including three home runs, though the Braves lost the game 11–7. The last two were off Ruth's old Cubs nemesis, Guy Bush. The final home run, both of the game and of Ruth's career, sailed out of the park over the right field upper deck–the first time anyone had hit a fair ball completely out of Forbes Field. Ruth was urged to make this his last game, but he had given his word to Fuchs and played in Cincinnati and Philadelphia. The first game of the doubleheader in Philadelphia—the Braves lost both—was his final major league appearance. Ruth retired on June 2 after an argument with Fuchs. He finished 1935 with a .181 average—easily his worst as a full-time position player—and the final six of his 714 home runs. The Braves, 10–27 when Ruth left, finished 38–115, at .248 the worst winning percentage in modern National League history. Insolvent like his team, Fuchs gave up control of the Braves before the end of the season; the National League took over the franchise at the end of the year.

Although Fuchs had given Ruth his unconditional release, no major league team expressed an interest in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager if he could not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement and the end of the 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner <a href="Alva%20Bradley">Alva Bradley</a> replied negatively.

The writer Creamer believed Ruth was unfairly treated in never being given an opportunity to manage a major league club. The author believed there was not necessarily a relationship between personal conduct and managerial success, noting that <a href="John%20McGraw%20%28baseball%29">McGraw</a>, <a href="Billy%20Martin">Billy Martin</a>, and <a href="Bobby%20Valentine">Bobby Valentine</a> were winners despite character flaws. Team owners and general managers assessed Ruth's flamboyant personal habits as a reason to exclude him from a managerial job; Barrow said of him, "How can he manage other men when he can't even manage himself?"

Ruth played much golf and in a few exhibition baseball games, where he demonstrated a continuing ability to draw large crowds. This appeal contributed to the Dodgers hiring him as first base coach in 1938. When Ruth was hired, Brooklyn general manager <a href="Larry%20MacPhail">Larry MacPhail</a> made it clear that Ruth would not be considered for the manager's job if, as expected, <a href="Burleigh%20Grimes">Burleigh Grimes</a> retired at the end of the season. Although much was said about what Ruth could teach the younger players, in practice, his duties were to appear on the field in uniform and encourage base runners—he was not called upon to relay signs. Indeed, his most newsworthy accomplishment during this period was hitting a 430-foot home run—and thus earning the fifty-dollar grand prize—in a pre-game distance hitting contest held at <a href="Sportsman%27s%20Park">Sportsman's Park</a> on July 24. Ruth got along well with everyone except team captain <a href="Leo%20Durocher">Leo Durocher</a>, who was hired as Grimes' replacement at season's end. Ruth then left his job as a first base coach and would never again work in any capacity in the game of baseball.

On July 4, 1939, Ruth spoke on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day at Yankee Stadium as members of the 1927 Yankees and a sellout crowd turned out to honor the first baseman, who was forced into premature retirement by <a href="Amyotrophic%20lateral%20sclerosis">ALS</a>, which would kill him two years later. The next week, Ruth went to <a href="Cooperstown%2C%20New%20York">Cooperstown, New York</a>, for the formal opening of the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a>. Three years earlier, he was one of the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201936">first five players</a> elected to the hall. As radio broadcasts of baseball games became popular, Ruth sought a job in that field, arguing that his celebrity and knowledge of baseball would assure large audiences, but he received no offers. During World War II, he made many personal appearances to advance the war effort, including his last appearance as a player at Yankee Stadium, in a 1943 exhibition for the Army-Navy Relief Fund. He hit a long fly ball off Walter Johnson; the blast left the field, curving foul, but Ruth circled the bases anyway. In 1946, he made a final effort to gain a job in baseball when he contacted new Yankees boss MacPhail, but he was sent a rejection letter.

Ruth met Helen Woodford (1897–1929), by some accounts, in a coffee shop in Boston where she was a waitress, and they were married as teenagers on October 17, 1914. Although Ruth later claimed to have been married in <a href="Elkton%2C%20Maryland">Elkton, Maryland</a>, records show that they were married at <a href="Saint%20Paul%20Catholic%20Church%20%28Ellicott%20City%2C%20Maryland%29">St. Paul's Catholic Church</a> in <a href="Ellicott%20City%2C%20Maryland">Ellicott City</a>. They adopted a daughter, <a href="Dorothy%20Ruth">Dorothy</a> (1921–1989), in 1921. Ruth and Helen separated around 1925, reportedly due to his repeated <a href="Adultery">infidelities</a>. They appeared in public as a couple for the last time during the 1926 World Series. Helen died in January 1929 at age 31 in a house fire in <a href="Watertown%2C%20Massachusetts">Watertown, Massachusetts</a>, in a house owned by Edward Kinder, a dentist with whom she had been living as "Mrs. Kinder". In her book, "My Dad, the Babe", Dorothy claimed that she was Ruth's biological child by a mistress named Juanita Jennings. She died in 1989.

On April 17, 1929 (only three months after the death of his first wife) Ruth married actress and model <a href="Claire%20Merritt%20Hodgson">Claire Merritt Hodgson</a> (1897–1976) and adopted her daughter Julia (1916–2019). It was the second and final marriage for both parties. By one account, Julia and Dorothy were, through no fault of their own, the reason for the seven-year rift in Ruth's relationship with teammate Lou Gehrig. Sometime in 1932, during a conversation that she assumed was private, Gehrig's mother remarked, "It's a shame [Claire] doesn't dress Dorothy as nicely as she dresses her own daughter." When the comment inevitably got back to Ruth, he angrily told Gehrig to tell his mother to mind her own business. Gehrig, in turn, took offense at what he perceived as Ruth's comment about his mother. The two men reportedly never spoke off the field until they reconciled at Yankee Stadium on Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day, July 4, 1939, which was shortly after Gehrig's retirement from baseball.

Although Ruth was married throughout most of his baseball career, when team co-owner <a href="Tillinghast%20L%27Hommedieu%20Huston">Tillinghast 'Cap' Huston</a> asked him to tone down his lifestyle, the player said, "I'll promise to go easier on drinking and to get to bed earlier, but not for you, fifty thousand dollars, or two-hundred and fifty thousand dollars will I give up women. They're too much fun." Before the start of the 1922 season, Ruth had signed a three-year contact at $52,000 per year with an option to renew for two additional years. His performance during the 1922 season had been disappointing, in part attributed to his drinking and late-night hours. After the end of the 1922 season he was asked to sign a contract addendum with a <a href="morals%20clause">morals clause</a>. Ruth and Ruppert signed it on November 11, 1922. It called for Ruth to abstain entirely from the use of intoxicating liquors, and to not stay up later than 1:00 a.m. during the training and playing season without permission of the manager. Ruth was also enjoined from any action or misbehavior which would compromise his ability to play baseball.

As early as the war years, doctors had cautioned Ruth to take better care of his health, and he grudgingly followed their advice, limiting his drinking and not going on a proposed trip to support the troops in the South Pacific. In 1946, Ruth began experiencing severe pain over his left eye and had difficulty swallowing. In November 1946, Ruth entered <a href="French%20Hospital%20%28Manhattan%29">French Hospital</a> in New York for tests, which revealed that he had an inoperable <a href="cancer">malignant tumor</a> at the base of his skull and in his neck. The malady was a lesion known as <a href="nasopharyngeal%20carcinoma">nasopharyngeal carcinoma</a>, or "lymphoepithelioma." His name and fame gave him access to experimental treatments, and he was one of the first cancer patients to receive both drugs and radiation treatment simultaneously. Having lost , he was discharged from the hospital in February and went to Florida to recuperate. He returned to New York and Yankee Stadium after the season started. The new commissioner, <a href="Happy%20Chandler">Happy Chandler</a> (Judge Landis had died in 1944), proclaimed April 27, 1947, Babe Ruth Day around the major leagues, with the most significant observance to be at Yankee Stadium. A number of teammates and others spoke in honor of Ruth, who briefly addressed the crowd of almost 60,000.

Around this time, developments in <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors had not told Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a <a href="folic%20acid">folic acid</a> derivative; he may have been the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by his doctors at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on <a href="American%20Legion%20Baseball">American Legion Baseball</a>. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.

The improvement was only a temporary remission, and by late 1947, Ruth was unable to help with the writing of his autobiography, "The Babe Ruth Story", which was almost entirely ghostwritten. In and out of the hospital in Manhattan, he left for Florida in February 1948, doing what activities he could. After six weeks he returned to New York to appear at a book-signing party. He also traveled to California to witness the filming of the movie based on the book.

On June 5, 1948, a "gaunt and hollowed out" Ruth visited <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> to donate a manuscript of "The Babe Ruth Story" to its library. At Yale, he met with future president <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, who was the captain of the <a href="Yale%20Bulldogs%20baseball">Yale baseball team</a>. On June 13, Ruth visited Yankee Stadium for the final time in his life, appearing at the 25th-anniversary celebrations of "The House that Ruth Built". By this time he had lost much weight and had difficulty walking. Introduced along with his surviving teammates from 1923, Ruth used a bat as a cane. <a href="Nat%20Fein">Nat Fein</a>'s photo of Ruth taken from behind, standing near home plate and facing "Ruthville" (right field) became one of baseball's most famous and widely circulated photographs, and won the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>.

Ruth made one final trip on behalf of American Legion Baseball, then entered <a href="Memorial%20Sloan%E2%80%93Kettering%20Cancer%20Center">Memorial Hospital</a>, where he would die. He was never told he had cancer, but before his death, had surmised it. He was able to leave the hospital for a few short trips, including a final visit to Baltimore. On July 26, 1948, Ruth left the hospital to attend the premiere of the film "<a href="The%20Babe%20Ruth%20Story">The Babe Ruth Story</a>". Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually grew worse; only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was <a href="National%20League">National League</a> president and future <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">Commissioner of Baseball</a> <a href="Ford%20Frick">Ford Frick</a>. "Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard", Frick said years later.

Thousands of New Yorkers, including many children, stood vigil outside the hospital during Ruth's final days. On August 16, 1948, at 8:01 p.m., Ruth died in his sleep at the age of 53. His open casket was placed on display in the rotunda of Yankee Stadium, where it remained for two days; 77,000 people filed past to pay him tribute. His funeral Mass took place at <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%20%28New%20York%29">St. Patrick's Cathedral</a>; a crowd estimated at 75,000 waited outside. Ruth was buried on a hillside in Section 25 at the <a href="Gate%20of%20Heaven%20Cemetery">Gate of Heaven Cemetery</a> in <a href="Hawthorne%2C%20New%20York">Hawthorne, New York</a>. An epitaph by <a href="Cardinal%20Spellman">Cardinal Spellman</a> appears on his headstone. His second wife, <a href="Claire%20Merritt%20Ruth">Claire Merritt Ruth</a>, would be interred with him 28 years later in 1976.

On April 19, 1949, the Yankees unveiled a granite monument in Ruth's honor in center field of Yankee Stadium. The monument was located <a href="ground%20rules">in the field of play</a> next to a flagpole and similar tributes to Huggins and Gehrig until the stadium was remodeled from 1974 to 1975, which resulted in the outfield fences moving inward and enclosing the monuments from the playing field. This area was known thereafter as <a href="Monument%20Park%20%28Yankee%20Stadium%29">Monument Park</a>. Yankee Stadium, "the House that Ruth Built", was replaced after the 2008 season with a new <a href="Yankee%20Stadium">Yankee Stadium</a> across the street from the old one; Monument Park was subsequently moved to the new venue behind the center field fence. Ruth's uniform number 3 has been <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> by the Yankees, and he is one of five Yankees players or managers to have a granite monument within the stadium.

The Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum is located at 216 Emory Street, a Baltimore row house where Ruth was born, and three blocks west of <a href="Oriole%20Park%20at%20Camden%20Yards">Oriole Park at Camden Yards</a>, where the AL's <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> play. The property was restored and opened to the public in 1973 by the non-profit Babe Ruth Birthplace Foundation, Inc. Ruth's widow, Claire, his two daughters, Dorothy and Julia, and his sister, Mamie, helped select and install exhibits for the museum.

Ruth was the first baseball star to be the subject of overwhelming public adulation. Baseball had been known for star players such as Ty Cobb and "Shoeless Joe" Jackson, but both men had uneasy relations with fans. In Cobb's case, the incidents were sometimes marked by violence. Ruth's biographers agreed that he benefited from the timing of his ascension to "Home Run King". The country had been hit hard by both the war and the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 flu pandemic</a> and longed for something to help put these traumas behind it. Ruth also resonated in a country which felt, in the aftermath of the war, that it took second place to no one. Montville argued that Ruth was a larger-than-life figure who was capable of unprecedented athletic feats in the nation's largest city. The Babe became an icon of the significant social changes that marked the early 1920s. In his history of the Yankees, Glenn Stout noted that "Ruth was New York incarnate—uncouth and raw, flamboyant and flashy, oversized, out of scale, and absolutely unstoppable".

During his lifetime, Ruth had become a symbol of the United States. During World War II, Japanese soldiers could think of no greater insult than to yell in English, "To hell with Babe Ruth", to anger American soldiers. Ruth replied that he hoped that "every Jap that mention[ed] my name gets shot". Creamer recorded that "Babe Ruth transcended sport and moved far beyond the artificial limits of baselines and outfield fences and sports pages". Wagenheim stated, "He appealed to a deeply rooted American yearning for the definitive climax: clean, quick, unarguable." According to Glenn Stout, "Ruth's home runs were exalted, uplifting experience that meant more to fans than any runs they were responsible for. A Babe Ruth home run was an event unto itself, one that meant anything was possible."

Ruth's penchant for hitting home runs altered how baseball is played. Prior to 1920, home runs were unusual, and managers tried to win games by getting a runner on base and bringing him around to score through such means as the stolen base, the <a href="bunt%20%28baseball%29">bunt</a>, and the <a href="hit%20and%20run%20%28baseball%29">hit and run</a>. Advocates of what was dubbed "inside baseball", such as Giants manager McGraw, disliked the home run, considering it a blot on the purity of the game. According to sportswriter W. A. Phelon, after the 1920 season, Ruth's breakout performance that season and the response in excitement and attendance, "settled, for all time to come, that the American public is nuttier over the Home Run than the Clever Fielding or the Hitless Pitching. Viva el Home Run and two times viva Babe Ruth, exponent of the home run, and overshadowing star." Bill James noted, "When the owners discovered that the fans "liked" to see home runs, and when the foundations of the games were simultaneously imperiled by disgrace [in the Black Sox Scandal], then there was no turning back." While a few, such as McGraw and Cobb, decried the passing of the old-style play, teams quickly began to seek and develop sluggers.

According to contemporary sportswriter <a href="Grantland%20Rice">Grantland Rice</a>, only two sports figures of the 1920s approached Ruth in popularity—boxer <a href="Jack%20Dempsey">Jack Dempsey</a> and racehorse <a href="Man%20o%27%20War">Man o' War</a>. One of the factors that contributed to Ruth's broad appeal was the uncertainty about his family and early life. Ruth appeared to exemplify the American success story, that even an uneducated, unsophisticated youth, without any family wealth or connections, can do something better than anyone else in the world. Montville noted that "the fog [surrounding his childhood] will make him forever accessible, universal. He will be the patron saint of American possibility." Similarly, the fact that Ruth played in the pre-television era, when a relatively small portion of his fans had the opportunity to see him play allowed his legend to grow through word of mouth and the hyperbole of sports reporters. Reisler noted that recent sluggers who surpassed Ruth's 60-home run mark, such as <a href="Mark%20McGwire">Mark McGwire</a> and <a href="Barry%20Bonds">Barry Bonds</a>, generated much less excitement than when Ruth repeatedly broke the single-season home run record in the 1920s. Ruth dominated a relatively small sports world, while Americans of the present era have many sports available to watch.

Creamer termed Ruth "a unique figure in the social history of the United States". Ruth has even entered the language: a dominant figure in a field, whether within or outside sports, is often referred to as "the Babe Ruth" of that field. Similarly, "Ruthian" has come to mean in sports, "colossal, dramatic, prodigious, magnificent; with great power."

In 2006, Montville noted that more books have been written about Ruth than any other member of the Baseball Hall of Fame. At least five of these books (including Creamer's and Wagenheim's) were written in 1973 and 1974. The books were timed to capitalize on the increase in public interest in Ruth as <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Henry Aaron</a> approached his career home run mark, which he broke on April 8, 1974. As he approached Ruth's record, Aaron stated, "I can't remember a day this year or last when I did not hear the name of Babe Ruth."

Montville suggested that Ruth is probably even more popular today than he was when his career home run record was broken by Aaron. The long ball era that Ruth started continues in baseball, to the delight of the fans. Owners build ballparks to encourage home runs, which are featured on "<a href="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a>" and "<a href="Baseball%20Tonight">Baseball Tonight</a>" each evening during the season. The questions of <a href="performance-enhancing%20drug">performance-enhancing drug</a> use, which dogged later home run hitters such as McGwire and Bonds, do nothing to diminish Ruth's reputation; his overindulgences with beer and hot dogs seem part of a simpler time.

In various surveys and rankings, Ruth has been named the greatest baseball player of all time. In 1998, "<a href="The%20Sporting%20News">The Sporting News</a>" ranked him number one on the list of "Baseball's 100 Greatest Players". In 1999, baseball fans named Ruth to the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Century%20Team">Major League Baseball All-Century Team</a>. He was named baseball's Greatest Player Ever in a ballot commemorating the 100th anniversary of professional baseball in 1969. The <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> reported in 1993 that <a href="Muhammad%20Ali">Muhammad Ali</a> was tied with Babe Ruth as the most recognized athletes in America. In a 1999 ESPN poll, he was ranked as the second-greatest U.S. athlete of the century, behind <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>. In 1983, the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> honored Ruth with the issuance of a twenty-cent stamp.

Several of the most expensive items of <a href="sports%20memorabilia">sports memorabilia</a> and baseball memorabilia ever sold at auction are associated with Ruth. , the most expensive piece of sports memorabilia ever sold is Ruth's 1920 Yankees jersey, which sold for $4,415,658 in 2012. The <a href="baseball%20bat">bat</a> with which he hit the first home run at Yankee Stadium is in "<a href="The%20Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records">The Guinness Book of World Records</a>" as the most expensive baseball bat sold at auction, having fetched $1,265,000 on December 2, 2004. A hat of Ruth's from the 1934 season set a record for a <a href="baseball%20cap">baseball cap</a> when <a href="David%20Wells">David Wells</a> sold it at auction for $537,278 in 2012. In 2017, <a href="Charlie%20Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a> sold Ruth's 1927 World Series ring for $2,093,927 at auction. It easily broke the record for a <a href="championship%20ring">championship ring</a> previously set when <a href="Julius%20Erving">Julius Erving</a>'s <a href="1974%20ABA%20Playoffs">1974 ABA championship</a> ring sold for $460,741 in 2011.
One long-term survivor of the craze over Ruth may be the <a href="Baby%20Ruth">Baby Ruth</a> candy bar. The original company to market the confectionery, the Curtis Candy Company, maintained that the bar was named after <a href="Ruth%20Cleveland">Ruth Cleveland</a>, daughter of former president <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>. She died in 1904 and the bar was first marketed in 1921, at the height of the craze over the slugger. The slugger later sought to market candy bearing his name; he was refused a trademark because of the Baby Ruth bar. Corporate files from 1921 are no longer extant; the brand has changed hands several times and is now owned by the <a href="Nestl%C3%A9">Nestlé</a> company. The Ruth estate licensed his likeness for use in an advertising campaign for Baby Ruth in 1995. Due to a marketing arrangement, in 2005, the Baby Ruth bar became the official candy bar of Major League Baseball.

In 2018, President <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> announced that Ruth, along with <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="Antonin%20Scalia">Antonin Scalia</a>, would posthumously receive the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>. Montville noted the continuing relevance of Babe Ruth in American culture, more than three-quarters of a century after he last swung a bat in a major league game:

Barnard's Star

Barnard's Star is a very-low-mass <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a> about 6 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away from Earth in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> of <a href="Ophiuchus">Ophiuchus</a>. It is the fourth <a href="list%20of%20nearest%20stars">nearest known</a> individual star to the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> (after the three components of the <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> system) and the closest star in the <a href="Northern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Northern Celestial Hemisphere</a>. Despite its proximity, the star has a dim <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of +9.5 and is invisible to the <a href="naked%20eye">unaided eye</a>; it is much brighter in the <a href="infrared">infrared</a> than in <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a>.

The star is named after the American <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a> <a href="Edward%20Emerson%20Barnard">E. E. Barnard</a>. He was not the first to observe the star (it appeared on Harvard University plates in 1888 and 1890), but in 1916 he measured its <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> as 10.3 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc">arcseconds</a> per year relative to the Sun, the highest known for any star.

Barnard's Star is among the most studied red dwarfs because of its proximity and favorable location for observation near the <a href="celestial%20equator">celestial equator</a>. Historically, research on Barnard's Star has focused on measuring its stellar characteristics, its <a href="astrometry">astrometry</a>, and also refining the limits of possible <a href="extrasolar%20planet">extrasolar planet</a>s. Although Barnard's Star is an ancient star, it still experiences <a href="flare%20star">star flare</a> events, one being observed in 1998.

From the early 1960s to the early 1970s, <a href="Peter%20van%20de%20Kamp">Peter van de Kamp</a> argued that there were one or more <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a>s in orbit around it. His specific claims of large gas giants were refuted in the mid-1970s after much debate. 
In November 2018 a candidate <a href="super-Earth">super-Earth</a> planetary companion known as <a href="Barnard%27s%20Star%20b">Barnard's Star b</a> was reported to orbit Barnard's Star. It is believed to have (Earth masses) and orbit at .

In 2016, the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> organized a <a href="IAU%20Working%20Group%20on%20Star%20Names">Working Group on Star Names</a> (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name "Barnard's Star" for this star on 1 February 2017 and it is now included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

Barnard's Star is a red dwarf of the dim <a href="stellar%20classification">spectral type</a> M4, and it is too faint to see without a <a href="telescope">telescope</a>. Its <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> is 9.5.

At 7–12 billion years of age, Barnard's Star is considerably older than the Sun, which is 4.5 billion years old, and it might be among the oldest stars in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy. Barnard's Star has lost a great deal of rotational energy, and the periodic slight changes in its brightness indicate that it rotates once in 130 days (the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> rotates in 25). Given its age, Barnard's Star was long assumed to be quiescent in terms of stellar activity. In 1998, astronomers observed an intense <a href="Solar%20flare">stellar flare</a>, showing that Barnard's Star is a <a href="flare%20star">flare star</a>. Barnard's Star has the <a href="variable%20star%20designation">variable star designation</a> V2500 Ophiuchi. In 2003, Barnard's Star presented the first detectable change in the <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> of a star caused by its motion. Further variability in the radial velocity of Barnard's Star was attributed to its stellar activity.
The proper motion of Barnard's Star corresponds to a relative lateral speed of 90 <a href="Metre%20per%20second">km/s</a>. The 10.3 seconds of arc it travels annually amount to a quarter of a degree in a human lifetime, roughly half the angular diameter of the full Moon.

The radial velocity of Barnard's Star towards the Sun is measured from its <a href="blueshift">blueshift</a> to be −110 km/s. Combined with its proper motion, this gives a <a href="Stellar%20kinematics%23Space%20velocity">space velocity</a> (actual velocity relative to the Sun) of −142.6 ± 0.2 km/s. Barnard's Star will make its closest approach to the Sun around 11,800 AD, when it will approach to within about 3.75 light-years.

<a href="Proxima%20Centauri">Proxima Centauri</a> is the closest star to the Sun at a position currently 4.24 light-years distant from it. However, despite Barnard's Star's even closer pass to the Sun in 11,800 AD, it will still not then be the nearest star, since by that time Proxima Centauri will have moved to a yet-nearer proximity to the Sun. At the time of the star's closest pass by the Sun, Barnard's Star will still be too dim to be seen with the naked eye, since its apparent magnitude will only have increased by one magnitude to about 8.5 by then, still being 2.5 magnitudes short of visibility to the naked eye.

Barnard's Star has a mass of about 0.14 <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>es (), and a radius 15% to 20% of that of the Sun. Thus, although Barnard's Star has roughly 150 times the mass of Jupiter (), its radius is only 1.5 to 2.0 times larger, due to its much higher density. Its <a href="effective%20temperature">effective temperature</a> is 3,100 <a href="kelvin">kelvin</a>, and it has a visual luminosity of 0.0004 <a href="solar%20luminosity">solar luminosities</a>. Barnard's Star is so faint that if it were at the same distance from Earth as the Sun is, it would appear only 100 times brighter than a full moon, comparable to the brightness of the Sun at 80 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s.

Barnard's Star has 10–32% of the solar <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a>. Metallicity is the proportion of stellar mass made up of elements heavier than <a href="helium">helium</a> and helps classify stars relative to the galactic population. Barnard's Star seems to be typical of the old, red dwarf <a href="Stellar%20population">population II stars</a>, yet these are also generally metal-poor <a href="Spiral%20galaxy">halo stars</a>. While sub-solar, Barnard's Star's metallicity is higher than that of a halo star and is in keeping with the low end of the metal-rich <a href="Disc%20%28galaxy%29">disk star</a> range; this, plus its high space motion, have led to the designation "intermediate population II star", between a halo and disk star.

In November 2018 an international team of astronomers announced the detection of a candidate <a href="super-Earth">super-Earth</a> orbiting in relatively close proximity to Barnard's Star. The large team was led by Ignasi Ribas of Spain and their work included two decades of observation, with their observations giving strong evidence that the planet exists.

Dubbed Barnard's Star b, the planet was found near the stellar system's <a href="Frost%20line%20%28astrophysics%29">snow line</a>, which is an ideal spot for the icy accretion of proto-planetary material. It orbits at 0.4 AU every 233 days and has a proposed mass of . The planet is most likely frigid, with an estimated surface temperature of about −170 °C (−275 °F), and lies outside Barnard Star's presumed <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a>. However, more work is needed on the planet's atmospherics to better understand surface conditions. Direct imaging of the planet and its tell-tale <a href="Spectral%20signature">light signature</a> are possible in the decade after its discovery. Further faint and unaccounted for perturbations in the system suggest there may be a second planetary companion even further out.

For a decade from 1963 to about 1973, a substantial number of astronomers accepted a claim by <a href="Peter%20van%20de%20Kamp">Peter van de Kamp</a> that he had detected, by using <a href="Methods%20of%20detecting%20exoplanets%23Astrometry">astrometry</a>, a perturbation in the <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of Barnard's Star consistent with its having one or more planets comparable in mass with <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. Van de Kamp had been observing the star from 1938, attempting, with colleagues at the <a href="Sproul%20Observatory">Sproul Observatory</a> at <a href="Swarthmore%20College">Swarthmore College</a>, to find minuscule variations of one <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a> in its position on <a href="photographic%20plate">photographic plate</a>s consistent with <a href="perturbation%20%28astronomy%29">orbital perturbations</a> that would indicate a planetary companion; this involved as many as ten people averaging their results in looking at plates, to avoid systemic individual errors. Van de Kamp's initial suggestion was a planet having about at a distance of 4.4 AU in a slightly eccentric orbit, and these measurements were apparently refined in a 1969 paper. Later that year, Van de Kamp suggested that there were two planets of 1.1 and .

Other astronomers subsequently repeated Van de Kamp's measurements, and two papers in 1973 undermined the claim of a planet or planets. <a href="George%20David%20Gatewood">George Gatewood</a> and Heinrich Eichhorn, at a different observatory and using newer plate measuring techniques, failed to verify the planetary companion. Another paper published by John L. Hershey four months earlier, also using the Swarthmore observatory, found that changes in the astrometric field of various stars correlated to the timing of adjustments and modifications that had been carried out on the refractor telescope's objective lens; the claimed planet was attributed to an artifact of maintenance and upgrade work. The affair has been discussed as part of a broader scientific review.

Van de Kamp never acknowledged any error and published a further claim of two planets' existence as late as 1982; he died in 1995. <a href="Wulff-Dieter%20Heintz">Wulff Heintz</a>, Van de Kamp's successor at Swarthmore and an expert on <a href="double%20star">double star</a>s, questioned his findings and began publishing criticisms from 1976 onwards. The two men were reported to have become estranged because of this.

For the more than four decades between van de Kamp's rejected claim and the eventual announcement of a planet candidate, Barnard's Star was carefully studied and the mass and orbital boundaries for possible planets were slowly tightened. M dwarfs such as Barnard's Star are more easily studied than larger stars in this regard because their lower masses render perturbations more obvious.

Null results for planetary companions continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including <a href="Interferometry">interferometric</a> work with the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> in 1999. Gatewood was able to show in 1995 that planets with were impossible around Barnard's Star, in a paper which helped refine the negative certainty regarding planetary objects in general. In 1999, the Hubble work further excluded planetary companions of with an orbital period of less than 1,000 days (Jupiter's orbital period is 4,332 days), while Kuerster determined in 2003 that within the <a href="Circumstellar%20habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a> around Barnard's Star, planets are not possible with an ""M" sin "i"" value greater than 7.5 times the mass of the Earth (), or with a mass greater than 3.1 times the mass of Neptune (much lower than van de Kamp's smallest suggested value).

In 2013, a research paper was published that further refined planet mass boundaries for the star. Using radial velocity measurements, taken over a period of 25 years, from the <a href="Lick%20Observatory">Lick</a> and <a href="W.%20M.%20Keck%20Observatory">Keck</a> Observatories and applying <a href="Monte%20Carlo%20method">Monte Carlo analysis</a> for both circular and eccentric orbits, upper masses for planets out to 1,000-day orbits were determined. Planets above two Earth masses in orbits of less than 10 days were excluded, and planets of more than ten Earth masses out to a two-year orbit were also confidently ruled out. It was also discovered that the habitable zone of the star seemed to be devoid of roughly Earth-mass planets or larger, save for face-on orbits.

Even though this research greatly restricted the possible properties of planets around Barnard's Star, it did not rule them out completely as <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a>s were always going to be difficult to detect. <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="Space%20Interferometry%20Mission">Space Interferometry Mission</a>, which was to begin searching for extrasolar Earth-like planets, was reported to have chosen Barnard's Star as an early search target. This mission was shut down in 2010. <a href="European%20Space%20Agency">ESA</a>'s similar <a href="Darwin%20%28ESA%29">Darwin</a> interferometry mission had the same goal, but was stripped of funding in 2007.

The analysis of radial velocities that eventually led to discovery of the candidate super-Earth orbiting Barnard's Star was also used to set more precise upper mass limits for possible planets, up to and within the habitable zone: a maximum of up to the inner edge and on the outer edge of the optimistic habitable zone, corresponding to orbital periods of up to 10 and 40 days respectively. Therefore, it appears that Barnard's Star indeed does not host Earth-mass planets, or larger, in hot and temperate orbits, unlike other M-dwarf stars that commonly have these type of planets in close-in orbits.

Barnard's Star was studied as part of <a href="Project%20Daedalus">Project Daedalus</a>. Undertaken between 1973 and 1978, the study suggested that rapid, unmanned travel to another star system was possible with existing or near-future technology. Barnard's Star was chosen as a target partly because it was believed to have planets.

The theoretical model suggested that a nuclear pulse rocket employing <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> (specifically, electron bombardment of <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> and <a href="helium-3">helium-3</a>) and accelerating for four years could achieve a velocity of 12% of the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>. The star could then be reached in 50 years, within a human lifetime. Along with detailed investigation of the star and any companions, the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> would be examined and baseline astrometric readings performed.

The initial Project Daedalus model sparked further theoretical research. In 1980, <a href="Robert%20Freitas">Robert Freitas</a> suggested a more ambitious plan: a <a href="self-replicating%20spacecraft">self-replicating spacecraft</a> intended to search for and make contact with <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrial life</a>. Built and launched in <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s orbit, it would reach Barnard's Star in 47 years under parameters similar to those of the original Project Daedalus. Once at the star, it would begin automated self-replication, constructing a factory, initially to manufacture exploratory probes and eventually to create a copy of the original spacecraft after 1,000 years.

In 1998 a <a href="Solar%20flare">stellar flare</a> on Barnard's Star was detected based on changes in the <a href="Emission%20spectrum">spectral emissions</a> on 17 July during an unrelated search for variations in the proper motion. Four years passed before the flare was fully analyzed, at which point it was suggested that the flare's temperature was 8000 K, more than twice the normal temperature of the star. Given the essentially random nature of flares, Diane Paulson, one of the authors of that study, noted that "the star would be fantastic for amateurs to observe".
The flare was surprising because intense stellar activity is not expected in stars of such age. Flares are not completely understood, but are believed to be caused by strong <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s, which suppress <a href="plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a> <a href="convection">convection</a> and lead to sudden outbursts: strong magnetic fields occur in rapidly rotating stars, while old stars tend to rotate slowly. For Barnard's Star to undergo an event of such magnitude is thus presumed to be a rarity. Research on the star's periodicity, or changes in stellar activity over a given timescale, also suggest it ought to be quiescent; 1998 research showed weak evidence for periodic variation in the star's brightness, noting only one possible starspot over 130 days.

Stellar activity of this sort has created interest in using Barnard's Star as a proxy to understand similar stars. It is hoped that photometric studies of its <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> and <a href="Ultraviolet">UV</a> emissions will shed light on the large population of old M dwarfs in the galaxy. Such research has <a href="astrobiology">astrobiological</a> implications: given that the habitable zones of M dwarfs are close to the star, any planets would be strongly influenced by solar flares, winds, and plasma ejection events.

Barnard's Star shares much the same neighborhood as the Sun. The neighbors of Barnard's Star are generally of red dwarf size, the smallest and most common star type. Its closest neighbor is currently the red dwarf <a href="Ross%20154">Ross 154</a>, at 1.66 <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s' (5.41 light-years) distance. The Sun and <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> are, respectively, the next closest systems. From Barnard's Star, the Sun would appear on the diametrically opposite side of the sky at coordinates RA=, Dec=, in the eastern part of the constellation <a href="Monoceros">Monoceros</a>. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is 4.83, and at a distance of 1.834 parsecs, it would be a first-magnitude star, as <a href="Pollux%20%28star%29">Pollux</a> is from the Earth.

Binary search algorithm

In <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a <a href="search%20algorithm">search algorithm</a> that finds the position of a target value within a <a href="sorted%20array">sorted array</a>. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array. Even though the idea is simple, implementing binary search correctly requires attention to some subtleties about its exit conditions and midpoint calculation, particularly if the values in the array are not all of the whole numbers in the range.

Binary search runs in <a href="Time%20complexity%23Logarithmic%20time">logarithmic time</a> in the <a href="Best%2C%20worst%20and%20average%20case">worst case</a>, making comparisons, where is the number of elements in the array, the is <a href="Big%20O%20notation">Big O notation</a>, and is the <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a>. Binary search takes constant () space, meaning that the space taken by the algorithm is the same for any number of elements in the array. Binary search is faster than <a href="linear%20search">linear search</a> except for small arrays, but the array must be sorted first. Although specialized <a href="data%20structures">data structures</a> designed for fast searching, such as <a href="hash%20tables">hash tables</a>, can be searched more efficiently, binary search applies to a wider range of problems.

There are numerous variations of binary search. In particular, <a href="fractional%20cascading">fractional cascading</a> speeds up binary searches for the same value in multiple arrays. Fractional cascading efficiently solves a number of search problems in <a href="computational%20geometry">computational geometry</a> and in numerous other fields. <a href="Exponential%20search">Exponential search</a> extends binary search to unbounded lists. The <a href="binary%20search%20tree">binary search tree</a> and <a href="B-tree">B-tree</a> data structures are based on binary search.

Binary search works on sorted arrays. Binary search begins by comparing the middle element of the array with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, its position in the array is returned. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of the array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the upper half of the array. By doing this, the algorithm eliminates the half in which the target value cannot lie in each iteration.

Given an array formula_1 of formula_2 elements with values or <a href="Record%20%28computer%20science%29">records</a> formula_3sorted such that formula_4, and target value formula_5, the following <a href="subroutine">subroutine</a> uses binary search to find the index of formula_5 in formula_1.

This iterative procedure keeps track of the search boundaries with the two variables formula_8 and formula_10. The procedure may be expressed in <a href="pseudocode">pseudocode</a> as follows, where the variable names and types remain the same as above, codice_1 is the floor function, and codice_2 refers to a specific value that conveys the failure of the search.

In the above procedure, the algorithm checks whether the middle element (formula_13) is equal to the target (formula_5) in every iteration. Some implementations leave out this check during each iteration. The algorithm would perform this check only when one element is left (when formula_28). This results in a faster comparison loop, as one comparison is eliminated per iteration. However, it requires one more iteration on average.

<a href="Hermann%20Bottenbruch">Hermann Bottenbruch</a> published the first implementation to leave out this check in 1962.


The procedure may return any index whose element is equal to the target value, even if there are duplicate elements in the array. For example, if the array to be searched was formula_45 and the target was formula_46, then it would be correct for the algorithm to either return the 4th (index 3) or 5th (index 4) element. The regular procedure would return the 4th element (index 3). However, it is sometimes necessary to find the leftmost element or the rightmost element if the target value is duplicated in the array. In the above example, the 4th element is the leftmost element of the value 4, while the 5th element is the rightmost element of the value 4. The alternative procedure above will always return the index of the rightmost element if an element is duplicated in the array.

To find the leftmost element, the following procedure can be used:


If formula_63 and formula_64, then formula_65 is the leftmost element that equals formula_5. Even if formula_5 is not in the array, formula_8 is the <a href="%23Approximate%20matches">rank</a> of formula_5 in the array, or the number of elements in the array that are less than formula_5.

Where codice_1 is the floor function, the pseudocode for this version is:

To find the rightmost element, the following procedure can be used:


If formula_87 and formula_88, then formula_89 is the rightmost element that equals formula_5. Even if "formula_5" is not in the array, formula_92 is the number of elements in the array that are greater than "formula_5".

Where codice_1 is the floor function, the pseudocode for this version is:

The above procedure only performs "exact" matches, finding the position of a target value. However, it is trivial to extend binary search to perform approximate matches because binary search operates on sorted arrays. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and <a href="Nearest%20neighbor%20search">nearest neighbor</a>. <a href="Range%20query%20%28data%20structures%29">Range queries</a> seeking the number of elements between two values can be performed with two rank queries.

The performance of binary search can be analyzed by reducing the procedure to a binary comparison tree. The root node of the tree is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root. The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. This model represents binary search. Starting from the root node, the left or right subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration. This represents the successive elimination of elements.

In the worst case, binary search makes formula_98 iterations of the comparison loop, where the formula_99 notation denotes the <a href="floor%20function">floor function</a> that yields the greatest integer less than or equal to the argument, and formula_100 is the <a href="binary%20logarithm">binary logarithm</a>. The worst case is reached when the search reaches the deepest level of the tree. This is equivalent to a binary search that has reduced to one element and always eliminates the smaller subarray out of the two in each iteration if they are not of equal size.

The worst case may also be reached when the target element is not in the array. If formula_101 is one less than a power of two, then this is always the case. Otherwise, the search may perform formula_98iterations if the search reaches the deepest level of the tree. However, it may make formula_103 iterations, which is one less than the worst case, if the search ends at the second-deepest level of the tree.

On average, assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, binary search makes formula_104 iterations when the target element is in the array. This is approximately equal to formula_105 iterations. When the target element is not in the array, binary search makes formula_106 iterations on average, assuming that the range between and outside elements is equally likely to be searched.

In the best case, where the target value is the middle element of the array, its position is returned after one iteration.

In terms of iterations, no search algorithm that works only by comparing elements can exhibit better average and worst-case performance than binary search. The comparison tree representing binary search has the fewest levels possible as every level above the lowest level of the tree is filled completely. Otherwise, the search algorithm can eliminate few elements in an iteration, increasing the number of iterations required in the average and worst case. This is the case for other search algorithms based on comparisons, as while they may work faster on some target values, the average performance over "all" elements is worse than binary search. By dividing the array in half, binary search ensures that the size of both subarrays are as similar as possible.

The average number of iterations performed by binary search depends on the probability of each element being searched. The average case is different for successful searches and unsuccessful searches. It will be assumed that each element is equally likely to be searched for successful searches. For unsuccessful searches, it will be assumed that the <a href="Interval%20%28mathematics%29">intervals</a> between and outside elements are equally likely to be searched. The average case for successful searches is the number of iterations required to search every element exactly once, divided by formula_2, the number of elements. The average case for unsuccessful searches is the number of iterations required to search an element within every interval exactly once, divided by the formula_108 intervals.

In the binary tree representation, a successful search can be represented by a path from the root to the target node, called an "internal path". The length of a path is the number of edges (connections between nodes) that the path passes through. The number of iterations performed by a search, given that the corresponding path has length formula_109, is formula_110 counting the initial iteration. The "internal path length" is the sum of the lengths of all unique internal paths. Since there is only one path from the root to any single node, each internal path represents a search for a specific element. If there are formula_2 elements, which is a positive integer, and the internal path length is formula_112, then the average number of iterations for a successful search formula_113, with the one iteration added to count the initial iteration.

Since binary search is the optimal algorithm for searching with comparisons, this problem is reduced to calculating the minimum internal path length of all binary trees with formula_2 nodes, which is equal to:

formula_115

For example, in a 7-element array, the root requires one iteration, the two elements below the root require two iterations, and the four elements below require three iterations. In this case, the internal path length is:

formula_116

The average number of iterations would be formula_117 based on the equation for the average case. The sum for formula_112 can be simplified to:

formula_119

Substituting the equation for formula_112 into the equation for formula_121:

formula_122

For integer formula_2, this is equivalent to the equation for the average case on a successful search specified above.

Unsuccessful searches can be represented by augmenting the tree with "external nodes", which forms an "extended binary tree". If an internal node, or a node present in the tree, has fewer than two child nodes, then additional child nodes, called external nodes, are added so that each internal node has two children. By doing so, an unsuccessful search can be represented as a path to an external node, whose parent is the single element that remains during the last iteration. An "external path" is a path from the root to an external node. The "external path length" is the sum of the lengths of all unique external paths. If there are formula_2 elements, which is a positive integer, and the external path length is formula_125, then the average number of iterations for an unsuccessful search formula_126. The external path length is divided by formula_127 instead of formula_2 because there are formula_127 external paths, representing the intervals between and outside the elements of the array.

This problem can similarly be reduced to determining the minimum external path length of all binary trees with formula_2 nodes. For all binary trees, the external path length is equal to the internal path length plus formula_131. Substituting the equation for formula_112:

formula_133

Substituting the equation for formula_125 into the equation for formula_135, the average case for unsuccessful searches can be determined:

formula_136

Each iteration of the binary search procedure defined above makes one or two comparisons, checking if the middle element is equal to the target in each iteration. Assuming that each element is equally likely to be searched, each iteration makes 1.5 comparisons on average. A variation of the algorithm checks whether the middle element is equal to the target at the end of the search. On average, this eliminates half a comparison from each iteration. This slightly cuts the time taken per iteration on most computers. However, it guarantees that the search takes the maximum number of iterations, on average adding one iteration to the search. Because the comparison loop is performed only formula_98 times in the worst case, the slight increase in efficiency per iteration does not compensate for the extra iteration for all but enormous formula_101.

Sorted arrays with binary search are a very inefficient solution when insertion and deletion operations are interleaved with retrieval, taking formula_139 time for each such operation. In addition, sorted arrays can complicate memory use especially when elements are often inserted into the array. There are other data structures that support much more efficient insertion and deletion. Binary search can be used to perform exact matching and <a href="Set%20%28abstract%20data%20type%29">set membership</a> (determining whether a target value is in a collection of values). There are data structures that support faster exact matching and set membership. However, unlike many other searching schemes, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching, usually performing such matches in formula_140 time regardless of the type or structure of the values themselves. In addition, there are some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, that can be performed efficiently on a sorted array.

For implementing <a href="associative%20arrays">associative arrays</a>, <a href="hash%20table">hash table</a>s, a data structure that maps keys to <a href="record%20%28computer%20science%29">records</a> using a <a href="hash%20function">hash function</a>, are generally faster than binary search on a sorted array of records. Most hash table implementations require only <a href="Amortized%20analysis">amortized</a> constant time on average. However, hashing is not useful for approximate matches, such as computing the next-smallest, next-largest, and nearest key, as the only information given on a failed search is that the target is not present in any record. Binary search is ideal for such matches, performing them in logarithmic time. Binary search also supports approximate matches. Some operations, like finding the smallest and largest element, can be done efficiently on sorted arrays but not on hash tables.

A <a href="binary%20search%20tree">binary search tree</a> is a <a href="binary%20tree">binary tree</a> data structure that works based on the principle of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in binary search trees. This can be faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.

However, binary search is usually more efficient for searching as binary search trees will most likely be imperfectly balanced, resulting in slightly worse performance than binary search. This even applies to <a href="balanced%20binary%20search%20tree">balanced binary search tree</a>s, binary search trees that balance their own nodes, because they rarely produce "optimally"-balanced trees. Although unlikely, the tree may be severely imbalanced with few internal nodes with two children, resulting in the average and worst-case search time approaching formula_101 comparisons. Binary search trees take more space than sorted arrays.

Binary search trees lend themselves to fast searching in external memory stored in hard disks, as binary search trees can efficiently be structured in filesystems. The <a href="B-tree">B-tree</a> generalizes this method of tree organization. B-trees are frequently used to organize long-term storage such as <a href="database">database</a>s and <a href="filesystem">filesystem</a>s.

<a href="Linear%20search">Linear search</a> is a simple search algorithm that checks every record until it finds the target value. Linear search can be done on a linked list, which allows for faster insertion and deletion than an array. Binary search is faster than linear search for sorted arrays except if the array is short, although the array needs to be sorted beforehand. All <a href="sorting%20algorithm">sorting algorithm</a>s based on comparing elements, such as <a href="quicksort">quicksort</a> and <a href="merge%20sort">merge sort</a>, require at least formula_142 comparisons in the worst case. Unlike linear search, binary search can be used for efficient approximate matching. There are operations such as finding the smallest and largest element that can be done efficiently on a sorted array but not on an unsorted array.

A related problem to search is <a href="Set%20%28abstract%20data%20type%29">set membership</a>. Any algorithm that does lookup, like binary search, can also be used for set membership. There are other algorithms that are more specifically suited for set membership. A <a href="bit%20array">bit array</a> is the simplest, useful when the range of keys is limited. It compactly stores a collection of <a href="bit">bit</a>s, with each bit representing a single key within the range of keys. Bit arrays are very fast, requiring only formula_143 time. The Judy1 type of <a href="Judy%20array">Judy array</a> handles 64-bit keys efficiently.

For approximate results, <a href="Bloom%20filter">Bloom filter</a>s, another probabilistic data structure based on hashing, store a <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> of keys by encoding the keys using a <a href="bit%20array">bit array</a> and multiple hash functions. Bloom filters are much more space-efficient than bit arrays in most cases and not much slower: with formula_144 hash functions, membership queries require only formula_145 time. However, Bloom filters suffer from <a href="False%20positives%20and%20false%20negatives">false positives</a>.

There exist data structures that may improve on binary search in some cases for both searching and other operations available for sorted arrays. For example, searches, approximate matches, and the operations available to sorted arrays can be performed more efficiently than binary search on specialized data structures such as <a href="van%20Emde%20Boas%20tree">van Emde Boas tree</a>s, <a href="fusion%20tree">fusion tree</a>s, <a href="trie">trie</a>s, and <a href="bit%20array">bit array</a>s. These specialized data structures are usually only faster because they take advantage of the properties of keys with a certain attribute (usually keys that are small integers), and thus will be time or space consuming for keys that lack that attribute. As long as the keys can be ordered, these operations can always be done at least efficiently on a sorted array regardless of the keys. Some structures, such as Judy arrays, use a combination of approaches to mitigate this while retaining efficiency and the ability to perform approximate matching.

Uniform binary search stores, instead of the lower and upper bounds, the index of the middle element and the change in the middle element from the current iteration to the next iteration. Each step reduces the change by about half. For example, if the array to be searched is formula_146, the middle element would be formula_147. Uniform binary search works on the basis that the difference between the index of middle element of the array and the left and right subarrays is the same. In this case, the middle element of the left subarray (formula_148) is formula_149 and the middle element of the right subarray (formula_150) is formula_151. Uniform binary search would store the value of formula_149 as both indices differ from formula_147 by this same amount. To reduce the search space, the algorithm either adds or subtracts this change from the middle element. The main advantage of uniform binary search is that the procedure can store a table of the differences between indices for each iteration of the procedure. Uniform binary search may be faster on systems where it is inefficient to calculate the midpoint, such as on <a href="decimal%20computer">decimal computer</a>s.

Exponential search extends binary search to unbounded lists. It starts by finding the first element with an index that is both a power of two and greater than the target value. Afterwards, it sets that index as the upper bound, and switches to binary search. A search takes formula_154 iterations of the exponential search and at most formula_155 iterations of the binary search, where formula_156 is the position of the target value. Exponential search works on bounded lists, but becomes an improvement over binary search only if the target value lies near the beginning of the array.

Instead of calculating the midpoint, interpolation search estimates the position of the target value, taking into account the lowest and highest elements in the array as well as length of the array. This is only possible if the array elements are numbers. It works on the basis that the midpoint is not the best guess in many cases. For example, if the target value is close to the highest element in the array, it is likely to be located near the end of the array. When the distribution of the array elements is uniform or near uniform, it makes formula_157 comparisons.

In practice, interpolation search is slower than binary search for small arrays, as interpolation search requires extra computation. Its time complexity grows more slowly than binary search, but this only compensates for the extra computation for large arrays.

Fractional cascading is a technique that speeds up binary searches for the same element in multiple sorted arrays. Searching each array separately requires formula_158 time, where formula_144 is the number of arrays. Fractional cascading reduces this to formula_160 by storing specific information in each array about each element and its position in the other arrays.

Fractional cascading was originally developed to efficiently solve various <a href="computational%20geometry">computational geometry</a> problems. Fractional cascading has been applied elsewhere, such as in <a href="data%20mining">data mining</a> and <a href="Internet%20Protocol">Internet Protocol</a> routing.

Noisy binary search algorithms solve the case where the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array. For each pair of elements, there is a certain probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position.

Classical computers are bounded to the worst case of exactly formula_161 iterations when performing binary search. <a href="Quantum%20algorithm">Quantum algorithm</a>s for binary search are still bounded to a proportion of formula_162 queries (representing iterations of the classical procedure), but the constant factor is less than one, providing for faster performance on <a href="quantum%20computing">quantum computers</a>. Any "exact" quantum binary search procedure—that is, a procedure that always yields the correct result—requires at least formula_163 queries in the worst case, where formula_164 is the <a href="natural%20logarithm">natural logarithm</a>. There is an exact quantum binary search procedure that runs in formula_165 queries in the worst case. In comparison, <a href="Grover%27s%20algorithm">Grover's algorithm</a> is the optimal quantum algorithm for searching an unordered list of elements, and it requires formula_166 queries.

In 1946, <a href="John%20Mauchly">John Mauchly</a> made the first mention of binary search as part of the <a href="Moore%20School%20Lectures">Moore School Lectures</a>, a seminal and foundational college course in computing. In 1957, <a href="W.%20Wesley%20Peterson">William Wesley Peterson</a> published the first method for interpolation search. Every published binary search algorithm worked only for arrays whose length is one less than a power of two until 1960, when <a href="Derrick%20Henry%20Lehmer">Derrick Henry Lehmer</a> published a binary search algorithm that worked on all arrays. In 1962, Hermann Bottenbruch presented an <a href="ALGOL%2060">ALGOL 60</a> implementation of binary search that placed the <a href="%23Alternative%20procedure">comparison for equality at the end</a>, increasing the average number of iterations by one, but reducing to one the number of comparisons per iteration. The <a href="%23Uniform%20binary%20search">uniform binary search</a> was developed by A. K. Chandra of <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a> in 1971. In 1986, <a href="Bernard%20Chazelle">Bernard Chazelle</a> and <a href="Leonidas%20J.%20Guibas">Leonidas J. Guibas</a> introduced <a href="fractional%20cascading">fractional cascading</a> as a method to solve numerous search problems in <a href="computational%20geometry">computational geometry</a>.

Although the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky ... — <a href="Donald%20Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>

When <a href="Jon%20Bentley%20%28computer%20scientist%29">Jon Bentley</a> assigned binary search as a problem in a course for professional programmers, he found that ninety percent failed to provide a correct solution after several hours of working on it, mainly because the incorrect implementations failed to run or returned a wrong answer in rare <a href="edge%20case">edge case</a>s. A study published in 1988 shows that accurate code for it is only found in five out of twenty textbooks. Furthermore, Bentley's own implementation of binary search, published in his 1986 book "Programming Pearls", contained an <a href="Integer%20overflow">overflow error</a> that remained undetected for over twenty years. The <a href="Java%20%28programming%20language%29">Java programming language</a> library implementation of binary search had the same overflow bug for more than nine years.

In a practical implementation, the variables used to represent the indices will often be of fixed size, and this can result in an <a href="integer%20overflow">arithmetic overflow</a> for very large arrays. If the midpoint of the span is calculated as formula_14, then the value of formula_168 may exceed the range of integers of the data type used to store the midpoint, even if formula_8 and formula_10 are within the range. If "formula_8" and "formula_10" are nonnegative, this can be avoided by calculating the midpoint as formula_173.

If the target value is greater than the greatest value in the array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of "formula_8", the value of "formula_8" will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar problem will occur if the target value is smaller than the least value in the array and the first index of the array is the smallest representable value of "formula_10". In particular, this means that "formula_10" must not be an unsigned type if the array starts with index formula_9.

An infinite loop may occur if the exit conditions for the loop are not defined correctly. Once "formula_8" exceeds "formula_10", the search has failed and must convey the failure of the search. In addition, the loop must be exited when the target element is found, or in the case of an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that most of the programmers who incorrectly implemented binary search made an error in defining the exit conditions.

Many languages' <a href="standard%20library">standard libraries</a> include binary search routines:

Although beagle-type dogs have existed for 2,500 years, the modern breed was developed in <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> around the 1830s from several breeds, including the <a href="Talbot%20%28dog%29">Talbot Hound</a>, the <a href="North%20Country%20Beagle">North Country Beagle</a>, the <a href="Southern%20Hound">Southern Hound</a>, and possibly the <a href="Harrier%20%28dog%29">Harrier</a>.

Dogs of similar size and purpose to the modern beagle can be traced in <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greece</a>
back to around the 5th century BC. <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>, born around 430 BC, in his "Treatise on Hunting" or "<a href="Cynegeticus">Cynegeticus</a>" refers to a <a href="hound">hound</a> that hunted hares by scent and was followed on foot. Small hounds are mentioned in the Forest Laws of <a href="Canute%20the%20Great">Canute</a> which exempted them from the ordinance which commanded that all dogs capable of running down a <a href="Deer">stag</a> should have one foot mutilated. If genuine, these laws would confirm that beagle-type dogs were present in England before 1016, but it is likely the laws were written in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> to give a sense of antiquity and tradition to Forest Law.

In the 11th century, <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a> brought the <a href="Talbot%20%28dog%29">Talbot hound</a> to Britain. The Talbot was a predominantly white, slow, deep-throated, scent hound derived from the <a href="St.%20Hubert%20Hound">St. Hubert Hound</a> which had been developed in the 8th century. At some point the English Talbots were crossed with <a href="Greyhound">Greyhound</a>s to give them an extra turn of speed. Long extinct, the Talbot strain probably gave rise to the Southern Hound which, in turn, is thought to be an ancestor of the modern-day beagle.

From medieval times, "beagle" was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed. Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of <a href="Edward%20II%20of%20England">Edward II</a> and <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth I</a> kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood at the shoulder. Small enough to fit in a "pocket" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt. The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush. Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her "singing beagles" and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups. 19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety. In George Jesse's "Researches into the History of the British Dog" from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer <a href="Gervase%20Markham">Gervase Markham</a> is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety.

By the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the <a href="Southern%20Hound">Southern Hound</a> and the <a href="North%20Country%20Beagle">North Country Beagle</a> (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the <a href="River%20Trent">River Trent</a> and probably closely related to the <a href="Talbot%20%28dog%29">Talbot Hound</a>. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed. As <a href="fox%20hunting">fox hunting</a> became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern <a href="English%20Foxhound">Foxhound</a>. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small <a href="rabbit-hunting">rabbit-hunting</a> packs.

Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a beagle pack in <a href="Essex">Essex</a> in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern breed. Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; <a href="William%20Youatt">William Youatt</a> suspected that <a href="Harrier%20%28dog%29">Harriers</a> formed a good majority of the beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure. Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in "The Sportsman's Library" in 1845). <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> and <a href="Edward%20Turnour%2C%204th%20Earl%20Winterton">Lord Winterton</a> also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favour no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three.

Although credited with the development of the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.

In the 1840s, a standard beagle type was beginning to develop; the distinction between the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound had been lost, but there was still a large variation in size, character, and reliability among the emerging packs. In 1856, "Stonehenge" (the pseudonym of <a href="John%20Henry%20Walsh">John Henry Walsh</a>), writing in the "Manual of British Rural Sports", was still dividing beagles into four varieties: the medium beagle; the dwarf or lapdog beagle; the fox beagle (a smaller, slower version of the Foxhound); and the rough-coated or terrier beagle, which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the Scottish <a href="terrier">terrier</a> breeds. Stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description:

By 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England. The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time. The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed. Both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle. By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44.

Beagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged <a href="Dachshund">Dachshund</a>s with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General <a href="Richard%20Rowett">Richard Rowett</a> from <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">American Kennel Club</a> (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.

The average size of a beagle litter is six puppies. When mother beagles give birth to litters of puppies, the little pups weigh just a few ounces each.

On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at <a href="Peterborough">Peterborough</a> that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896. The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> when all shows were suspended. After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low. A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the breed was once again doing well. Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered.

As purebred dogs, beagles have always been more popular in the United States and Canada than in their native country England. The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a beagle had won a Best in Show title. As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased. In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the <a href="Westminster%20Kennel%20Club">Westminster Kennel Club</a>'s show and by 1939 a beagle – Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman – had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year. On 12 February 2008, a beagle, <a href="K-Run%27s%20Park%20Me%20In%20First">K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno)</a>, won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show for the first time in the competition's history. In North America they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over 30 years. From 1953 to 1959 the beagle was ranked No. 1 on the list of the <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">American Kennel Club</a>'s registered breeds; in 2005 and 2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered. In the UK they are not quite so popular, placing 28th and 30th in the rankings of registrations with the Kennel Club in 2005 and 2006 respectively. In the United States the beagle ranked 4th most popular breed in 2012 and 2013, behind the <a href="Labrador%20Retriever">Labrador Retriever</a> (#1), <a href="German%20Shepherd">German Shepherd</a> (#2) and <a href="Golden%20Retriever">Golden Retriever</a> (#3) breeds.

According to the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>", the first mention of the beagle by name in English literature dates from c. 1475 in "<a href="The%20Squire%20of%20Low%20Degree">The Squire of Low Degree</a>". The origin of the word "beagle" is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the French "begueule". 

It is not known why the black and tan <a href="Kerry%20Beagle">Kerry Beagle</a>, present in Ireland since <a href="Celt">Celt</a>ic times, has the "beagle" description, since at it is significantly taller than the modern day beagle, and in earlier times was even larger. Some writers suggest that the beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the Kerry Beagle. Originally used for hunting stags, it is today used for hare and <a href="drag%20hunting">drag hunting</a>.

The general appearance of the beagle resembles a miniature <a href="Foxhound">Foxhound</a>, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body. They are generally between high at the <a href="withers">withers</a> and weigh between , with females being slightly smaller than males on average.

They have a smooth, somewhat domed <a href="skull">skull</a> with a medium-length, square-cut <a href="snout">muzzle</a> and a black (or occasionally liver) gumdrop nose. The jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw. The eyes are large, hazel or brown, with a mild hound-like pleading look. The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips. Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a <a href="dewlap">dewlap</a>; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a> and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the "stern") tipped with white. The white tip, known as the flag has been selectively bred for, as it allows the dog to be easily seen when its head is down following a scent. The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active. The beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat. The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the <a href="Stifle%20joint">stifles</a>.

The tricolored beaglewhite with large black areas and light brown shadingis the most common. Tricolored beagles occur in a number of shades, from the "Classic Tri" with a jet black saddle (also known as "Blackback"), to the "Dark Tri" (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the "Faded Tri" (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings). Some tricolored dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as "pied". These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair. Tricolor beagles are almost always born black and white. The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures. (The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.) Some beagles gradually change color during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely.

Two-color varieties always have a white base color with areas of the second color. Tan and white is the most common two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black. Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes. Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks ("ticking"), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the <a href="Bluetick%20Coonhound">Bluetick Coonhound</a>. Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas.

Alongside the <a href="Bloodhound">Bloodhound</a> and <a href="Basset%20Hound">Basset Hound</a>, the beagle has one of the best developed senses of smell of any dog. In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior. As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-<a href="acre">acre</a> field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it. The beagles found it in less than a minute, while <a href="Fox%20Terrier">Fox Terrier</a>s took 15 minutes and <a href="Scottish%20Terrier">Scottish Terrier</a>s failed to find it at all. Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most <a href="mountain%20rescue">mountain rescue</a> teams in favor of <a href="collie">collie</a>s, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable. The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose.

The <a href="American%20Kennel%20Club">American Kennel Club</a> recognizes two separate varieties of beagle: the 13-inch for hounds less than , and the 15-inch for those between . The <a href="Canadian%20Kennel%20Club">Canadian Kennel Club</a> recognizes a single type, with a height not exceeding . The <a href="Kennel%20Club%20%28UK%29">Kennel Club (UK)</a> and <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Cynologique%20Internationale">FCI</a> affiliated clubs recognize a single type, with a height of between .

English and American varieties are sometimes mentioned. However, there is no official recognition from any Kennel Club for this distinction. Beagles fitting the American Kennel Club standard – which disallows animals over – are smaller on average than those fitting the Kennel Club standard which allows heights up to .

Pocket Beagles are sometimes advertised for sale but while the UK Kennel Club originally specified a standard for the Pocket Beagle in 1901, the variety is now not recognized by any Kennel Club.
A strain known as Patch Hounds was developed by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability. They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking.

In the 1850s, Stonehenge recommended a cross between a Beagle and a <a href="Scottish%20Terrier">Scottish Terrier</a> as a retriever. He found the <a href="crossbreed">crossbreed</a> to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare.

More recently the trend has been for "<a href="dog%20crossbreeds">designer dogs</a>" and one of the most popular has been the Beagle/<a href="Pug">Pug</a> cross known as a <a href="Puggle">Puggle</a>. Some puppies of this cross are less excitable than a Beagle and with a lower exercise requirement, similar to the Pug parent; but many are highly excitable and require vigorous exercise.

The beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition. Described in several breed standards as "merry", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends on the individual. They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over. They make poor <a href="guard%20dogs">guard dogs</a> for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs. In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the <a href="Yorkshire%20Terrier">Yorkshire Terrier</a>, <a href="Cairn%20Terrier">Cairn Terrier</a>, <a href="Miniature%20Schnauzer">Miniature Schnauzer</a>, <a href="West%20Highland%20White%20Terrier">West Highland White Terrier</a>, and <a href="Fox%20Terrier">Fox Terrier</a>.

Beagles are intelligent but, as a result of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in <a href="Stanley%20Coren">Stanley Coren</a>'s "<a href="The%20Intelligence%20of%20Dogs">The Intelligence of Dogs</a>", as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.

Beagles are excellent with children and this is one of the reasons they have became popular family pets. But as beagles are pack animals, they are prone to <a href="separation%20anxiety%20in%20dogs">separation anxiety</a>, a condition which causes them to destroy things when left unattended. Not all beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as "speaking", "giving tongue", or "opening") when they catch the scent of potential quarry. They also generally get along well with cats and other dogs. They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest. Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone.

The typical longevity of beagles is 12–15 years, which is a common lifespan for dogs of their size.

Beagles may be prone to <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a>, but this can often be controlled with medication. <a href="Hypothyroidism">Hypothyroidism</a> and a number of types of <a href="dwarfism">dwarfism</a> occur in beagles. Two conditions in particular are unique to the breed: "Funny Puppy", in which the puppy is slow to develop and eventually develops weak legs, a crooked back and although normally healthy, is prone to a range of illnesses; <a href="Hip%20dysplasia%20%28canine%29">Hip dysplasia</a>, common in Harriers and in some larger breeds, is rarely considered a problem in beagles. Beagles are considered a <a href="chondrodystrophy">chondrodystrophic</a> breed, meaning that they are prone to types of disk diseases.

In rare cases, beagles may develop <a href="immune%20mediated%20polygenic%20arthritis">immune mediated polygenic arthritis</a> (where the immune system attacks the joints) even at a young age. The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by <a href="Corticosteroid%23Uses">steroid</a> treatments. Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal <a href="Cerebellar%20abiotrophy">cerebellar cortical degeneration</a>. Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait. It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%. A genetic test is available.

Their long floppy ears can mean that the inner ear does not receive a substantial air flow or that moist air becomes trapped, and this can lead to ear infections. Beagles may also be affected by a range of eye problems; two common ophthalmic conditions in beagles are <a href="Canine%20glaucoma">glaucoma</a> and <a href="Corneal%20dystrophies%20in%20dogs">corneal dystrophy</a>. "<a href="Cherry%20eye">Cherry eye</a>", a prolapse of the gland of the <a href="third%20eyelid">third eyelid</a>, and <a href="distichiasis">distichiasis</a>, a condition in which eyelashes grow into the eye causing irritation, sometimes exist; both these conditions can be corrected with surgery. They can suffer from several types of <a href="retinal%20atrophy">retinal atrophy</a>. Failure of the nasolacrimal drainage system can cause dry eye or leakage of tears onto the face.

As field dogs they are prone to minor injuries such as cuts and sprains, and, if inactive, obesity is a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight. When working or running free they are also likely to pick up parasites such as <a href="flea">flea</a>s, <a href="tick">tick</a>s, <a href="harvest%20mite">harvest mite</a>s, and <a href="tapeworm">tapeworm</a>s, and irritants such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes, soft ears, or paws.

Beagles may exhibit a behaviour known as <a href="reverse%20sneezing">reverse sneezing</a>, in which they sound as if they are choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose. The exact cause of this behaviour is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog.

Beagles were developed primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as <a href="beagling">beagling</a>. They were seen as ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who could not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses. Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill. In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare. The beagle packs would run closely together ("so close that they might be covered with a sheet") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail. In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to <a href="spaniel">spaniel</a>s when hunting <a href="pheasant">pheasant</a>.

With the fashion for faster hunts, the beagle fell out of favour for chasing hare, but was still employed for rabbit hunting. In "Anecdotes of Dogs" (1846), <a href="Edward%20Jesse">Edward Jesse</a> says:

In the United States they appear to have been employed chiefly for hunting rabbits from the earliest imports.
Hunting hare with beagles became popular again in Britain in the mid-19th century and continued until it was made illegal in Scotland by the <a href="Protection%20of%20Wild%20Mammals%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%202002">Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002</a> and in England and Wales by the <a href="Hunting%20Act%202004">Hunting Act 2004</a>. Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the <a href="landowner">landowner</a>'s permission. <a href="Drag%20hunting">Drag hunting</a> is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who do not wish to participate in hunting a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills.

The traditional foot pack consists of up to 40 beagles, marshaled by a Huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in whose job is to return straying hounds to the pack. The Master of the Hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack, and may or may not take on the role of Huntsman on the day of the hunt.

As hunting with beagles was seen as ideal for young people, many of the British <a href="Independent%20school%20%28UK%29">public schools</a> traditionally maintained beagle packs. Protests were lodged against <a href="Eton%20College">Eton's</a> use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today, and a pack used by <a href="Wye%20College">Imperial College</a> in <a href="Wye%2C%20Kent">Wye, Kent</a> was stolen by the <a href="Animal%20Liberation%20Front">Animal Liberation Front</a> in 2001. School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, <a href="Marlborough%20College">Marlborough</a>, Wye, <a href="Radley%20College">Radley</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Agricultural%20University">Royal Agricultural University</a> and <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church, Oxford</a>.

In addition to organized beagling, beagles have been used for hunting or flushing to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including <a href="snowshoe%20hare">snowshoe hare</a>, <a href="cottontail%20rabbit">cottontail rabbit</a>s, <a href="game%20bird">game bird</a>s, <a href="roe%20deer">roe deer</a>, <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a>, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>, <a href="wild%20boar">wild boar</a> and foxes, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt <a href="stoat">stoat</a>. In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns.

Beagles are used as detection dogs in the <a href="Beagle%20Brigade">Beagle Brigade</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a>. These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States. After trialling several breeds, beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and work well for rewards. They are also used for this purpose in a number of other countries including by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Agriculture%20and%20Forestry%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry</a> in New Zealand, the <a href="Australian%20Quarantine%20and%20Inspection%20Service">Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service</a>, and in Canada, Japan and the People's Republic of China. Larger breeds are generally used for detection of explosives as this often involves climbing over luggage and on large conveyor belts, work for which the smaller Beagle is not suited.

Beagles are the dog breed most often used in <a href="animal%20testing">animal testing</a>, due to their size and passive nature. In the United States, as many as 65,000 beagles are used every year for medical, cosmetic, beauty, and other chemical tests. They are purpose bred and live their lives in cages undergoing experiments. The Rescue + Freedom Project (formerly Beagle Freedom Project) has successfully advocated for beagles to be released from labs. This organization has freed hundreds of animals.

Beagles are used in a range of research procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment. Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%). In the UK, the <a href="Animals%20%28Scientific%20Procedures%29%20Act%201986">Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986</a> gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved. In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%). Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as <a href="Harlan%20%28company%29">Harlan</a>. In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.
Testing of cosmetic products on animals is banned in the member states of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted. It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA). When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and <a href="miniature%20pig">miniature pig</a>s as surrogates for direct human testing. Minnesota was the first state to enact a Beagle freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed with research testing.

Anti-<a href="Animal%20testing">vivisection</a> groups have reported on abuse of animals inside testing facilities. In 1997 footage secretly filmed by a freelance journalist inside <a href="Huntingdon%20Life%20Sciences">Huntingdon Life Sciences</a> in the UK showed staff punching and screaming at beagles. <a href="Consort%20Kennels">Consort Kennels</a>, a UK-based breeder of beagles for testing, closed down in 1997 after pressure from animal rights groups.

Although bred for hunting, Beagles are versatile and are nowadays employed for various other roles in detection, therapy, and as family pets.

Beagles are used as sniffer dogs for <a href="termite">termite</a> detection in Australia, and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection. Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in <a href="Animal-assisted%20therapy">pet therapy</a>, visiting the sick and elderly in hospital. In June 2006, a trained Beagle assistance dog was credited with saving the life of its owner after using her owner's mobile phone to dial an emergency number. In the aftermath of the <a href="2010%20Haiti%20earthquake">2010 Haiti earthquake</a>, a Beagle <a href="search%20and%20rescue%20dog">search and rescue dog</a> with a Colombian rescue squad was credited with locating the owner of the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Montana">Hôtel Montana</a>, who was subsequently rescued after spending 100 hours buried in the rubble. Beagles were hired by New York City to help with bedbug detection, while the role of such dogs in this type of detection may have doubts.

Bald eagle

The bald eagle ("Haliaeetus leucocephalus", from Greek ἅλς, "hals" "sea", αἰετός "aietos" "<a href="eagle">eagle</a>", λευκός, "leukos" "white", κεφαλή, "kephalē" "head") is a <a href="bird%20of%20prey">bird of prey</a> found in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. A <a href="sea%20eagle">sea eagle</a>, it has two known subspecies and forms a <a href="Species%20complex">species pair</a> with the <a href="white-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed eagle</a> ("Haliaeetus albicilla"). Its range includes most of <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, all of the <a href="contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous United States</a>, and northern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on <a href="fish">fish</a>, which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest <a href="bird%20nest">nest</a> of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to deep, wide, and in weight. <a href="Sexual%20maturity">Sexual maturity</a> is attained at the age of four to five years.

Bald eagles are not actually <a href="bald">bald</a>; the name derives from an older meaning of the word, "white headed". The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The <a href="beak">beak</a> is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.

The bald eagle is both the <a href="List%20of%20national%20birds">national bird</a> and <a href="List%20of%20national%20animals">national animal</a> of the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a>. The bald eagle appears on its <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20United%20States">seal</a>. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of <a href="local%20extinction">extirpation</a> in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species was removed from the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. government</a>'s list of <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of <a href="threatened%20species">threatened species</a>. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the <a href="Continental%20United%20States">Lower 48</a> States on June 28, 2007.

The <a href="plumage">plumage</a> of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a> are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The <a href="beak">beak</a> is large and hooked, with a yellow <a href="cere">cere</a>. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related <a href="African%20fish%20eagle">African fish eagle</a> ("H. vocifer") (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body (albeit of somewhat more rufous hue), white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.
The plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity. Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a> ("Aquila chrysaetos"), the only other very large, non-vulturine raptorial bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger <a href="beak">beak</a>, straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its <a href="nape">nape</a> and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing. Another distinguishing feature of the immature bald eagle over the mature bird is its black, yellow-tipped beak; the mature eagle has a fully yellow beak. The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor (<a href="Accipitriformes">accipitrid</a>) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the <a href="California%20condor">California condor</a> ("Gymnogyps californianus"), a <a href="New%20World%20vulture">New World vulture</a> which today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids. However, the <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>, averaging and in <a href="Wing%20chord%20%28biology%29">wing chord length</a> in its American race ("A. c. canadensis"), is merely lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around . Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed <a href="white-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed eagle</a> and the overall larger <a href="Steller%27s%20sea%20eagle">Steller's sea eagle</a> ("H. pelagicus"), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.
The bald eagle has a body length of . Typical wingspan is between and mass is normally between . Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging as much as , and against the males' average weight of .

The size of the bird varies by location and generally corresponds with <a href="Bergmann%27s%20rule">Bergmann's rule</a>, since the species increases in size further away from the Equator and the tropics. For example, eagles from <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> average in mass and in wingspan, smaller than their northern counterparts. One field guide in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> listed similarly small sizes for bald eagles there, at about . Of intermediate size, 117 migrant bald eagles in <a href="Glacier%20National%20Park%20%28U.S.%29">Glacier National Park</a> were found to average but this was mostly (possibly post-dispersal) juvenile eagles, with 6 adults here averaging . Wintering eagles in Arizona (winter weights are usually the highest through the year since like many raptors they spend the highest percentage of time foraging during winter) were found to average . The largest eagles are from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, where large females may weigh more than and span across the wings. A survey of adult weights in Alaska showed that females there weighed on average , respectively, and males weighed against immatures which averaged and in the two sexes. An Alaskan adult female eagle that was considered outsized weighed some . R.S. Palmer listed a record from 1876 in <a href="Wyoming%20County%2C%20New%20York">Wyoming County, New York</a> of an enormous adult bald eagle that was shot and reportedly scaled . Among standard linear measurements, the <a href="Wing%20chord%20%28biology%29">wing chord</a> is , the <a href="tail">tail</a> is long, and the <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> is . The <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> reportedly ranges from , while the measurement from the <a href="gape">gape</a> to the tip of the bill is . The bill size is unusually variable as Alaskan eagles could be up to twice the bill length of "southern birds" (i.e. from <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>), with means in between the sexes of and in culmen length, respectively, from these two areas.
The call consists of weak staccato, chirping whistles, "kleek kik ik ik ik", somewhat similar in cadence to a <a href="gull">gull</a>'s call. The calls of young birds tend to be more harsh and shrill than those of adults.

The bald eagle placed in the genus "Haliaeetus" (<a href="sea%20eagle">sea eagle</a>s) which gets both its common and specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult's head. "Bald" in the <a href="English%20language">English</a> name is derived from the word "<a href="piebald">piebald</a>", and refers to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker body. The genus name is <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a>: "Haliaeetus" (from the ), and the specific name, "leucocephalus", is Latinized () and ().

The bald eagle was one of the many species originally described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his 18th century work "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", under the name "Falco leucocephalus".

There are two recognized <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of bald eagle:

The bald eagle forms a <a href="species%20pair">species pair</a> with the <a href="white-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed eagle</a> of <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a> in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles at the beginning of the Early <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> (c. 10 <a href="Ma%20%28unit%29">Ma BP</a>) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>, 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this <a href="genus">genus</a>.

The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, all of the <a href="continental%20United%20States">continental United States</a>, and northern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. It is the only sea eagle <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the <a href="bayou">bayou</a>s of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> to the <a href="Sonoran%20Desert">Sonoran Desert</a> and the eastern deciduous forests of <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> and <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, northern birds are <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, northern and eastern Canada, and <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. During the interval 1966-2015 bald eagle numbers increased substantially throughout its winter and breeding ranges, and as of 2018 the species nests in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.

The majority of bald eagles in Canada are found along the <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> coast while large populations are found in the forests of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> and <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. Bald eagles also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in <a href="Squamish%2C%20British%20Columbia">Squamish, British Columbia</a>, about halfway between <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and <a href="Whistler%2C%20British%20Columbia">Whistler</a>. The birds primarily gather along the <a href="Squamish%20River">Squamish</a> and <a href="Cheakamus%20River">Cheakamus</a> Rivers, attracted by the <a href="salmon">salmon</a> spawning in the area. Similar congregations of wintering bald eagles at open lakes and rivers, wherein fish are readily available for hunting or scavenging, are observed in the northern United States.

It has occurred as a <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> twice in Ireland; a juvenile was shot illegally in <a href="Fermanagh">Fermanagh</a> on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a <a href="white-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed eagle</a>), and an exhausted juvenile was captured in <a href="County%20Kerry">Kerry</a> on November 15, 1987.

The bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American <a href="wetland">wetland</a> habitat such as <a href="Coast">seacoasts</a>, <a href="river">river</a>s, large <a href="lake">lake</a>s or <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es or other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than , and lakes with an area greater than are optimal for breeding bald eagles.

The bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of <a href="pinophyta">coniferous</a> or <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a> trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and location. Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low above the ground. In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from in height. In <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, nesting trees averaged in diameter and in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands high and is in diameter. Trees used for nesting in the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone area</a> average high. Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water. Most nests have been found within of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over , in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>.

Bald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.

In Florida, nesting habitats often consist of <a href="Mangrove">mangrove swamps</a>, the shorelines of lakes and rivers, <a href="pine">pine</a>lands, seasonally flooded <a href="flatwoods">flatwoods</a>, <a href="Swamp">hardwood swamps</a>, and open <a href="prairie">prairie</a>s and <a href="pasture">pasture</a>land with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are <a href="Pinus%20elliottii">slash pines</a> ("Pinus elliottii"), <a href="Pinus%20palustris">longleaf pines</a> ("P. palustris"), <a href="Pinus%20taeda">loblolly pines</a> ("P. taeda") and <a href="Cupressaceae">cypress trees</a>, but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used. In <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, groves of mature <a href="Populus%20sect.%20Aigeiros">cottonwoods</a> or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of <a href="Pinus%20ponderosa">ponderosa pines</a> ("Pinus ponderosa") to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland. In <a href="Southeast%20Alaska">Southeast Alaska</a>, <a href="Picea%20sitchensis">Sitka spruce</a> ("Picea sitchensis") provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by <a href="Tsuga">hemlocks</a> ("Tsuga") at 20%. Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.
The bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than from low-density human disturbance and more than from medium- to high-density human disturbance. However, bald eagles will occasionally nest in large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the <a href="Willamette%20River">Willamette River</a> in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> or <a href="John%20Heinz%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge%20at%20Tinicum">John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity. Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a> neighborhood in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in 2010.

While wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as <a href="prairie">prairie</a>s, <a href="meadow">meadow</a>s or <a href="tundra">tundra</a>, or open forests with regular carrion access.

The bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on <a href="thermal">thermal convection currents</a>. It reaches speeds of when gliding and flapping, and about while carrying fish. Its dive speed is between , though it seldom dives vertically. Regarding their flying abilities, despite being morphologically less well adapted to faster flight than golden eagles (especially during dives), the bald eagle is considered surprisingly maneuverable in flight, bounty hunters shooting from helicopters opined that they were far more difficult to hunt while flying than golden eagles as they would turn, double back or dive as soon as approached. Bald eagles have also been recorded catching up to and then swooping under geese in flight, turning over and thrusting their talons into the other bird's breast. It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer. The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of <a href="thermal">thermal</a>s, <a href="updraft">updraft</a>s, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to consume a great variety of prey. Throughout their range, <a href="fish">fish</a> often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet. In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%. More than 400 species are known to be included in the bald eagle's prey spectrum, far more than its ecological equivalent in the Old World, the <a href="white-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed eagle</a>, is known to take. Despite its considerably lower population, the bald eagle may come in second amongst all North American accipitrids, slightly behind only the <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a>, in number of prey species recorded. In <a href="Southeast%20Alaska">Southeast Alaska</a>, fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-around diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents. Eagles living in the <a href="Columbia%20River%20Estuary">Columbia River Estuary</a> in <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake. At least 100 species of fish have been recorded in the bald eagle's diet. In the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>, spawning <a href="trout">trout</a> and <a href="salmon">salmon</a> provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall. Southeast Alaskan eagles largely prey on <a href="pink%20salmon">pink salmon</a> ("Oncorhynchus gorbuscha"), <a href="coho%20salmon">coho salmon</a> ("O. kisutch") and, more locally, <a href="sockeye%20salmon">sockeye salmon</a> ("O. nerka"), with <a href="chinook%20salmon">chinook salmon</a> ("O. tshawytscha"), due to their large size ( average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion. Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are <a href="Pacific%20herring">Pacific herring</a> ("Clupea pallasii"), <a href="sand%20lance">Pacific sand lance</a> ("Ammodytes hexapterus") and <a href="eulachon">eulachon</a> ("Thaleichthys pacificus").

In Oregon's Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were <a href="largescale%20sucker">largescale sucker</a>s ("Catostomus macrocheilus") (17.3% of the prey selected there), <a href="American%20shad">American shad</a> ("Alosa sapidissima"; 13%) and <a href="common%20carp">common carp</a> ("Cyprinus carpio"; 10.8%). Eagles living in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> were found to subsist largely on <a href="American%20gizzard%20shad">American gizzard shad</a> ("Dorosoma cepedianum"), <a href="threadfin%20shad">threadfin shad</a> ("D. petenense") and <a href="white%20bass">white bass</a> ("Morone chrysops"). Floridian eagles have been reported to prey on <a href="catfish">catfish</a>, most prevalently the <a href="brown%20bullhead">brown bullhead</a> ("Ameiurus nebulosus") and any species in the genus "<a href="Ictalurus">Ictalurus</a>" as well as <a href="mullet%20%28fish%29">mullet</a>, <a href="trout">trout</a>, <a href="needlefish">needlefish</a>, and <a href="eel">eel</a>s. Wintering eagles on the <a href="Platte%20River">Platte River</a> in <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a> preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp. From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught live by the eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.

Even eagles living in relatively arid regions still typically rely primarily on fish as prey. In <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a> (<a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>) and <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, 77% and over 73%, respectively, of prey remains at the nests were from fish, largely various catfish and <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> ("Oncorhynchus mykiss"). Prey fish targeted by bald eagles are often quite large. When experimenters offered fish of different sizes in the breeding season around <a href="Lake%20Britton">Lake Britton</a> in <a href="California">California</a>, fish measuring were taken 71.8% of the time by parent eagles while fish measuring were chosen only 25% of the time. At nests around <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>, the remains of fish (mostly <a href="Catostomus">suckers</a>) were found to average in total length. In the Columbia River estuary, most preyed on by eagles were estimated to measure between in length, and carp flown with (laboriously) were up to in length. Much larger marine fish such as <a href="Pacific%20halibut">Pacific halibut</a> ("Hippoglossus stenolepis") and <a href="lemon%20shark">lemon shark</a>s ("Negaprion brevirostris") have been recorded among bald eagle prey though probably are only taken as young, as small, newly mature fish or as carrion.
<a href="Benthic%20zone">Benthic fishes</a> such as catfish are usually consumed after they die and float to the surface, though while temporarily swimming in the open may be more vulnerable to predation than most fish since their eyes focus downwards. Bald eagles also regularly exploit water turbines which produce battered, stunned or dead fish easily consumed. Predators who leave behind scraps of dead fish that they kill, such as <a href="brown%20bear">brown bear</a>s ("Ursus arctos"), <a href="Gray%20wolf">gray wolves</a> ("Canis lupus") and <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a>es ("Vulpes vulpes"), may be habitually followed in order to scavenge the kills secondarily. Once North Pacific salmon die off after spawning, usually local bald eagles eat salmon carcasses almost exclusively. Eagles in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> need to consume of fish each day for survival, with adults generally consuming more than juveniles and thus reducing potential energy deficiency and increasing survival during winter.

Behind fish, the next most significant prey base for bald eagles are other <a href="Water%20bird">waterbirds</a>. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface. Waterbirds can seasonally comprise from 7% to 80% of the prey selection for eagles in certain localities. Overall, birds are the most diverse group in the bald eagle's prey spectrum, with 200 prey species recorded. Exceptionally, in the <a href="Greater%20Yellowstone%20Ecosystem">Greater Yellowstone area</a>, birds were eaten as regularly as fish year-around, with both prey groups comprising 43% of the studied dietary intake. Preferred avian prey includes <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s, <a href="alcid">alcid</a>s, <a href="duck">duck</a>s, <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="coot">coot</a>s, <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="egret">egret</a>s, and <a href="geese">geese</a>. Bird species most preferred as prey by eagles tend to be medium-sized, such as <a href="western%20grebe">western grebe</a>s ("Aechmophorus occidentalis"), <a href="mallard">mallard</a>s ("Anas platyrhynchos") and <a href="American%20coot">American coot</a>s ("Fulica americana") as such prey is relatively easy for the much larger eagles to catch and fly with. <a href="American%20herring%20gull">American herring gull</a> ("Larus smithsonianus") are the favored avian prey species for eagles living around Lake Superior. Larger waterbirds are occasionally prey as well, with wintering <a href="Emperor%20goose">emperor geese</a> ("Chen canagica") and <a href="snow%20goose">snow geese</a> ("C. caerulescens"), which gather in large groups, sometimes becoming regular prey. Other large waterbirds hunted at least occasionally by bald eagles have included adults of <a href="common%20loon">common loon</a>s ("Gavis immer"), <a href="great%20black-backed%20gull">great black-backed gull</a>s ("Larus marinus"), <a href="sandhill%20crane">sandhill crane</a>s ("Grus canadensis"), <a href="great%20blue%20heron">great blue heron</a>s ("Ardea herodias"), <a href="Canada%20goose">Canada geese</a> ("Branta canadensis"), <a href="brown%20pelican">brown pelican</a>s ("Pelecanus occidentalis"), and fledging <a href="American%20white%20pelican">American white pelican</a>s ("P. erythrorhynchos"). Colony nesting <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, such as <a href="Alcidae">alcids</a>, <a href="storm%20petrel">storm petrel</a>s, <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s, <a href="northern%20gannet">northern gannet</a>s ("Morus bassanus"), <a href="tern">tern</a>s and <a href="gull">gull</a>s, may be especially vulnerable to predation. Due to easy accessibility and lack of formidable nest defense by such species, bald eagles are capable of preying on such seabirds at all ages, from eggs to mature adults, and can effectively cull large portions of a colony.

Along some portions of the <a href="North%20Pacific">North Pacific</a> coastline, bald eagles which had historically preyed mainly <a href="kelp">kelp</a>-dwelling fish and supplementally <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a> ("Enhydra lutris") pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had precipitous population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation. Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist have expressed concern that <a href="murre">murre</a>s are heading for a "conservation collision" due to heavy eagle predation. Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as <a href="storm%20petrel">storm petrel</a>s and <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside. If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle. If the said birds are on a colony, this exposed their unprotected eggs and nestlings to scavengers such as <a href="gull">gull</a>s. Bird prey may occasionally be attacked in flight, with prey up to the size of <a href="Canada%20goose">Canada geese</a> attacked and killed in mid-air. Unprecedented photographs of a bald eagle unsuccessfully attempting to prey on a much larger adult <a href="trumpeter%20swan">trumpeter swan</a> ("Cygnus buccinator") in mid-flight were taken recently. While adults often actively prey on waterbirds, congregated wintering waterfowl are frequently exploited for carcasses to scavenge by immature eagles in harsh winter weather. Bald eagles have been recorded as killing other <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a> on occasion. In some cases, these may be attacks of competition or <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a> on rival species but ended with the consumption of the victim. Nine species each of other <a href="accipitrid">accipitrid</a>s and <a href="owl">owl</a>s are known to have been preyed upon by bald eagles. Owl prey species have ranged in size from <a href="western%20screech-owl">western screech-owl</a>s ("Megascops kennicotti") to <a href="snowy%20owl">snowy owl</a>s ("Bubo scandiacus"). Larger diurnal raptors known to have fallen victim to bald eagles have included <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a>s ("Buteo jamaicensis"), <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s ("Falco peregrinus"), <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>s ("Accipiter gentilis"), <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s ("Pandion haliaetus") and <a href="Black%20vulture">black</a> ("Coragyps atratus") and <a href="turkey%20vulture">turkey vulture</a>s ("Cathartes aura").

<a href="Mammal">Mammal</a>ian prey includes <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s, <a href="hare">hare</a>s, <a href="ground%20squirrel">ground squirrel</a>s, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s ("Procyon lotor"), <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s ("Ondatra zibethicus"), <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beavers</a> ("Castor canadensis"), and <a href="deer">deer</a> fawns. Newborn, dead, sickly or already injured mammals are often targeted. However, more formidable prey such as adult raccoons and subadult beavers are sometimes attacked. In the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> area, bald eagles are reportedly the main natural predators of raccoons. Other relatively large mammalian prey known to be taken by bald eagles (at least rarely) as adults include <a href="Virginia%20opossum">Virginia opossum</a>s ("Didelphis virginiana"), <a href="nine-banded%20armadillo">nine-banded armadillo</a>s ("Dasypus novemcinctus"), <a href="Red%20fox">red</a> and <a href="arctic%20fox">arctic fox</a>es ("Vulpes vulpes" & "Vulpes lagopus") and <a href="striped%20skunk">striped skunk</a>s ("Mephitis mephitis"). Even an adult <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a> ("Lynx rufus") has been recorded amongst their prey, although this may have been scavenged. Where available, seal colonies can provide much food. On <a href="Protection%20Island%20%28Washington%20state%29">Protection Island</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, they commonly feed on <a href="harbor%20seal">harbor seal</a> ("Phoca vitulina") afterbirths, still-borns and sickly seal pups. On <a href="San%20Juan%20Island">San Juan Island</a> in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, introduced <a href="European%20rabbit">European rabbit</a>s ("Oryctolagus cuniculus"), mainly those killed by auto accidents, comprise nearly 60% of the dietary intake of eagles. In landlocked areas of North America, wintering bald eagles may become habitual predators of medium-sized mammals that occur in colonies or local concentrations, such as <a href="prairie%20dog">prairie dog</a>s ("Cynomys") and <a href="jackrabbit">jackrabbit</a>s ("Lepus"). Like the golden eagle, bald eagles are capable of attacking jackrabbits and hares of nearly any size Together with the golden eagle, bald eagles are occasionally accused of preying on livestock, especially <a href="sheep">sheep</a> ("Ovis aries"). There are a handful of proven cases of lamb predation, some of specimens weighing up to , by bald eagles but they are much less likely to attack a healthy lamb than a golden eagle and both species prefer native, wild prey and are unlikely to cause any extensive detriment to human livelihoods. There is one case of a bald eagle killing and feeding on an adult, pregnant ewe (then joined in eating the kill by at least 3 other eagles), which, weighing on average over , is much larger than any other known prey taken by this species.

Supplemental prey are readily taken given the opportunity. In some areas <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s may become regular prey, especially warm areas such as <a href="Florida">Florida</a> where reptile diversity is high. <a href="Turtle">Turtle</a>s are perhaps the most regularly hunted type of reptile. In coastal <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, 14 of 20 studied eagle nests included remains of turtles. The main species found were <a href="Sternotherus%20odoratus">common musk turtles</a> ("Sternotherus odoratus"), <a href="diamondback%20terrapin">diamondback terrapin</a> ("Malaclemys terrapin") and juvenile <a href="common%20snapping%20turtle">common snapping turtle</a>s ("Chelydra serpentina"). In these New Jersey nests, mainly subadult and small adults were taken, ranging in carapace length from . Similarly, many turtles were recorded in the diet in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>. <a href="Snake">Snake</a>s are also taken occasionally, especially partially aquatic ones, as are <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s and <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s (largely <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> and <a href="crab">crab</a>s).

To hunt fish, the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its <a href="talons">talons</a>. They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other. Eagles have structures on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish. <a href="Osprey">Osprey</a> also have this adaptation. Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a <a href="mule%20deer">mule deer</a> ("Odocoileus hemionus") fawn. This feat is the record for the heaviest load carrying ever verified for a flying bird. It has been estimated that the gripping power (pounds by square inch) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human. Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight, but if the fish is too heavy to lift, the eagle may be dragged into the water. It may swim to safety, in some cases pulling the catch along to the shore as it swims, but some eagles drown or succumb to <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a>. Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions. On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey. When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable. Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it. While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way). When hunting concentrated prey, a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully.

Unlike some other eagle species, bald eagles rarely take on evasive or dangerous prey on their own. The species mainly target prey which is much smaller than themselves, with most live fish caught weighing and most waterbirds preyed weighing . On the other hand, some salmon, carp and marine fish, mammals such as deer fawn and lambs and birds such as <a href="swan">swan</a>s taken by bald eagles are likely to have been up to at least twice the bald eagles' own size (even if the eagle was unable to fly with it). They obtain much of their food as <a href="carrion">carrion</a> or via a practice known as <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a>, by which they steal prey away from other predators. Due to their dietary habits, bald eagles are frequently viewed in a negative light by humans. Thanks to their superior foraging ability and experience, adults are generally more likely to hunt live prey than immature eagles, which often obtain their food from scavenging. They are not very selective about the condition or origin, whether provided by humans, other animals, auto accidents or natural causes, of a carcass's presence, but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence. They will scavenge carcasses up to the size of <a href="whale">whale</a>s, though carcasses of <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s and large <a href="fish">fish</a> are seemingly preferred. Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on material scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps (dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska).

When competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s such as <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s ("Canis latrans") and <a href="fox">fox</a>es, and birds such as <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s, <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="vulture">vulture</a>s and other <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a>. Occasionally, coyotes, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s ("Lynx rufus") and <a href="Dog">domestic dogs</a> ("Canis lupus familiaris") can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, as has been recorded in Maine. Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed). However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way. Neither species is known to be dominant, and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved. Wintering bald and golden eagles in <a href="Utah">Utah</a> both sometimes won conflicts, though in one recorded instance a single bald eagle successfully displaced two consecutive golden eagles from a kill. The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle, with the bald species estimated to number at least 150,000 individuals, about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America. Due to this, bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources. Despite the potential for contention between these animals, in <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> during winter, a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt <a href="snow%20geese">snow geese</a> alongside each other without conflict. Similarly, both eagle species have been recorded, via video-monitoring, to feed on gut pills and carcasses of <a href="white-tailed%20deer">white-tailed deer</a> ("Odocoileus virginianus") in remote forest clearings in the eastern <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> without apparent conflict. Bald eagles as frequently mobbed by smaller raptors, due to their infrequent but unpredictable tendency to hunt other birds of prey. Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites, especially in winters when fish are harder to come by. They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s, <a href="heron">heron</a>s and even <a href="otter">otter</a>s. They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s ("Falco peregrinus"), prairie dogs from <a href="ferruginous%20hawk">ferruginous hawk</a>s ("Buteo regalis") and even jackrabbits from <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s. When they approach scavengers like dogs, gulls or vultures at carrion sites, they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food. Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>s.

Bald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles <a href="mate%20for%20life">mate for life</a>. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the survivor will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates. Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free-fall, separating just before hitting the ground. Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be of waterside habitat.
Compared to most other raptors which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep snow in the North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid April to early May, and the young fledge late June to early July. The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as deep, across and weigh ; one nest in Florida was found to be deep, across, and to weigh . This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal. Usually nests are used for under five years or so, as they either collapse in storms or break the branches supporting them by their sheer weight. However, one nest in the <a href="Midwest">Midwest</a> was occupied continuously for at least 34 years. The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the bald eagle will nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators, such as Amchitka Island in Alaska.
In <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, eagles have been observed nesting on top of <a href="Pachycereus%20pecten-aboriginum">Hecho catcuses</a> ("Pachycereus pectinaboriginum"). Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> and <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, but currently are only verified to occur only in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. The eggs average about long, ranging from , and have a breadth of , ranging from . Eggs in Alaska averaged in mass, while in <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> they averaged . As with their ultimate body size, egg size tends to increase further away from the Equator. Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests but these may be exceptional cases of <a href="polygyny">polygyny</a>. Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs. It is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledging stage. The oldest chick often bears the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards it. Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills its younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different. However, nearly half of known bald eagles produce two fledgings (more rarely three), unlike in some other "eagle" species such as some in the genus "Aquila", in which a second fledging is typically observed in less than 20% of nests, despite two eggs typically being laid. Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the sitting. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period, at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby).

A young eaglet can gain up to a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird. The young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise up in the air. The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age, though will remain close to the nest and attended to by their parents for a further 6 weeks. Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development. For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce. Additionally, as shown by a pair of eagles in Shoal Harbor Migratory Bird Sanctuary located near Sydney, British Columbia on June 9, 2017, bald eagles have been recently recorded to occasionally adopt other raptor fledglings into their nests. The pair of eagles in question were recorded carrying a juvenile <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a> back to their nest, whereupon the chick was accepted into the family by both the parents and the eagles' three fledgelings. Whether or not the chick survived remained to be seen at the time, as young bald eagles are known for <a href="fratricide">killing their siblings</a>. However, the aggression of the red-tailed hawk may ensure its survival, as the hawks are well known for their ability to successfully defend against an eagle attack. Six weeks after however, it was discovered that the hawk, nicknamed "Spunky" by biologists monitoring the nest, had grown to fledgeling size and was learning how to hunt, indicating that it successfully survived.

The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 38 years of age. In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in New York lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears to be influenced by its location and access to prey. As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate. In <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a> in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the <a href="Exxon%20Valdez%20oil%20spill">Exxon Valdez oil spill</a> adversely affected eagles in the area. Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases. In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused. Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status. In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it. An early natural history video depicting a <a href="cougar">cougar</a> ("Puma concolor") ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.

Most non-human-related mortality involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive their first year. However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived to their first year. Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be preyed by large <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s (including <a href="raven">raven</a>s, <a href="Corvus%20%28genus%29">crows</a> and <a href="magpie">magpie</a>s), <a href="wolverine">wolverine</a>s ("Gulo gulo"), <a href="Fisher%20%28animal%29">fishers</a> ("Martes pennanti"), <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a>s, <a href="owl">owl</a>s, <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s ("Lynx rufus"), <a href="American%20black%20bear">American black bear</a>s ("Ursus americanus") and <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s. If food access is low, parental attendance at the nest may be lower because both parents may have to forage thus resulting in less protection. Nestlings are usually exempt from predation by terrestrial carnivores that are poor tree-climbers, but <a href="Arctic%20fox">Arctic fox</a>es ("Vulpes lagopus") occasionally snatched nestlings from ground nests on Amchitka Island in Alaska before they were extirpated from the island. The bald eagle will defend its nest fiercely from all comers and has even repelled attacks from bears, having been recorded knocking a black bear out of a tree when the latter tried to climb a tree holding nestlings.

Once a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide <a href="DDT">DDT</a>. Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to <a href="biomagnification">biomagnification</a>. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's <a href="calcium">calcium</a> metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch. It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000, but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous states</a> of the US.
Other factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent). Later illegal shooting was described as "the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles," according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin. In 1984, the <a href="National%20Wildlife%20Federation">National Wildlife Federation</a> listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald eagles have also been killed by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion at nests.

The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">1918 Migratory Bird Treaty</a>, later extended to all of North America. The <a href="Bald%20and%20Golden%20Eagle%20Protection%20Act">Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act</a>, approved by the U.S. Congress in 1940, protected the bald eagle and the <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>, prohibiting commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States due to the fact that it inhibited the reproduction of many birds. DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.
With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000–115,000 by 1992; the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> with the largest resident population is <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, with about 40,000–50,000, with the next highest population the <a href="Provinces%20and%20territories%20of%20Canada">Canadian province</a> of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> with 20,000–30,000 in 1992. Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported. For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the <a href="Contiguous%20United%20States">contiguous state</a> with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Florida's most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles. In Washington State, there were only 105 occupied nests in 1980. That number increased by about 30 per year, so that by 2005 there were 840 occupied nests. 2005 was the last year that the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife counted occupied nests. Further population increases in Washington may be limited by the availability of late winter food, particularly salmon.

The bald eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995, by the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service</a>, when it was reclassified from "Endangered" to "Threatened." On July 6, 1999, a proposal was initiated "To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife." It was de-listed on June 28, 2007. It has also been assigned a risk level of <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> category on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. In the <a href="Exxon%20Valdez%20Oil%20Spill">Exxon Valdez Oil Spill</a> of 1989 an estimated 247 were killed in <a href="Prince%20William%20Sound">Prince William Sound</a>, though the local population returned to its pre-spill level by 1995. In some areas, the population has increased such that the eagles are a pest.

In December 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposed quadrupling to 4,200 per year the amount of bald eagles that can be killed by the wind electric generation industry without paying a penalty. If issued, the permits would last 30 years, six times the current 5-year permits.

<a href="License">Permits</a> are required to keep bald eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles which they show are permanently injured individuals which cannot be released to the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging and facilities, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles.
In <a href="Canada">Canada</a> and in <a href="England">England</a> a license is required to keep bald eagles for <a href="falconry">falconry</a>. Bald eagles cannot legally be kept for <a href="falconry">falconry</a> in the United States, but a license may be issued in some jurisdictions to allow for using such eagles to perform in birds of prey flight shows.

As a rule, the bald eagle is not the ideal choice for public shows, being timid, prone to becoming highly stressed, and unpredictable in nature. Native American tribes can obtain a "Native American Religious Use" permit to keep non-releasable eagles as well. They use their naturally molted feathers for religious and cultural ceremonies. The bald eagle can be long-lived in captivity if well cared for, but does not breed well even under the best conditions.

The bald eagle is important in various <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> cultures and, as the <a href="national%20symbol">national bird</a> of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, is prominent in seals and logos, coinage, postage stamps, and other items relating to the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. federal government</a>.

The bald eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, like those of the <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>, are central to many religious and <a href="Native%20American%20mythology">spiritual</a> customs among <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native Americans</a>. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures. Many <a href="pow%20wow">pow wow</a> dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. In the <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo</a> Tradition an Eagle feather is represented to be a Protector, along with the Feather Navajo Medicine Man use the leg and wing bones for ceremonial whistles. The <a href="Lakota%20people">Lakota</a>, for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college. The <a href="Pawnee%20people">Pawnee</a> considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young. The <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a> considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.
During the <a href="Sun%20Dance">Sun Dance</a>, which is practiced by many <a href="Plains%20Indian">Plains Indian</a> tribes, the eagle is represented in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance. Also during the dance, a <a href="medicine%20man">medicine man</a> may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.

Current <a href="eagle%20feather%20law">eagle feather law</a> stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups on the basis that it violates the <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.

The <a href="National%20Eagle%20Repository">National Eagle Repository</a>, a division of the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">FWS</a>, exists as a means to receive, process, and store bald and <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s which are found dead, and to distribute the eagles, their parts and feathers, to <a href="List%20of%20federally%20recognized%20tribes">federally recognized</a> Native American tribes for use in religious ceremonies.

The bald eagle is the national bird of the <a href="United%20States">United States of America</a>. The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>, in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> adopted the design for the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20United%20States">Great Seal of the United States</a> depicting a bald eagle grasping 13 <a href="arrow">arrow</a>s and an <a href="olive%20branch">olive branch</a> with thirteen leaves, with its talons.

The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the <a href="Seal%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidential seal</a>, the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidential flag</a>, and in the <a href="logo">logo</a>s of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which gave rise to the <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a> that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.

Contrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> ever publicly supported the <a href="wild%20turkey">wild turkey</a> ("Meleagris gallopavo"), rather than the bald eagle, as a symbol of the United States. However, in a letter written to his daughter in 1784 from Paris, criticizing the <a href="Society%20of%20the%20Cincinnati">Society of the Cincinnati</a>, he stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle's behavior. In the letter Franklin states:

Franklin opposed the creation of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a <a href="order%20%28honour%29">noble order</a> unwelcome in the newly independent <a href="Republic">Republic</a>, contrary to the ideals of <a href="Lucius%20Quinctius%20Cincinnatus">Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus</a>, for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.

Blackbeard

Edward Teach or Edward Thatch ( – 22 November 1718), better known as Blackbeard, was an English <a href="Piracy">pirate</a> who operated around the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> and the eastern coast of Britain's <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">North American colonies</a>. Little is known about his early life, but he may have been a sailor on <a href="privateer">privateer</a> ships during <a href="Queen%20Anne%27s%20War">Queen Anne's War</a> before settling on the <a href="The%20Bahamas">Bahamian</a> island of <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a>, a base for Captain <a href="Benjamin%20Hornigold">Benjamin Hornigold</a>, whose crew Teach joined around 1716. Hornigold placed him in command of a <a href="sloop">sloop</a> that he had captured, and the two engaged in numerous acts of piracy. Their numbers were boosted by the addition to their fleet of two more ships, one of which was commanded by <a href="Stede%20Bonnet">Stede Bonnet</a>; but Hornigold retired from piracy towards the end of 1717, taking two vessels with him.

Teach captured a French merchant vessel, renamed her "<a href="Queen%20Anne%27s%20Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a>", and equipped her with 40 guns. He became a renowned pirate, his nickname derived from his thick black beard and fearsome appearance; he was reported to have tied lit fuses (<a href="slow%20match">slow match</a>es) under his hat to frighten his enemies. He formed an alliance of pirates and blockaded the port of <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charles Town, South Carolina</a>, ransoming the port's inhabitants. He then ran "Queen Anne's Revenge" aground on a sandbar near <a href="Beaufort%2C%20North%20Carolina">Beaufort, North Carolina</a>. He parted company with Bonnet and settled in <a href="Bath%2C%20North%20Carolina">Bath, North Carolina</a>, also known as Bath Town where he accepted a royal pardon. But he was soon back at sea, where he attracted the attention of <a href="Alexander%20Spotswood">Alexander Spotswood</a>, the <a href="Governor%20of%20Virginia">Governor of Virginia</a>. Spotswood arranged for a party of soldiers and sailors to capture the pirate, which they did on 22 November 1718 following a ferocious battle. Teach and several of his crew were killed by a small force of sailors led by Lieutenant <a href="Robert%20Maynard">Robert Maynard</a>.

Teach was a shrewd and calculating leader who spurned the use of force, relying instead on his fearsome image to elicit the response that he desired from those whom he robbed. Contrary to the modern-day picture of the traditional tyrannical pirate, he commanded his vessels with the consent of their crews and there is no known account of his ever having harmed or murdered those whom he held captive. He was romanticized after his death and became the inspiration for an archetypal pirate in works of fiction across many genres.

Little is known about Blackbeard's early life. It is commonly believed that at the time of his death he was between 35 and 40 years old and thus born in about 1680. In contemporary records his name is most often given as Blackbeard, Edward Thatch or Edward Teach; the latter is most often used. Several spellings of his surname exist—Thatch, Thach, Thache, Thack, Tack, Thatche and Theach. One early source claims that his surname was Drummond, but the lack of any supporting documentation makes this unlikely. Pirates habitually used fictitious surnames while engaged in piracy, so as not to tarnish the family name, and this makes it unlikely that Teach's real name will ever be known.

The 17th-century rise of Britain's American colonies and the rapid 18th-century expansion of the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> had made Bristol an important international sea port, and Teach was most likely raised in what was then the second-largest city in England. He could almost certainly read and write; he communicated with merchants and when killed had in his possession a letter addressed to him by the Chief Justice and Secretary of the <a href="Province%20of%20Carolina">Province of Carolina</a>, Tobias Knight. The author Robert Lee speculated that Teach may therefore have been born into a respectable, wealthy family. He may have arrived in the Caribbean in the last years of the 17th century, on a merchant vessel (possibly a <a href="slave%20ship">slave ship</a>). The 18th-century author <a href="Captain%20Charles%20Johnson">Charles Johnson</a> claimed that Teach was for some time a sailor operating from <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> on privateer ships during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>, and that "he had often distinguished himself for his uncommon boldness and personal courage". At what point during the war Teach joined the fighting is, in keeping with the record of most of his life before he became a pirate, unknown.

With its history of colonialism, trade and piracy, the West Indies was the setting for many 17th and 18th-century maritime incidents. The privateer-turned-pirate <a href="Henry%20Jennings">Henry Jennings</a> and his followers decided, early in the 18th century, to use the uninhabited island of <a href="New%20Providence">New Providence</a> as a base for their operations; it was within easy reach of the <a href="Florida%20Strait">Florida Strait</a> and its busy shipping lanes, which were filled with European vessels crossing the Atlantic. New Providence's harbour could easily accommodate hundreds of ships but was too shallow for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>'s larger vessels to navigate. The author George Woodbury described New Providence as "no city of homes; it was a place of temporary sojourn and refreshment for a literally floating population," continuing, "The only permanent residents were the piratical camp followers, the traders, and the hangers-on; all others were transient." In New Providence, pirates found a welcome respite from the law.

Teach was one of those who came to enjoy the island's benefits. Probably shortly after the signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Utrecht">Treaty of Utrecht</a>, he moved there from Jamaica, and, along with most privateers once involved in the war, became involved in piracy. Possibly about 1716, he joined the crew of Captain <a href="Benjamin%20Hornigold">Benjamin Hornigold</a>, a renowned pirate who operated from New Providence's safe waters. In 1716 Hornigold placed Teach in charge of a <a href="sloop">sloop</a> he had taken as a prize. In early 1717, Hornigold and Teach, each captaining a sloop, set out for the mainland. They captured a boat carrying 120 barrels of flour out of <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, and shortly thereafter took 100 barrels of wine from a sloop out of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. A few days later they stopped a vessel sailing from <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> to Charles Town, South Carolina. Teach and his quartermaster, William Howard, may at this time have struggled to control their crews. By then they had probably developed a taste for <a href="Madeira%20wine">Madeira wine</a>, and on 29 September near <a href="Cape%20Charles%2C%20Virginia">Cape Charles</a> all they took from the "Betty" of Virginia was her cargo of Madeira, before they <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> her with the remaining cargo.

It was during this cruise with Hornigold that the earliest known report of Teach was made, in which he is recorded as a pirate in his own right, in command of a large crew. In a report made by a Captain Mathew Munthe on an anti-piracy patrol for North Carolina, "Thatch" was described as operating "a sloop 6 gunns and about 70 men". In September Teach and Hornigold encountered Stede Bonnet, a landowner and military officer from a wealthy family who had turned to piracy earlier that year. Bonnet's crew of about 70 were reportedly dissatisfied with his command, so with Bonnet's permission, Teach took control of his ship "Revenge". The pirates' flotilla now consisted of three ships; Teach on "Revenge", Teach's old sloop and Hornigold's "Ranger". By October, another vessel had been captured and added to the small fleet. The sloops "Robert" of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and "Good Intent" of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> were stopped on 22 October 1717, and their cargo holds emptied.

As a former British privateer, Hornigold attacked only his old enemies, but for his crew, the sight of British vessels filled with valuable cargo passing by unharmed became too much, and at some point toward the end of 1717 he was demoted. Whether Teach had any involvement in this decision is unknown, but Hornigold quickly retired from piracy. He took "Ranger" and one of the sloops, leaving Teach with "Revenge" and the remaining sloop. The two never met again, and with many other occupants of New Providence, Hornigold accepted the King's pardon from <a href="Woodes%20Rogers">Woodes Rogers</a> in June the following year.

On 28 November Teach's two ships attacked a French merchant vessel off the coast of <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20%28island%29">Saint Vincent</a>. They each fired a <a href="broadside">broadside</a> across its bulwarks, killing several of its crew, and forcing its captain to surrender. The ship was "La Concorde" of <a href="Saint-Malo">Saint-Malo</a>, a large French <a href="guineaman">guineaman</a> carrying a cargo of slaves. Teach and his crews sailed the vessel south along <a href="Saint%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines">Saint Vincent and the Grenadines</a> to <a href="Bequia">Bequia</a>, where they disembarked her crew and cargo, and converted the ship for their own use. The crew of "La Concorde" were given the smaller of Teach's two sloops, which they renamed "Mauvaise Rencontre" (Bad Meeting), and sailed for Martinique. Teach may have recruited some of their slaves, but the remainder were left on the island and were later recaptured by the returning crew of "Mauvaise Rencontre".

Teach immediately renamed "La Concorde" as "Queen Anne's Revenge" and equipped her with 40 guns. By this time Teach had placed his <a href="Lieutenant%20Richards%20%28pirate%29">lieutenant Richards</a> in command of Bonnet's "Revenge". In late November, near Saint Vincent, he attacked the "Great Allen". After a lengthy engagement, he forced the large and well-armed merchant ship to surrender. He ordered her to move closer to the shore, disembarked her crew and emptied her cargo holds, and then burned and sank the vessel. The incident was chronicled in the "Boston News-Letter", which called Teach the commander of a "French ship of 32 Guns, a <a href="Brigantine">Briganteen</a> of 10 guns and a Sloop of 12 guns." When or where Teach collected the ten gun briganteen is unknown, but by that time he may have been in command of at least 150 men split among three vessels.

On 5 December 1717 Teach stopped the merchant sloop "Margaret" off the coast of Crab Island, near <a href="Anguilla">Anguilla</a>. Her captain, Henry Bostock, and crew, remained Teach's prisoners for about eight hours, and were forced to watch as their sloop was ransacked. Bostock, who had been held aboard "Queen Anne's Revenge", was returned unharmed to "Margaret" and was allowed to leave with his crew. He returned to his base of operations on <a href="Saint%20Christopher%20Island">Saint Christopher Island</a> and reported the matter to Governor Walter Hamilton, who requested that he sign an <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a> about the encounter. Bostock's deposition details Teach's command of two vessels: a sloop and a large French guineaman, Dutch-built, with 36 cannon and a crew of 300 men. The captain believed that the larger ship carried valuable gold dust, silver plate, and "a very fine cup" supposedly taken from the commander of "Great Allen". Teach's crew had apparently informed Bostock that they had destroyed several other vessels, and that they intended to sail to <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> and lie in wait for an expected Spanish armada, supposedly laden with money to pay the garrisons. Bostock also claimed that Teach had questioned him about the movements of local ships, but also that he had seemed unsurprised when Bostock told him of an expected royal pardon from London for all pirates.

Bostock's deposition describes Teach as a "tall spare man with a very black beard which he wore very long". It is the first recorded account of Teach's appearance and is the source of his cognomen, Blackbeard. Later descriptions mention that his thick black beard was braided into pigtails, sometimes tied in with small coloured ribbons. Johnson (1724) described him as "such a figure that imagination cannot form an idea of a fury from hell to look more frightful." Whether Johnson's description was entirely truthful or embellished is unclear, but it seems likely that Teach understood the value of appearances; better to strike fear into the heart of one's enemies, than rely on bluster alone. Teach was tall, with broad shoulders. He wore knee-length boots and dark clothing, topped with a wide hat and sometimes a long coat of brightly coloured silk or velvet. Johnson also described Teach in times of battle as wearing "a sling over his shoulders, with three brace of pistols, hanging in holsters like bandoliers; and stuck lighted matches (<a href="Slow%20match">Slow match</a>) under his hat", the latter apparently to emphasise the fearsome appearance he wished to present to his enemies. Despite his ferocious reputation though, there are no verified accounts of his ever having murdered or harmed those he held captive. Teach may have used other aliases; on 30 November, the "Monserrat Merchant" encountered two ships and a sloop, commanded by a Captain Kentish and Captain Edwards (the latter a known alias of Stede Bonnet).

Teach's movements between late 1717 and early 1718 are not known. He and Bonnet were probably responsible for an attack off <a href="Sint%20Eustatius">Sint Eustatius</a> in December 1717. Henry Bostock claimed to have heard the pirates say they would head toward the Spanish-controlled <a href="Saman%C3%A1%20Bay">Samaná Bay</a> in Hispaniola, but a cursory search revealed no pirate activity. Captain Hume of reported on 6 February that a "Pyrate Ship of 36 Guns and 250 men, and a Sloop of 10 Guns and 100 men were Said to be Cruizing amongst the Leeward Islands". Hume reinforced his crew with <a href="musket">musket</a>-armed soldiers and joined up with to track the two ships, to no avail, though they discerned that the two ships had sunk a French vessel off <a href="Saint%20Kitts">St Christopher Island</a>, and reported also that they had last been seen "gone down the North side of Hispaniola". Although no confirmation exists that these two ships were controlled by Teach and Bonnet, author Angus Konstam believes it very likely they were.
In March 1718, while taking on water at Turneffe Island east of <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, both ships spotted the Jamaican logwood cutting sloop "Adventure" making for the harbour. She was stopped and her captain, <a href="David%20Herriot">Harriot</a>, invited to join the pirates. Harriot and his crew accepted the invitation, and Teach sent over a crew to sail "Adventure" making <a href="Israel%20Hands">Israel Hands</a> the captain. They sailed for the <a href="Bay%20of%20Honduras">Bay of Honduras</a>, where they added another ship and four sloops to their flotilla. On 9 April Teach's enlarged fleet of ships looted and burnt "Protestant Caesar". His fleet then sailed to <a href="Grand%20Cayman">Grand Cayman</a> where they captured a "small turtler". Teach probably sailed toward Havana, where he may have captured a small Spanish vessel that had left the Cuban port. They then sailed to the wrecks of the <a href="1715%20Treasure%20Fleet">1715 Spanish fleet</a>, off the eastern coast of <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. There Teach disembarked the crew of the captured Spanish sloop, before proceeding north to the port of Charles Town, South Carolina, attacking three vessels along the way.

By May 1718, Teach had awarded himself the rank of <a href="Commodore%20%28rank%29">Commodore</a> and was at the height of his power. Late that month his flotilla blockaded the port of Charles Town in the <a href="Province%20of%20South%20Carolina">Province of South Carolina</a>. All vessels entering or leaving the port were stopped, and as the town had no <a href="guard%20ship">guard ship</a>, its <a href="pilot%20boat">pilot boat</a> was the first to be captured. Over the next five or six days about nine vessels were stopped and ransacked as they attempted to sail past <a href="Charleston%20Bar">Charles Town Bar</a>, where Teach's fleet was anchored. One such ship, headed for London with a group of prominent Charles Town citizens which included Samuel Wragg (a member of the Council of the Province of Carolina), was the "Crowley". Her passengers were questioned about the vessels still in port and then locked below decks for about half a day. Teach informed the prisoners that his fleet required medical supplies from the colonial government of South Carolina, and that if none were forthcoming, all prisoners would be executed, their heads sent to the Governor and all captured ships burnt.

Wragg agreed to Teach's demands, and a Mr. Marks and two pirates were given two days to collect the drugs. Teach moved his fleet, and the captured ships, to within about five or six <a href="League%20%28unit%29">leagues</a> from land. Three days later a messenger, sent by Marks, returned to the fleet; Marks's boat had capsized and delayed their arrival in Charles Town. Teach granted a reprieve of two days, but still the party did not return. He then called a meeting of his fellow sailors and moved eight ships into the harbour, causing panic within the town. When Marks finally returned to the fleet, he explained what had happened. On his arrival he had presented the pirates' demands to the Governor and the drugs had been quickly gathered, but the two pirates sent to escort him had proved difficult to find; they had been busy drinking with friends and were finally discovered, drunk.

Teach kept to his side of the bargain and released the captured ships and his prisoners—albeit relieved of their valuables, including the fine clothing some had worn.

Whilst at Charles Town, Teach learned that Woodes Rogers had left England with several <a href="Man-of-war">men-of-war</a>, with orders to purge the West Indies of pirates. Teach's flotilla sailed northward along the Atlantic coast and into <a href="Topsail%20Inlet">Topsail Inlet</a> (commonly known as Beaufort Inlet), off the coast of North Carolina. There they intended to <a href="Careening">careen</a> their ships to scrape their hulls, but on 10 June, 1718 the "Queen Anne's Revenge" ran aground on a sandbar, cracking her <a href="main-mast">main-mast</a> and severely damaging many of her timbers. Teach ordered several sloops to throw ropes across the flagship in an attempt to free her. A sloop commanded by <a href="Israel%20Hands">Israel Hands</a> of "Adventure" also ran aground, and both vessels appeared to be damaged beyond repair, leaving only "Revenge" and the captured Spanish sloop.

Teach had at some stage learnt of the offer of a royal pardon and probably confided in Bonnet his willingness to accept it. The pardon was open to all pirates who surrendered on or before 5 September 1718, but contained a caveat stipulating that immunity was offered only against crimes committed before 5 January. Although in theory this left Bonnet and Teach at risk of being hanged for their actions at Charles Town Bar, most authorities could waive such conditions. Teach thought that Governor <a href="Charles%20Eden%20%28politician%29">Charles Eden</a> was a man he could trust, but to make sure, he waited to see what would happen to another captain. Bonnet left immediately on a small sailing boat for Bath Town, where he surrendered to Governor Eden, and received his pardon. He then travelled back to Beaufort Inlet to collect the "Revenge" and the remainder of his crew, intending to sail to <a href="Saint%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Thomas Island</a> to receive a commission. Unfortunately for him, Teach had stripped the vessel of its valuables and provisions, and had marooned its crew; Bonnet set out for revenge, but was unable to find him. He and his crew returned to piracy and were captured on 27 September 1718 at the mouth of the <a href="Cape%20Fear%20River">Cape Fear River</a>. All but four were tried and hanged in Charles Town.

The author Robert Lee surmised that Teach and Hands intentionally ran the ships aground to reduce the fleet's crew complement, increasing their share of the spoils. During the trial of Bonnet's crew, "Revenge"s <a href="boatswain">boatswain</a> Ignatius Pell testified that "the ship was run ashore and lost, which Thatch [Teach] caused to be done." Lee considers it plausible that Teach let Bonnet in on his plan to accept a pardon from Governor Eden. He suggested that Bonnet do the same, and as war between the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Quadruple%20Alliance">Quadruple Alliance of 1718</a> and Spain was threatening, to consider taking a privateer's commission from England. Lee suggests that Teach also offered Bonnet the return of his ship "Revenge". Konstam (2007) proposes a similar idea, explaining that Teach began to see "Queen Anne's Revenge" as something of a liability; while a pirate fleet was anchored, news of this was sent to neighbouring towns and colonies, and any vessels nearby would delay sailing. It was prudent therefore for Teach not to linger for too long, although wrecking the ship was a somewhat extreme measure.

Before sailing northward on his remaining sloop to <a href="Ocracoke%20Inlet">Ocracoke Inlet</a>, Teach marooned about 25 men on a small sandy island about a league from the mainland. He may have done this to stifle any protest they made, if they guessed their captain's plans. Bonnet rescued them two days later. Teach continued on to Bath, where in June 1718—only days after Bonnet had departed with his pardon—he and his much-reduced crew received their pardon from Governor Eden.

He settled in Bath, on the eastern side of Bath Creek at Plum Point, near Eden's home. During July and August he travelled between his base in the town and his sloop off Ocracoke. Johnson's account states that he <a href="Mary%20Ormond">married</a> the daughter of a local plantation owner, although there is no supporting evidence for this. Eden gave Teach permission to sail to St Thomas to seek a commission as a privateer (a useful way of removing bored and troublesome pirates from the small settlement), and Teach was given official title to his remaining sloop, which he renamed "Adventure". By the end of August he had returned to piracy, and in the same month the Governor of Pennsylvania issued a warrant for his arrest, but by then Teach was probably operating in <a href="Delaware%20Bay">Delaware Bay</a>, some distance away. He took two French ships leaving the Caribbean, moved one crew across to the other, and sailed the remaining ship back to Ocracoke. In September he told Eden that he had found the French ship at sea, deserted. A <a href="Vice%20admiralty%20court">Vice Admiralty Court</a> was quickly convened, presided over by Tobias Knight and the Collector of Customs. The ship was judged as a derelict found at sea, and of its cargo twenty <a href="hogshead">hogshead</a>s of sugar were awarded to Knight and sixty to Eden; Teach and his crew were given what remained in the vessel's hold.

Ocracoke Inlet was Teach's favourite anchorage. It was a perfect vantage point from which to view ships travelling between the various settlements of northeast Carolina, and it was from there that Teach first spotted the approaching ship of <a href="Charles%20Vane">Charles Vane</a>, another English pirate. Several months earlier Vane had rejected the pardon brought by Woodes Rogers and escaped the men-of-war the English captain brought with him to <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>. He had also been pursued by Teach's old commander, Benjamin Hornigold, who was by then a pirate hunter. Teach and Vane spent several nights on the southern tip of Ocracoke Island, accompanied by such notorious figures as Israel Hands, Robert Deal and <a href="Calico%20Jack">Calico Jack</a>.

As it spread throughout the neighbouring colonies, the news of Teach and Vane's impromptu party worried the Governor of Pennsylvania enough to send out two sloops to capture the pirates. They were unsuccessful, but Governor of Virginia Alexander Spotswood was also concerned that the supposedly retired freebooter and his crew were living in nearby North Carolina. Some of Teach's former crew had already moved into several Virginian seaport towns, prompting Spotswood to issue a proclamation on 10 July, requiring all former pirates to make themselves known to the authorities, to give up their arms and to not travel in groups larger than three. As head of a <a href="Crown%20colony">Crown colony</a>, Spotswood viewed the <a href="proprietary%20colony">proprietary colony</a> of North Carolina with contempt; he had little faith in the ability of the Carolinians to control the pirates, who he suspected would be back to their old ways, disrupting Virginian commerce, as soon as their money ran out.

Spotswood learnt that William Howard, the former quartermaster of "Queen Anne's Revenge", was in the area, and believing that he might know of Teach's whereabouts had the pirate and his two slaves arrested. Spotswood had no legal authority to have pirates tried, and as a result, Howard's attorney, John Holloway, brought charges against Captain Brand of , where Howard was imprisoned. He also sued on Howard's behalf for damages of £500, claiming wrongful arrest.

Spotswood's council claimed that Teach's presence was a crisis and that under a statute of <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>, the governor was entitled to try Howard without a jury. The charges referred to several acts of piracy supposedly committed after the pardon's cut-off date, in "a sloop belonging to ye subjects of the King of Spain", but ignored the fact that they took place outside Spotswood's jurisdiction and in a vessel then legally owned. Another charge cited two attacks, one of which was the capture of a slave ship off Charles Town Bar, from which one of Howard's slaves was presumed to have come. Howard was sent to await trial before a Court of Vice-Admiralty, on the charge of piracy, but Brand and his colleague, Captain Gordon (of ) refused to serve with Holloway present. Incensed, Holloway had no option but to stand down, and was replaced by the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Virginia">Attorney General of Virginia</a>, John Clayton, whom Spotswood described as "an honester man [than Holloway]". Howard was found guilty and sentenced to be hanged, but was saved by a commission from London, which directed Spotswood to pardon all acts of piracy committed by surrendering pirates before 23 July 1718.

Spotswood had obtained from Howard valuable information on Teach's whereabouts, and he planned to send his forces across the border into North Carolina to capture him. He gained the support of two men keen to discredit North Carolina's Governor—Edward Moseley and Colonel Maurice Moore. He also wrote to the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Lords of Trade</a>, suggesting that the Crown might benefit financially from Teach's capture. Spotswood personally financed the operation, possibly believing that Teach had fabulous treasures hidden away. He ordered Captains Gordon and Brand of HMS "Pearl" and HMS "Lyme" to travel overland to Bath. Lieutenant Robert Maynard of HMS "Pearl" was given command of two commandeered sloops, to approach the town from the sea. An extra incentive for Teach's capture was the offer of a reward from the Assembly of Virginia, over and above any that might be received from the Crown.

Maynard took command of the two armed sloops on 17 November. He was given 57 men—33 from HMS "Pearl" and 24 from HMS "Lyme". Maynard and the detachment from HMS "Pearl" took the larger of the two vessels and named her "Jane"; the rest took "Ranger", commanded by one of Maynard's officers, a Mister Hyde. Some from the two ships' civilian crews remained aboard. They sailed from <a href="Kecoughtan%2C%20Virginia">Kecoughtan</a>, along the <a href="James%20River%20%28Virginia%29">James River</a>, on 17 November. The two sloops moved slowly, giving Brand's force time to reach Bath. Brand set out for North Carolina six days later, arriving within three miles of Bath on 23 November. Included in Brand's force were several North Carolinians, including Colonel Moore and Captain Jeremiah Vail, sent to put down any local objection to the presence of foreign soldiers. Moore went into the town to see if Teach was there, reporting back that he was not, but that the pirate was expected at "every minute." Brand then went to Governor Eden's home and informed him of his purpose. The next day, Brand sent two canoes down <a href="Pamlico%20River">Pamlico River</a> to Ocracoke Inlet, to see if Teach could be seen. They returned two days later and reported on what eventually transpired.

Maynard found the pirates anchored on the inner side of <a href="Ocracoke%2C%20North%20Carolina">Ocracoke Island</a>, on the evening of 21 November. He had ascertained their position from ships he had stopped along his journey, but unfamiliar with the local channels and shoals he decided to wait until the following morning to make his attack. He stopped all traffic from entering the inlet—preventing any warning of his presence—and posted a lookout on both sloops to ensure that Teach could not escape to sea. On the other side of the island, Teach was busy entertaining guests and had not set a lookout. With Israel Hands ashore in Bath with about 24 of "Adventure"s sailors, he also had a much-reduced crew. Johnson (1724) reported that the pirate had "no more than twenty-five men on board" and that he "gave out to all the vessels that he spoke with that he had forty". "Thirteen white and six Negroes", was the number later reported by Brand to the Admiralty.

At daybreak, preceded by a small boat taking <a href="Depth%20sounding">soundings</a>, Maynard's two sloops entered the channel. The small craft was quickly spotted by "Adventure" and fired at as soon as it was within range of her guns. While the boat made a quick retreat to the "Jane", Teach cut the "Adventure"s anchor cable. His crew hoisted the sails and the "Adventure" manoeuvred to point her starboard guns toward Maynard's sloops, which were slowly closing the gap. Hyde moved "Ranger" to the port side of "Jane" and the <a href="Union%20flag">Union flag</a> was unfurled on each ship. "Adventure" then turned toward the beach of Ocracoke Island, heading for a narrow channel. What happened next is uncertain. Johnson claimed that there was an exchange of <a href="small%20arms">small arms</a> fire following which "Adventure" ran aground on a <a href="Shoal">sandbar</a>, and Maynard anchored and then lightened his ship to pass over the obstacle. Another version claimed that "Jane" and "Ranger" ran aground, although Maynard made no mention of this in his log.
What is certain though is that "Adventure" turned her guns on the two ships and fired. The broadside was devastating; in an instant, Maynard had lost as much as a third of his forces. About 20 on "Jane" were either wounded or killed and 9 on "Ranger". Hyde was dead and his second and third officers either dead or seriously injured. His sloop was so badly damaged that it played no further role in the attack. Again, contemporary accounts of what happened next are confused, but small-arms fire from "Jane" may have cut "Adventure"s <a href="jib%20sheet">jib sheet</a>, causing her to lose control and run onto the sandbar. In the aftermath of Teach's overwhelming attack, "Jane" and "Ranger" may also have been grounded; the battle would have become a race to see who could float their ship first.
The lieutenant had kept many of his men below deck and in anticipation of being boarded told them to prepare for close fighting. Teach watched as the gap between the vessels closed, and ordered his men to be ready. The two vessels contacted one another as the "Adventure"s grappling hooks hit their target and several grenades, made from powder and shot-filled bottles and ignited by fuses, broke across the sloop's deck. As the smoke cleared, Teach led his men aboard, buoyant at the sight of Maynard's apparently empty ship, his men firing at the small group formed by the lieutenant and his men at the <a href="stern">stern</a>.

The rest of Maynard's men then burst from the hold, shouting and firing. The plan to surprise Teach and his crew worked; the pirates were apparently taken aback at the assault. Teach rallied his men and the two groups fought across the deck, which was already slick with blood from those killed or injured by Teach's broadside. Maynard and Teach fired their <a href="flintlock">flintlock</a>s at each other, then threw them away. Teach drew his cutlass and managed to break Maynard's sword. Against superior training and a slight advantage in numbers, the pirates were pushed back toward the bow, allowing the "Jane"s crew to surround Maynard and Teach, who was by then completely isolated. As Maynard drew back to fire once again, Teach moved in to attack him, but was slashed across the neck by one of Maynard's men. Badly wounded, he was then attacked and killed by several more of Maynard's crew. The remaining pirates quickly surrendered. Those left on the "Adventure" were captured by the "Ranger"s crew, including one who planned to set fire to the powder room and blow up the ship. Varying accounts exist of the battle's list of casualties; Maynard reported that 8 of his men and 12 pirates were killed. Brand reported that 10 pirates and 11 of Maynard's men were killed. Spotswood claimed ten pirates and ten of the King's men dead.
Maynard later examined Teach's body, noting that it had been shot five times and cut about twenty. He also found several items of correspondence, including a letter to the pirate from Tobias Knight. Teach's corpse was thrown into the inlet and his head was suspended from the <a href="bowsprit">bowsprit</a> of Maynard's sloop so that the reward could be collected.

Lieutenant Maynard remained at Ocracoke for several more days, making repairs and burying the dead. Teach's loot—sugar, cocoa, <a href="Indigo%20dye">indigo</a> and cotton—found "in pirate sloops and ashore in a tent where the sloops lay", was sold at auction along with sugar and cotton found in Tobias Knight's barn, for £2,238. Governor Spotswood used a portion of this to pay for the entire operation. The prize money for capturing Teach was to have been about £400, but it was split between the crews of HMS "Lyme" and HMS "Pearl". As Captain Brand and his troops had not been the ones fighting for their lives, Maynard thought this extremely unfair. He lost much of any support he may have had though when it was discovered that he and his crew had helped themselves to about £90 of Teach's booty. The two companies did not receive their prize money for another four years, and despite his bravery Maynard was not promoted; instead, he faded into obscurity.

The remainder of Teach's crew and former associates were found by Brand, in Bath, and were transported to <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg, Virginia</a>, where they were jailed on charges of piracy. Several were black, prompting Spotswood to ask his council what could be done about "the Circumstances of these Negroes to exempt them from undergoing the same Tryal as other pirates." Regardless, the men were tried with their comrades in Williamsburg's Capitol building, under admiralty law, on 12 March 1719. No records of the day's proceedings remain, but 14 of the 16 accused were found guilty. Of the remaining two, one proved that he had partaken of the fight out of necessity, having been on Teach's ship only as a guest at a drinking party the night before, and not as a pirate. The other, Israel Hands, was not present at the fight. He claimed that during a drinking session Teach had shot him in the knee, and that he was still covered by the royal pardon. The remaining pirates were <a href="Hanging%23Short%20drop">hanged</a>, then left to rot in <a href="gibbet">gibbet</a>s along Williamsburg's Capitol Landing Road (known for some time after as "Gallows Road").

Governor Eden was certainly embarrassed by Spotswood's invasion of North Carolina, and Spotswood disavowed himself of any part of the seizure. He defended his actions, writing to <a href="John%20Carteret%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Granville">Lord Carteret</a>, a shareholder of the Province of Carolina, that he might benefit from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests. He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden "could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design", and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king. Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice. By criticising Eden, Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion. Lee (1974) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means, he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina, to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods. Eden doubtless shared the same view. As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach, on 4 April 1719, Eden had Knight brought in for questioning. Israel Hands had, weeks earlier, testified that Knight had been on board the "Adventure" in August 1718, shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize. Four pirates had testified that with Teach, they had visited Knight's home to give him presents. This testimony and the letter found on Teach's body by Maynard appeared compelling, but Knight conducted his defence with competence. Despite being very sick and close to death, he questioned the reliability of Spotswood's witnesses. He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress, and that under North Carolinian law, the other witness, an African, was unable to testify. The sugar, he argued, was stored at his house legally, and Teach had visited him only on business, in his official capacity. The board found Knight innocent of all charges. He died later that year.

Eden was annoyed that the accusations against Knight arose during a trial in which he played no part. The goods which Brand seized were officially North Carolinian property and Eden considered him a thief. The argument raged back and forth between the colonies until Eden's death on 17 March 1722. His will named one of Spotswood's opponents, John Holloway, a beneficiary. In the same year, Spotswood, who for years had fought his enemies in the <a href="House%20of%20Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a> and the Council, was replaced by <a href="Hugh%20Drysdale">Hugh Drysdale</a>, once <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a> was convinced to act.

Official views on pirates were sometimes quite different from those held by contemporary authors, who often described their subjects as despicable rogues of the sea. Privateers who became pirates were generally considered by the English government to be reserve naval forces, and were sometimes given active encouragement; as far back as 1581 <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a> was knighted by <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth</a>, when he returned to England from a round-the-world expedition with plunder worth an estimated £1,500,000. Royal pardons were regularly issued, usually when England was on the verge of war, and the public's opinion of pirates was often favourable, some considering them akin to patrons. Economist <a href="Peter%20Leeson">Peter Leeson</a> believes that pirates were generally shrewd businessmen, far removed from the modern, romanticised view of them as barbarians. After Woodes Rogers' 1718 landing at New Providence and his ending of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Pirates">pirate republic</a>, piracy in the West Indies fell into terminal decline. With no easily accessible outlet to fence their stolen goods, pirates were reduced to a subsistence livelihood, and following almost a century of naval warfare between the British, French and Spanish—during which sailors could find easy employment—lone privateers found themselves outnumbered by the powerful ships employed by the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> to defend its merchant fleets. The popularity of the slave trade helped bring to an end the frontier condition of the West Indies, and in these circumstances, piracy was no longer able to flourish as it once did.

Since the end of this so-called <a href="golden%20age%20of%20piracy">golden age of piracy</a>, Teach and his exploits have become the stuff of lore, inspiring books, films and even amusement park rides. Much of what is known about him can be sourced to Charles Johnson's "<a href="A%20General%20Historie%20of%20the%20Robberies%20and%20Murders%20of%20the%20Most%20Notorious%20Pyrates">A General Historie of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates</a>", published in Britain in 1724. A recognised authority on the pirates of his time, Johnson's descriptions of such figures as <a href="Anne%20Bonny">Anne Bonny</a> and <a href="Mary%20Read">Mary Read</a> were for years required reading for those interested in the subject. Readers were titillated by his stories and a second edition was quickly published, though author Angus Konstam suspects that Johnson's entry on Blackbeard was "coloured a little to make a more sensational story." "A General Historie", though, is generally considered to be a reliable source. Johnson may have been an assumed alias. As Johnson's accounts have been corroborated in personal and official dispatches, Lee (1974) considers that whoever he was, he had some access to official correspondence. Konstam speculates further, suggesting that Johnson may have been the English playwright <a href="Charles%20Johnson%20%28writer%29">Charles Johnson</a>, the British publisher <a href="Charles%20Rivington">Charles Rivington</a>, or the writer <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>. In his 1951 work "The Great Days of Piracy", author George Woodbury wrote that Johnson is "obviously a pseudonym", continuing "one cannot help suspecting that he may have been a pirate himself."

Despite his infamy, Teach was not the most successful of pirates. <a href="Henry%20Every">Henry Every</a> retired a rich man, and <a href="Bartholomew%20Roberts">Bartholomew Roberts</a> took an estimated five times the amount Teach stole. Treasure hunters have long busied themselves searching for any trace of his rumoured hoard of gold and silver, but nothing found in the numerous sites explored along the east coast of the US has ever been connected to him. Some tales suggest that pirates often killed a prisoner on the spot where they buried their loot, and Teach is no exception in these stories, but that no finds have come to light is not exceptional; buried pirate treasure is often considered a modern myth for which almost no supporting evidence exists. The available records include nothing to suggest that the burial of treasure was a common practice, except in the imaginations of the writers of fictional accounts such as "<a href="Treasure%20Island">Treasure Island</a>". Such hoards would necessitate a wealthy owner, and their supposed existence ignores the command structure of a pirate vessel, in which the crew served for a share of the profit. The only pirate ever known to bury treasure was <a href="William%20Kidd">William Kidd</a>; the only treasure so far recovered from Teach's exploits is that taken from the wreckage of what is presumed to be the "Queen Anne's Revenge", which was found in 1996. As of 2009 more than 250,000 artefacts had been recovered. A selection is on public display at the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Maritime%20Museum">North Carolina Maritime Museum</a>.

Various <a href="Credulity">superstitious</a> tales exist of Teach's ghost. Unexplained lights at sea are often referred to as "Teach's light", and some recitals claim that the notorious pirate now roams the afterlife searching for his head, for fear that his friends, and the Devil, will not recognise him. A North Carolinian tale holds that Teach's skull was used as the basis for a silver drinking chalice; a local judge even claimed to have drunk from it one night in the 1930s.

The name of Blackbeard has been attached to many local attractions, such as Charleston's Blackbeard's Cove.

His name and persona have also featured heavily in literature. He is the main subject of Matilda Douglas's fictional 1835 work "Blackbeard: A page from the colonial history of Philadelphia".

Film renditions of his life include "<a href="Blackbeard%20the%20Pirate">Blackbeard the Pirate</a>" (1952), "<a href="Blackbeard%27s%20Ghost">Blackbeard's Ghost</a>" (1968), "<a href="Blackbeard%20%282005%20film%29">Blackbeard: Terror at Sea</a>" (2005) and the 2006 <a href="Hallmark%20Channel">Hallmark Channel</a> miniseries "<a href="Blackbeard%20%282006%20film%29">Blackbeard</a>". Parallels have also been drawn between Johnson's Blackbeard and the character of Captain <a href="Jack%20Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a> in the 2003 adventure film, "". Blackbeard is also portrayed as a central character in two recent TV series. In the short lived <a href="Crossbones%20%28TV%20series%29">Crossbones</a> (2014) he is played by <a href="John%20Malkovich">John Malkovich</a>. The British actor <a href="Ray%20Stevenson%20%28actor%29">Ray Stevenson</a> plays him in season three and four of <a href="Black%20Sails%20%28TV%20series%29">Black Sails</a> (2016–2017).

Battle of the Nile

The Battle of the Nile (also known as the Battle of Aboukir Bay; ) was a major naval battle fought between the British <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and the Navy of the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French Republic</a> at <a href="Aboukir%20Bay">Aboukir Bay</a> on the Mediterranean coast off the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a> of <a href="Egypt%20Eyalet">Egypt</a> from the 1st to the 3rd of August 1798. The battle was the climax of a <a href="Mediterranean%20campaign%20of%201798">naval campaign</a> that had raged across the Mediterranean during the previous three months, as a large French convoy sailed from <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a> to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> carrying an expeditionary force under General <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. The British fleet was led in the battle by Rear-Admiral Sir <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Horatio Nelson</a>; they decisively defeated the French under Vice-Admiral <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Paul%20Brueys%20d%27Aigalliers">François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers</a>.

Bonaparte sought to invade Egypt as the first step in a campaign against <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, part of a greater effort to drive Britain out of the <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">French Revolutionary Wars</a>. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the <a href="Tagus">Tagus</a> to learn the purpose of the French expedition and to defeat it. He chased the French for more than two months, on several occasions missing them only by a matter of hours. Bonaparte was aware of Nelson's pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination. He was able to capture <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.

With the French army ashore, the French fleet anchored in Aboukir Bay, northeast of Alexandria. Commander Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers believed that he had established a formidable defensive position. The British fleet arrived off Egypt on 1 August and discovered Brueys's dispositions, and Nelson ordered an immediate attack. His ships advanced on the French line and split into two divisions as they approached. One cut across the head of the line and passed between the anchored French and the shore, while the other engaged the seaward side of the French fleet.

Trapped in a crossfire, the leading French warships were battered into surrender during a fierce three-hour battle, while the centre succeeded in repelling the initial British attack. As British reinforcements arrived, the centre came under renewed assault and, at 22:00, the French flagship <a href="French%20ship%20Orient%20%281791%29">"Orient"</a> exploded. The rear division of the French fleet attempted to break out of the bay, with Brueys dead and his <a href="vanguard">vanguard</a> and centre defeated, but only two <a href="ships%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> and two <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s escaped from a total of 17 ships engaged.

The battle reversed the strategic situation between the two nations' forces in the Mediterranean and entrenched the Royal Navy in the dominant position that it retained for the rest of the war. It also encouraged other European countries to turn against France, and was a factor in the outbreak of the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Second%20Coalition">War of the Second Coalition</a>. Bonaparte's army was trapped in Egypt, and Royal Navy dominance off the Syrian coast contributed significantly to the French defeat at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Acre%20%281799%29">Siege of Acre</a> in 1799 which preceded Bonaparte's return to Europe. Nelson had been wounded in the battle, and he was proclaimed a hero across Europe and was subsequently made <a href="Baron%20Nelson">Baron Nelson</a>—although he was privately dissatisfied with his rewards. His captains were also highly praised and went on to form the nucleus of the legendary <a href="Nelson%27s%20Band%20of%20Brothers">Nelson's Band of Brothers</a>. The legend of the battle has remained prominent in the popular consciousness, with perhaps the best-known representation being <a href="Felicia%20Hemans">Felicia Hemans</a>' 1826 poem "<a href="Casabianca%20%28poem%29">Casabianca</a>".

<a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>'s victories in northern Italy over the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a> helped secure victory for the French in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20First%20Coalition">War of the First Coalition</a> in 1797, and Great Britain remained the only major European power still at war with the <a href="French%20First%20Republic">French Republic</a>. The <a href="French%20Directory">French Directory</a> investigated a number of strategic options to counter British opposition, including projected invasions of Ireland and Britain and the expansion of the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> to challenge the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> at sea. Despite significant efforts, British control of Northern European waters rendered these ambitions impractical in the short term, and the Royal Navy remained firmly in control of the Atlantic Ocean. However, the French navy was dominant in the Mediterranean, following the withdrawal of the British fleet after the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain in 1796. This allowed Bonaparte to propose an <a href="Napoleonic%20Campaign%20in%20Egypt">invasion of Egypt</a> as an alternative to confronting Britain directly, believing that the British would be too distracted by an imminent <a href="Irish%20Rebellion%20of%201798">Irish uprising</a> to intervene in the Mediterranean.

Bonaparte believed that, by establishing a permanent presence in Egypt (nominally part of the neutral <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>), the French would obtain a staging point for future operations against <a href="British%20India">British India</a>, possibly in conjunction with the <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> of <a href="Seringapatam">Seringapatam</a>, that might successfully drive the British out of the war. The campaign would sever the chain of communication that connected Britain with India, an essential part of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> whose trade generated the wealth that Britain required to prosecute the war successfully. The French Directory agreed with Bonaparte's plans, although a major factor in their decision was a desire to see the politically ambitious Bonaparte and the fiercely loyal veterans of his Italian campaigns travel as far from France as possible. During the spring of 1798, Bonaparte assembled more than 35,000 soldiers in Mediterranean France and Italy and developed a powerful fleet at <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a>. He also formed the "<a href="Commission%20des%20Sciences%20et%20des%20Arts">Commission des Sciences et des Arts</a>", a body of scientists and engineers intended to establish a French colony in Egypt. Napoleon kept the destination of the expedition top secret—most of the army's officers did not know of its target, and Bonaparte did not publicly reveal his goal until the first stage of the expedition was complete.

Bonaparte's armada sailed from Toulon on 19 May 1798, making rapid progress through the <a href="Ligurian%20Sea">Ligurian Sea</a> and collecting more ships at <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, before sailing southwards along the <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>n coast and passing <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> on 7 June. On 9 June, the fleet arrived off <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, then under the ownership of the <a href="Knights%20of%20St.%20John%20of%20Jerusalem">Knights of St. John of Jerusalem</a>, ruled by <a href="List%20of%20Grand%20Masters%20of%20the%20Knights%20Hospitaller">Grand Master</a> <a href="Ferdinand%20von%20Hompesch%20zu%20Bolheim">Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim</a>. Bonaparte demanded that his fleet be permitted entry to the fortified harbour of <a href="Valletta">Valletta</a>. When the Knights refused, the French general responded by ordering a large scale invasion of the Maltese Islands, overrunning the defenders after 24 hours of skirmishing. The Knights formally surrendered on 12 June and, in exchange for substantial financial compensation, handed the islands and all of their resources over to Bonaparte, including the extensive property of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> on Malta. Within a week, Bonaparte had resupplied his ships, and on 19 June, his fleet departed for <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> in the direction of <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, leaving 4,000 men at Valletta under General <a href="Claude-Henri%20Belgrand%20de%20Vaubois">Claude-Henri Vaubois</a> to ensure French control of the islands.

While Bonaparte was sailing to Malta, the Royal Navy re-entered the Mediterranean for the first time in more than a year. Alarmed by reports of French preparations on the Mediterranean coast, <a href="George%20Spencer%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Spencer">Lord Spencer</a> at the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> sent a message to Vice-Admiral <a href="John%20Jervis%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20St%20Vincent">Earl St. Vincent</a>, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet based in the <a href="Tagus%20River">Tagus River</a>, to despatch a squadron to investigate. This squadron, consisting of three <a href="Ship%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> and three <a href="frigates">frigates</a>, was entrusted to Rear-Admiral Sir Horatio Nelson.

Nelson was a highly experienced officer who had been blinded in one eye during fighting in <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> in 1794 and subsequently commended for his capture of two Spanish <a href="ships%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20St.%20Vincent%20%281797%29">Battle of Cape St. Vincent</a> in February 1797. In July 1797, he lost an arm at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Santa%20Cruz%20de%20Tenerife%20%281797%29">Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife</a> and had been forced to return to Britain to recuperate. Returning to the fleet at the Tagus in late April 1798, he was ordered to collect the squadron stationed at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and sail for the Ligurian Sea. On 21 May, as Nelson's squadron approached Toulon, it was struck by a fierce gale and Nelson's flagship, <a href="HMS%20Vanguard%20%281787%29">HMS "Vanguard"</a>, lost its topmasts and was almost wrecked on the Corsican coast. The remainder of the squadron was scattered. The ships of the line sheltered at <a href="San%20Pietro%20Island">San Pietro Island</a> off Sardinia; the frigates were blown to the west and failed to return.

On 7 June, following hasty repairs to his flagship, a fleet consisting of ten ships of the line and a <a href="fourth-rate">fourth-rate</a> joined Nelson off Toulon. The fleet, under the command of Captain <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Troubridge%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Troubridge</a>, had been sent by Earl St. Vincent to reinforce Nelson, with orders that he was to pursue and intercept the Toulon convoy. Although he now had enough ships to challenge the French fleet, Nelson suffered two great disadvantages: He had no intelligence regarding the destination of the French, and no frigates to scout ahead of his force. Striking southwards in the hope of collecting information about French movements, Nelson's ships stopped at <a href="Elba">Elba</a> and <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, where the British ambassador, <a href="William%20Hamilton%20%28diplomat%29">Sir William Hamilton</a>, reported that the French fleet had passed Sicily headed in the direction of Malta. Despite pleas from Nelson and Hamilton, <a href="Ferdinand%20I%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">King Ferdinand of Naples</a> refused to lend his frigates to the British fleet, fearing French reprisals. On 22 June, a brig sailing from <a href="Dubrovnik">Ragusa</a> brought Nelson the news that the French had sailed eastwards from Malta on 16 June. After conferring with his captains, the admiral decided that the French target must be Egypt and set off in pursuit. Incorrectly believing the French to be five days ahead rather than two, Nelson insisted on a direct route to Alexandria without deviation.

On the evening of 22 June, Nelson's fleet passed the French in the darkness, overtaking the slow invasion convoy without realising how close they were to their target. Making rapid time on a direct route, Nelson reached Alexandria on 28 June and discovered that the French were not there. After a meeting with the suspicious Ottoman commander, Sayyid Muhammad Kurayyim, Nelson ordered the British fleet northwards, reaching the coast of <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> on 4 July and turning westwards back towards Sicily. Nelson had missed the French by less than a day—the scouts of the French fleet arrived off Alexandria in the evening of 29 June.

Concerned by his near encounter with Nelson, Bonaparte ordered an immediate invasion, his troops coming ashore in a poorly managed <a href="amphibious%20operation">amphibious operation</a> in which at least 20 drowned. Marching along the coast, the French army stormed Alexandria and captured the city, after which Bonaparte led the main force of his army inland. He instructed his naval commander, Vice-Admiral <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Paul%20Brueys%20D%27Aigalliers">François-Paul Brueys D'Aigalliers</a>, to anchor in Alexandria harbour, but naval surveyors reported that the channel into the harbour was too shallow and narrow for the larger ships of the French fleet. As a result, the French selected an alternative anchorage at <a href="Aboukir%20Bay">Aboukir Bay</a>, northeast of Alexandria.

Nelson's fleet reached <a href="Syracuse%2C%20Sicily">Syracuse</a> in Sicily on 19 July and took on essential supplies. There the admiral wrote letters describing the events of the previous months: "It is an old saying, 'the Devil's children have the Devil's luck.' I cannot find, or at this moment learn, beyond vague conjecture where the French fleet are gone to. All my ill fortune, hitherto, has proceeded from want of frigates." Meanwhile, the French were securing Egypt by the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Pyramids">Battle of the Pyramids</a>. By 24 July, the British fleet was resupplied and, having determined that the French must be somewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean, Nelson sailed again in the direction of the <a href="Morea">Morea</a>. On 28 July, at <a href="Koroni">Coron</a>, Nelson finally obtained intelligence describing the French attack on Egypt and turned south across the Mediterranean. His scouts, <a href="HMS%20Alexander%20%281778%29">HMS "Alexander"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Swiftsure%20%281787%29">HMS "Swiftsure"</a>, sighted the French transport fleet at Alexandria on the afternoon of 1 August.

When Alexandria harbour had proved inadequate for his fleet, Brueys had gathered his captains and discussed their options. Bonaparte had ordered the fleet to anchor in Aboukir Bay, a shallow and exposed anchorage, but had supplemented the orders with the suggestion that, if Aboukir Bay was too dangerous, Brueys could sail north to <a href="Corfu">Corfu</a>, leaving only the transports and a handful of lighter warships at Alexandria. Brueys refused, in the belief that his squadron could provide essential support to the French army on shore, and called his captains aboard his 120-gun flagship "<a href="French%20ship%20Orient%20%281791%29">Orient</a>" to discuss their response should Nelson discover the fleet in its anchorage. Despite vocal opposition from <a href="Contre-amiral">Contre-amiral</a> <a href="Armand%20Blanquet">Armand Blanquet</a>, who insisted that the fleet would be best able to respond in open water, the rest of the captains agreed that anchoring in a <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a> inside the bay presented the strongest tactic for confronting Nelson. It is possible that Bonaparte envisaged Aboukir Bay as a temporary anchorage: on 27 July, he expressed the expectation that Brueys had already transferred his ships to Alexandria, and three days later, he issued orders for the fleet to make for Corfu in preparation for naval operations against the Ottoman territories in the Balkans, although <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> <a href="Irregular%20military">partisans</a> intercepted and killed the courier carrying the instructions.

Aboukir Bay is a coastal indentation across, stretching from the village of <a href="Abu%20Qir">Abu Qir</a> in the west to the town of <a href="Rosetta">Rosetta</a> to the east, where one of the mouths of the <a href="River%20Nile">River Nile</a> empties into the Mediterranean. In 1798, the bay was protected at its western end by extensive rocky <a href="shoal">shoal</a>s which ran into the bay from a <a href="promontory">promontory</a> guarded by Aboukir Castle. A small fort situated on <a href="Nelson%27s%20Island">an island</a> among the rocks protected the shoals. The fort was garrisoned by French soldiers and armed with at least four cannon and two heavy <a href="mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a>. Brueys had augmented the fort with his <a href="bomb%20vessel">bomb vessel</a>s and <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s, anchored among the rocks to the west of the island in a position to give support to the head of the French line. Further shoals ran unevenly to the south of the island and extended across the bay in a rough semicircle approximately from the shore. These shoals were too shallow to permit the passage of larger warships, and so Brueys ordered his thirteen ships of the line to form up in a line of battle following the northeastern edge of the shoals to the south of the island, a position that allowed the ships to disembark supplies from their port sides while covering the landings with their starboard batteries. Orders were issued for each ship to attach strong cables to the bow and stern of their neighbours, which would effectively turn the line into a long battery forming a theoretically impregnable barrier. Brueys positioned a second, inner line of four frigates approximately west of the main line, roughly halfway between the line and the shoal. The van of the French line was led by "<a href="French%20ship%20Guerrier%20%281754%29">Guerrier</a>", positioned southeast of Aboukir Island and about from the edge of the shoals that surrounded the island. The line stretched southeast, with the centre bowed seawards away from the shoal. The French ships were spaced at intervals of and the whole line was long, with the flagship "Orient" at the centre and two large 80-gun ships anchored on either side. The rear division of the line was under the command of Contre-amiral <a href="Pierre-Charles%20Villeneuve">Pierre-Charles Villeneuve</a> in "<a href="French%20ship%20Guillaume%20Tell%20%281795%29">Guillaume Tell</a>".

In deploying his ships in this way, Brueys hoped that the British would be forced by the shoals to attack his strong centre and rear, allowing his van to use the prevailing northeasterly wind to counterattack the British once they were engaged. However, he had made a serious misjudgement: he had left enough room between "Guerrier" and the shoals for an enemy ship to cut across the head of the French line and proceed between the shoals and the French ships, allowing the unsupported vanguard to be caught in a crossfire by two divisions of enemy ships. Compounding this error, the French only prepared their ships for battle on their starboard (seaward) sides, from which they expected the attack would have to come; their landward port sides were unprepared.
The port side gun ports were closed, and the decks on that side were uncleared, with various stored items blocking access to the guns. Brueys' dispositions had a second significant flaw: The 160-yard gaps between ships were large enough for a British ship to push through and break the French line. Furthermore, not all of the French captains had followed Brueys' orders to attach cables to their neighbours' bow and stern, which would have prevented such a manoeuvre. The problem was exacerbated by orders to only anchor at the bow, which allowed the ships to swing with the wind and widened the gaps. It also created areas within the French line not covered by the broadside of any ship. British vessels could anchor in those spaces and engage the French without reply. In addition, the deployment of Brueys' fleet prevented the rear from effectively supporting the van due to the prevailing winds.

A more pressing problem for Brueys was a lack of food and water for the fleet: Bonaparte had unloaded almost all of the provisions carried aboard and no supplies were reaching the ships from the shore. To remedy this, Brueys sent foraging parties of 25 men from each ship along the coast to requisition food, dig wells, and collect water. Constant attacks by Bedouin partisans, however, required escorts of heavily armed guards for each party. Hence, up to a third of the fleet's sailors were away from their ships at any one time. Brueys wrote a letter describing the situation to <a href="List%20of%20Naval%20Ministers%20of%20France">Minister of Marine</a> <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Eustache%20Bruix">Étienne Eustache Bruix</a>, reporting that "Our crews are weak, both in number and quality. Our rigging, in general, out of repair, and I am sure it requires no little courage to undertake the management of a fleet furnished with such tools."

Although initially disappointed that the main French fleet was not at Alexandria, Nelson knew from the presence of the transports that they must be nearby. At 14:00 on 1 August, lookouts on <a href="HMS%20Zealous%20%281785%29">HMS "Zealous"</a> reported the French anchored in Aboukir Bay, its signal lieutenant just beating the lieutenant on <a href="HMS%20Goliath%20%281781%29">HMS "Goliath"</a> with the signal, but inaccurately describing 16 French ships of the line instead of 13. At the same time, French lookouts on "<a href="French%20ship%20Heureux%20%281782%29">Heureux</a>", the ninth ship in the French line, sighted the British fleet approximately nine nautical miles off the mouth of Aboukir Bay. The French initially reported just 11 British ships – "Swiftsure" and "Alexander" were still returning from their scouting operations at Alexandria, and so were to the west of the main fleet, out of sight. Troubridge's ship, <a href="HMS%20Culloden%20%281783%29">HMS "Culloden"</a>"," was also some distance from the main body, towing a captured merchant ship. At the sight of the French, Troubridge abandoned the vessel and made strenuous efforts to rejoin Nelson. Due to the need for so many sailors to work onshore, Brueys had not deployed any of his lighter warships as scouts, which left him unable to react swiftly to the sudden appearance of the British.

As his ships readied for action, Brueys ordered his captains to gather for a conference on "Orient" and hastily recalled his shore parties, although most had still not returned by the start of the battle. To replace them, large numbers of men were taken out of the frigates and distributed among the ships of the line. Brueys also hoped to lure the British fleet onto the shoals at Aboukir Island, sending the brigs "<a href="French%20brig%20Alerte%20%281787%29">Alerte</a>" and "Railleur" to act as decoys in the shallow waters. By 16:00, "Alexander" and "Swiftsure" were also in sight, although some distance from the main British fleet. Brueys gave orders to abandon the plan to remain at anchor and instead for his line to set sail. Blanquet protested the order on the grounds that there were not enough men aboard the French ships to both sail the ships and man the guns. Nelson gave orders for his leading ships to slow down, to allow the British fleet to approach in a more organised formation. This convinced Brueys that rather than risk an evening battle in confined waters, the British were planning to wait for the following day. He rescinded his earlier order to sail. Brueys may have been hoping that the delay would allow him to slip past the British during the night and thus follow Bonaparte's orders not to engage the British fleet directly if he could avoid it.

Nelson ordered the fleet to slow down at 16:00 to allow his ships to rig "springs" on their anchor cables, a system of attaching the bow anchor that increased stability and allowed his ships to swing their <a href="broadside">broadside</a>s to face an enemy while stationary. It also increased manoeuvrability and therefore reduced the risk of coming under <a href="raking%20fire">raking fire</a>. Nelson's plan, shaped through discussion with his senior captains during the return voyage to Alexandria, was to advance on the French and pass down the seaward side of the van and centre of the French line, so that each French ship would face two British ships and the massive "Orient" would be fighting against three. The direction of the wind meant that the French rear division would be unable to join the battle easily and would be cut off from the front portions of the line. To ensure that in the smoke and confusion of a night battle his ships would not accidentally open fire on one another, Nelson ordered that each ship prepare four horizontal lights at the head of their <a href="mizzen">mizzen</a> mast and hoist an illuminated <a href="White%20Ensign">White Ensign</a>, which was different enough from the <a href="French%20tricolour">French tricolour</a> that it would not be mistaken in poor visibility, reducing the risk that British ships might fire on one another in the darkness. As his ship was readied for battle, Nelson held a final dinner with "Vanguard"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s officers, announcing as he rose: "Before this time tomorrow I shall have gained a <a href="peerage%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">peerage</a> or <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>," in reference to the rewards of victory or the traditional burial place of British military heroes.
Shortly after the French order to set sail was abandoned, the British fleet began rapidly approaching once more. Brueys, now expecting to come under attack that night, ordered each of his ships to place springs on their anchor cables and prepare for action. He sent the "Alerte" ahead, which passed close to the leading British ships and then steered sharply to the west over the shoal, in the hope that the ships of the line might follow and become grounded. None of Nelson's captains fell for the ruse and the British fleet continued undeterred. At 17:30, Nelson hailed one of his two leading ships, HMS "Zealous" under Captain <a href="Sir%20Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Baronet">Samuel Hood</a>, which had been racing "Goliath" to be the first to fire on the French. The admiral ordered Hood to establish the safest course into the harbour. The British had no charts of the depth or shape of the bay, except a rough sketch map "Swiftsure" had obtained from a merchant captain, an inaccurate British atlas on "Zealous", and a 35-year-old French map aboard "Goliath". Hood replied that he would take careful <a href="Depth%20sounding">soundings</a> as he advanced to test the depth of the water, and that, "If you will allow the honour of leading you into battle, I will keep the lead going." Shortly afterwards, Nelson paused to speak with the brig <a href="HMS%20Mutine%20%281797%29">HMS "Mutine"</a>, whose commander, Lieutenant <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Hardy%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Hardy</a>, had seized some <a href="maritime%20pilots">maritime pilots</a> from a small Alexandrine vessel. As "Vanguard" came to a stop, the following ships slowed. This caused a gap to open up between "Zealous" and "Goliath" and the rest of the fleet. To counter this effect, Nelson ordered <a href="HMS%20Theseus%20%281786%29">HMS "Theseus"</a> under Captain <a href="Ralph%20Willett%20Miller">Ralph Miller</a> to pass his flagship and join "Zealous" and "Goliath" in the vanguard. By 18:00, the British fleet was again under full sail, "Vanguard" sixth in the line of ten ships as "Culloden" trailed behind to the north and "Alexander" and "Swiftsure" hastened to catch up to the west. Following the rapid change from a loose formation to a rigid line of battle both fleets raised their colours; each British ship added additional <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a>s in its rigging in case its main flag was shot away. At 18:20, as "Goliath" and "Zealous" rapidly bore down on them, the leading French ships "Guerrier" and "<a href="French%20ship%20Conqu%C3%A9rant%20%281747%29">Conquérant</a>" opened fire.
Ten minutes after the French opened fire "Goliath", ignoring fire from the fort to <a href="starboard">starboard</a> and from "Guerrier" to <a href="port%20%28nautical%29">port</a>, most of which was too high to trouble the ship, crossed the head of the French line. Captain <a href="Thomas%20Foley%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Foley</a> had noticed as he approached that there was an unexpected gap between "Guerrier" and the shallow water of the shoal. On his own initiative, Foley decided to exploit this tactical error and changed his angle of approach to sail through the gap. As the bow of "Guerrier" came within range, "Goliath" opened fire, inflicting severe damage with a double-shotted raking broadside as the British ship turned to port and passed down the unprepared port side of "Guerrier." Foley's <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a> and a company of Austrian <a href="grenadier">grenadier</a>s joined the attack, firing their muskets. Foley had intended to anchor alongside the French ship and engage it closely, but his anchor took too long to descend and his ship passed "Guerrier" entirely. "Goliath" eventually stopped close to the bow of "Conquérant", opening fire on the new opponent and using the unengaged starboard guns to exchange occasional shots with the frigate "<a href="French%20frigate%20S%C3%A9rieuse%20%281779%29">Sérieuse</a>" and bomb vessel "Hercule," which were anchored inshore of the battle line.

Foley's attack was followed by Hood in "Zealous", who also crossed the French line and successfully anchored next to "Guerrier" in the space Foley had intended, engaging the lead ship's bow from close range. Within five minutes "Guerrier"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s foremast had fallen, to cheers from the crews of the approaching British ships. The speed of the British advance took the French captains by surprise; they were still aboard "Orient" in conference with the admiral when the firing started. Hastily launching their boats, they returned to their vessels. Captain <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois-Timoth%C3%A9e%20Trullet">Jean-François-Timothée Trullet</a> of "Guerrier" shouted orders from his barge for his men to return fire on "Zealous".

The third British ship into action was <a href="HMS%20Orion%20%281787%29">HMS "Orion"</a> under Captain <a href="James%20Saumarez%2C%201st%20Baron%20de%20Saumarez">Sir James Saumarez</a>, which rounded the engagement at the head of the battle line and passed between the French main line and the frigates that lay closer inshore. As he did so, the frigate "Sérieuse" opened fire on "Orion", wounding two men. The <a href="convention%20in%20naval%20warfare">convention in naval warfare</a> of the time was that ships of the line did not attack frigates when there were ships of equal size to engage, but in firing first French Captain <a href="Claude-Jean%20Martin">Claude-Jean Martin</a> had negated the rule. Saumarez waited until the frigate was at close range before replying. "Orion" needed just one broadside to reduce the frigate to a wreck, and Martin's disabled ship drifted away over the shoal. During the delay this detour caused, two other British ships joined the battle: <a href="HMS%20Theseus%20%281786%29">Theseus</a>, which had been disguised as a <a href="first-rate">first-rate</a> ship, followed Foley's track across "Guerrier"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s bow. Miller steered his ship through the middle of the melee between the anchored British and French ships until he encountered the third French ship, "<a href="HMS%20Spartiate%20%281798%29">Spartiate</a>". Anchoring to port, Miller's ship opened fire at close range. <a href="HMS%20Audacious%20%281785%29">HMS "Audacious"</a> under Captain <a href="Davidge%20Gould">Davidge Gould</a> crossed the French line between "Guerrier" and "Conquérant", anchoring between the ships and raking them both. "Orion" then rejoined the action further south than intended, firing on the fifth French ship, "<a href="French%20ship%20Souverain%20%281792%29">Peuple Souverain</a>," and Admiral Blanquet's flagship, "<a href="French%20ship%20Franklin%20%281797%29">Franklin</a>".

The next three British ships, "Vanguard" in the lead followed by <a href="HMS%20Minotaur%20%281793%29">HMS "Minotaur"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Defence%20%281763%29">HMS "Defence"</a>, remained in line of battle formation and anchored on the starboard side of the French line at 18:40. Nelson focused his flagship's fire on "Spartiate", while Captain <a href="Thomas%20Louis">Thomas Louis</a> in "Minotaur" attacked the unengaged "<a href="French%20ship%20Aquilon%20%281789%29">Aquilon</a>" and Captain <a href="John%20Peyton%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Peyton</a> in "Defence" joined the attack on "Peuple Souverain". With the French vanguard now heavily outnumbered, the following British ships, <a href="HMS%20Bellerophon%20%281786%29">HMS "Bellerophon"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Majestic%20%281785%29">HMS "Majestic"</a>"," passed by the melee and advanced on the so far unengaged French centre. Both ships were soon fighting enemies much more powerful than they and began to take severe damage. Captain <a href="Henry%20D%27Esterre%20Darby">Henry Darby</a> on "Bellerophon" missed his intended anchor near "Franklin" and instead found his ship underneath the main battery of the French flagship. Captain <a href="George%20Blagdon%20Westcott">George Blagdon Westcott</a> on "Majestic" also missed his station and almost collided with "Heureux", coming under heavy fire from "<a href="HMS%20Tonnant%20%281798%29">Tonnant</a>". Unable to stop in time, Westcott's <a href="jib">jib</a> <a href="boom%20%28sailing%29">boom</a> became entangled with "Tonnant"s <a href="Shroud%20%28sailing%29">shroud</a>.

The French suffered too, Admiral Brueys on "Orient" was severely wounded in the face and hand by flying debris during the opening exchange of fire with "Bellerophon". The final ship of the British line, "Culloden" under Troubridge, sailed too close to Aboukir Island in the growing darkness and became stuck fast on the shoal. Despite strenuous efforts from the "Culloden"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s boats, the brig "Mutine" and the 50-gun <a href="HMS%20Leander%20%281780%29">HMS "Leander"</a> under Captain <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Thompson%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Thompson</a>, the ship of the line could not be moved, and the waves drove "Culloden" further onto the shoal, inflicting severe damage to the ship's hull.

At 19:00 the identifying lights in the mizzenmasts of the British fleet were lit. By this time, "Guerrier" had been completely dismasted and heavily battered. "Zealous" by contrast was barely touched: Hood had situated "Zealous" outside the arc of most of the French ship's broadsides, and in any case "Guerrier" was not prepared for an engagement on both sides simultaneously, with its port guns blocked by stores. Although their ship was a wreck, the crew of "Guerrier" refused to surrender, continuing to fire the few functional guns whenever possible despite heavy answering fire from "Zealous". In addition to his cannon fire, Hood called up his marines and ordered them to fire volleys of musket shot at the deck of the French ship, driving the crew out of sight but still failing to secure the surrender from Captain Trullet. It was not until 21:00, when Hood sent a small boat to "Guerrier" with a boarding party, that the French ship finally surrendered. "Conquérant" was defeated more rapidly, after heavy broadsides from passing British ships and the close attentions of "Audacious" and "Goliath" brought down all three masts before 19:00. With his ship immobile and badly damaged, the mortally wounded Captain <a href="Etienne%20Dalbarade">Etienne Dalbarade</a> <a href="Striking%20the%20colours">struck his colours</a> and a boarding party seized control. Unlike "Zealous", these British ships suffered relatively severe damage in the engagement. "Goliath" lost most of its rigging, suffered damage to all three masts and suffered more than 60 casualties. With his opponents defeated, Captain Gould on "Audacious" used the spring on his cable to transfer fire to "Spartiate", the next French ship in line. To the west of the battle the battered "Sérieuse" sank over the shoal. Its masts protruded from the water as survivors scrambled into boats and rowed for the shore.

The transfer of "Audacious"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s broadside to "Spartiate" meant that Captain <a href="Maurice-Julien%20Emeriau">Maurice-Julien Emeriau</a> now faced three opponents. Within minutes all three of his ship's masts had fallen, but the battle around "Spartiate" continued until 21:00, when the badly wounded Emeriau ordered his colours struck. Although "Spartiate" was outnumbered, it had been supported by the next in line, "Aquilon", which was the only ship of the French van squadron fighting a single opponent, "Minotaur". Captain <a href="Antoine%20Ren%C3%A9%20Th%C3%A9venard">Antoine René Thévenard</a> used the spring on his anchor cable to angle his broadside into a raking position across the bow of Nelson's flagship, which consequently suffered more than 100 casualties, including the admiral. At approximately 20:30, an iron splinter fired in a <a href="Naval%20artillery%20in%20the%20Age%20of%20Sail%23Shot">langrage</a> shot from "Spartiate "struck Nelson over his blinded right eye. The wound caused a flap of skin to fall across his face, rendering him temporarily completely blind. Nelson collapsed into the arms of Captain <a href="Edward%20Berry">Edward Berry</a> and was carried below. Certain that his wound was fatal, he cried out "I am killed, remember me to my wife", and called for his chaplain, <a href="Stephen%20George%20Comyn">Stephen Comyn</a>. The wound was immediately inspected by "Vanguard"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s surgeon Michael Jefferson, who informed the admiral that it was a simple flesh wound and stitched the skin together. Nelson subsequently ignored Jefferson's instructions to remain inactive, returning to the quarterdeck shortly before the explosion on "Orient" to oversee the closing stages of the battle. Although Thévenard's manoeuvre was successful, it placed his own bow under "Minotaur"s guns and by 21:25 the French ship was dismasted and battered, Captain Thévenard killed and his junior officers forced to surrender. With his opponent defeated, Captain <a href="Thomas%20Louis">Thomas Louis</a> then took "Minotaur" south to join the attack on "Franklin".

"Defence" and "Orion "attacked the fifth French ship, "Peuple Souverain", from either side and the ship rapidly lost the fore and main masts. Aboard the "Orion", a wooden block was smashed off one of the ship's masts, killing two men before wounding Captain Saumarez in the thigh. On "Peuple Souverain", Captain <a href="Pierre-Paul%20Raccord">Pierre-Paul Raccord</a> was badly wounded and ordered his ship's anchor cable cut in an effort to escape the bombardment. "Peuple Souverain" drifted south towards the flagship "Orient", which mistakenly opened fire on the darkened vessel. "Orion" and "Defence" were unable to immediately pursue. "Defence" had lost its fore topmast and an improvised <a href="fireship">fireship</a> that drifted through the battle narrowly missed "Orion". The origin of this vessel, an abandoned and burning ship's boat laden with highly flammable material, is uncertain, but it may have been launched from "Guerrier" as the battle began. "Peuple Souverain" anchored not far from "Orient", but took no further part in the fighting. The wrecked ship surrendered during the night. "Franklin" remained in combat, but Blanquet had suffered a severe head wound and Captain Gillet had been carried below unconscious with severe wounds. Shortly afterwards, a fire broke out on the quarterdeck after an arms locker exploded, which was eventually extinguished with difficulty by the crew.

To the south, HMS "Bellerophon" was in serious trouble as the huge broadside of "Orient" pounded the ship. At 19:50 the mizzenmast and main mast both collapsed and fires broke out simultaneously at several points. Although the blazes were extinguished, the ship had suffered more than 200 casualties. Captain Darby recognised that his position was untenable and ordered the anchor cables cut at 20:20. The battered ship drifted away from the battle under continued fire from "Tonnant" as the foremast collapsed as well. "Orient" had also suffered significant damage and Admiral Brueys had been struck in the midriff by a cannonball that almost cut him in half. He died fifteen minutes later, remaining on deck and refusing to be carried below. "Orient"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s captain, <a href="Luc-Julien-Joseph%20Casabianca">Luc-Julien-Joseph Casabianca</a>, was also wounded, struck in the face by flying debris and knocked unconscious, while his twelve-year-old son had a leg torn off by a cannonball as he stood beside his father. The most southerly British ship, "Majestic", had become briefly entangled with the 80-gun "Tonnant", and in the resulting battle, suffered heavy casualties. Captain <a href="George%20Blagdon%20Westcott">George Blagdon Westcott</a> was among the dead, killed by French musket fire. Lieutenant Robert Cuthbert assumed command and successfully disentangled his ship, allowing the badly damaged "Majestic" to drift further southwards so that by 20:30 it was stationed between "Tonnant" and the next in line, "Heureux", engaging both. To support the centre, Captain Thompson of "Leander" abandoned the futile efforts to drag the stranded "Culloden" off the shoal and sailed down the embattled French line, entering the gap created by the drifting "Peuple Souverain" and opening a fierce raking fire on "Franklin" and "Orient".

While the battle raged in the bay, the two straggling British ships made strenuous efforts to join the engagement, focusing on the flashes of gunfire in the darkness. Warned away from the Aboukir shoals by the grounded "Culloden", Captain <a href="Benjamin%20Hallowell%20Carew">Benjamin Hallowell</a> in "Swiftsure" passed the melee at the head of the line and aimed his ship at the French centre. Shortly after 20:00, a dismasted hulk was spotted drifting in front of "Swiftsure" and Hallowell initially ordered his men to fire before rescinding the order, concerned for the identity of the strange vessel. Hailing the battered ship, Hallowell received the reply "Bellerophon, going out of action disabled." Relieved that he had not accidentally attacked one of his own ships in the darkness, Hallowell pulled up between "Orient" and "Franklin" and opened fire on them both. "Alexander", the final unengaged British ship, which had followed "Swiftsure", pulled up close to "Tonnant", which had begun to drift away from the embattled French flagship. Captain <a href="Alexander%20John%20Ball">Alexander Ball</a> then joined the attack on "Orient".

At 21:00, the British observed a fire on the lower decks of the "Orient", the French flagship. Identifying the danger this posed to the "Orient", Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their guns directly into the blaze. Sustained British gun fire spread the flames throughout the ship's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish them. Within minutes the fire had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight. The nearest British ships, "Swiftsure", "Alexander", and "Orion", all stopped firing, closed their gunports, and began edging away from the burning ship in anticipation of the detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board. In addition, they took crews away from the guns to form fire parties and to soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting fires. Likewise the French ships "Tonnant", "Heureux", and "<a href="French%20ship%20Mercure%20%281783%29">Mercure</a>" all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the burning ship. At 22:00 the fire reached the <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a>, and the "Orient" was destroyed by a massive explosion. The concussion of the blast was powerful enough to rip open the seams of the nearest ships, and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle, much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond. Falling wreckage started fires on "Swiftsure", "Alexander", and "Franklin", although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames, despite a secondary explosion on "Franklin".

It has never been firmly established how the fire on "Orient" broke out, but one common account is that jars of oil and paint had been left on the <a href="poop%20deck">poop deck</a>, instead of being properly stowed after painting of the ship's hull had been completed shortly before the battle. Burning <a href="wadding">wadding</a> from one of the British ships is believed to have floated onto the poop deck and ignited the paint. The fire rapidly spread through the admiral's cabin and into a ready magazine that stored <a href="Carcass%20%28projectile%29">carcass</a> ammunition, which was designed to burn more fiercely in water than in air. Alternatively, Fleet Captain <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20Ganteaume">Honoré Ganteaume</a> later reported the cause as an explosion on the quarterdeck, preceded by a series of minor fires on the main deck among the ship's boats. Whatever its origin, the fire spread rapidly through the ship's rigging, unchecked by the fire pumps aboard, which had been smashed by British shot. A second blaze then began at the bow, trapping hundreds of sailors in the ship's waist. Subsequent archaeological investigation found debris scattered over of seabed and evidence that the ship was wracked by two huge explosions one after the other. Hundreds of men dove into the sea to escape the flames, but fewer than 100 survived the blast. British boats picked up approximately 70 survivors, including the wounded staff officer <a href="L%C3%A9onard-Bernard%20Motard">Léonard-Bernard Motard</a>. A few others, including Ganteaume, managed to reach the shore on rafts. The remainder of the crew, numbering more than 1,000 men, were killed, including Captain Casabianca and his son, Giocante.

For ten minutes after the explosion there was no firing; sailors from both sides were either too shocked by the blast or desperately extinguishing fires aboard their own ships to continue the fight. During the lull, Nelson gave orders that boats be sent to pull survivors from the water around the remains of "Orient". At 22:10, "Franklin" restarted the engagement by firing on "Swiftsure". Isolated and battered, Blanquet's ship was soon dismasted and the admiral, suffering a severe head wound, was forced to surrender by the combined firepower of "Swiftsure" and "Defence". More than half of "Franklin"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s crew had been killed or wounded.

By midnight only "Tonnant" remained engaged, as Commodore <a href="Aristide%20Aubert%20Du%20Petit%20Thouars">Aristide Aubert Du Petit Thouars</a> continued his fight with "Majestic" and fired on "Swiftsure" when the British ship moved within range. By 03:00, after more than three hours of close quarter combat, "Majestic" had lost its main and mizzen masts while "Tonnant" was a dismasted hulk. Although Captain Du Petit Thouars had lost both legs and an arm he remained in command, insisting on having the tricolour nailed to the mast to prevent it from being struck and giving orders from his position propped up on deck in a bucket of wheat. Under his guidance, the battered "Tonnant" gradually drifted southwards away from the action to join the southern division under Villeneuve, who failed to bring these ships into effective action. Throughout the engagement the French rear had kept up an arbitrary fire on the battling ships ahead. The only noticeable effect was the smashing of "<a href="French%20ship%20Commerce%20de%20Bordeaux%20%281785%29">Timoléon</a>"s rudder by misdirected fire from the neighbouring "<a href="French%20ship%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9reux%20%281785%29">Généreux</a>".

As the sun rose at 04:00 on 2 August, firing broke out once again between the French southern division of "Guillaume Tell", "Tonnant", "Généreux" and "Timoléon" and the battered "Alexander" and "Majestic". Although briefly outmatched, the British ships were soon joined by "Goliath" and "Theseus". As Captain Miller manoeuvred his ship into position, "Theseus" briefly came under fire from the frigate "<a href="French%20frigate%20Art%C3%A9mise%20%281794%29">Artémise</a>". Miller turned his ship towards "Artémise", but Captain <a href="Pierre-Jean%20Standelet">Pierre-Jean Standelet</a> struck his flag and ordered his men to abandon the frigate. Miller sent a boat under Lieutenant <a href="William%20Hoste">William Hoste</a> to take possession of the empty vessel, but Standelet had set fire to his ship as he left and "Artémise" blew up shortly afterwards. The surviving French ships of the line, covering their retreat with gunfire, gradually pulled to the east away from the shore at 06:00. "Zealous" pursued, and was able to prevent the frigate "<a href="French%20frigate%20Justice%20%281794%29">Justice</a>" from boarding "Bellerophon", which was anchored at the southern point of the bay undergoing hasty repairs.

Two other French ships still flew the tricolour, but neither was in a position to either retreat or fight. When "Heureux" and "Mercure" had cut their anchor cables to escape the exploding "Orient", their crews had panicked and neither captain (both of whom were wounded) had managed to regain control of his ship. As a result, both vessels had drifted onto the shoal. "Alexander", "Goliath", "Theseus" and "Leander" attacked the stranded and defenceless ships, and both surrendered within minutes. The distractions provided by "Heureux", "Mercure" and "Justice" allowed Villeneuve to bring most of the surviving French ships to the mouth of the bay at 11:00. On the dismasted "Tonnant", Commodore Du Petit Thouars was now dead from his wounds and thrown overboard at his own request. As the ship was unable to make the required speed it was driven ashore by its crew. "Timoléon" was too far south to escape with Villeneuve and, in attempting to join the survivors, had also grounded on the shoal. The force of the impact dislodged the ship's foremast. The remaining French vessels: the ships of the line "Guillaume Tell" and "Généreux" and the frigates "Justice" and "<a href="French%20frigate%20Diane%20%281796%29">Diane</a>", formed up and stood out to sea, pursued by "Zealous". Despite strenuous efforts, Captain Hood's isolated ship came under heavy fire and was unable to cut off the trailing "Justice" as the French survivors escaped seawards. "Zealous" was struck by a number of French shot and lost one man killed.

For the remainder of 2 August Nelson's ships made improvised repairs and boarded and consolidated their <a href="Prize%20%28law%29">prizes</a>. "Culloden" especially required assistance. Troubridge, having finally dragged his ship off the shoal at 02:00, found that he had lost his rudder and was taking on more than of water an hour. Emergency repairs to the hull and fashioning a replacement rudder from a spare topmast took most of the next two days. On the morning of 3 August, Nelson sent "Theseus" and "Leander" to force the surrender of the grounded "Tonnant" and "Timoléon". The "Tonnant", its decks crowded with 1,600 survivors from other French vessels, surrendered as the British ships approached while "Timoléon" was set on fire by its remaining crew who then escaped to the shore in small boats. "Timoléon" exploded shortly after midday, the eleventh and final French ship of the line destroyed or captured during the battle.

British casualties in the battle were recorded with some accuracy in the immediate aftermath as 218 killed and approximately 677 wounded, although the number of wounded who subsequently died is not known. The ships that suffered most were "Bellerophon" with 201 casualties and "Majestic" with 193. Other than "Culloden" the lightest loss was on "Zealous", which had one man killed and seven wounded.

The casualty list included Captain Westcott, five lieutenants and ten junior officers among the dead, and Admiral Nelson, Captains Saumarez, Ball and Darby, and six lieutenants wounded. Other than "Culloden", the only British ships seriously damaged in their hulls were "Bellerophon", "Majestic," and "Vanguard". "Bellerophon" and "Majestic" were the only ships to lose masts: "Majestic" the main and mizzen and "Bellerophon" all three.

French casualties are harder to calculate but were significantly higher. Estimates of French losses range from 2,000 to 5,000, with a suggested median point of 3,500, which includes more than 1,000 captured wounded and nearly 2,000 killed, half of whom died on "Orient". In addition to Admiral Brueys killed and Admiral Blanquet wounded, four captains died and seven others were seriously wounded. The French ships suffered severe damage: Two ships of the line and two frigates were destroyed (as well as a bomb vessel scuttled by its crew), and three other captured ships were too battered ever to sail again. Of the remaining prizes, only three were ever sufficiently repaired for frontline service. For weeks after the battle, bodies washed up along the Egyptian coast, decaying slowly in the intense, dry heat.

Nelson, who on surveying the bay on the morning of 2 August said, "Victory is not a name strong enough for such a scene", remained at anchor in Aboukir Bay for the next two weeks, preoccupied with recovering from his wound, writing dispatches, and assessing the military situation in Egypt using documents captured on board one of the prizes. Nelson's head wound was recorded as being "three inches long" with "the cranium exposed for one inch". He suffered pain from the injury for the rest of his life and was badly scarred, styling his hair to disguise it as much as possible. As their commander recovered, his men stripped the wrecks of useful supplies and made repairs to their ships and prizes.

Throughout the week, Aboukir Bay was surrounded by bonfires lit by Bedouin tribesmen in celebration of the British victory. On 5 August, "Leander" was despatched to <a href="Cadiz">Cadiz</a> with messages for Earl St. Vincent carried by Captain Edward Berry. Over the next few days the British landed all but 200 of the captured prisoners on shore under strict terms of <a href="Parole%23Prisoners%20of%20war">parole</a>, although Bonaparte later ordered them to be formed into an infantry unit and added to his army. The wounded officers taken prisoner were held on board "Vanguard", where Nelson regularly entertained them at dinner. Historian Joseph Allen recounts that on one occasion Nelson, whose eyesight was still suffering following his wound, offered toothpicks to an officer who had lost his teeth and then passed a <a href="snuff%20%28tobacco%29">snuff-box</a> to an officer whose nose had been torn off, causing much embarrassment. On 8 August the fleet's boats stormed Aboukir Island, which surrendered without a fight. The landing party removed four of the guns and destroyed the rest along with the fort they were mounted in, renaming the island "Nelson's Island".

On 10 August, Nelson sent Lieutenant Thomas Duval from "Zealous" with messages to the government in India. Duval travelled across the Middle East overland via <a href="camel%20train">camel train</a> to <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a> and took the <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a> ship "Fly" from <a href="Basra">Basra</a> to <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a>, acquainting <a href="Governor-General%20of%20India">Governor-General of India</a> <a href="Richard%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Wellesley">Viscount Wellesley</a> with the situation in Egypt. On 12 August the frigates <a href="HMS%20Emerald%20%281795%29">HMS "Emerald"</a> under Captain Thomas Moutray Waller and <a href="HMS%20Alcmene%20%281794%29">HMS "Alcmene"</a> under Captain <a href="George%20Johnstone%20Hope">George Johnstone Hope</a>, and the sloop <a href="HMS%20Bonne%20Citoyenne%20%281796%29">HMS "Bonne Citoyenne"</a> under Captain Robert Retalick, arrived off Alexandria. Initially the British mistook the frigate squadron for French warships and "Swiftsure" chased them away. They returned the following day once the error had been realised. The same day as the frigates arrived, Nelson sent "Mutine" to Britain with dispatches, under the command of Lieutenant <a href="Thomas%20Bladen%20Capel">Thomas Bladen Capel</a>, who had replaced Hardy after the latter's promotion to captain of "Vanguard". On 14 August, Nelson sent "Orion", "Majestic", "Bellerophon", "Minotaur", "Defence", "Audacious", "Theseus", "Franklin", "Tonnant", "Aquilon", "Conquérant", "Peuple Souverain," and "Spartiate" to sea under the command of Saumarez. Many ships had only <a href="jury%20masts">jury masts</a> and it took a full day for the convoy to reach the mouth of the bay, finally sailing into open water on 15 August. On 16 August the British burned and destroyed the grounded prize "Heureux" as no longer fit for service and on 18 August also burned "Guerrier" and "Mercure". On 19 August, Nelson sailed for Naples with "Vanguard", "Culloden," and "Alexander", leaving Hood in command of "Zealous", "Goliath", "Swiftsure," and the recently joined frigates to watch over French activities at Alexandria.

The first message to reach Bonaparte regarding the disaster that had overtaken his fleet arrived on 14 August at his camp on the road between <a href="Salahieh">Salahieh</a> and <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. The messenger was a staff officer sent by the Governor of Alexandria General <a href="Jean%20Baptiste%20Kl%C3%A9ber">Jean Baptiste Kléber</a>, and the report had been hastily written by Admiral Ganteaume, who had subsequently rejoined Villeneuve's ships at sea. One account reports that when he was handed the message, Bonaparte read it without emotion before calling the messenger to him and demanding further details. When the messenger had finished, the French general reportedly announced ""Nous n'avons plus de flotte: eh bien. Il faut rester en ces contrées, ou en sortir grands comme les anciens"" ("We no longer have a fleet: well, we must either remain in this country or quit it as great as the ancients"). Another story, as told by the general's secretary, <a href="Louis%20Antoine%20Fauvelet%20de%20Bourrienne">Bourienne</a>, claims that Bonaparte was almost overcome by the news and exclaimed "Unfortunate Brueys, what have you done!" Bonaparte later placed much of the blame for the defeat on the wounded Admiral Blanquet, falsely accusing him of surrendering "Franklin" while his ship was undamaged. Protestations from Ganteaume and Minister Étienne Eustache Bruix later reduced the degree of criticism Blanquet faced, but he never again served in a command capacity. Bonaparte's most immediate concern however was with his own officers, who began to question the wisdom of the entire expedition. Inviting his most senior officers to dinner, Bonaparte asked them how they were. When they replied that they were "marvellous," Bonaparte responded that it was just as well, since he would have them shot if they continued "fostering mutinies and preaching revolt." To quell any uprising among the native inhabitants, Egyptians overheard discussing the battle were threatened with having their tongues cut out.

Nelson's first set of dispatches were captured when "Leander" was intercepted and defeated by "Généreux" in a fierce engagement off the western shore of Crete <a href="Action%20of%2018%20August%201798">on 18 August 1798</a>. As a result, reports of the battle did not reach Britain until Capel arrived in "Mutine" on 2 October, entering the Admiralty at 11:15 and personally delivering the news to Lord Spencer, who collapsed unconscious when he heard the report. Although Nelson had previously been castigated in the press for failing to intercept the French fleet, rumours of the battle had begun to arrive in Britain from the continent in late September and the news Capel brought was greeted with celebrations right across the country. Within four days Nelson had been elevated to Baron Nelson of the Nile and Burnham Thorpe, a title with which he was privately dissatisfied, believing his actions deserved better reward. <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> addressed the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Houses of Parliament</a> on 20 November with the words:

Saumarez's convoy of prizes stopped first at Malta, where Saumarez provided assistance to a rebellion on the island among the <a href="Maltese%20people">Maltese population</a>. It then sailed to Gibraltar, arriving on 18 October to the cheers of the garrison. Saumarez wrote that, "We can never do justice to the warmth of their applause, and the praises they all bestowed on our squadron." On 23 October, following the transfer of the wounded to the military hospital and provision of basic supplies, the convoy sailed on towards <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, leaving "Bellerophon" and "Majestic" behind for more extensive repairs. "Peuple Souverain" also remained at Gibraltar: The ship was deemed too badly damaged for the Atlantic voyage to Britain and so was converted to a guardship under the name of HMS "Guerrier". The remaining prizes underwent basic repairs and then sailed for Britain, spending some months at the <a href="Tagus">Tagus</a> and joining with the annual merchant convoy from Portugal in June 1799 under the escort of a squadron commanded by Admiral <a href="Alan%20Gardner%2C%201st%20Baron%20Gardner">Sir Alan Gardner</a>, before eventually arriving at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>. Their age and battered state meant that neither "Conquérant" nor "Aquilon" were considered fit for active service in the Royal Navy and both were subsequently hulked, although they had been bought into the service for £20,000 (the equivalent of £ as of 2019) each as HMS "Conquerant" and HMS "Aboukir" to provide a financial reward to the crews that had captured them. Similar sums were also paid out for "Guerrier", "Mercure", "Heureux" and "Peuple Souverain", while the other captured ships were worth considerably more. Constructed of Adriatic <a href="oak">oak</a>, "Tonnant" had been built in 1792 and "Franklin" and "Spartiate" were less than a year old. "Tonnant" and "Spartiate", both of which later fought at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trafalgar">Battle of Trafalgar</a>, joined the Royal Navy under their old names while "Franklin", considered to be "the finest two-decked ship in the world", was renamed HMS "Canopus". The total value of the prizes captured at the Nile and subsequently bought into the Royal Navy was estimated at just over £130,000 (the equivalent of £ as of 2019).
Additional awards were presented to the British fleet: Nelson was awarded £2,000 (£ as of 2019) a year for life by the Parliament of Great Britain and £1,000 per annum by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Parliament of Ireland</a>, although the latter was inadvertently discontinued after the <a href="Act%20of%20Union%201800">Act of Union</a> dissolved the Irish Parliament. Both parliaments gave unanimous votes of thanks, each captain who served in the battle was presented with a specially minted gold medal and the first lieutenant of every ship engaged in the battle was promoted to commander. Troubridge and his men, initially excluded, received equal shares in the awards after Nelson personally interceded for the crew of the stranded "Culloden, "even though they did not directly participate in the engagement. The <a href="Honourable%20East%20India%20Company">Honourable East India Company</a> presented Nelson with £10,000 (£ as of 2019) in recognition of the benefit his action had on their holdings and the cities of <a href="London">London</a>, <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and other municipal and corporate bodies made similar awards. Nelson's own captains presented him with a sword and a portrait as "proof of their esteem." Nelson publicly encouraged this close bond with his officers and on 29 September 1798 described them as "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers", echoing <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>". From this grew the notion of the <a href="Nelsonic%20Band%20of%20Brothers">Nelsonic Band of Brothers</a>, a cadre of high-quality naval officers that served with Nelson for the remainder of his life. Nearly five decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the <a href="Naval%20General%20Service%20Medal%20%281847%29">Naval General Service Medal</a>, awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847.

Other rewards were bestowed by foreign states, particularly the <a href="Ottoman%20Emperor">Ottoman Emperor</a> <a href="Selim%20III">Selim III</a>, who made Nelson the first Knight Commander of the newly created <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crescent">Order of the Crescent</a>, and presented him with a <a href="chelengk">chelengk</a>, a diamond studded rose, a sable fur and numerous other valuable presents. Tsar <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul I of Russia</a> sent, among other rewards, a gold box studded with diamonds, and similar gifts in silver arrived from other European rulers. On his return to Naples, Nelson was greeted with a triumphal procession led by <a href="Ferdinand%20IV%20of%20Naples">King Ferdinand IV</a> and Sir William Hamilton and was introduced for only the third time to Sir William's wife <a href="Emma%2C%20Lady%20Hamilton">Emma, Lady Hamilton</a>, who fainted violently at the meeting, and apparently took several weeks to recover from her injuries. Lauded as a hero by the Neapolitan court, Nelson was later to dabble in Neapolitan politics and become the Duke of Bronté, actions for which he was criticised by his superiors and his reputation suffered. British general <a href="John%20Moore%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Moore</a>, who met Nelson in Naples at this time, described him as "covered with stars, medals and ribbons, more like a Prince of Opera than the Conqueror of the Nile."

Rumours of a battle first appeared in the French press as early as 7 August, although credible reports did not arrive until 26 August, and even these claimed that Nelson was dead and Bonaparte a British prisoner. When the news became certain, the French press insisted that the defeat was the result both of an overwhelmingly large British force and unspecified "traitors." Among the anti-government journals in France, the defeat was blamed on the incompetence of the French Directory and on supposed lingering Royalist sentiments in the Navy. Villeneuve came under scathing attack on his return to France for his failure to support Brueys during the battle. In his defence, he pleaded that the wind had been against him and that Brueys had not issued orders for him to counterattack the British fleet. Writing many years later, Bonaparte commented that if the French Navy had adopted the same tactical principles as the British:
By contrast, the British press were jubilant; many newspapers sought to portray the battle as a victory for Britain over anarchy, and the success was used to attack the supposedly pro-republican <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20party%29">Whig</a> politicians <a href="Charles%20James%20Fox">Charles James Fox</a> and <a href="Richard%20Brinsley%20Sheridan">Richard Brinsley Sheridan</a>.

There has been extensive historiographical debate over the comparative strengths of the fleets, although they were ostensibly evenly matched in size, each containing 13 ships of the line. However, the loss of "Culloden", the relative sizes of "Orient" and "Leander" and the participation in the action by two of the French frigates and several smaller vessels, as well as the theoretical strength of the French position, leads most historians to the conclusion that the French were marginally more powerful. This is accentuated by the weight of broadside of several of the French ships: "Spartiate", "Franklin", "Orient", "Tonnant" and "Guillaume Tell" were each significantly larger than any individual British ship in the battle. However inadequate deployment, reduced crews, and the failure of the rear division under Villeneuve to meaningfully participate, all contributed to the French defeat.

The Battle of the Nile has been called "arguably, the most decisive naval engagement of the great age of sail", and "the most splendid and glorious success which the British Navy gained." Historian and novelist <a href="C.%20S.%20Forester">C. S. Forester</a>, writing in 1929, compared the Nile to the great naval actions in history and concluded that "it still only stands rivalled by <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Tsu-Shima</a> as an example of the annihilation of one fleet by another of approximately equal material force". The effect on the strategic situation in the Mediterranean was immediate, reversing the balance of the conflict and giving the British control at sea that they maintained for the remainder of the war. The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet allowed the Royal Navy to return to the sea in force, as British squadrons set up <a href="blockade">blockade</a>s off French and allied ports. In particular, British ships cut Malta off from France, aided by the rebellion among the native Maltese population that forced the French garrison to retreat to Valletta and shut the gates. The ensuing <a href="Siege%20of%20Malta%20%281798%E2%80%931800%29">Siege of Malta</a> lasted for two years before the defenders were finally starved into surrender. In 1799, British ships harassed Bonaparte's army as it marched east and north through <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, and played a crucial part in Bonaparte's defeat at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Acre%20%281799%29">Siege of Acre</a>, when the barges carrying the siege train were captured and the French storming parties were bombarded by British ships anchored offshore. It was during one of these latter engagements that Captain Miller of "Theseus" was killed in an ammunition explosion. The defeat at Acre forced Bonaparte to retreat to Egypt and effectively ended his efforts to carve an empire in the Middle East. The French general returned to France without his army late in the year, leaving Kléber in command of Egypt.

The Ottomans, with whom Bonaparte had hoped to conduct an alliance once his control of Egypt was complete, were encouraged by the Battle of the Nile to go to war against France. This led to a series of campaigns that slowly sapped the strength from the French army trapped in Egypt. The British victory also encouraged the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian Empire</a> and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, both of whom were mustering armies as part of a <a href="Second%20Coalition">Second Coalition</a>, which declared war on France in 1799. With the Mediterranean undefended, a Russian fleet entered the <a href="Ionian%20Sea">Ionian Sea</a>, while Austrian armies recaptured much of the Italian territory lost to Bonaparte in the previous war. Without their best general and his veterans, the French suffered a series of defeats and it was not until Bonaparte returned to become <a href="First%20Consul">First Consul</a> that France once again held a position of strength on mainland Europe. In 1801 a British Expeditionary Force defeated the demoralised remains of the French army in Egypt. The Royal Navy used its dominance in the Mediterranean to invade Egypt without the fear of ambush while anchored off the Egyptian coast.

In spite of the overwhelming British victory in the climactic battle, the campaign has sometimes been considered a strategic success for France. Historian <a href="Edward%20Ingram%20%28historian%29">Edward Ingram</a> noted that if Nelson had successfully intercepted Bonaparte at sea as ordered, the ensuing battle could have annihilated both the French fleet and the transports. As it was, Bonaparte was free to continue the war in the Middle East and later to return to Europe personally unscathed. The potential of a successful engagement at sea to change the course of history is underscored by the list of French army officers carried aboard the convoy who later formed the core of the generals and marshals under Emperor Napoleon. In addition to Bonaparte himself, <a href="Louis-Alexandre%20Berthier">Louis-Alexandre Berthier</a>, <a href="Auguste%20de%20Marmont">Auguste de Marmont</a>, <a href="Jean%20Lannes">Jean Lannes</a>, <a href="Joachim%20Murat">Joachim Murat</a>, <a href="Louis%20Desaix">Louis Desaix</a>, <a href="Jean%20Reynier">Jean Reynier</a>, <a href="Antoine-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Andr%C3%A9ossy">Antoine-François Andréossy</a>, <a href="Jean-Andoche%20Junot">Jean-Andoche Junot</a>, <a href="Louis-Nicolas%20Davout">Louis-Nicolas Davout</a> and <a href="Guillaume-Mathieu%20Dumas">Dumas</a> were all passengers on the <a href="Mediterranean%20campaign%20of%201798">cramped Mediterranean crossing</a>.

The Battle of the Nile remains one of the Royal Navy's most famous victories, and has remained prominent in the British popular imagination, sustained by its depiction in a large number of cartoons, paintings, poems, and plays. One of the best known poems about the battle is "<a href="Casabianca%20%28poem%29">Casabianca</a>", which was written by <a href="Felicia%20Dorothea%20Hemans">Felicia Dorothea Hemans</a> in 1826 and describes a fictional account of the death of Captain Casabianca's son on "Orient".

Monuments were raised, including <a href="Cleopatra%27s%20Needle%20%28London%29">Cleopatra's Needle</a> in London. <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20of%20Egypt">Muhammad Ali of Egypt</a> gave the monument in 1819 in recognition of the battle of 1798 and the campaign of 1801 but Great Britain did not erect it on the <a href="Victoria%20Embankment">Victoria Embankment</a> until 1878. Another memorial, the <a href="Nile%20Clumps">Nile Clumps</a> near <a href="Amesbury">Amesbury</a>, consists of stands of <a href="beech">beech</a> trees purportedly planted by <a href="Charles%20Douglas%2C%206th%20Marquess%20of%20Queensberry">Lord Queensbury</a> at the bequest of Lady Hamilton and <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Hardy%2C%201st%20Baronet">Thomas Hardy</a> after Nelson's death. The trees form a plan of the battle; each clump represents the position of a British or French ship. A similar arboreal memorial is thought to have been planted near <a href="Alnwick">Alnwick</a> by Nelson's agent <a href="Alexander%20Davison">Alexander Davison</a>.

The composer <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a> had just completed the <a href="Missa%20in%20Angustiis">Missa in Angustiis</a> (mass for troubled times) after <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> had defeated the Austrian army in four major battles. The well received news of France's defeat at the Nile however resulted in the mass gradually acquiring the nickname "Lord Nelson Mass". The title became indelible when, in 1800, Nelson himself visited the <a href="Palais%20Esterh%C3%A1zy">Palais Esterházy</a>, accompanied by his mistress, <a href="Emma%2C%20Lady%20Hamilton">Lady Hamilton</a>, and may have heard the mass performed.

The Royal Navy commemorated the battle with the ship names <a href="HMS%20Aboukir">HMS "Aboukir"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Nile">HMS "Nile"</a>"," and in 1998 commemorated the 200th anniversary of the battle with a visit to Aboukir Bay by the modern frigate <a href="HMS%20Somerset%20%28F82%29">HMS "Somerset"</a>, whose crew laid wreaths in memory of those who lost their lives in the battle.

Although Nelson biographer <a href="Ernle%20Bradford">Ernle Bradford</a> assumed in 1977 that the remains of "Orient" "are almost certainly unrecoverable," the first archaeological investigation into the battle began in 1983, when a French survey team under Jacques Dumas discovered the wreck of the French flagship. <a href="Franck%20Goddio">Franck Goddio</a> later took over the work, leading a major project to explore the bay in 1998. He found that material was scattered over an area in diameter. In addition to military and nautical equipment, Goddio recovered a large number of gold and silver coins from countries across the Mediterranean, some from the 17th century. It is likely that these were part of the treasure taken from Malta that was lost in the explosion aboard "Orient". In 2000, Italian archaeologist Paolo Gallo led an excavation focusing on ancient ruins on Nelson's Island. It uncovered a number of graves that date from the battle, as well as others buried there during the 1801 invasion. These graves, which included a woman and three children, were relocated in 2005 to a cemetery at <a href="Shatby">Shatby</a> in Alexandria. The reburial was attended by sailors from the modern frigate <a href="HMS%20Chatham%20%28F87%29">HMS "Chatham"</a> and a band from the <a href="Egyptian%20Navy">Egyptian Navy</a>, as well as a descendant of the only identified burial, Commander James Russell.

Balfour Declaration

The Balfour Declaration was a public statement issued by the British government in 1917 during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> announcing support for the establishment of a "national home for the <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> people" in <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, then an <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> region with a small minority Jewish population. It read:

The declaration was contained in a letter dated 2November 1917 from the United Kingdom's <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a> <a href="Arthur%20Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a> to <a href="Walter%20Rothschild%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Rothschild">Lord Rothschild</a>, a leader of the <a href="British%20Jews">British Jewish community</a>, for transmission to the <a href="Zionist%20Federation%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland</a>. The text of the declaration was published in the press on 9November 1917.

Immediately following their declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire in November 1914, the <a href="British%20War%20Cabinet">British War Cabinet</a> began to consider the future of Palestine; within two months <a href="The%20Future%20of%20Palestine">a memorandum was circulated to the Cabinet</a> by a Zionist Cabinet member, <a href="Herbert%20Samuel%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Samuel">Herbert Samuel</a>, proposing the support of Zionist ambitions in order to enlist the support of Jews in the wider war. <a href="De%20Bunsen%20Committee">A committee</a> was established in April 1915 by <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Prime Minister</a> <a href="H.%20H.%20Asquith">H. H. Asquith</a> to determine their policy toward the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> including Palestine. Asquith, who had favored post-war reform of the Ottoman Empire, resigned in December 1916; his replacement <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, favored partition of the Empire. The first negotiations between the British and the <a href="Zionism">Zionists</a> took place at a conference on 7 February 1917 that included <a href="Mark%20Sykes">Sir Mark Sykes</a> and the Zionist leadership. Subsequent discussions led to Balfour's request, on 19 June, that Rothschild and <a href="Chaim%20Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a> submit a draft of a public declaration. Further drafts were discussed by the British Cabinet during September and October, with input from Zionist and <a href="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionist</a> Jews but with no representation from the local population in Palestine. 

By late 1917, in the lead up to the Balfour Declaration, the wider war had reached a stalemate, with two of <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Britain's allies</a> not fully engaged: the United States had yet to suffer a casualty, and the Russians were in the midst of a <a href="October%20revolution">revolution</a> with <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> taking over the government. A <a href="Stalemate%20in%20Southern%20Palestine">stalemate in southern Palestine</a> was broken by the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beersheba%20%281917%29">Battle of Beersheba</a> on 31 October 1917. The release of the final declaration was authorised on 31 October; the preceding Cabinet discussion had referenced perceived propaganda benefits amongst the worldwide Jewish community for the Allied war effort.

The opening words of the declaration represented the first public expression of support for Zionism by a major political power. The term "national home" had no precedent in international law, and was intentionally vague as to whether a <a href="Jewish%20state">Jewish state</a> was contemplated. The intended boundaries of Palestine were not specified, and the British government later confirmed that the words "in Palestine" meant that the Jewish national home was not intended to cover all of Palestine. The second half of the declaration was added to satisfy opponents of the policy, who had claimed that it would otherwise prejudice the position of the local population of Palestine and encourage <a href="antisemitism">antisemitism</a> worldwide by "stamping the Jews as strangers in their native lands". The declaration called for safeguarding the civil and religious rights for the <a href="Palestinian%20Arabs">Palestinian Arabs</a>, who composed the <a href="Demographic%20history%20of%20Palestine%20%28region%29">vast majority of the local population</a>, and also the rights and political status of the Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The British government acknowledged in 1939 that the local population's views should have been taken into account, and recognised in 2017 that the declaration should have called for protection of the Palestinian Arabs' political rights.

The declaration had many long-lasting consequences. It greatly increased popular support for <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a> within <a href="Jewish%20diaspora">Jewish communities worldwide</a>, and became a core component of the <a href="British%20Mandate%20for%20Palestine%20%28legal%20instrument%29">British Mandate for Palestine</a>, the founding document of <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Mandatory Palestine</a>, which later became <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and the <a href="Palestinian%20territories">Palestinian territories</a>. As a result, it is considered a principal cause of the ongoing <a href="Israeli%E2%80%93Palestinian%20conflict">Israeli–Palestinian conflict</a>, often described as the world's most intractable conflict. Controversy remains over a number of areas, such as whether the declaration contradicted earlier promises the British made to <a href="Hussein%20ibn%20Ali%20al-Hashimi">the Sharif of Mecca</a> in the <a href="McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein%20Correspondence">McMahon–Hussein correspondence</a>.

Early British political support for an increased Jewish presence in the <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">region of Palestine</a> was based upon geopolitical calculations. This support began in the early 1840s and was led by <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>, following the <a href="Egyptian%E2%80%93Ottoman%20War%20%281831%E2%80%9333%29">occupation of Syria</a> and <a href="Peasants%27%20revolt%20in%20Palestine">Palestine</a> by <a href="separatism">separatist</a> Ottoman governor <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20of%20Egypt">Muhammad Ali of Egypt</a>. French influence had grown in Palestine and the wider Middle East, and its role as protector of the <a href="Catholic%20church">Catholic</a> communities <a href="R%C3%A8glement%20Organique%20%28Mount%20Lebanon%29">began to grow</a>, just as Russian influence had grown as protector of the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox</a> in the same regions. This left Britain without a sphere of influence, and thus a need to find or create their own regional "protégés". These political considerations were supported by a sympathetic evangelical Christian sentiment towards the "<a href="Christian%20Zionism">restoration of the Jews</a>" to Palestine among elements of the mid-19th-century British political elite – most notably <a href="Anthony%20Ashley-Cooper%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Shaftesbury">Lord Shaftesbury</a>. The British Foreign Office actively encouraged Jewish emigration to Palestine, exemplified by <a href="Charles%20Henry%20Churchill">Charles Henry Churchill</a>'s 1841–1842 exhortations to <a href="Moses%20Montefiore">Moses Montefiore</a>, the leader of the British Jewish community.

Such efforts were premature, and did not succeed; only 24,000 Jews were living in Palestine on the eve of the emergence of <a href="Zionism">Zionism</a> within the world's Jewish communities in the last two decades of the 19th century. With the geopolitical shakeup occasioned by the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the earlier calculations, which had lapsed for some time, led to a renewal of strategic assessments and political bargaining over the Middle and Far East.

Zionism arose in the late 19th century in reaction to anti-Semitic and exclusionary nationalist movements in Europe. <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">Romantic nationalism</a> in <a href="Central%20Europe">Central</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> had helped to set off the <a href="Haskalah">Haskalah</a>, or "Jewish Enlightenment", creating a split in the Jewish community between those who saw Judaism as their religion and those who saw it as their ethnicity or nation. The 1881–1884 <a href="anti-Jewish%20pogroms%20in%20the%20Russian%20Empire">anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire</a> encouraged the growth of the latter identity, resulting in the formation of the <a href="Hovevei%20Zion">Hovevei Zion</a> pioneer organizations, the publication of <a href="Leon%20Pinsker">Leon Pinsker</a>'s "<a href="Autoemancipation">Autoemancipation</a>", and the first major wave of Jewish immigration to Palestine – retrospectively named the "<a href="First%20Aliyah">First Aliyah</a>".

In 1896, <a href="Theodor%20Herzl">Theodor Herzl</a>, a Jewish journalist living in <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, published the foundational text of political Zionism, "<a href="Der%20Judenstaat">Der Judenstaat</a>" ("The Jews' State" or "The State of the Jews"), in which he asserted that the only solution to the "<a href="Jewish%20Question">Jewish Question</a>" in Europe, including growing anti-Semitism, was the establishment of a state for the Jews. A year later, Herzl founded the <a href="World%20Zionist%20Organization">Zionist Organization</a>, which at its <a href="First%20Zionist%20Congress">first congress</a> called for the establishment of "a home for the Jewish people in Palestine secured under public law". Proposed measures to attain that goal included the promotion of Jewish settlement there, the organisation of Jews in the <a href="Jewish%20Diaspora">diaspora</a>, the strengthening of Jewish feeling and consciousness, and preparatory steps to attain necessary governmental grants. Herzl died in 1904, 44 years before the establishment of <a href="State%20of%20Israel">State of Israel</a>, the Jewish state that he proposed, without having gained the political standing required to carry out his agenda.

Zionist leader <a href="Chaim%20Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a>, later President of the World Zionist Organisation and first <a href="President%20of%20Israel">President of Israel</a>, moved from Switzerland to the UK in 1904 and met <a href="Arthur%20Balfour">Arthur Balfour</a> – who had just launched his <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201906">1905–1906 election campaign</a> after resigning as Prime Minister – in a session arranged by <a href="Charles%20Dreyfus">Charles Dreyfus</a>, his Jewish constituency representative. Earlier that year, Balfour had successfully driven the <a href="Aliens%20Act%201905">Aliens Act</a> through Parliament with impassioned speeches regarding the need to restrict the wave of immigration into Britain from Jews fleeing the Russian Empire. During this meeting, he asked what Weizmann's objections had been to the 1903 <a href="Uganda%20Scheme">Uganda Scheme</a> that Herzl had supported to provide a portion of <a href="British%20East%20Africa">British East Africa</a> to the Jewish people as a homeland. The scheme, which had been proposed to Herzl by <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a>, <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">Colonial Secretary</a> in Balfour's Cabinet, following his trip to East Africa earlier in the year, had been subsequently voted down following Herzl's death by the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905 after two years of heated debate in the Zionist Organization. Weizmann responded that he believed the English are to London as the Jews are to Jerusalem.

In January 1914 Weizmann first met <a href="Edmond%20James%20de%20Rothschild">Baron Edmond de Rothschild</a>, a member of the <a href="Rothschild%20banking%20family%20of%20France">French branch of the Rothschild family</a> and a leading proponent of the Zionist movement, in relation to a project to build a Hebrew university in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. The Baron was not part of the World Zionist Organization, but had funded the <a href="Moshava">Jewish agricultural colonies</a> of the First Aliyah and transferred them to the <a href="Jewish%20Colonization%20Association">Jewish Colonization Association</a> in 1899. This connection was to bear fruit later that year when the Baron's son, <a href="James%20de%20Rothschild%20%28politician%29">James deRothschild</a>, requested a meeting with Weizmann on 25November 1914, to enlist him in influencing those deemed to be receptive within the British government to their agenda of a "Jewish State" in Palestine. Through James's wife <a href="Dorothy%20de%20Rothschild">Dorothy</a>, Weizmann was to meet <a href="R%C3%B3zsika%20Rothschild">Rózsika Rothschild</a>, who introduced him to the <a href="Rothschild%20banking%20family%20of%20England">English branch of the family</a>in particular her husband <a href="Charles%20Rothschild">Charles</a> and his older brother <a href="Walter%20Rothschild%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Rothschild">Walter</a>, a <a href="zoology">zoologist</a> and former <a href="member%20of%20parliament">member of parliament</a> (MP). Their father, <a href="Nathan%20Rothschild%2C%201st%20Baron%20Rothschild">Nathan Rothschild, 1st Baron Rothschild</a>, head of the English branch of the family, had a guarded attitude towards Zionism, but he died in March 1915 and his title was inherited by Walter. 

Prior to the declaration, about 8,000 of Britain's 300,000 Jews belonged to a Zionist organisation. Globally, as of 1913 – the latest known date prior to the declaration – the equivalent figure was approximately 1%.

The year 1916 marked four centuries since Palestine had <a href="Ottoman%E2%80%93Mamluk%20War%20%281516%E2%80%9317%29">become part of the Ottoman Empire</a>, also known as the Turkish Empire. For most of this period, the Jewish population represented a small minority, approximately 3% of the total, with Muslims representing the largest segment of the population, and Christians the second.

Ottoman government in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> began to apply restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine in late 1882, in response to the start of the <a href="First%20Aliyah">First Aliyah</a> earlier that year. Although this immigration was creating a certain amount of tension with the local population, mainly among the merchant and <a href="Ottoman%20Ayan">notable</a> classes, in 1901 the <a href="Sublime%20Porte">Sublime Porte</a> (the Ottoman central government) gave Jews the same rights as Arabs to buy land in Palestine and the percentage of Jews in the population rose to 7% by 1914. At the same time, with growing distrust of the <a href="Young%20Turks">Young Turks</a> – Turkish nationalists who had <a href="Young%20Turk%20Revolution">taken control of the Empire</a> in 1908 – and the <a href="Second%20Aliyah">Second Aliyah</a>, <a href="Arab%20nationalism">Arab nationalism</a> was on the rise, and in Palestine anti-Zionism was a unifying characteristic. Historians do not know whether these strengthening forces would still have ultimately resulted in conflict in the absence of the Balfour Declaration.

In July 1914 war broke out in Europe between the <a href="Triple%20Entente">Triple Entente</a> (Britain, France, and the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>) and the <a href="Central%20Powers">Central Powers</a> (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and, later that year, the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>).

The <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Cabinet</a> first discussed Zionism at a meeting on 9November 1914, four days after Britain's declaration of war on the Ottoman Empire, of which the <a href="Mutasarrifate%20of%20Jerusalem">Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem</a>often referred to as Palestinewas a component. At the meeting <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, then <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, "referred to the ultimate destiny of Palestine". The Chancellor, whose law firm Lloyd George, Roberts and Co had been engaged a decade before by the <a href="Zionist%20Federation%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland</a> to work on the <a href="Uganda%20Scheme">Uganda Scheme</a>, was to become Prime Minister by the time of the declaration, and was ultimately responsible for it.

Weizmann's political efforts picked up speed, and on 10December 1914 he met with <a href="Herbert%20Samuel">Herbert Samuel</a>, a British Cabinet member and a secular Jew who had studied Zionism; Samuel believed Weizmann's demands were too modest. Two days later, Weizmann met Balfour again, for the first time since their initial meeting in 1905; Balfour had been out of government ever since his electoral defeat in 1906, but remained a senior member of the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> in their role as <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Loyal%20Opposition%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Official Opposition</a>.

A month later, Samuel circulated a memorandum entitled "<a href="The%20Future%20of%20Palestine">The Future of Palestine</a>" to his Cabinet colleagues. The memorandum stated: "I am assured that the solution of the problem of Palestine which would be much the most welcome to the leaders and supporters of the Zionist movement throughout the world would be the annexation of the country to the British Empire". Samuel discussed a copy of his memorandum with Nathan Rothschild in February 1915, a month before the latter's death. It was the first time in an official record that enlisting the support of Jews as a war measure had been proposed.

Many further discussions followed, including the initial meetings in 1915–16 between Lloyd George, who had been appointed <a href="Minister%20of%20Munitions">Minister of Munitions</a> in May 1915, and Weizmann, who was appointed as a scientific advisor to the ministry in September 1915. Seventeen years later, in his "War Memoirs", Lloyd George described these meetings as being the "fount and origin" of the declaration; historians have rejected this claim.

In late 1915 the <a href="List%20of%20diplomats%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20Egypt">British High Commissioner to Egypt</a>, <a href="Henry%20McMahon%20%28diplomat%29">Henry McMahon</a>, <a href="McMahon%E2%80%93Hussein%20Correspondence">exchanged ten letters</a> with <a href="Hussein%20bin%20Ali%2C%20Sharif%20of%20Mecca">Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca</a>, in which he promised Hussein to recognize Arab independence "in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca" in return for Hussein launching a revolt against the Ottoman Empire. The pledge excluded "portions of <a href="Syria">Syria</a>" lying to the west of "the districts of Damascus, <a href="Homs">Homs</a>, <a href="Hama">Hama</a> and <a href="Aleppo">Aleppo</a>". In the decades after the war, the extent of this coastal exclusion was hotly disputed since Palestine lay to the southwest of <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> and was not explicitly mentioned.
The <a href="Arab%20Revolt">Arab Revolt</a> was launched on June5th, 1916, on the basis of the "quid pro quo" agreement in the correspondence. However, less than three weeks earlier the governments of the United Kingdom, France, and Russia <a href="secret%20treaty">secretly concluded</a> the <a href="Sykes%E2%80%93Picot%20Agreement">Sykes–Picot Agreement</a>, which Balfour described later as a "wholly new method" for dividing the region, after the 1915 agreement "seems to have been forgotten".

This Anglo-French treaty was negotiated in late 1915 and early 1916 between Sir <a href="Mark%20Sykes">Mark Sykes</a> and <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Georges-Picot">François Georges-Picot</a>, with the primary arrangements being set out in draft form in a joint memorandum on 5 January 1916. Sykes was a British Conservative <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull%20Central%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">MP</a> who had risen to a position of significant influence on Britain's Middle East policy, beginning with his seat on the 1915 <a href="De%20Bunsen%20Committee">De Bunsen Committee</a> and his initiative to create the <a href="Arab%20Bureau">Arab Bureau</a>. Picot was a French diplomat and former <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29%23Consular%20rank">consul-general</a> in Beirut. Their agreement defined the proposed spheres of influence and control in Western Asia should the Triple Entente succeed in defeating the Ottoman Empire during World WarI, dividing many Arab territories into British- and French-administered areas. In Palestine, internationalisation was proposed, with the form of administration to be confirmed after consultation with both Russia and Hussein; the January draft noted Christian and Muslim interests, and that "members of the Jewish community throughout the world have a conscientious and sentimental interest in the future of the country."

Prior to this point, no active negotiations with Zionists had taken place, but Sykes had been aware of Zionism, was in contact with <a href="Moses%20Gaster">Moses Gaster</a> – a former President of the English Zionist Federation – and may have seen Samuel's 1915 memorandum. In Sykes' mind, the agreement which bore his name was outdated even before it was signed – in March 1916, he wrote in a private letter: "to my mind the Zionists are now the key of the situation".

These wartime initiatives, inclusive of the declaration, are frequently considered together by historians because of the potential, real or imagined, for incompatibility between them, particularly in regard to the disposition of Palestine. In the words of Professor <a href="Albert%20Hourani">Albert Hourani</a>, founder of the Middle East Centre at <a href="St%20Antony%27s%20College%2C%20Oxford">St Antony's College, Oxford</a>: "The argument about the interpretation of these agreements is one which is impossible to end, because they were intended to bear more than one interpretation."

In terms of British politics, the declaration resulted from the coming into power of <a href="Lloyd%20George%20ministry">Lloyd George and his Cabinet</a>, which had replaced the <a href="Asquith%20coalition%20ministry">H. H. Asquith led-Cabinet</a> in December 1916. Whilst both Prime Ministers were <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberals</a> and both governments were <a href="Coalition%20government">wartime coalitions</a>, Lloyd George and Balfour, appointed as his Foreign Secretary, favoured a post-war partition of the Ottoman Empire as a major British war aim, whereas Asquith and his Foreign Secretary, <a href="Edward%20Grey%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Grey%20of%20Fallodon">Sir Edward Grey</a>, had favoured its reform.

Two days after taking office, Lloyd George told <a href="Sir%20William%20Robertson%2C%201st%20Baronet">General Robertson</a>, the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a>, that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, to impress British public opinion, and immediately consulted his War Cabinet about a "further campaign into Palestine when El Arish had been secured." Subsequent pressure from Lloyd George, over the reservations of Robertson, resulted in the recapture of the <a href="Sinai">Sinai</a> for <a href="Khedivate%20of%20Egypt">British-controlled Egypt</a>, and, with the <a href="Battle%20of%20Magdhaba">capture of El Arish</a> in December 1916 <a href="Battle%20of%20Rafa">and Rafah</a> in January 1917, the arrival of British forces at the southern borders of the Ottoman Empire. Following two unsuccessful <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">attempts to capture Gaza</a> between 26 March and 19 April, a six-month <a href="stalemate%20in%20Southern%20Palestine">stalemate in Southern Palestine</a> began; the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a> would not make any progress into Palestine until 31October 1917.

Following the change in government, Sykes was promoted into the War Cabinet Secretariat with responsibility for Middle Eastern affairs. In January 1917, despite having previously built a relationship with Moses Gaster, he began looking to meet other Zionist leaders; by the end of the month he had been introduced to Weizmann and his associate <a href="Nahum%20Sokolow">Nahum Sokolow</a>, a journalist and executive of the World Zionist Organization who had moved to Britain at the beginning of the war.

On 7February 1917, Sykes, claiming to be acting in a private capacity, entered into substantive discussions with the Zionist leadership. The previous British correspondence with "the Arabs" was discussed at the meeting; Sokolow's notes record Sykes' description that "The Arabs professed that language must be the measure [by which control of Palestine should be determined] and [by that measure] could claim all Syria and Palestine. Still the Arabs could be managed, particularly if they received Jewish support in other matters." At this point the Zionists were still unaware of the <a href="Sykes-Picot%20Agreement">Sykes-Picot Agreement</a>, although they had their suspicions. One of Sykes' goals was the mobilization of Zionism to the cause of British suzerainty in Palestine, so as to have arguments to put to France in support of that objective.

During the period of the British War Cabinet discussions leading up to the declaration, the war had reached a period of stalemate. On the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> the tide would first turn in favour of the Central Powers in <a href="Spring%20Offensive">spring 1918</a>, before decisively <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20the%20Marne">turning in favour of the Allies</a> from July 1918 onwards. Although the United States declared war on Germany in the spring of 1917, it did not suffer its first casualties until 2 November 1917, at which point President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> still hoped to avoid dispatching large contingents of troops into the war. The Russian forces were known to be distracted by the ongoing <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a> and the growing support for the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> faction, but <a href="Alexander%20Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a>'s <a href="Russian%20Provisional%20Government">Provisional Government</a> had remained in the war; Russia only withdrew after the final stage of the revolution <a href="October%20Revolution">on 7November 1917</a>.

Balfour met Weizmann at the Foreign Office on 22 March 1917; two days later, Weizmann described the meeting as being "the first time I had a real business talk with him". Weizmann explained at the meeting that the Zionists had a preference for a British protectorate over Palestine, as opposed to an American, French or international arrangement; Balfour agreed, but warned that "there may be difficulties with France and Italy".

The French position in regard to Palestine and the wider <a href="Syria%20%28region%29">Syria region</a> during the lead up to the Balfour Declaration was largely dictated by the terms of the Sykes-Picot Agreement, and was complicated from 23 November 1915 by increasing French awareness of the British discussions with the Sherif of Mecca. Prior to 1917, the British had led the fighting on the southern border of the Ottoman Empire alone, given their neighbouring <a href="History%20of%20Egypt%20under%20the%20British">Egyptian colony</a> and the French preoccupation with the fighting on the Western Front that was taking place on their own soil. Italy's participation in the war, which began following the April 1915 <a href="Treaty%20of%20London%20%281915%29">Treaty of London</a>, did not include involvement in the Middle Eastern sphere until the April 1917 <a href="Agreement%20of%20Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne">Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne</a>; at this conference, Lloyd George had raised the question of a British protectorate of Palestine and the idea "had been very coldly received" by the French and the Italians. In May and June 1917, the French and Italians sent <a href="Detachment%20%28military%29">detachments</a> to support the British as they built their reinforcements in preparation for a renewed attack on Palestine.

In early April, Sykes and Picot were appointed to act as the chief negotiators once more, this time on a month-long mission to the Middle East for further discussions with the Sherif of Mecca and other Arab leaders. On 3 April 1917, Sykes met with Lloyd George, Curzon and Hankey to receive his instructions in this regard, namely to keep the French onside while "not prejudicing the Zionist movement and the possibility of its development under British auspices, [and not] enter into any political pledges to the Arabs, and particularly none in regard to Palestine". Before travelling to the Middle East, Picot, via Sykes, invited Nahum Sokolow to Paris to educate the French government on Zionism. Sykes, who had prepared the way in correspondence with Picot, arrived a few days after Sokolow; in the meantime Sokolow had met Picot and other French officials, and convinced the French Foreign Office to accept for study a statement of Zionist aims "in regard to facilities of colonization, communal autonomy, rights of language and establishment of a Jewish chartered company." Sykes went on ahead to Italy and had meetings with the British ambassador and British Vatican representative to prepare the way for Sokolow once again.

Sokolow was granted an audience with <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XV">Pope Benedict XV</a> on 6 May 1917. Sokolow's notes of the meeting – the only meeting records known to historians – stated that the Pope expressed general sympathy and support for the Zionist project. On 21 May 1917 Angelo Sereni, president of the <a href="Union%20of%20Italian%20Jewish%20Communities">Committee of the Jewish Communities</a>, presented Sokolow to <a href="Sidney%20Sonnino">Sidney Sonnino</a>, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs. He was also received by <a href="Paolo%20Boselli">Paolo Boselli</a>, the Italian prime minister. Sonnino arranged for the secretary general of the ministry to send a letter to the effect that, although he could not express himself on the merits of a program which concerned all the allies, "generally speaking" he was not opposed to the legitimate claims of the Jews. On his return journey, Sokolow met with French leaders again and secured a <a href="Cambon%20letter">letter</a> dated 4 June 1917, giving assurances of sympathy towards the Zionist cause by <a href="Jules%20Cambon">Jules Cambon</a>, head of the political section of the French foreign ministry. This letter was not published, but was deposited at the British Foreign Office.

Following the United States' entry into the war on 6 April, the British Foreign Secretary led the <a href="Balfour%20Mission">Balfour Mission</a> to <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, where he spent a month between mid-April and mid-May. During the trip he spent significant time discussing Zionism with <a href="Louis%20Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a>, a leading Zionist and a close ally of Wilson who had been appointed as a <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court Justice</a> a year previously.

By 13 June 1917, it was acknowledged by <a href="Ronald%20William%20Graham">Ronald Graham</a>, head of the Foreign Office's Middle Eastern affairs department, that the three most relevant politiciansthe Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, and the <a href="Parliamentary%20Under-Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs">Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</a>, <a href="Robert%20Cecil%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cecil%20of%20Chelwood">Lord Robert Cecil</a>were all in favour of Britain supporting the Zionist movement; on the same day Weizmann had written to Graham to advocate for a public declaration.

Six days later, at a meeting on 19June, Balfour asked Lord Rothschild and Weizmann to submit a formula for a declaration. Over the next few weeks, a 143-word draft was prepared by the Zionist negotiating committee, but it was considered too specific on sensitive areas by Sykes, Graham and Rothschild. Separately, a very different draft had been prepared by the Foreign Office, described in 1961 by <a href="Harold%20Nicolson">Harold Nicolson</a> – who had been involved in preparing the draft – as proposing a "sanctuary for Jewish victims of persecution". The Foreign Office draft was strongly opposed by the Zionists, and was discarded; no copy of the draft has been found in the Foreign Office archives.

Following further discussion, a revised – and at just 46 words in length, much shorter – draft declaration was prepared and sent by Lord Rothschild to Balfour on 18 July. It was received by the Foreign Office, and the matter was brought to the Cabinet for formal consideration.

The decision to release the declaration was taken by the British War Cabinet on 31 October 1917. This followed discussion at four War Cabinet meetings (including the 31 October meeting) over the space of the previous two months. In order to aid the discussions, the War Cabinet Secretariat, led by <a href="Maurice%20Hankey%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hankey%23Lloyd%20George%27s%20War%20Cabinet">Maurice Hankey</a> and supported by his <a href="Assistant%20Secretary">Assistant Secretaries</a> – primarily Sykes and his fellow Conservative MP and pro-Zionist <a href="Leo%20Amery">Leo Amery</a> – solicited outside perspectives to put before the Cabinet. These included the views of government ministers, war allies – notably from President Woodrow Wilson – and in October, formal submissions from six Zionist leaders and four non-Zionist Jews.

British officials asked President Wilson for his consent on the matter on two occasions – first on 3 September, when he replied the time was not ripe, and later on 6 October, when he agreed with the release of the declaration.

Excerpts from the minutes of these four War Cabinet meetings provide a description of the primary factors that the ministers considered:



Declassification of British government archives has allowed scholars to piece together the choreography of the drafting of the declaration; in his widely cited 1961 book, <a href="Leonard%20Stein%20%28Liberal%20politician%29">Leonard Stein</a> published four previous drafts of the declaration.

The drafting began with Weizmann's guidance to the Zionist drafting team on its objectives in a letter dated 20 June 1917, one day following his meeting with Rothschild and Balfour. He proposed that the declaration from the British government should state: "its conviction, its desire or its intention to support Zionist aims for the creation of a Jewish national home in Palestine; no reference must be made I think to the question of the Suzerain Power because that would land the British into difficulties with the French; it must be a Zionist declaration."

A month after the receipt of the much-reduced 12 July draft from Rothschild, Balfour proposed a number of mainly technical amendments. The two subsequent drafts included much more substantial amendments: the first in a late August draft by <a href="Alfred%20Milner">Lord Milner</a> – one of the original five members of Lloyd George's War Cabinet as a <a href="minister%20without%20portfolio">minister without portfolio</a> – which reduced the geographic scope from all of Palestine to "in Palestine", and the second from Milner and Amery in early October, which added the two "safeguard clauses".

Subsequent authors have debated who the "primary author" really was. In his posthumously published 1981 book "<a href="The%20Anglo-American%20Establishment">The Anglo-American Establishment</a>", <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a> history professor <a href="Carroll%20Quigley">Carroll Quigley</a> explained his view that Lord Milner was the primary author of the declaration, and more recently, <a href="William%20D.%20Rubinstein">William D. Rubinstein</a>, Professor of Modern History at <a href="Aberystwyth%20University">Aberystwyth University</a>, Wales, proposed Amery instead.Huneidi wrote that Ormsby-Gore, in a report he prepared for Shuckburgh, claimed authorship, together with Amery, of the final draft form.

The agreed version of the declaration, a single sentence of just 67 words, was sent on 2November 1917 in a short letter from Balfour to Walter Rothschild, for transmission to the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The declaration contained four <a href="clause">clause</a>s, of which the first two promised to support "the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people", followed by two "safeguard clauses" with respect to "the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine", and "the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country".

The term "national home" was intentionally ambiguous, having no legal value or precedent in international law, such that its meaning was unclear when compared to other terms such as "state". The term was intentionally used instead of "state" because of opposition to the Zionist program within the British Cabinet. According to historian Norman Rose, the chief architects of the declaration contemplated that a <a href="Jewish%20State">Jewish State</a> would emerge in time while the <a href="Palestine%20Royal%20Commission">Palestine Royal Commission</a> concluded that the wording was "the outcome of a compromise between those Ministers who contemplated the ultimate establishment of a Jewish State and those who did not."
Interpretation of the wording has been sought in the correspondence leading to the final version of the declaration. An official report to the War Cabinet sent by Sykes on 22 September said that the Zionists did "not" want "to set up a Jewish Republic or any other form of state in Palestine or in any part of Palestine" but rather preferred some form of protectorate as provided in the Palestine Mandate. A month later, Curzon produced a memorandum circulated on 26 October 1917 where he addressed two questions, the first concerning the meaning of the phrase "a National Home for the Jewish race in Palestine"; he noted that there were different opinions ranging from a fully fledged state to a merely spiritual centre for the Jews.

Sections of the British press assumed that a Jewish state was intended even before the Declaration was finalized. In the United States the press began using the terms "Jewish National Home", "Jewish State", "Jewish republic" and "Jewish Commonwealth" interchangeably.

Treaty expert <a href="David%20Hunter%20Miller">David Hunter Miller</a>, who was at the conference and subsequently compiled a 22 volume compendium of documents, provides a report of the Intelligence Section of the American Delegation to the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%20of%201919">Paris Peace Conference of 1919</a> which recommended that "there be established a separate state in Palestine," and that "it will be the policy of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> to recognize Palestine as a Jewish state, as soon as it is a Jewish state in fact." The report further advised that an independent Palestinian state under a <a href="British%20Mandate%20for%20Palestine%20%28legal%20instrument%29">British League of Nations mandate</a> be created. Jewish settlement would be allowed and encouraged in this state and this state's holy sites would be under the control of the League of Nations. Indeed, <a href="the%20Inquiry">the Inquiry</a> spoke positively about the possibility of a Jewish state eventually being created in Palestine if the necessary demographics for this were to exist.

Historian Matthew Jacobs later wrote that the US approach was hampered by the "general absence of specialist knowledge about the region" and that "like much of the Inquiry's work on the Middle East, the reports on Palestine were deeply flawed" and "presupposed a particular outcome of the conflict". He quotes Miller, writing about one report on the history and impact of Zionism, "absolutely inadequate from any standpoint and must be regarded as nothing more than material for a future report"
<a href="Lord%20Robert%20Cecil">Lord Robert Cecil</a> on 2 December 1917, assured an audience that the government fully intended that "Judea [was] for the Jews." Yair Auron opines that Cecil, then a deputy Foreign Secretary representing the British Government at a celebratory gathering of the English Zionist Federation, "possibly went beyond his official brief" in saying (he cites Stein) "Our wish is that Arabian countries shall be for the Arabs, Armenia for the Armenians and Judaea for the Jews".

The following October <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>, while chairing a Zionist meeting, discussed a "new Jewish State."At the time, Chamberlain was a Member of Parliament for Ladywood, Birmingham; recalling the event in 1939, just after Chamberlain had approved the 1939 White Paper, the Jewish Telegraph Agency noted that the Prime Minister had "experienced a pronounced change of mind in the 21 years intervening" A year later, on the Declaration's second anniversary, General <a href="Jan%20Smuts">Jan Smuts</a> said that Britain "would redeem her pledge ... and a great Jewish state would ultimately rise." In similar vein, Churchill a few months later stated:
At the 22 June 1921 meeting of the Imperial Cabinet, Churchill was asked by Arthur Meighen, the Canadian Prime Minister, about the meaning of the national home. Churchill said "If in the course of many years they become a majority in the country, they naturally would take it over...pro rata with the Arab. We made an equal pledge that we would not turn the Arab off his land or invade his political and social rights". 

Responding to Curzon in January 1919, Balfour wrote "Weizmann has never put forward a claim for the Jewish Government of Palestine. Such a claim in my opinion is clearly inadmissible and personally I do not think we should go further than the original declaration which I made to Lord Rothschild".

In February 1919, France issued a statement that it would not oppose putting Palestine under British trusteeship and the formation of a Jewish State. Friedman further notes that France's attitude went on to change; Yehuda Blum, while discussing France's "unfriendly attitude towards the Jewish national movement", notes the content of a report made by Robert Vansittart (a leading member of the British delegation to the Paris Peace Conference) to Curzon in November 1920 which said:
Greece's Foreign Minister told the editor of the Salonica Jewish organ Pro-Israel that "the establishment of a Jewish State meets in Greece with full and sincere sympathy ... A Jewish Palestine would become an ally of Greece." In <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, a number of noted historians including professors Tobler, Forel-Yvorne, and Rogaz, supported the idea of establishing a Jewish state, with one referring to it as "a sacred right of the Jews." While in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, officials and most of the press took the Declaration to mean a British sponsored state for the Jews.

The British government, including Churchill, made it clear that the Declaration did not intend for the whole of Palestine to be converted into a Jewish National Home, "but that such a Home should be founded in Palestine." <a href="Faisal%20I%20of%20Iraq">Emir Faisal</a>, King of Syria and Iraq, made a formal written agreement with Zionist leader <a href="Chaim%20Weizmann">Chaim Weizmann</a>, which was drafted by T.E. Lawrence, whereby they would try to establish a peaceful relationship between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. The 3 January 1919 <a href="Faisal%E2%80%93Weizmann%20Agreement">Faisal–Weizmann Agreement</a> was a short-lived agreement for Arab–Jewish cooperation on the development of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. Faisal did treat Palestine differently in his presentation to the Peace Conference on 6 February 1919 saying "Palestine, for its universal character, [should be] left on one side for the mutual consideration of all parties concerned". The agreement was never implemented. In a subsequent letter written in English by Lawrence for Faisal's signature, he explained:
When the letter was tabled at the <a href="Shaw%20Commission">Shaw Commission</a> in 1929, <a href="Rustam%20Haidar">Rustam Haidar</a> spoke to Faisal in Baghdad and cabled that Faisal had "no recollection that he wrote anything of the sort". In January 1930, Haidar wrote to a newspaper in Baghdad that Faisal: "finds it exceedingly strange that such a matter is attributed to him as he at no time would consider allowing any foreign nation to share in an Arab country". <a href="Awni%20Abd%20al-Hadi">Awni Abd al-Hadi</a>, Faisal's secretary, wrote in his memoirs that he was not aware that a meeting between Frankfurter and Faisal took place and that: "I believe that this letter, assuming that it is authentic, was written by Lawrence, and that Lawrence signed it in English on behalf of Faisal. I believe this letter is part of the false claims made by Chaim Weizmann and Lawrence to lead astray public opinion." According to Allawi, the most likely explanation for the Frankfurter letter is that a meeting took place, a letter was drafted in English by Lawrence, but that its "contents were not entirely made clear to Faisal. He then may or may not have been induced to sign it", since it ran counter to Faisal's other public and private statements at the time.A 1 March interview by Le Matin quoted Faisal as saying:
This feeling of respect for other religions dictates my opinion about Palestine, our neighbor. That the unhappy Jews come to reside there and behave as good citizens of this country, our humanity rejoices given that they are placed under a Muslim or Christian government mandated by The League of Nations. If they want to constitute a state and claim sovereign rights in this region, I forsee very serious dangers. It is to be feared that there will be a conflict between them and the other races. 

Referring to his 1922 <a href="Churchill%20White%20Paper">White Paper</a>, Churchill later wrote that "there is nothing in it to prohibit the ultimate establishment of a Jewish State." And in private, many British officials agreed with the Zionists' interpretation that a state would be established when a Jewish majority was achieved.

When Chaim Weizmann met with Churchill, Lloyd George and Balfour at Balfour's home in London on 21 July 1921, Lloyd George and Balfour assured Weizmann "that by the Declaration they had always meant an eventual Jewish State," according to Weizmann minutes of that meeting. Lloyd George stated in 1937 that it was intended that Palestine would become a Jewish Commonwealth if and when Jews "had become a definite majority of the inhabitants", and Leo Amery echoed the same position in 1946. In the UNSCOP report of 1947, the issue of home versus state was subjected to scrutiny arriving at a similar conclusion to that of Lloyd George.

The statement that such a homeland would be found "in Palestine" rather than "of Palestine" was also deliberate. The proposed draft of the declaration contained in Rothschild's 12 July letter to Balfour referred to the principle "that Palestine should be reconstituted as the National Home of the Jewish people." In the final text, following Lord Milner's amendment, the word "reconstituted" was removed and the word "that" was replaced with "in".

This text thereby avoided committing the entirety of Palestine as the National Home of the Jewish people, resulting in controversy in future years over the intended scope, especially the <a href="Revisionist%20Zionism">Revisionist Zionism</a> sector, which claimed entirety of <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Mandatory Palestine</a> and <a href="Emirate%20of%20Transjordan">Emirate of Transjordan</a> as <a href="Jewish%20Homeland">Jewish Homeland</a> This was clarified by the 1922 Churchill White Paper, which wrote that "the terms of the declaration referred to do not contemplate that Palestine as a whole should be converted into a Jewish National Home, but that such a Home should be founded 'in Palestine.'"

The declaration did not include any geographical boundaries for Palestine. Following the end of the war, three documents – the declaration, the Hussein-McMahon Correspondence and the Sykes-Picot Agreement – became the basis for the negotiations to set the boundaries of Palestine.

The declaration's first safeguard clause referred to protecting the <a href="human%20rights">civil and religious rights</a> of non-Jews in Palestine. The clause had been drafted together with the second safeguard by Leo Amery in consultation with Lord Milner, with the intention to "go a reasonable distance to meeting the objectors, both Jewish and pro-Arab, without impairing the substance of the proposed declaration".

The "non-Jews" constituted 90% of the population of Palestine; in the words of <a href="Ronald%20Storrs">Ronald Storrs</a>, Britain's Military Governor of Jerusalem between 1917 and 1920, the community observed that they had been "not so much as named, either as Arabs, Moslems or Christians, but were lumped together under the negative and humiliating definition of 'Non-Jewish Communities' and relegated to subordinate provisos". The community also noted that there was no reference to protecting their "political status" or political rights, as there was in the subsequent safeguard relating to Jews in other countries. This protection was frequently contrasted against the commitment to the Jewish community, and over the years a variety of terms were used to refer to these two obligations as a pair; a particularly heated question was whether these two obligations had "equal weight", and in 1930 this equal status was confirmed by the <a href="Permanent%20Mandates%20Commission">Permanent Mandates Commission</a> and by the British government in the <a href="Passfield%20white%20paper">Passfield white paper</a>.

Balfour stated in February 1919 that Palestine was considered an exceptional case in which, referring to the local population, "we deliberately and rightly decline to accept the principle of <a href="self-determination">self-determination</a>," although he considered that the policy provided self-determination to Jews. Avi Shlaim considers this the declaration's "greatest contradiction". This principle of self-determination had been declared on numerous occasions subsequent to the declarationPresident Wilson's January 1918 <a href="Fourteen%20Points">Fourteen Points</a>, McMahon's Declaration to the Seven in June 1918, the November 1918 <a href="Anglo-French%20Declaration">Anglo-French Declaration</a>, and the June 1919 <a href="Covenant%20of%20the%20League%20of%20Nations">Covenant of the League of Nations</a> that had established the <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">mandate system</a>. In an August 1919 memo Balfour acknowledged the inconsistency among these statements, and further explained that the British had no intention of consulting the existing population of Palestine. The results of the ongoing American <a href="King%E2%80%93Crane%20Commission">King–Crane Commission of Enquiry consultation</a> of the local population – from which the British had withdrawn – were suppressed for three years until the report was leaked in 1922. Subsequent British governments have acknowledged this deficiency, in particular the 1939 committee led by the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, <a href="Frederic%20Maugham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Maugham">Frederic Maugham</a>, which concluded that the government had not been "free to dispose of Palestine without regard for the wishes and interests of the inhabitants of Palestine", and the April 2017 statement by British Foreign Office minister of state <a href="Joyce%20Anelay%2C%20Baroness%20Anelay%20of%20St%20Johns">Baroness Anelay</a> that the government acknowledged that "the Declaration should have called for the protection of political rights of the non-Jewish communities in Palestine, particularly their right to self-determination."

The second safeguard clause was a commitment that nothing should be done which might prejudice the rights of the Jewish communities in other countries outside of Palestine. The original drafts of Rothschild, Balfour, and Milner did not include this safeguard, which was drafted together with the preceding safeguard in early October, in order to reflect opposition from influential members of the Anglo-Jewish community. Lord Rothschild took exception to the proviso on the basis that it presupposed the possibility of a danger to non-Zionists, which he denied.

The Conjoint Foreign Committee of the <a href="Board%20of%20Deputies%20of%20British%20Jews">Board of Deputies of British Jews</a> and the <a href="Anglo-Jewish%20Association">Anglo-Jewish Association</a> had published a letter in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" on 24 May 1917 entitled "Views of Anglo-Jewry", signed by the two organisations' presidents, <a href="David%20Lindo%20Alexander">David Lindo Alexander</a> and <a href="Claude%20Montefiore">Claude Montefiore</a>, stating their view that: "the establishment of a Jewish nationality in Palestine, founded on this theory of homelessness, must have the effect throughout the world of stamping the Jews as strangers in their native lands, and of undermining their hard-won position as citizens and nationals of these lands." This was followed in late August by <a href="Edwin%20Samuel%20Montagu">Edwin Samuel Montagu</a>, an influential <a href="anti-Zionist">anti-Zionist</a> Jew and <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20India">Secretary of State for India</a>, and the only Jewish member of the British Cabinet, who wrote in a Cabinet memorandum that: "The policy of His Majesty's Government is anti-Semitic in result and will prove a rallying ground for anti-Semites in every country of the world."

The text of the declaration was published in the press one week after it was signed, on 9November 1917. Other related events took place within a short timeframe, the two most relevant being the almost immediate British military capture of Palestine and the leaking of the previously secret Sykes-Picot Agreement. On the military side, both <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Gaza</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Jaffa%20%281917%29">Jaffa fell</a> within several days, and <a href="Battle%20of%20Jerusalem">Jerusalem was surrendered</a> to the British on 9 December. The publication of the Sykes–Picot Agreement, following the Russian Revolution, in the Bolshevik "<a href="Izvestia">Izvestia</a>" and "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>" on 23 November 1917 and in the British "<a href="The%20Guardian">Manchester Guardian</a>" on 26 November 1917, represented a dramatic moment for the Allies' Eastern campaign: "the British were embarrassed, the Arabs dismayed and the Turks delighted." The Zionists had been aware of the outlines of the agreement since April and specifically the part relevant to Palestine, following a meeting between Weizmann and Cecil where Weizmann made very clear his objections to the proposed scheme.

The declaration represented the first public support for Zionism by a major political power – its publication galvanized Zionism, which finally had obtained an official charter. In addition to its publication in major newspapers, leaflets were circulated throughout Jewish communities. These leaflets were <a href="airdrop">airdrop</a>ped over Jewish communities in Germany and Austria, as well as the <a href="Pale%20of%20Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a>, which <a href="Treaty%20of%20Brest-Litovsk%20%28Ukraine%E2%80%93Central%20Powers%29">had been given to the Central Powers</a> following the Russian withdrawal.

Weizmann had argued that the declaration would have three effects: it would swing Russia to maintain pressure on Germany's <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Eastern Front</a>, since Jews had been prominent in the <a href="February%20Revolution">March Revolution of 1917</a>; it would rally the large Jewish community in the United States to press for greater funding for the <a href="American%20entry%20into%20World%20War%20I">American war effort</a>, underway since April of that year; and, lastly, that it would undermine German Jewish support for <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>.

The declaration spurred an unintended and extraordinary increase in the number of adherents of American Zionism; in 1914 the 200 American Zionist societies comprised a total of 7,500 members, which grew to 30,000 members in 600 societies in 1918 and 149,000 members in 1919. Whilst the British had considered that the declaration reflected a previously established dominance of the Zionist position in Jewish thought, it was the declaration itself that was subsequently responsible for Zionism's legitimacy and leadership.

Exactly one month after the declaration was issued, a large-scale celebration took place at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a> – speeches were given by leading Zionists as well as members of the British administration including Sykes and Cecil. From 1918 until World War II, Jews in <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Mandatory Palestine</a> celebrated <a href="Balfour%20Day">Balfour Day</a> as an annual national holiday on 2November. The celebrations included ceremonies in schools and other public institutions and festive articles in the Hebrew press. In August 1919 Balfour approved Weizmann's request to name the first post-war settlement in Mandatory Palestine, "<a href="Balfouria">Balfouria</a>", in his honour. It was intended to be a model settlement for future American Jewish activity in Palestine.

Herbert Samuel, the Zionist MP whose 1915 memorandum had framed the start of discussions in the British Cabinet, was asked by Lloyd George on 24April 1920 to act as the first <a href="High%20Commissioners%20for%20Palestine%20and%20Transjordan">civil governor of British Palestine</a>, replacing the <a href="Occupied%20Enemy%20Territory%20Administration">previous military administration</a> that had ruled the area since the war. Shortly after beginning the role in July 1920, he was invited to read the "<a href="haftarah">haftarah</a>" from <a href="Isaiah%2040">Isaiah 40</a> at the <a href="Hurva%20Synagogue">Hurva Synagogue</a> in Jerusalem, which, according to his memoirs, led the congregation of older settlers to feel that the "fulfilment of ancient prophecy might at last be at hand".

The local Christian and Muslim community of Palestine, who constituted <a href="Demographic%20history%20of%20Palestine%20%28region%29">almost 90% of the population</a>, strongly opposed the declaration. As described by the Palestinian-American philosopher <a href="Edward%20Said">Edward Said</a> in 1979, it was perceived as being made: "(a)by a European power, (b)about a non-European territory, (c)in a flat disregard of both the presence and the wishes of the native majority resident in that territory, and (d)it took the form of a promise about this same territory to another foreign group."

According to the 1919 King–Crane Commission, "No British officer, consulted by the Commissioners, believed that the Zionist programme could be carried out except by force of arms." A delegation of the <a href="Muslim-Christian%20Associations">Muslim-Christian Association</a>, headed by <a href="Musa%20al-Husayni">Musa al-Husayni</a>, expressed public disapproval on 3November 1918, one day after the Zionist Commission parade marking the first anniversary of the Balfour Declaration. They handed a petition signed by more than 100 notables to Ronald Storrs, the British military governor:
The group also protested the carrying of new "white and blue banners with two inverted triangles in the middle", drawing the attention of the British authorities to the serious consequences of any political implications in raising the banners. Later that month, on the first anniversary of the occupation of <a href="Jaffa">Jaffa</a> by the British, the Muslim-Christian Association sent a lengthy memorandum and petition to the military governor protesting once more any formation of a Jewish state.

In the broader Arab world, the declaration was seen as a betrayal of the British wartime understandings with the Arabs. The Sharif of Mecca and other Arab leaders considered the declaration a violation of a previous commitment made in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence in exchange for launching the Arab Revolt.

Following the publication of the declaration, the British dispatched Commander <a href="David%20George%20Hogarth">David George Hogarth</a> to see Hussein in January 1918 bearing <a href="Hogarth%20Message">the message</a> that the "political and economic freedom" of the Palestinian population was not in question. Hogarth reported that Hussein "would not accept an independent Jewish State in Palestine, nor was I instructed to warn him that such a state was contemplated by Great Britain". Hussein had also learned of the Sykes–Picot Agreement when it was leaked by the new <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> government in December 1917, but was satisfied by <a href="Bassett%20Letter">two disingenuous messages</a> from Sir <a href="Reginald%20Wingate">Reginald Wingate</a>, who had replaced McMahon as High Commissioner of Egypt, assuring him that the British commitments to the Arabs were still valid and that the Sykes–Picot Agreement was not a formal treaty.

Continuing Arab disquiet over Allied intentions also led during 1918 to the British <a href="Declaration%20to%20the%20Seven">Declaration to the Seven</a> and the Anglo-French Declaration, the latter promising "the complete and final liberation of the peoples who have for so long been oppressed by the Turks, and the setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations".

In 1919, King Hussein refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. After February, 1920, the British ceased to pay subsidy to him. In August, 1920, five days after the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres, which formally recognized the Kingdom of Hejaz, Curzon asked Cairo to procure Hussein's signature to both treaties and agreed to make a payment of £30,000 conditional on signature. Hussein declined and in 1921, stated that he could not be expected to "affix his name to a document assigning Palestine to the Zionists and Syria to foreigners." Following the 1921 Cairo Conference, Lawrence was sent to try and obtain the King's signature to a treaty, a £100,000 annual subsidy being proposed; this attempt also failed. During 1923, the British made one further attempt to settle outstanding issues with Hussein and once again, the attempt foundered, Hussein continued in his refusal to recognize the Balfour Declaration or any of the Mandates that he perceived as being his domain. In March 1924, having briefly considered the possibility of removing the offending article from the treaty, the government suspended any further negotiations; within six months they withdrew their support in favor of their <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Nejd">central Arabian</a> ally <a href="Ibn%20Saud">Ibn Saud</a>, who proceeded to <a href="Saudi%20conquest%20of%20Hejaz">conquer Hussein's kingdom</a>.

The declaration was first endorsed by a foreign government on 27 December 1917, when <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Serbia">Serbian</a> Zionist leader and diplomat <a href="David%20Albala">David Albala</a> announced the support of Serbia's <a href="government%20in%20exile">government in exile</a> during a <a href="Diplomatic%20mission">mission</a> to the United States. The French and Italian governments offered their endorsements, on 14 February and 9 May 1918, respectively. At a private meeting in London on 1 December 1918, Lloyd George and French Prime Minister <a href="Georges%20Clemenceau">Georges Clemenceau</a> agreed to certain modifications to the Sykes-Picot Agreement, including British control of Palestine.

On 25 April 1920, the <a href="San%20Remo%20conference">San Remo conference</a> – an outgrowth of the Paris Peace Conference attended by the prime ministers of Britain, France and Italy, the , and the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Italy">United States Ambassador to Italy</a> – established the basic terms for three League of Nations mandates: a French mandate for Syria, and British mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine. With respect to Palestine, the resolution stated that the British were responsible for putting into effect the terms of the Balfour Declaration. The French and the Italians made clear their dislike of the "Zionist cast of the Palestinian mandate" and objected especially to language that did not safeguard the "political" rights of non-Jews, accepting Curzon's claim that "in the British language all ordinary rights were included in "civil rights"". At the request of France, it was agreed that an undertaking was to be inserted in the mandate's <a href="proc%C3%A8s-verbal">procès-verbal</a> that this would not involve the surrender of the rights hitherto enjoyed by the non-Jewish communities in Palestine. The boundaries of Palestine were left unspecified, to "be determined by the Principal Allied Powers." Three months later, in July 1920, the French defeat of Faisal's <a href="Arab%20Kingdom%20of%20Syria">Arab Kingdom of Syria</a> precipitated the British need to know "what is the 'Syria' for which the French received a mandate at San Remo?" and "does it include Transjordania?" – it subsequently decided to pursue a policy of associating <a href="Emirate%20of%20Transjordan">Transjordan</a> with the mandated area of Palestine without adding it to the area of the Jewish National Home.

In 1922, Congress officially endorsed America's support for the Balfour Declaration through the passage of the <a href="Lodge-Fish%20Resolution">Lodge-Fish Resolution</a>, notwithstanding opposition from the State Department. Professor <a href="Lawrence%20Davidson">Lawrence Davidson</a>, of <a href="West%20Chester%20University">West Chester University</a>, whose research focuses on American relations with the Middle East, argues that President Wilson and Congress ignored democratic values in favour of "biblical romanticism" when they endorsed the declaration. He points to an organized pro-Zionist lobby in the United States, which was active at a time when the country's small <a href="Arab%20Americans">Arab American</a> community had little political power.

The publication of the Balfour Declaration was met with tactical responses from the Central Powers. Two weeks following the declaration, <a href="Ottokar%20Czernin">Ottokar Czernin</a>, the Austrian Foreign Minister, gave an interview to <a href="Arthur%20Menachem%20Hantke">Arthur Hantke</a>, President of the <a href="Zionist%20Federation%20of%20Germany">Zionist Federation of Germany</a>, promising that his government would influence the Turks once the war was over. On 12December, the Ottoman <a href="Grand%20Vizier">Grand Vizier</a>, <a href="Talaat%20Pasha">Talaat Pasha</a>, gave an interview to the German newspaper "<a href="Vossische%20Zeitung">Vossische Zeitung</a>" that was published on 31December and subsequently released in the German-Jewish periodical "" on 4January 1918, in which he referred to the declaration as "une blague" (a deception) and promised that under Ottoman rule "all justifiable wishes of the Jews in Palestine would be able to find their fulfilment" subject to the absorptive capacity of the country. This Turkish statement was endorsed by the <a href="Federal%20Foreign%20Office">German Foreign Office</a> on 5January 1918. On 8January 1918, a German-Jewish Society, the Union of German Jewish Organizations for the Protection of the Rights of the Jews of the East (VJOD), was formed to advocate for further progress for Jews in Palestine.

Following the war, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20S%C3%A8vres">Treaty of Sèvres</a> was signed by the Ottoman Empire on 10August 1920. The treaty dissolved the Ottoman Empire, requiring Turkey to renounce sovereignty over much of the Middle East. Article95 of the treaty incorporated the terms of the Balfour Declaration with respect to "the administration of Palestine, within such boundaries as may be determined by the Principal Allied Powers". Since incorporation of the declaration into the Treaty of Sèvres did not affect the legal status of either the declaration or the Mandate, there was also no effect when Sèvres was superseded by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Lausanne%20%281923%29">Treaty of Lausanne (1923)</a>, which did not include any reference to the declaration.

In 1922, German <a href="anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> theorist <a href="Alfred%20Rosenberg">Alfred Rosenberg</a> in his primary <a href="racial%20policy%20of%20Nazi%20Germany">contribution to Nazi theory</a> on Zionism, "Der Staatsfeindliche Zionismus" ("Zionism, the Enemy of the State"), accused German Zionists of working for a German defeat and supporting Britain and the implementation of the Balfour Declaration, in a version of the <a href="stab-in-the-back%20myth">stab-in-the-back myth</a>. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> took a similar approach in some of his speeches from 1920 onwards.

With the advent of the declaration and the British entry into Jerusalem on 9 December, the Vatican reversed its earlier sympathetic attitude to Zionism and adopted an oppositional stance that was <a href="Holy%20See%E2%80%93Israel%20relations">to continue until the early 1990s</a>.

The British policy as stated in the declaration was to face numerous challenges to its implementation in the following years. The first of these was the indirect peace negotiations which took place between Britain and the Ottomans in December 1917 and January 1918 during a pause in the hostilities for the rainy season; although these peace talks were unsuccessful, archival records suggest that key members of the War Cabinet may have been willing to permit leaving Palestine under nominal Turkish sovereignty as part of an overall deal.

In October 1919, almost a year after the end of the war, <a href="George%20Curzon%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Curzon%20of%20Kedleston">Lord Curzon</a> succeeded Balfour as Foreign Secretary. Curzon had been a member of the 1917 Cabinet that had approved the declaration, and according to British historian <a href="Sir%20David%20Gilmour%2C%204th%20Baronet">Sir David Gilmour</a>, Curzon had been "the only senior figure in the British government at the time who foresaw that its policy would lead to decades of Arab–Jewish hostility". He therefore determined to pursue a policy in line with its "narrower and more prudent rather than the wider interpretation". Following <a href="Bonar%20Law">Bonar Law</a>'s appointment as Prime Minister in late 1922, Curzon wrote to Law that he regarded the declaration as "the worst" of Britain's Middle East commitments and "a striking contradiction of our publicly declared principles".

In August 1920 the report of the <a href="Palin%20Commission">Palin Commission</a>, the first in a long line of British <a href="Public%20inquiry">Commissions of Inquiry</a> on the question of Palestine during the Mandate period, noted that "The Balfour Declaration... is undoubtedly the starting point of the whole trouble". The conclusion of the report, which was not published, mentioned the Balfour Declaration three times, stating that "the causes of the alienation and exasperation of the feelings of the population of Palestine" included:


British public and government opinion became increasingly unfavourable to state support for Zionism; even Sykes had begun to change his views in late 1918. In February 1922 Churchill telegraphed Samuel, who had begun his role as High Commissioner for Palestine 18 months earlier, asking for cuts in expenditure and noting:
Following the issuance of the Churchill White Paper in June 1922, the House of Lords rejected a Palestine Mandate that incorporated the Balfour Declaration by 60 votes to 25, following a motion issued by <a href="John%20Dickson-Poynder%2C%201st%20Baron%20Islington">Lord Islington</a>. The vote proved to be only symbolic as it was subsequently overruled by a vote in the House of Commons following a tactical pivot and variety of promises made by Churchill.

In February 1923, following the change in government, Cavendish, in a lengthy memorandum for the Cabinet, laid the foundation for a secret review of Palestine policy:

His covering note asked for a statement of policy to be made as soon as possible and that the cabinet ought to focus on three questions: (1) whether or not pledges to the Arabs conflict with the Balfour declaration; (2) if not, whether the new government should continue the policy set down by the old government in the 1922 White Paper; and (3) if not, what alternative policy should be adopted.

Stanley Baldwin, replacing Bonar Law, in June 1923 set up a cabinet subcommittee whose terms of reference were:

The Cabinet approved the report of this committee on 31 July 1923. Describing it as "nothing short of remarkable", Quigley noted that the government was admitting to itself that its support for Zionism had been prompted by considerations having nothing to do with the merits of Zionism or its consequences for Palestine. As Huneidi noted, "wise or unwise, it is well nigh impossible for any government to extricate itself without a substantial sacrifice of consistency and self-respect, if not honour."

The wording of the declaration was thus incorporated into the <a href="British%20Mandate%20for%20Palestine%20%28legal%20instrument%29">British Mandate for Palestine</a>, a legal instrument that created Mandatory Palestine with an explicit purpose of putting the declaration into effect and was finally formalized in September,1923. Unlike the declaration itself, the Mandate was legally binding on the British government. In June, 1924, Britain made its report to the Permanent Mandates Commission for the period July 1920 to the end of 1923 containing nothing of the candor reflected in the internal documents; the documents relating to the 1923 reappraisal stayed secret until the early 1970s. 

Lloyd George and Balfour remained in government until <a href="Carlton%20Club%20meeting">the collapse of the coalition in October 1922</a>. Under <a href="Conservative%20Government%201922%E2%80%9324">the new Conservative government</a>, attempts were made to identify the background to and motivations for the declaration. A private Cabinet memorandum was produced in January 1923, providing a summary of the then-known Foreign Office and War Cabinet records leading up to the declaration. An accompanying Foreign Office note asserted that the primary authors of the declaration were Balfour, Sykes, Weizmann, and Sokolow, with "perhaps Lord Rothschild as a figure in the background", and that "negotiations seem to have been mainly oral and by means of private notes and memoranda of which only the scantiest records seem to be available."

Following the 1936 <a href="Arab%20general%20strike%20%28Mandatory%20Palestine%29">general strike</a> that was to degenerate into the <a href="1936%E2%80%931939%20Arab%20revolt%20in%20Palestine">1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine</a>, the most significant outbreak of violence since the Mandate began, a British <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>  – a high-profile public inquiry – was appointed to investigate the causes of the unrest. The Palestine Royal Commission, appointed with significantly broader <a href="terms%20of%20reference">terms of reference</a> than the previous British inquiries into Palestine, completed its 404-page report after six months of work in June 1937, publishing it a month later. The report began by describing the history of the problem, including a detailed summary of the origins of the Balfour Declaration. Much of this summary relied on Lloyd-George's personal testimony; Balfour had died in 1930 and Sykes in 1919. He told the commission that the declaration was made "due to propagandist reasons... In particular Jewish sympathy would confirm the support of American Jewry, and would make it more difficult for Germany to reduce her military commitments and improve her economic position on the eastern front". Two years later, in his "Memoirs", Lloyd George described a total of nine factors motivating his decision as Prime Minister to release the declaration, including the additional reasons that a Jewish presence in Palestine would strengthen Britain's position on the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> and reinforce the route to their imperial dominion in India.

These geopolitical calculations were debated and discussed in the following years. Historians agree that the British believed that expressing support would appeal to Jews in Germany and the United States, given two of Woodrow Wilson's closest advisors were known to be avid Zionists; they also hoped to encourage support from the large Jewish population in Russia. In addition, the British intended to pre-empt the expected French pressure for an international administration in Palestine.

Some historians argue that the British government's decision reflected what <a href="James%20L.%20Gelvin">James Gelvin</a>, Professor of Middle Eastern History at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">UCLA</a>, calls 'patrician anti-Semitism' in the overestimation of Jewish power in both the United States and Russia. American Zionism was still in its infancy; in 1914 the Zionist Federation had a small budget of about $5,000 and only 12,000 members, despite an American Jewish population of three million. But the Zionist organizations had recently succeeded, following a show of force within the American Jewish community, in arranging a Jewish congress to debate the Jewish problem as a whole. This impacted British and French government estimates of the balance of power within the American Jewish public.

<a href="Avi%20Shlaim">Avi Shlaim</a>, Emeritus Professor of International Relations in the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, asserts that two main schools of thought have been developed on the question of the primary driving force behind the declaration, one presented in 1961 by Leonard Stein, a lawyer and former political secretary to the <a href="World%20Zionist%20Organization">World Zionist Organization</a>, and the other in 1970 by Mayir Vereté, then Professor of Israeli History at the <a href="Hebrew%20University%20of%20Jerusalem">Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>. Shlaim states that Stein does not reach any clear cut conclusions, but that implicit in his narrative is that the declaration resulted primarily from the activity and skill of the Zionists, whereas according to Vereté, it was the work of hard-headed pragmatists motivated by British imperial interests in the Middle East. Much of modern scholarship on the decision to issue the declaration focuses on the Zionist movement and rivalries within it, with a key debate being whether the role of Weizmann was decisive or whether the British were likely to have issued a similar declaration in any event. Danny Gutwein, Professor of Jewish History at the <a href="University%20of%20Haifa">University of Haifa</a>, proposes a twist on an old idea, asserting that Sykes's February 1917 approach to the Zionists was the defining moment, and that it was consistent with the pursuit of the government's wider agenda to <a href="Partition%20of%20the%20Ottoman%20Empire">partition the Ottoman Empire</a>.

The declaration had two indirect consequences, the emergence of a Jewish state and a chronic state of conflict between Arabs and Jews throughout the Middle East. It has been described as the "<a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>" with respect to both Britain's failure in Palestine and for wider events in Palestine. The statement also had a significant impact on the traditional anti-Zionism of religious Jews, some of whom saw it as <a href="divine%20providence">divine providence</a>; this contributed to the growth of <a href="religious%20Zionism">religious Zionism</a> amid the larger Zionist movement.

Starting in 1920, <a href="intercommunal%20conflict%20in%20Mandatory%20Palestine">intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine</a> broke out, which widened into the regional <a href="Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20conflict">Arab–Israeli conflict</a>, often referred to as the world's "most intractable conflict". The "dual obligation" to the two communities quickly proved to be untenable; the British subsequently concluded that it was impossible for them to pacify the two communities in Palestine by using different messages for different audiences. The Palestine Royal Commission – in making the first official proposal for partition of the region – referred to the requirements as "contradictory obligations", and that the "disease is so deep-rooted that, in our firm conviction, the only hope of a cure lies in a surgical operation". Following the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, and as worldwide tensions rose in the buildup to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the British Parliament approved the <a href="White%20Paper%20of%201939">White Paper of 1939</a> – their last formal statement of governing policy in Mandatory Palestine – declaring that Palestine should not become a Jewish State and placing restrictions on Jewish immigration. Whilst the British considered this consistent with the Balfour Declaration's commitment to protect the rights of non-Jews, many Zionists saw it as a repudiation of the declaration. Although this policy lasted until the British surrendered the Mandate in 1948, it served only to highlight the fundamental difficulty for Britain in carrying out the Mandate obligations.

Britain's involvement in this became one of the most controversial parts of its Empire's history, and damaged its reputation in the Middle East for generations. According to historian Elizabeth Monroe: "measured by British interests alone, [the declaration was] one of the greatest mistakes in [its] imperial history." The 2010 study by Jonathan Schneer, specialist in modern British history at <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Georgia Tech</a>, concluded that because the build-up to the declaration was characterized by "contradictions, deceptions, misinterpretations, and wishful thinking", the declaration sowed <a href="Dragon%27s%20teeth%20%28mythology%29">dragon's teeth</a> and "produced a murderous harvest, and we go on harvesting even today". The foundational stone for modern Israel had been laid, but the prediction that this would lay the groundwork for harmonious Arab-Jewish cooperation proved to be wishful thinking.

The document was presented to the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> in 1924 by Walter Rothschild; today it is held in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>, which separated from the British Museum in 1973, as Additional Manuscripts number 41178. From October 1987 to May 1988 it was lent outside the UK for display in Israel's <a href="Knesset">Knesset</a>. The Israeli government are currently in negotiations to arrange a second loan in 2018, with plans to display the document at <a href="Independence%20Hall%20%28Israel%29">Independence Hall</a> in Tel Aviv.

Charlie Chaplin

Sir Charles Spencer "Charlie" Chaplin (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of <a href="silent%20film">silent film</a>. He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, "<a href="The%20Tramp">The Tramp</a>", and is considered one of the most important figures in the history of the film industry. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.

Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship, as his father was absent and his mother struggled financially, and he was sent to a workhouse twice before the age of nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a>s and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the prestigious <a href="Fred%20Karno">Fred Karno</a> company, which took him to America. He was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for <a href="Keystone%20Studios">Keystone Studios</a>. He soon developed the Tramp persona and formed a large fan base. He directed his own films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to the <a href="Essanay%20Studios">Essanay</a>, <a href="Mutual%20Film">Mutual</a>, and <a href="First%20National%20Pictures">First National</a> corporations. By 1918, he was one of the best-known figures in the world.

In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> which gave him complete control over his films. His first feature-length film was "<a href="The%20Kid%20%281921%20film%29">The Kid</a>" (1921), followed by "<a href="A%20Woman%20of%20Paris">A Woman of Paris</a>" (1923), "<a href="The%20Gold%20Rush">The Gold Rush</a>" (1925), and "<a href="The%20Circus%20%28film%29">The Circus</a>" (1928). He refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing "<a href="City%20Lights">City Lights</a>" (1931) and "<a href="Modern%20Times%20%28film%29">Modern Times</a>" (1936) without dialogue. He became increasingly political, and his next film "<a href="The%20Great%20Dictator">The Great Dictator</a>" (1940) satirized <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. The 1940s were a decade marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies, while he created scandal through his involvement in a paternity suit and his marriages to much younger women. An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the United States and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in his later films, which include "<a href="Monsieur%20Verdoux">Monsieur Verdoux</a>" (1947), "<a href="Limelight%20%281952%20film%29">Limelight</a>" (1952), "<a href="A%20King%20in%20New%20York">A King in New York</a>" (1957), and "<a href="A%20Countess%20from%20Hong%20Kong">A Countess from Hong Kong</a>" (1967).

Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development and production of a picture. His films are characterized by slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well as autobiographical elements. He received an Honorary Academy Award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century" in 1972, as part of a renewed appreciation for his work. He continues to be held in high regard, with "The Gold Rush", "City Lights", "Modern Times", and "The Great Dictator" often ranked on lists of the greatest films of all time.

Charles Spencer Chaplin was born on 16 April 1889 to <a href="Hannah%20Chaplin">Hannah Chaplin</a> (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and <a href="Charles%20Chaplin%20Sr">Charles Chaplin Sr</a>. There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at <a href="East%20Street">East Street</a>, <a href="Walworth">Walworth</a>, in <a href="South%20London">South London</a>. His mother and father had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal guardian of Hannah's illegitimate son, <a href="Sydney%20Chaplin">Sydney John Hill</a>. At the time of his birth, Chaplin's parents were both <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular singer. Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891. The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son – <a href="Wheeler%20Dryden">George Wheeler Dryden</a> – fathered by the music hall entertainer <a href="Leo%20Dryden">Leo Dryden</a>. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for 30 years.

Chaplin's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory "the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told" according to his authorised biographer <a href="David%20Robinson%20%28film%20critic%29">David Robinson</a>. Chaplin's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of <a href="Kennington">Kennington</a>; Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support. As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to <a href="Lambeth%20Workhouse">Lambeth Workhouse</a> when he was seven years old. The council housed him at the <a href="Central%20London%20District%20School">Central London District School</a> for <a href="Pauperism">paupers</a>, which Chaplin remembered as "a forlorn existence". He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, before Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to <a href="West%20Norwood">Norwood</a> Schools, another institution for destitute children.

In September 1898, Hannah was committed to <a href="Cane%20Hill%20Hospital">Cane Hill</a> mental asylum – she had developed a <a href="psychosis">psychosis</a> seemingly brought on by an infection of <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> and malnutrition. For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent to live with their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew. Charles Sr. was by then a severe alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the <a href="National%20Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Children">National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</a>. Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> of the liver.

Hannah entered a period of remission but, in May 1903, became ill again. Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she was sent back to Cane Hill. He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until Sydney – who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier – returned. Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later, but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. "There was nothing we could do but accept poor mother's fate", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.

Between his time in the poor schools and his mother succumbing to mental illness, Chaplin began to perform on stage. He later recalled making his first amateur appearance at the age of five years, when he took over from Hannah one night in <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a>. This was an isolated occurrence, but by the time he was nine Chaplin had, with his mother's encouragement, grown interested in performing. He later wrote: "[she] imbued me with the feeling that I had some sort of talent". Through his father's connections, Chaplin became a member of the <a href="The%20Eight%20Lancashire%20Lads">Eight Lancashire Lads</a> <a href="Clog%20dance">clog-dancing</a> troupe, with whom he toured English music halls throughout 1899 and 1900. Chaplin worked hard, and the act was popular with audiences, but he was not satisfied with dancing and wished to form a comedy act.

In the years Chaplin was touring with the Eight Lancashire Lads, his mother ensured that he still attended school but, by age 13, he had abandoned education. He supported himself with a range of jobs, while nursing his ambition to become an actor. At 14, shortly after his mother's relapse, he registered with a theatrical agency in London's <a href="West%20End%20of%20London">West End</a>. The manager sensed potential in Chaplin, who was promptly given his first role as a newsboy in <a href="Harry%20Arthur%20Saintsbury">Harry Arthur Saintsbury</a>'s "Jim, a Romance of Cockayne". It opened in July 1903, but the show was unsuccessful and closed after two weeks. Chaplin's comic performance, however, was singled out for praise in many of the reviews.

Saintsbury secured a role for Chaplin in <a href="Charles%20Frohman">Charles Frohman</a>'s production of "<a href="Sherlock%20Holmes%20%28play%29">Sherlock Holmes</a>", where he played Billy the pageboy in three nationwide tours. His performance was so well received that he was called to London to play the role alongside <a href="William%20Gillette">William Gillette</a>, the original Holmes. "It was like tidings from heaven", Chaplin recalled. At 16 years old, Chaplin starred in the play's West End production at the <a href="Duke%20of%20York%27s%20Theatre">Duke of York's Theatre</a> from October to December 1905. He completed one final tour of "Sherlock Holmes" in early 1906, before leaving the play after more than two-and-a-half years.

Chaplin soon found work with a new company, and went on tour with his brother – who was also pursuing an acting career – in a <a href="Sketch%20comedy">comedy sketch</a> called "Repairs". In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus, where he developed popular <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> pieces and was soon the star of the show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer. He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.

Meanwhile, Sydney Chaplin had joined <a href="Fred%20Karno">Fred Karno</a>'s prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, he was one of their key performers. In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was initially wary, and considered Chaplin a "pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster" who "looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre." However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the <a href="London%20Coliseum">London Coliseum</a> and he was quickly signed to a contract. Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909. In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, "Jimmy the Fearless". It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.

Karno selected his new star to join the section of the company, one that also included <a href="Stan%20Laurel">Stan Laurel</a>, that toured North America's <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> circuit. The young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers, being described as "one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here". His most successful role was a drunk called the "Inebriate Swell", which drew him significant recognition. The tour lasted 21 months, and the troupe returned to England in June 1912. Chaplin recalled that he "had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing commonplaceness" and was, therefore, delighted when a new tour began in October.

Six months into the second American tour, Chaplin was invited to join the New York Motion Picture Company. A representative who had seen his performances thought he could replace <a href="Fred%20Mace">Fred Mace</a>, a star of their <a href="Keystone%20Studios">Keystone Studios</a> who intended to leave. Chaplin thought the Keystone comedies "a crude mélange of rough and rumble", but liked the idea of working in films and rationalised: "Besides, it would mean a new life." He met with the company and signed a $150-per-week contract in September 1913. Chaplin arrived in Los Angeles in early December, and began working for the Keystone studio on 5 January 1914.

Chaplin's boss was <a href="Mack%20Sennett">Mack Sennett</a>, who initially expressed concern that the 24-year-old looked too young. He was not used in a picture until late January, during which time Chaplin attempted to learn the processes of filmmaking. The <a href="Film%20reel">one-reeler</a> "<a href="Making%20a%20Living">Making a Living</a>" marked his film acting debut and was released on 2 February 1914. Chaplin strongly disliked the picture, but one review picked him out as "a comedian of the first water". For his second appearance in front of the camera, Chaplin selected the costume with which he became identified. He described the process in his autobiography:

The film was "<a href="Mabel%27s%20Strange%20Predicament">Mabel's Strange Predicament</a>", but "<a href="the%20Tramp">the Tramp</a>" character, as it became known, debuted to audiences in "<a href="Kid%20Auto%20Races%20at%20Venice">Kid Auto Races at Venice</a>" – shot later than "Mabel's Strange Predicament" but released two days earlier on 7 February 1914. Chaplin adopted the character as his screen persona and attempted to make suggestions for the films he appeared in. These ideas were dismissed by his directors. During the filming of his eleventh picture, "<a href="Mabel%20at%20the%20Wheel">Mabel at the Wheel</a>", he clashed with director <a href="Mabel%20Normand">Mabel Normand</a> and was almost released from his contract. Sennett kept him on, however, when he received orders from exhibitors for more Chaplin films. Sennett also allowed Chaplin to direct his next film himself after Chaplin promised to pay $1,500 ($ in dollars) if the film was unsuccessful.

"<a href="Caught%20in%20the%20Rain">Caught in the Rain</a>", issued 4 May 1914, was Chaplin's directorial debut and was highly successful. Thereafter he directed almost every short film in which he appeared for Keystone, at the rate of approximately one per week, a period which he later remembered as the most exciting time of his career. Chaplin's films introduced a slower form of comedy than the typical Keystone farce, and he developed a large fan base. In November 1914, he had a supporting role in the first <a href="feature%20length">feature length</a> comedy film, "<a href="Tillie%27s%20Punctured%20Romance%20%281914%20film%29">Tillie's Punctured Romance</a>", directed by Sennett and starring <a href="Marie%20Dressler">Marie Dressler</a>, which was a commercial success and increased his popularity. When Chaplin's contract came up for renewal at the end of the year, he asked for $1,000 a week ($ in dollars) – an amount Sennett refused as too large.

The <a href="Essanay%20Studios">Essanay Film Manufacturing Company</a> of Chicago sent Chaplin an offer of $1,250 a week with a signing bonus of $10,000. He joined the studio in late December 1914, where he began forming a stock company of regular players, including <a href="Leo%20White">Leo White</a>, <a href="Bud%20Jamison">Bud Jamison</a>, Paddy McGuire and Billy Armstrong. He soon recruited a leading lady – <a href="Edna%20Purviance">Edna Purviance</a>, whom Chaplin met in a cafe and hired on account of her beauty. She went on to appear in 35 films with Chaplin over eight years; the pair also formed a romantic relationship that lasted into 1917.

Chaplin asserted a high level of control over his pictures and started to put more time and care into each film. There was a month-long interval between the release of his second production, "<a href="A%20Night%20Out%20%281915%20film%29">A Night Out</a>", and his third, "<a href="The%20Champion%20%281915%20film%29">The Champion</a>". The final seven of Chaplin's 14 Essanay films were all produced at this slower pace. Chaplin also began to alter his screen persona, which had attracted some criticism at Keystone for its "mean, crude, and brutish" nature. The character became more gentle and romantic; "<a href="The%20Tramp%20%28film%29">The Tramp</a>" (April 1915) was considered a particular turning point in his development. The use of pathos was developed further with "<a href="The%20Bank%20%281915%20film%29">The Bank</a>", in which Chaplin created a sad ending. Robinson notes that this was an innovation in comedy films, and marked the time when serious critics began to appreciate Chaplin's work. At Essanay, writes film scholar <a href="Simon%20Louvish">Simon Louvish</a>, Chaplin "found the themes and the settings that would define the Tramp's world."

During 1915, Chaplin became a cultural phenomenon. Shops were stocked with Chaplin merchandise, he was featured in cartoons and comic strips, and several songs were written about him. In July, a journalist for "<a href="Motion%20Picture%20Magazine">Motion Picture Magazine</a>" wrote that "Chaplinitis" had spread across America. As his fame grew worldwide, he became the film industry's first international star. When the Essanay contract ended in December 1915, Chaplin – fully aware of his popularity – requested a $150,000 signing bonus from his next studio. He received several offers, including <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal</a>, <a href="Fox%20Film">Fox</a>, and <a href="Vitagraph%20Studios">Vitagraph</a>, the best of which came from the <a href="Mutual%20Film">Mutual Film Corporation</a> at $10,000 a week.

A contract was negotiated with Mutual that amounted to $670,000 a year ($ million today), which Robinson says made Chaplin – at 26 years old – one of the highest paid people in the world. The high salary shocked the public and was widely reported in the press. John R. Freuler, the studio president, explained: "We can afford to pay Mr. Chaplin this large sum annually because the public wants Chaplin and will pay for him."

Mutual gave Chaplin his own Los Angeles studio to work in, which opened in March 1916. He added two key members to his stock company, <a href="Albert%20Austin">Albert Austin</a> and <a href="Eric%20Campbell%20%28actor%29">Eric Campbell</a>, and produced a series of elaborate two-reelers: "<a href="The%20Floorwalker">The Floorwalker</a>", "<a href="The%20Fireman%20%281916%20film%29">The Fireman</a>", "<a href="The%20Vagabond%20%28film%29">The Vagabond</a>", "<a href="One%20A.M.%20%281916%20film%29">One A.M.</a>", and "<a href="The%20Count%20%28film%29">The Count</a>". For "<a href="The%20Pawnshop">The Pawnshop</a>", he recruited the actor <a href="Henry%20Bergman">Henry Bergman</a>, who was to work with Chaplin for 30 years. "<a href="Behind%20the%20Screen">Behind the Screen</a>" and "<a href="The%20Rink%20%28film%29">The Rink</a>" completed Chaplin's releases for 1916. The Mutual contract stipulated that he release a two-reel film every four weeks, which he had managed to achieve. With the new year, however, Chaplin began to demand more time. He made only four more films for Mutual over the first ten months of 1917: "<a href="Easy%20Street%20%28film%29">Easy Street</a>", "<a href="The%20Cure%20%281917%20film%29">The Cure</a>", "<a href="The%20Immigrant%20%281917%20film%29">The Immigrant</a>", and "<a href="The%20Adventurer%20%281917%20film%29">The Adventurer</a>". With their careful construction, these films are considered by Chaplin scholars to be among his finest work. Later in life, Chaplin referred to his Mutual years as the happiest period of his career. However, Chaplin also felt that those films became increasingly formulaic over the period of the contract and he was increasingly dissatisfied with the working conditions encouraging that.
Chaplin was attacked in the British media for not fighting in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. He defended himself, claiming that he would fight for Britain if called and had registered for the American draft, but he was not summoned by either country. Despite this criticism Chaplin was a favourite with the troops, and his popularity continued to grow worldwide. "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>" reported that the name of Charlie Chaplin was "a part of the common language of almost every country", and that the Tramp image was "universally familiar". In 1917, professional Chaplin imitators were so widespread that he took legal action, and it was reported that nine out of ten men who attended costume parties dressed as the Tramp. The same year, a study by the <a href="Boston%20Society%20for%20Psychical%20Research">Boston Society for Psychical Research</a> concluded that Chaplin was "an American obsession". The actress <a href="Minnie%20Maddern%20Fiske">Minnie Maddern Fiske</a> wrote that "a constantly increasing body of cultured, artistic people are beginning to regard the young English buffoon, Charles Chaplin, as an extraordinary artist, as well as a comic genius".

In January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian <a href="Harry%20Lauder">Harry Lauder</a>, and the two acted in a short film together.

Mutual was patient with Chaplin's decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press, "Charlie [must] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing [films] the way he wants ... It is quality, not quantity, we are after." In June 1917, Chaplin signed to complete eight films for <a href="First%20National%20Pictures">First National Exhibitors' Circuit</a> in return for $1 million ($ million today). He chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off <a href="Sunset%20Boulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a>, with production facilities of the highest order. It was completed in January 1918, and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures.

"<a href="A%20Dog%27s%20Life">A Dog's Life</a>", released April 1918, was the first film under the new contract. In it, Chaplin demonstrated his increasing concern with story construction and his treatment of the Tramp as "a sort of <a href="Pierrot">Pierrot</a>". The film was described by <a href="Louis%20Delluc">Louis Delluc</a> as "cinema's first total work of art". Chaplin then embarked on the <a href="Liberty%20bond%23Sales%20difficulties%20and%20the%20subsequent%20campaign">Third Liberty Bond</a> campaign, touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the First World War. He also produced a short <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> film at his own expense, donated to the government for fund-raising, called "<a href="The%20Bond">The Bond</a>". Chaplin's next release was war-based, placing the Tramp in the trenches for "<a href="Shoulder%20Arms">Shoulder Arms</a>". Associates warned him against making a comedy about the war but, as he later recalled: "Dangerous or not, the idea excited me." He spent four months filming the 45-minute-long picture, which was released in October 1918 with great success.

After the release of "Shoulder Arms", Chaplin requested more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and <a href="Famous%20Players-Lasky">Famous Players-Lasky</a>, Chaplin joined forces with <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a>, <a href="Mary%20Pickford">Mary Pickford</a>, and <a href="D.%20W.%20Griffith">D. W. Griffith</a> to form a new distribution company – <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a>, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with the new company and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They refused and insisted that he complete the final six films owed.

Before the creation of United Artists, Chaplin married for the first time. The 16-year-old actress <a href="Mildred%20Harris">Mildred Harris</a> had revealed that she was pregnant with his child, and in September 1918, he married her quietly in Los Angeles to avoid controversy. Soon after, the pregnancy was found to be false. Chaplin was unhappy with the union and, feeling that marriage stunted his creativity, struggled over the production of his film "<a href="Sunnyside%20%28film%29">Sunnyside</a>". Harris was by then legitimately pregnant, and on 7 July 1919, gave birth to a son. Norman Spencer Chaplin was born malformed and died three days later. The marriage ended in April 1920, with Chaplin explaining in his autobiography that they were "irreconcilably mismated".

Losing the child, plus his own childhood experiences, are thought to have influenced Chaplin's film, which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy. For this new venture, Chaplin also wished to do more than comedy and, according to Louvish, "make his mark on a changed world." Filming on "<a href="The%20Kid%20%281921%20film%29">The Kid</a>" began in August 1919, with four-year-old <a href="Jackie%20Coogan">Jackie Coogan</a> his co-star. "The Kid" was in production for nine months until May 1920 and, at 68 minutes, it was Chaplin's longest picture to date. Dealing with issues of poverty and parent–child separation, "The Kid" was one of the earliest films to combine comedy and drama. It was released in January 1921 with instant success, and, by 1924, had been screened in over 50 countries.

Chaplin spent five months on his next film, the two-reeler "<a href="The%20Idle%20Class">The Idle Class</a>". Following its September 1921 release, he chose to return to England for the first time in almost a decade. He then worked to fulfil his First National contract, releasing "<a href="Pay%20Day%20%281922%20film%29">Pay Day</a>" in February 1922. "<a href="The%20Pilgrim%20%281923%20film%29">The Pilgrim</a>" – his final short film – was delayed by distribution disagreements with the studio, and released a year later.

Having fulfilled his First National contract, Chaplin was free to make his first picture as an independent producer. In November 1922, he began filming "<a href="A%20Woman%20of%20Paris">A Woman of Paris</a>", a romantic drama about ill-fated lovers. Chaplin intended it to be a star-making vehicle for Edna Purviance, and did not appear in the picture himself other than in a brief, uncredited cameo. He wished the film to have a realistic feel and directed his cast to give restrained performances. In real life, he explained, "men and women try to hide their emotions rather than seek to express them". "A Woman of Paris" premiered in September 1923 and was acclaimed for its innovative, subtle approach. The public, however, seemed to have little interest in a Chaplin film without Chaplin, and it was a <a href="box%20office%20bomb">box office disappointment</a>. The filmmaker was hurt by this failure – he had long wanted to produce a dramatic film and was proud of the result – and soon withdrew "A Woman of Paris" from circulation.

Chaplin returned to comedy for his next project. Setting his standards high, he told himself "This next film must be an epic! The Greatest!" Inspired by a photograph of the 1898 <a href="Klondike%20Gold%20Rush">Klondike Gold Rush</a>, and later the story of the <a href="Donner%20Party">Donner Party</a> of 1846–47, he made what Geoffrey Macnab calls "an epic comedy out of grim subject matter." In "<a href="The%20Gold%20Rush">The Gold Rush</a>", the Tramp is a lonely <a href="prospecting">prospector</a> fighting adversity and looking for love. With <a href="Georgia%20Hale">Georgia Hale</a> as his new leading lady, Chaplin began filming the picture in February 1924. Its elaborate production, costing almost $1 million, included <a href="location%20shooting">location shooting</a> in the <a href="Truckee%20Range">Truckee mountains</a> in <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> with 600 extras, extravagant sets, and <a href="special%20effect">special effect</a>s. The last scene was shot May 1925 after 15 months of filming.

Chaplin felt "The Gold Rush" was the best film he had made. It opened in August 1925 and became one of the highest-grossing films of the silent era with a U.S. box-office of $5 million. The comedy contains some of Chaplin's most famous sequences, such as the Tramp eating his shoe and the "Dance of the Rolls". Macnab has called it "the quintessential Chaplin film". Chaplin stated at its release, "This is the picture that I want to be remembered by".

While making "The Gold Rush", Chaplin married for the second time. Mirroring the circumstances of his first union, <a href="Lita%20Grey">Lita Grey</a> was a teenage actress, originally set to star in the film, whose surprise announcement of pregnancy forced Chaplin into marriage. She was 16 and he was 35, meaning Chaplin could have been charged with <a href="statutory%20rape">statutory rape</a> under California law. He therefore arranged a discreet marriage in Mexico on 25 November 1924. Their first son, <a href="Charles%20Chaplin%20Jr.">Charles Spencer Chaplin, Jr.</a>, was born on 5 May 1925, followed by <a href="Sydney%20Chaplin%20%28American%20actor%29">Sydney Earl Chaplin</a> on 30 March 1926.

It was an unhappy marriage, and Chaplin spent long hours at the studio to avoid seeing his wife. In November 1926, Grey took the children and left the family home. A bitter divorce followed, in which Grey's application – accusing Chaplin of infidelity, abuse, and of harbouring "perverted sexual desires" – was leaked to the press. Chaplin was reported to be in a state of nervous breakdown, as the story became headline news and groups formed across America calling for his films to be banned. Eager to end the case without further scandal, Chaplin's lawyers agreed to a cash settlement of $600,000the largest awarded by American courts at that time. His fan base was strong enough to survive the incident, and it was soon forgotten, but Chaplin was deeply affected by it.

Before the divorce suit was filed, Chaplin had begun work on a new film, "<a href="The%20Circus%20%28film%29">The Circus</a>". He built a story around the idea of walking a tightrope while besieged by monkeys, and turned the Tramp into the accidental star of a circus. Filming was suspended for 10 months while he dealt with the divorce scandal, and it was generally a trouble-ridden production. Finally completed in October 1927, "The Circus" was released in January 1928 to a positive reception. At the <a href="1st%20Academy%20Awards">1st Academy Awards</a>, Chaplin was given a special trophy "For versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing and producing "The Circus"". Despite its success, he permanently associated the film with the stress of its production; Chaplin omitted "The Circus" from his autobiography, and struggled to work on it when he recorded the score in his later years.

By the time "The Circus" was released, Hollywood had witnessed the introduction of <a href="sound%20film">sound film</a>s. Chaplin was cynical about this new medium and the technical shortcomings it presented, believing that "talkies" lacked the artistry of silent films. He was also hesitant to change the formula that had brought him such success, and feared that giving the Tramp a voice would limit his international appeal. He, therefore, rejected the new Hollywood craze and began work on a new silent film. Chaplin was nonetheless anxious about this decision and remained so throughout the film's production.

When filming began at the end of 1928, Chaplin had been working on the story for almost a year. "<a href="City%20Lights">City Lights</a>" followed the Tramp's love for a blind flower girl (played by <a href="Virginia%20Cherrill">Virginia Cherrill</a>) and his efforts to raise money for her sight-saving operation. It was a challenging production that lasted 21 months, with Chaplin later confessing that he "had worked himself into a neurotic state of wanting perfection". One advantage Chaplin found in sound technology was the opportunity to record a musical score for the film, which he composed himself.

Chaplin finished editing "City Lights" in December 1930, by which time silent films were an anachronism. A preview before an unsuspecting public audience was not a success, but a showing for the press produced positive reviews. One journalist wrote, "Nobody in the world but Charlie Chaplin could have done it. He is the only person that has that peculiar something called 'audience appeal' in sufficient quality to defy the popular penchant for movies that talk." Given its general release in January 1931, "City Lights" proved to be a popular and financial success – eventually grossing over $3 million. The <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> cites it as Chaplin's finest accomplishment, and the critic <a href="James%20Agee">James Agee</a> hails the closing scene as "the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies". "City Lights" became Chaplin's personal favourite of his films and remained so throughout his life.

"City Lights" had been a success, but Chaplin was unsure if he could make another picture without dialogue. He remained convinced that sound would not work in his films, but was also "obsessed by a depressing fear of being old-fashioned." In this state of uncertainty, early in 1931, the comedian decided to take a holiday and ended up travelling for 16 months. He spent months travelling Western Europe, including extended stays in France and Switzerland, and spontaneously decided to visit Japan. The day after he arrived in Japan, Prime Minister <a href="Inukai%20Tsuyoshi">Inukai Tsuyoshi</a> was assassinated by ultra-nationalists in the <a href="May%2015%20Incident">May 15 Incident</a>. The group's original plan had been to provoke a war with the United States by assassinating Chaplin at a welcome reception organised by the prime minister, but the plan had been foiled due to delayed public announcement of the event's date.

In his autobiography, Chaplin recalled that on his return to Los Angeles, "I was confused and without plan, restless and conscious of an extreme loneliness". He briefly considered retiring and moving to China. Chaplin's loneliness was relieved when he met 21-year-old actress <a href="Paulette%20Goddard">Paulette Goddard</a> in July 1932, and the pair began a relationship. He was not ready to commit to a film, however, and focused on writing a <a href="Serial%20%28literature%29">serial</a> about his travels (published in "<a href="Woman%27s%20Home%20Companion">Woman's Home Companion</a>"). The trip had been a stimulating experience for Chaplin, including meetings with several prominent thinkers, and he became increasingly interested in world affairs. The state of labour in America troubled him, and he feared that capitalism and machinery in the workplace would increase unemployment levels. It was these concerns that stimulated Chaplin to develop his new film.

"<a href="Modern%20Times%20%28film%29">Modern Times</a>" was announced by Chaplin as "a satire on certain phases of our industrial life." Featuring the Tramp and Goddard as they endure the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, it took ten and a half months to film. Chaplin intended to use spoken dialogue but changed his mind during rehearsals. Like its predecessor, "Modern Times" employed sound effects but almost no speaking. Chaplin's performance of a gibberish song did, however, give the Tramp a voice for the only time on film. After recording the music, Chaplin released "Modern Times" in February 1936. It was his first feature in 15 years to adopt political references and social realism, a factor that attracted considerable press coverage despite Chaplin's attempts to downplay the issue. The film earned less at the box-office than his previous features and received mixed reviews, as some viewers disliked the politicising. Today, "Modern Times" is seen by the British Film Institute as one of Chaplin's "great features," while David Robinson says it shows the filmmaker at "his unrivalled peak as a creator of visual comedy."

Following the release of "Modern Times", Chaplin left with Goddard for a trip to the Far East. The couple had refused to comment on the nature of their relationship, and it was not known whether they were married or not. Some time later, Chaplin revealed that they married in <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a> during this trip. By 1938, the couple had drifted apart, as both focused heavily on their work, although Goddard was again his leading lady in his next feature film, "The Great Dictator". She eventually divorced Chaplin in Mexico in 1942, citing incompatibility and separation for more than a year.

The 1940s saw Chaplin face a series of controversies, both in his work and in his personal life, which changed his fortunes and severely affected his popularity in the United States. The first of these was his growing boldness in expressing his political beliefs. Deeply disturbed by the <a href="Para-fascism">surge of militaristic nationalism</a> in 1930s world politics, Chaplin found that he could not keep these issues out of his work. Parallels between himself and <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> had been widely noted: the pair were born four days apart, both had risen from poverty to world prominence, and Hitler wore the same <a href="toothbrush%20moustache">toothbrush moustache</a> as Chaplin. It was this physical resemblance that supplied the plot for Chaplin's next film, "<a href="The%20Great%20Dictator">The Great Dictator</a>", which directly satirised Hitler and attacked fascism.

Chaplin spent two years developing the script, and began filming in September 1939 – six days after Britain declared war on Germany. He had submitted to using spoken dialogue, partly out of acceptance that he had no other choice, but also because he recognised it as a better method for delivering a political message. Making a comedy about Hitler was seen as highly controversial, but Chaplin's financial independence allowed him to take the risk. "I was determined to go ahead," he later wrote, "for Hitler must be laughed at." Chaplin replaced the Tramp (while wearing similar attire) with "A Jewish Barber", a reference to the Nazi party's belief that he was Jewish. In a dual performance, he also played the dictator "Adenoid Hynkel", who parodied Hitler.

"The Great Dictator" spent a year in production and was released in October 1940. The film generated a vast amount of publicity, with a critic for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" calling it "the most eagerly awaited picture of the year", and it was one of the biggest money-makers of the era. The ending was unpopular, however, and generated controversy. Chaplin concluded the film with a five-minute speech in which he abandoned his barber character, looked directly into the camera, and pleaded against war and fascism. Charles J. Maland has identified this overt preaching as triggering a decline in Chaplin's popularity, and writes, "Henceforth, no movie fan would ever be able to separate the dimension of politics from [his] star image". "The Great Dictator" received five Academy Award nominations, including <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Screenplay">Best Original Screenplay</a> and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a>.

In the mid-1940s, Chaplin was involved in a series of trials that occupied most of his time and significantly affected his public image. The troubles stemmed from his affair with an aspirant actress named <a href="Joan%20Barry%20%28American%20actress%29">Joan Barry</a>, with whom he was involved intermittently between June 1941 and the autumn of 1942. Barry, who displayed obsessive behaviour and was twice arrested after they separated, reappeared the following year and announced that she was pregnant with Chaplin's child. As Chaplin denied the claim, Barry filed a <a href="paternity%20suit">paternity suit</a> against him.

The director of the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI), <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a>, who had long been suspicious of Chaplin's political leanings, used the opportunity to generate negative publicity about him. As part of a <a href="smear%20campaign">smear campaign</a> to damage Chaplin's image, the FBI named him in four <a href="indictment">indictment</a>s related to the Barry case. Most serious of these was an alleged violation of the <a href="Mann%20Act">Mann Act</a>, which prohibits the transportation of women across state boundaries for sexual purposes. The historian <a href="Otto%20Friedrich">Otto Friedrich</a> has called this an "absurd prosecution" of an "ancient statute", yet if Chaplin was found guilty, he faced 23 years in jail. Three charges lacked sufficient evidence to proceed to court, but the Mann Act trial began on 21 March 1944. Chaplin was <a href="acquittal">acquitted</a> two weeks later, on 4 April. The case was frequently headline news, with "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" calling it the "biggest public relations scandal since the <a href="Roscoe%20Arbuckle">Fatty Arbuckle</a> murder trial in 1921."

Barry's child, Carol Ann, was born in October 1944, and the paternity suit went to court in February 1945. After two arduous trials, in which the prosecuting lawyer accused him of "<a href="moral%20turpitude">moral turpitude</a>", Chaplin was declared to be the father. Evidence from blood tests which indicated otherwise were not admissible, and the judge ordered Chaplin to pay child support until Carol Ann turned 21. Media coverage of the paternity suit was influenced by the FBI, as information was fed to the prominent gossip columnist <a href="Hedda%20Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a>, and Chaplin was portrayed in an overwhelmingly critical light.

The controversy surrounding Chaplin increased when, two weeks after the paternity suit was filed, it was announced that he had married his newest <a href="prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9e">protégée</a>, 18-year-old <a href="Oona%20O%27Neill">Oona O'Neill</a> – daughter of the American playwright <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a>. Chaplin, then 54, had been introduced to her by a film agent seven months earlier. In his autobiography, Chaplin described meeting O'Neill as "the happiest event of my life", and claimed to have found "perfect love". Chaplin's son, Charles Jr., reported that Oona "worshipped" his father. The couple remained married until Chaplin's death, and had eight children over 18 years: <a href="Geraldine%20Chaplin">Geraldine Leigh</a> (b. July 1944), <a href="Michael%20Chaplin%20%28actor%29">Michael John</a> (b. March 1946), <a href="Josephine%20Chaplin">Josephine Hannah</a> (b. March 1949), <a href="Victoria%20Chaplin">Victoria</a> (b. May 1951), <a href="Eugene%20Chaplin">Eugene Anthony</a> (b. August 1953), Jane Cecil (b. May 1957), Annette Emily (b. December 1959), and <a href="Christopher%20Chaplin">Christopher James</a> (b. July 1962).

Chaplin claimed that the Barry trials had "crippled [his] creativeness", and it was some time before he began working again. In April 1946, he finally began filming a project that had been in development since 1942. "<a href="Monsieur%20Verdoux">Monsieur Verdoux</a>" was a <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a>, the story of a French bank clerk, Verdoux (Chaplin), who loses his job and begins marrying and murdering wealthy widows to support his family. Chaplin's inspiration for the project came from <a href="Orson%20Welles">Orson Welles</a>, who wanted him to star in a film about the French <a href="serial%20killer">serial killer</a> <a href="Henri%20D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Landru">Henri Désiré Landru</a>. Chaplin decided that the concept would "make a wonderful comedy", and paid Welles $5,000 for the idea.

Chaplin again vocalised his political views in "Monsieur Verdoux", criticising <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a> and arguing that the world encourages mass killing through wars and <a href="Weapon%20of%20mass%20destruction">weapons of mass destruction</a>. Because of this, the film met with controversy when it was released in April 1947; Chaplin was booed at the premiere, and there were calls for a boycott. "Monsieur Verdoux" was the first Chaplin release that failed both critically and commercially in the United States. It was more successful abroad, and Chaplin's screenplay was nominated at the <a href="20th%20Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>. He was proud of the film, writing in his autobiography, ""Monsieur Verdoux" is the cleverest and most brilliant film I have yet made."

The negative reaction to "Monsieur Verdoux" was largely the result of changes in Chaplin's public image. Along with damage of the Joan Barry scandal, he was publicly accused of being a <a href="communist">communist</a>. His political activity had heightened during World War II, when he campaigned for the opening of a Second Front to help the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> and supported various Soviet–American friendship groups. He was also friendly with several suspected communists, and attended functions given by Soviet diplomats in Los Angeles. In the political climate of 1940s America, such activities meant Chaplin was considered, as Larcher writes, "dangerously <a href="progressivism">progressive</a> and amoral." The FBI wanted him out of the country, and launched an official investigation in early 1947.

Chaplin denied being a communist, instead calling himself a "peacemonger", but felt the government's effort to suppress the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a>. Unwilling to be quiet about the issue, he openly protested against the trials of <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">Communist Party</a> members and the activities of the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>. Chaplin received a <a href="subpoena">subpoena</a> to appear before HUAC but was not called to testify. As his activities were widely reported in the press, and <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> fears grew, questions were raised over his failure to take American citizenship. Calls were made for him to be deported; in one extreme and widely published example, Representative <a href="John%20E.%20Rankin">John E. Rankin</a>, who helped establish HUAC, told <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> in June 1947: "[Chaplin's] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America. [If he is deported] ... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. He should be deported and gotten rid of at once."

Although Chaplin remained politically active in the years following the failure of "Monsieur Verdoux", his next film, about a forgotten vaudeville comedian and a young ballerina in <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian</a> London, was devoid of political themes. "<a href="Limelight%20%281952%20film%29">Limelight</a>" was heavily autobiographical, alluding not only to Chaplin's childhood and the lives of his parents, but also to his loss of popularity in the United States. The cast included various members of his family, including his five oldest children and his half-brother, Wheeler Dryden.

Filming began in November 1951, by which time Chaplin had spent three years working on the story. He aimed for a more serious tone than any of his previous films, regularly using the word "melancholy" when explaining his plans to his co-star <a href="Claire%20Bloom">Claire Bloom</a>. "Limelight" featured a cameo appearance from <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a>, whom Chaplin cast as his stage partner in a pantomime scene. This marked the only time the comedians worked together.

Chaplin decided to hold the world premiere of "Limelight" in London, since it was the setting of the film. As he left Los Angeles, he expressed a premonition that he would not be returning. At New York, he boarded the with his family on 18 September 1952. The next day, <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">attorney general</a> <a href="James%20P.%20McGranery">James P. McGranery</a> revoked Chaplin's <a href="re-entry%20permit">re-entry permit</a> and stated that he would have to submit to an interview concerning his political views and moral behaviour in order to re-enter the US. Although McGranery told the press that he had "a pretty good case against Chaplin", Maland has concluded, on the basis of the FBI files that were released in the 1980s, that the US government had no real evidence to prevent Chaplin's re-entry. It is likely that he would have gained entry if he had applied for it. However, when Chaplin received a cablegram informing him of the news, he privately decided to cut his ties with the United States:

Because all of his property remained in America, Chaplin refrained from saying anything negative about the incident to the press. The scandal attracted vast attention, but Chaplin and his film were warmly received in Europe. In America, the hostility towards him continued, and, although it received some positive reviews, "Limelight" was subjected to a wide-scale boycott. Reflecting on this, Maland writes that Chaplin's fall, from an "unprecedented" level of popularity, "may be the most dramatic in the history of stardom in America".

Chaplin did not attempt to return to the United States after his re-entry permit was revoked, and instead sent his wife to settle his affairs. The couple decided to settle in Switzerland and, in January 1953, the family moved into their permanent home: <a href="Manoir%20de%20Ban">Manoir de Ban</a>, a estate overlooking <a href="Lake%20Geneva">Lake Geneva</a> in <a href="Corsier-sur-Vevey">Corsier-sur-Vevey</a>. Chaplin put his Beverly Hills house and studio up for sale in March, and surrendered his re-entry permit in April. The next year, his wife renounced her US citizenship and became a British citizen. Chaplin severed the last of his professional ties with the United States in 1955, when he sold the remainder of his stock in United Artists, which had been in financial difficulty since the early 1940s.

Chaplin remained a controversial figure throughout the 1950s, especially after he was awarded the <a href="World%20Peace%20Council%20prizes">International Peace Prize</a> by the communist-led <a href="World%20Peace%20Council">World Peace Council</a>, and after his meetings with <a href="Zhou%20Enlai">Zhou Enlai</a> and <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>. He began developing his first European film, "<a href="A%20King%20in%20New%20York">A King in New York</a>", in 1954. Casting himself as an exiled king who seeks asylum in the United States, Chaplin included several of his recent experiences in the screenplay. His son, Michael, was cast as a boy whose parents are targeted by the FBI, while Chaplin's character faces accusations of communism. The political satire parodied HUAC and attacked elements of 1950s culture – including consumerism, plastic surgery, and wide-screen cinema. In a review, the playwright <a href="John%20Osborne">John Osborne</a> called it Chaplin's "most bitter" and "most openly personal" film.

Chaplin founded a new production company, Attica, and used <a href="Shepperton%20Studios">Shepperton Studios</a> for the shooting. Filming in England proved a difficult experience, as he was used to his own Hollywood studio and familiar crew, and no longer had limitless production time. According to Robinson, this had an effect on the quality of the film. "A King in New York" was released in September 1957, and received mixed reviews. Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in the United States. This severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe. "A King in New York" was not shown in America until 1973.

In the last two decades of his career, Chaplin concentrated on re-editing and scoring his old films for re-release, along with securing their ownership and distribution rights. In an interview he granted in 1959, the year of his 70th birthday, Chaplin stated that there was still "room for the Little Man in the atomic age". The first of these re-releases was "<a href="The%20Chaplin%20Revue">The Chaplin Revue</a>" (1959), which included new versions of "A Dog's Life", "Shoulder Arms", and "The Pilgrim".

In America, the political atmosphere began to change and attention was once again directed to Chaplin's films instead of his views. In July 1962, "The New York Times" published an editorial stating that "we do not believe the Republic would be in danger if yesterday's unforgotten little tramp were allowed to amble down the gangplank of a steamer or plane in an American port". The same month, Chaplin was invested with the <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a> of <a href="Doctor%20of%20Letters">Doctor of Letters</a> by the universities of <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> and <a href="Durham%20University">Durham</a>. In November 1963, the Plaza Theater in New York started a year-long series of Chaplin's films, including "Monsieur Verdoux" and "Limelight", which gained excellent reviews from American critics. September 1964 saw the release of Chaplin's memoirs, "<a href="My%20Autobiography%20%28Chaplin%29">My Autobiography</a>", which he had been working on since 1957. The 500-page book became a worldwide best-seller. It focused on his early years and personal life, and was criticised for lacking information on his film career. 

Shortly after the publication of his memoirs, Chaplin began work on "<a href="A%20Countess%20from%20Hong%20Kong">A Countess from Hong Kong</a>" (1967), a romantic comedy based on a script he had written for Paulette Goddard in the 1930s. Set on an ocean liner, it starred <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a> as an American ambassador and <a href="Sophia%20Loren">Sophia Loren</a> as a stowaway found in his cabin. The film differed from Chaplin's earlier productions in several aspects. It was his first to use <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a> and the <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> format, while he concentrated on directing and appeared on-screen only in a cameo role as a seasick steward. He also signed a deal with <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Pictures</a> and appointed his assistant, Jerome Epstein, as the producer. Chaplin was paid $600,000 director's fee as well as a percentage of the gross receipts. "A Countess from Hong Kong" premiered in January 1967, to unfavourable reviews, and was a box-office failure. Chaplin was deeply hurt by the negative reaction to the film, which turned out to be his last.

Chaplin suffered a series of minor strokes in the late 1960s, which marked the beginning of a slow decline in his health. Despite the setbacks, he was soon writing a new film script, "<a href="The%20Freak">The Freak</a>", a story of a winged girl found in South America, which he intended as a starring vehicle for his daughter, Victoria. His fragile health prevented the project from being realised. In the early 1970s, Chaplin concentrated on re-releasing his old films, including "The Kid" and "The Circus". In 1971, he was made a <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour</a> at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. The following year, he was honoured with a special award by the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a>.

In 1972, the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> offered Chaplin an Honorary Award, which Robinson sees as a sign that America "wanted to make amends". Chaplin was initially hesitant about accepting but decided to return to the US for the first time in 20 years. The visit attracted a large amount of press coverage and, at the Academy Awards gala, he was given a 12-minute standing ovation, the longest in the Academy's history. Visibly emotional, Chaplin accepted his award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century".

Although Chaplin still had plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s he was very frail. He experienced several further strokes, which made it difficult for him to communicate, and he had to use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, "My Life in Pictures" (1974) and scoring "A Woman of Paris" for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, "The Gentleman Tramp" (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the <a href="1975%20New%20Year%20Honours">1975 New Year Honours</a>, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.

By October 1977, Chaplin's health had declined to the point that he needed constant care. In the early morning of 25 December 1977, Chaplin died at home after suffering a stroke in his sleep. He was 88 years old. The funeral, on 27 December, was a small and private <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> ceremony, according to his wishes. Chaplin was interred in the Corsier-sur-Vevey cemetery. Among the film industry's tributes, director <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Clair">René Clair</a> wrote, "He was a monument of the cinema, of all countries and all times ... the most beautiful gift the cinema made to us." Actor <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> declared, "We were lucky to have lived in his time."

On 1 March 1978, Chaplin's coffin was dug up and stolen from its grave by two unemployed immigrants, Roman Wardas, from Poland, and Gantcho Ganev, from Bulgaria. The body was held for <a href="ransom">ransom</a> in an attempt to extort money from Oona Chaplin. The pair were caught in a large police operation in May, and Chaplin's coffin was found buried in a field in the nearby village of <a href="Noville%2C%20Switzerland">Noville</a>. It was re-interred in the Corsier cemetery surrounded by reinforced concrete.

Chaplin believed his first influence to be his mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting at the window and mimicking passers-by: "it was through watching her that I learned not only how to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people." Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a>, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like <a href="Dan%20Leno">Dan Leno</a>. Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his "training ground", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags. From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian <a href="Max%20Linder">Max Linder</a>, whose films he greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.

Chaplin never spoke more than cursorily about his filmmaking methods, claiming such a thing would be tantamount to a magician spoiling his own illusion. Little was known about his working process throughout his lifetime, but research from film historians – particularly the findings of <a href="Kevin%20Brownlow">Kevin Brownlow</a> and <a href="David%20Gill%20%28film%20historian%29">David Gill</a> that were presented in the three-part documentary "<a href="Unknown%20Chaplin">Unknown Chaplin</a>" (1983) – has since revealed his unique working method.

Until he began making spoken dialogue films with "The Great Dictator", Chaplin never shot from a completed script. Many of his early films began with only a vague premise – for example "Charlie enters a health spa" or "Charlie works in a pawn shop." He then had sets constructed and worked with his stock company to improvise gags and "business" using them, almost always working the ideas out on film. As ideas were accepted and discarded, a narrative structure would emerge, frequently requiring Chaplin to reshoot an already-completed scene that might have otherwise contradicted the story. From "A Woman of Paris" onward Chaplin began the filming process with a prepared plot, but Robinson writes that every film up to "Modern Times" "went through many metamorphoses and permutations before the story took its final form."

Producing films in this manner meant Chaplin took longer to complete his pictures than almost any other filmmaker at the time. If he was out of ideas, he often took a break from the shoot, which could last for days, while keeping the studio ready for when inspiration returned. Delaying the process further was Chaplin's rigorous perfectionism. According to his friend <a href="Ivor%20Montagu">Ivor Montagu</a>, "nothing but perfection would be right" for the filmmaker. Because he personally funded his films, Chaplin was at liberty to strive for this goal and shoot as many takes as he wished. The number was often excessive, for instance 53 takes for every finished take in "The Kid". For "The Immigrant", a 20 minute-short, Chaplin shot 40,000 feet of film – enough for a feature-length.

Describing his working method as "sheer perseverance to the point of madness", Chaplin would be completely consumed by the production of a picture. Robinson writes that even in Chaplin's later years, his work continued "to take precedence over everything and everyone else." The combination of story improvisation and relentless perfectionism – which resulted in days of effort and thousands of feet of film being wasted, all at enormous expense – often proved taxing for Chaplin who, in frustration, would lash out at his actors and crew.

Chaplin exercised complete control over his pictures, to the extent that he would act out the other roles for his cast, expecting them to imitate him exactly. He personally edited all of his films, trawling through the large amounts of footage to create the exact picture he wanted. As a result of his complete independence, he was identified by the film historian <a href="Andrew%20Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> as one of the first <a href="Auteurism">auteur</a> filmmakers. Chaplin did receive help, notably from his long-time cinematographer <a href="Roland%20Totheroh">Roland Totheroh</a>, brother Sydney Chaplin, and various <a href="assistant%20director">assistant director</a>s such as <a href="Harry%20Crocker">Harry Crocker</a> and <a href="Charles%20Reisner">Charles Reisner</a>.

While Chaplin's comedic style is broadly defined as <a href="slapstick">slapstick</a>, it is considered restrained and intelligent, with the film historian Philip Kemp describing his work as a mix of "deft, balletic physical comedy and thoughtful, situation-based gags". Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential, with more focus on developing the viewer's relationship to the characters. Unlike conventional slapstick comedies, Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin's films centre on the Tramp's attitude to the things happening to him: the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree, but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology. Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin's "quirky mannerisms" and "serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action" are other key aspects of his comedy, while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of <a href="In-camera%20effect">in-camera</a> trickery are also common features.

Chaplin's silent films typically follow the Tramp's efforts to survive in a hostile world. The character lives in poverty and is frequently treated badly, but remains kind and upbeat; defying his social position, he strives to be seen as a gentleman. As Chaplin said in 1925, "The whole point of the Little Fellow is that no matter how down on his ass he is, no matter how well the jackals succeed in tearing him apart, he's still a man of dignity." The Tramp defies authority figures and "gives as good as he gets", leading Robinson and Louvish to see him as a representative for the underprivileged – an "<a href="everyman">everyman</a> turned heroic saviour". Hansmeyer notes that several of Chaplin's films end with "the homeless and lonely Tramp [walking] optimistically ... into the sunset ... to continue his journey".

The infusion of <a href="pathos">pathos</a> is a well-known aspect of Chaplin's work, and Larcher notes his reputation for "[inducing] laughter and tears". Sentimentality in his films comes from a variety of sources, with Louvish pinpointing "personal failure, society's strictures, economic disaster, and the elements." Chaplin sometimes drew on tragic events when creating his films, as in the case of "The Gold Rush" (1925), which was inspired by the fate of the Donner Party. Constance B. Kuriyama has identified serious underlying themes in the early comedies, such as greed ("The Gold Rush") and loss ("The Kid"). Chaplin also touched on controversial issues: immigration ("The Immigrant", 1917); illegitimacy ("The Kid", 1921); and drug use ("Easy Street", 1917). He often explored these topics ironically, making comedy out of suffering.

Social commentary was a feature of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed a keen interest in economics and felt obliged to publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. "Modern Times" (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, "The Great Dictator" (1940) parodied <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> and ended in a speech against nationalism, "Monsieur Verdoux" (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and "A King in New York" (1957) attacked <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>.

Several of Chaplin's films incorporate autobiographical elements, and the psychologist <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> believed that Chaplin "always plays only himself as he was in his dismal youth". "The Kid" is thought to reflect Chaplin's childhood trauma of being sent into an orphanage, the main characters in "Limelight" (1952) contain elements from the lives of his parents, and "A King in New York" references Chaplin's experiences of being shunned by the United States. Many of his sets, especially in street scenes, bear a strong similarity to Kennington, where he grew up. <a href="Stephen%20M.%20Weissman">Stephen M. Weissman</a> has argued that Chaplin's problematic relationship with his mentally ill mother was often reflected in his female characters and the Tramp's desire to save them.

Regarding the structure of Chaplin's films, the scholar <a href="Gerald%20Mast">Gerald Mast</a> sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting, rather than having a tightly unified storyline. Visually, his films are simple and economic, with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage. His approach to filming was described by the art director <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Louri%C3%A9">Eugène Lourié</a>: "Chaplin did not think in 'artistic' images when he was shooting. He believed that action is the main thing. The camera is there to photograph the actors". In his autobiography, Chaplin wrote, "Simplicity is best ... pompous effects slow up action, are boring and unpleasant ... The camera should not intrude." This approach has prompted criticism, since the 1940s, for being "old fashioned", while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium. Kamin, however, comments that Chaplin's comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an "ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium".

Chaplin developed a passion for music as a child and taught himself to play the piano, violin, and cello. He considered the musical accompaniment of a film to be important, and from "A Woman of Paris" onwards he took an increasing interest in this area. With the advent of sound technology, Chaplin began using a synchronised orchestral soundtrack – composed by himself – for "City Lights" (1931). He thereafter composed the scores for all of his films, and from the late 1950s to his death, he scored all of his silent features and some of his short films.

As Chaplin was not a trained musician, he could not read sheet music and needed the help of professional composers, such as <a href="David%20Raksin">David Raksin</a>, <a href="Raymond%20Rasch">Raymond Rasch</a> and <a href="Eric%20James%20%28arranger%29">Eric James</a>, when creating his scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as <a href="Alfred%20Newman%20%28composer%29">Alfred Newman</a> for "City Lights". Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him, Raksin – who worked with Chaplin on "Modern Times" – stressed Chaplin's creative position and active participation in the composing process. This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano. These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin. According to film historian <a href="Jeffrey%20Vance">Jeffrey Vance</a>, "although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent."

Chaplin's compositions produced three popular songs. "<a href="Smile%20%28Charlie%20Chaplin%20song%29">Smile</a>", composed originally for "Modern Times" (1936) and later set to lyrics by <a href="John%20Turner%20%28lyricist%29">John Turner</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20Parsons%20%28lyricist%29">Geoffrey Parsons</a>, was a hit for <a href="Nat%20King%20Cole">Nat King Cole</a> in 1954. For "Limelight", Chaplin composed "Terry's Theme", which was popularised by <a href="Jimmy%20Young%20%28broadcaster%29">Jimmy Young</a> as "<a href="Eternally%20%28Charles%20Chaplin%20song%29">Eternally</a>" (1952). Finally, "<a href="This%20Is%20My%20Song%20%281967%20song%29">This Is My Song</a>", performed by <a href="Petula%20Clark">Petula Clark</a> for "A Countess from Hong Kong" (1967), reached number one on the UK and other European charts. Chaplin also received his only competitive Oscar for his composition work, as the "Limelight" theme won an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Academy Award for Best Original Score</a> in 1973 following the film's re-release.

In 1998, the film critic <a href="Andrew%20Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> called Chaplin "arguably the single most important artist produced by the cinema, certainly its most extraordinary performer and probably still its most universal icon". He is described by the British Film Institute as "a towering figure in world culture", and was included in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine's list of the "" for the "laughter [he brought] to millions" and because he "more or less invented global recognizability and helped turn an industry into an art".

The image of the Tramp has become a part of cultural history; according to Simon Louvish, the character is recognisable to people who have never seen a Chaplin film, and in places where his films are never shown. The critic <a href="Leonard%20Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a> has written of the "unique" and "indelible" nature of the Tramp, and argued that no other comedian matched his "worldwide impact". Praising the character, <a href="Richard%20Schickel">Richard Schickel</a> suggests that Chaplin's films with the Tramp contain the most "eloquent, richly comedic expressions of the human spirit" in movie history. Memorabilia connected to the character still fetches large sums in auctions: in 2006 a bowler hat and a bamboo cane that were part of the Tramp's costume were bought for $140,000 in a Los Angeles auction.

As a filmmaker, Chaplin is considered a pioneer and one of the most influential figures of the early twentieth century. He is often credited as one of the medium's first artists. Film historian <a href="Mark%20Cousins%20%28film%20critic%29">Mark Cousins</a> has written that Chaplin "changed not only the imagery of cinema, but also its sociology and grammar" and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as <a href="D.%20W.%20Griffith">D.W. Griffith</a> was to drama. He was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to it. Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick, Chaplin's drama "A Woman of Paris" (1923) was a major influence on <a href="Ernst%20Lubitsch">Ernst Lubitsch</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Marriage%20Circle">The Marriage Circle</a>" (1924) and thus played a part in the development of "sophisticated comedy". According to David Robinson, Chaplin's innovations were "rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft." Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include <a href="Federico%20Fellini">Federico Fellini</a> (who called Chaplin "a sort of <a href="Adam">Adam</a>, from whom we are all descended"), <a href="Jacques%20Tati">Jacques Tati</a> ("Without him I would never have made a film"), René Clair ("He inspired practically every filmmaker"), <a href="Michael%20Powell">Michael Powell</a>, <a href="Billy%20Wilder">Billy Wilder</a>, <a href="Vittorio%20De%20Sica">Vittorio De Sica</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>. Russian filmmaker <a href="Andrei%20Tarkovsky">Andrei Tarkovsky</a> praised Chaplin as "the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old."

Chaplin also strongly influenced the work of later comedians. <a href="Marcel%20Marceau">Marcel Marceau</a> said he was inspired to become a mime artist after watching Chaplin, while the actor <a href="Raj%20Kapoor">Raj Kapoor</a> based his screen persona on the Tramp. Mark Cousins has also detected Chaplin's comedic style in the French character <a href="Monsieur%20Hulot">Monsieur Hulot</a> and the Italian character <a href="Tot%C3%B2">Totò</a>. In other fields, Chaplin helped inspire the cartoon characters <a href="Felix%20the%20Cat">Felix the Cat</a> and <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>, and was an influence on the <a href="Dada">Dada</a> art movement. As one of the founding members of United Artists, Chaplin also had a role in the development of the film industry. Gerald Mast has written that although UA never became a major company like <a href="MGM">MGM</a> or <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, the idea that directors could produce their own films was "years ahead of its time".

In the 21st century, several of Chaplin's films are still regarded as classics and among the greatest ever made. The 2012 "<a href="Sight%20%26amp%3B%20Sound">Sight & Sound</a>" poll, which compiles "top ten" ballots from film critics and directors to determine each group's most acclaimed films,
saw "City Lights" rank among the critics' top 50, "Modern Times" inside the top 100, and "The Great Dictator" and "The Gold Rush" placed in the top 250. The top 100 films as voted on by directors included "Modern Times" at number 22, "City Lights" at number 30, and "The Gold Rush" at number 91. Every one of Chaplin's features received a vote. In 2007, the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a> named "City Lights" the 11th <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Movies%20%2810th%20Anniversary%20Edition%29">greatest American film of all time</a>, while "The Gold Rush" and "Modern Times" again ranked in the top 100. Books about Chaplin continue to be published regularly, and he is a popular subject for media scholars and film archivists. Many of Chaplin's film have had a <a href="DVD">DVD</a> and <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-Ray</a> release.

Chaplin's final home, Manoir de Ban in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland, has been converted into a museum named "<a href="Chaplin%27s%20World">Chaplin's World</a>". It opened on 17 April 2016 after 15 years of development, and is described by <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> as "an interactive museum showcasing the life and works of Charlie Chaplin". On the 128th anniversary of his birth, a record-setting 662 people dressed as the Tramp in an event organised by the museum. Previously, the <a href="Museum%20of%20the%20Moving%20Image%20%28London%29">Museum of the Moving Image</a> in London held a permanent display on Chaplin, and hosted a dedicated exhibition to his life and career in 1988. The <a href="London%20Film%20Museum">London Film Museum</a> hosted an exhibition called "Charlie Chaplin – The Great Londoner", from 2010 until 2013.
In London, a statue of Chaplin as the Tramp, sculpted by <a href="John%20Doubleday">John Doubleday</a> and unveiled in 1981, is located in <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a>. The city also includes a road named after him in central London, "Charlie Chaplin Walk", which is the location of the <a href="BFI%20IMAX">BFI IMAX</a>. There are nine <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a>s memorialising Chaplin in London, Hampshire, and Yorkshire. The Swiss town of <a href="Vevey">Vevey</a> named a park in his honour in 1980 and erected a statue there in 1982. In 2011, two large murals depicting Chaplin on two 14-storey buildings were also unveiled in Vevey. Chaplin has also been honoured by the Irish town of <a href="Waterville%2C%20County%20Kerry">Waterville</a>, where he spent several summers with his family in the 1960s. A statue was erected in 1998; since 2011, the town has been host to the annual Charlie Chaplin Comedy Film Festival, which was founded to celebrate Chaplin's legacy and to showcase new comic talent.

In other tributes, a <a href="minor%20planet">minor planet</a>, <a href="3623%20Chaplin">3623 Chaplin</a> – discovered by <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> astronomer <a href="Lyudmila%20Karachkina">Lyudmila Karachkina</a> in 1981 – is named after Chaplin. Throughout the 1980s, the Tramp image was used by <a href="IBM">IBM</a> to advertise their personal computers. Chaplin's 100th birthday anniversary in 1989 was marked with several events around the world, and on 15 April 2011, a day before his 122nd birthday, <a href="Google">Google</a> celebrated him with a special <a href="Google%20Doodle">Google Doodle</a> video on its global and other country-wide homepages. Many countries, spanning six continents, have honoured Chaplin with a postal stamp.

Chaplin's legacy is managed on behalf of his children by the Chaplin office, located in Paris. The office represents Association Chaplin, founded by some of his children "to protect the name, image and moral rights" to his body of work, Roy Export SAS, which owns the copyright to most of his films made after 1918, and Bubbles Incorporated S.A., which owns the copyrights to his image and name. Their central archive is held at the archives of <a href="Montreux">Montreux</a>, Switzerland and scanned versions of its contents, including 83,630 images, 118 scripts, 976 manuscripts, 7,756 letters, and thousands of other documents, are available for research purposes at the Chaplin Research Centre at the <a href="Cineteca%20di%20Bologna">Cineteca di Bologna</a>. The photographic archive, which includes approximately 10,000 photographs from Chaplin's life and career, is kept at the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20de%20l%27%C3%89lys%C3%A9e">Musée de l'Elysée</a> in <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. The British Film Institute has also established the Charles Chaplin Research Foundation, and the first international Charles Chaplin Conference was held in London in July 2005.

Chaplin is the subject of a <a href="biographical%20film">biographical film</a>, "<a href="Chaplin%20%28film%29">Chaplin</a>" (1992) directed by <a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a>, and starring <a href="Robert%20Downey%20Jr.">Robert Downey Jr.</a> in the title role and Geraldine Chaplin playing Hannah Chaplin. He is also a character in the <a href="Historical%20period%20drama">period drama</a> film "<a href="The%20Cat%27s%20Meow">The Cat's Meow</a>" (2001), played by <a href="Eddie%20Izzard">Eddie Izzard</a>, and in the <a href="Television%20film">made-for-television movie</a> "<a href="The%20Scarlett%20O%27Hara%20War">The Scarlett O'Hara War</a>" (1980), played by <a href="Clive%20Revill">Clive Revill</a>. A television series about Chaplin's childhood, "Young Charlie Chaplin", ran on <a href="PBS">PBS</a> in 1989, and was nominated for an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Children's Program. The French film "<a href="The%20Price%20of%20Fame%20%28film%29">The Price of Fame</a>" (2014) is a fictionalized account of the robbery of Chaplin's grave.

Chaplin's life has also been the subject of several stage productions. Two musicals, "<a href="Little%20Tramp">Little Tramp</a>" and "<a href="Chaplin%20%281993%20musical%29">Chaplin</a>", were produced in the early 1990s. In 2006, <a href="Thomas%20Meehan%20%28writer%29">Thomas Meehan</a> and Christopher Curtis created another musical, "<a href="Chaplin%20%282006%20musical%29">Limelight: The Story of Charlie Chaplin</a>", which was first performed at the <a href="La%20Jolla%20Playhouse">La Jolla Playhouse</a> in San Diego in 2010. It was adapted for <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> two years later, re-titled "Chaplin – A Musical". Chaplin was portrayed by Robert McClure in both productions. In 2013, two plays about Chaplin premiered in <a href="Finland">Finland</a>: "Chaplin" at the <a href="Swedish%20Theatre">Svenska Teatern</a>, and "Kulkuri" ("The Tramp") at the <a href="Tampere%20Workers%27%20Theatre">Tampere Workers' Theatre</a>.

Chaplin has also been characterised in <a href="literary%20fiction">literary fiction</a>. He is the protagonist of <a href="Robert%20Coover">Robert Coover</a>'s short story "Charlie in the House of Rue" (1980; reprinted in Coover's 1987 collection "A Night at the Movies"), and of <a href="Glen%20David%20Gold">Glen David Gold</a>'s "<a href="Sunnyside%20%28novel%29">Sunnyside</a>" (2009), a <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a> set in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> period. A day in Chaplin's life in 1909 is dramatised in the chapter titled "Modern Times" in <a href="Alan%20Moore">Alan Moore</a>'s "<a href="Jerusalem%20%28Moore%20novel%29">Jerusalem</a>" (2016), a novel set in the author's home town of <a href="Northampton%2C%20England">Northampton, England</a>.

Chaplin received many awards and honours, especially later in life. In the <a href="1975%20New%20Year%20Honours">1975 New Year Honours</a>, he was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Most%20Excellent%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE). He was also awarded honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Letters">Doctor of Letters</a> degrees by the University of Oxford and the University of Durham in 1962. In 1965, he and <a href="Ingmar%20Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a> were joint winners of the <a href="Erasmus%20Prize">Erasmus Prize</a> and, in 1971, he was appointed a Commander of the National Order of the Legion of Honour by the French government.

From the film industry, Chaplin received a special <a href="Golden%20Lion">Golden Lion</a> at the Venice Film Festival in 1972, and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the <a href="Film%20Society%20of%20Lincoln%20Center">Lincoln Center Film Society</a> the same year. The latter has since been presented annually to filmmakers as The Chaplin Award. Chaplin was given a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 1972, having been previously excluded because of his political beliefs.

Chaplin received three <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>: an <a href="Academy%20Honorary%20Award">Honorary Award</a> for "versatility and genius in acting, writing, directing, and producing "The Circus"" in 1929, a second Honorary Award for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century" in 1972, and a <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Best Score</a> award in 1973 for "Limelight" (shared with Ray Rasch and Larry Russell).

The country is sometimes identified as West African and other times as Central African due to its strategic position at the crossroads between West and Central Africa.

French and English are the official languages of Cameroon. The country is often referred to as "Africa in miniature" for its geological and cultural diversity. Natural features include <a href="beaches">beaches</a>, <a href="deserts">deserts</a>, <a href="mountains">mountains</a>, <a href="rainforests">rainforests</a>, and <a href="savannas">savannas</a>.

After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the territory was divided between <a href="French%20Third%20Republic">France</a> and the <a href="British%20Empire">United Kingdom</a> as <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">League of Nations mandate</a>s. The <a href="Union%20of%20the%20Peoples%20of%20Cameroon">Union des Populations du Cameroun</a> (UPC) political party advocated independence, but was outlawed by France in the 1950s, leading to the <a href="Bamileke%20War">Bamileke War</a> fought between French and UPC militant forces until early 1971. In 1960, the French-administered part of Cameroon became independent as the Republic of Cameroun under President <a href="Ahmadou%20Ahidjo">Ahmadou Ahidjo</a>. The <a href="Southern%20Cameroons">southern part</a> of <a href="British%20Cameroons">British Cameroons</a> federated with it in 1961 to form the <a href="Federal%20republic">Federal Republic</a> of Cameroon. The federation was abandoned in 1972. The country was renamed the <a href="Unitary%20state">United Republic</a> of Cameroon in 1972 and the Republic of Cameroon in 1984. Large numbers of Cameroonians live as <a href="subsistence%20farmers">subsistence farmers</a>. Since 1982 <a href="Paul%20Biya">Paul Biya</a> has been President, governing with his <a href="Cameroon%20People%27s%20Democratic%20Movement">Cameroon People's Democratic Movement</a> party. The country has experienced tensions coming from the English-speaking territories. Politicians in the English-speaking regions have advocated for greater decentralisation and even complete separation or independence (as in the <a href="Southern%20Cameroons%20National%20Council">Southern Cameroons National Council</a>) from Cameroon. In 2017, tensions in the English-speaking territories escalated into <a href="Anglophone%20Crisis">open warfare</a>.

The territory of present-day Cameroon was first settled during the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> Era. The longest continuous inhabitants are groups such as the <a href="Baka%20%28Cameroon%20and%20Gabon%29">Baka</a> (<a href="Pygmy%20peoples">Pygmies</a>). From here, <a href="Bantu%20expansion">Bantu migrations</a> into eastern, southern, and central Africa are believed to have originated about 2,000 years ago. The <a href="Sao%20civilisation">Sao</a> culture arose around <a href="Lake%20Chad">Lake Chad</a>, c. 500 AD, and gave way to the <a href="Kanem%20Empire">Kanem</a> and its successor state, the <a href="Bornu%20Empire">Bornu Empire</a>. Kingdoms, <a href="fon%20%28Cameroon%29">fondoms</a>, and <a href="chiefdom">chiefdom</a>s arose in the west.

<a href="Portuguese%20discoveries">Portuguese sailors</a> reached the coast in 1472. They noted an abundance of the ghost shrimp "<a href="Lepidophthalmus%20turneranus">Lepidophthalmus turneranus</a>" in the <a href="Wouri%20River">Wouri River</a> and named it ("Shrimp River"), which became "Cameroon" in English. Over the following few centuries, European interests regularised trade with the coastal peoples, and Christian <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> pushed inland.

In the early 19th century, <a href="Modibo%20Adama">Modibo Adama</a> led <a href="Fula%20people">Fulani</a> soldiers on a <a href="jihad">jihad</a> in the north against non-Muslim and partially Muslim peoples and established the <a href="Adamawa%20Emirate">Adamawa Emirate</a>. Settled peoples who fled the Fulani caused a major redistribution of population.

The Bamum tribe have a writing system, known as <a href="Bamum%20script">Bamum script</a> or Shu Mom. The script was given to them by Sultan <a href="Ibrahim%20Njoya">Ibrahim Njoya</a> in 1896, and is taught in Cameroon by the <a href="Bamum%20Scripts%20and%20Archives%20Project">Bamum Scripts and Archives Project</a>. <a href="Germany">Germany</a> began to establish roots in Cameroon in 1868 when the Woermann Company of Hamburg built a warehouse. It was built on the estuary of the Wouri River. Later Gustav Nachtigal made a treaty with one of the local kings to annex the region for the German emperor. The <a href="German%20Empire">German Empire</a> claimed the territory as the colony of <a href="Kamerun">Kamerun</a> in 1884 and began a steady push inland. The Germans ran into resistance with the native people who did not want the Germans to establish themselves on this land. Under the influence of Germany, commercial companies were left to regulate local administrations. These concessions used forced labour of the Africans to make a profit. The labour was used on banana, rubber, palm oil, and cocoa plantations. They initiated projects to improve the colony's infrastructure, relying on a harsh system of <a href="unfree%20labour">forced labour</a>, which was much criticised by the other colonial powers.

With the defeat of Germany in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Kamerun became a <a href="League%20of%20Nations%20mandate">League of Nations mandate</a> territory and was split into <a href="French%20Cameroons">French Cameroons</a> and <a href="British%20Cameroons">British Cameroons</a> in 1919. France integrated the economy of Cameroon with that of France and improved the infrastructure with capital investments and skilled workers, modifying the system of forced labour.

The British administered their territory from neighbouring <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. Natives complained that this made them a neglected "colony of a colony". Nigerian migrant workers flocked to Southern Cameroons, ending forced labour altogether but angering the local natives, who felt swamped. The League of Nations mandates were converted into <a href="United%20Nations%20Trusteeship%20Council">United Nations Trusteeships</a> in 1946, and the question of independence became a pressing issue in French Cameroun.

France outlawed the most radical political party, the <a href="Union%20of%20the%20Peoples%20of%20Cameroon">Union des Populations du Cameroun</a> (UPC), on 13 July 1955. This prompted a long guerrilla war and the assassination of the party's leader, <a href="Ruben%20Um%20Nyob%C3%A9">Ruben Um Nyobé</a>. In the more peaceful British Cameroons, the question was whether to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.

On 1 January 1960, French Cameroun gained independence from France under President <a href="Ahmadou%20Ahidjo">Ahmadou Ahidjo</a>. On 1 October 1961, the formerly British <a href="Southern%20Cameroons">Southern Cameroons</a> gained independence voted by vote of the UN General Assembly and joined with French Cameroun to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon. Ahidjo used the ongoing war with the UPC to concentrate power in the presidency, continuing with this even after the suppression of the UPC in 1971.

His political party, the <a href="Cameroon%20National%20Union">Cameroon National Union</a> (CNU), became the sole legal political party on 1 September 1966 and in 1972, the <a href="federation">federal system of government</a> was abolished in favour of a United Republic of Cameroon, headed from <a href="Yaound%C3%A9">Yaoundé</a>. Ahidjo pursued an economic policy of <a href="planned%20liberalism">planned liberalism</a>, prioritising <a href="cash%20crops">cash crops</a> and petroleum development. The government used oil money to create a national cash reserve, pay farmers, and finance major development projects; however, many initiatives failed when Ahidjo appointed unqualified allies to direct them.

Ahidjo stepped down on 4 November 1982 and left power to his constitutional successor, <a href="Paul%20Biya">Paul Biya</a>. However, Ahidjo remained in control of the CNU and tried to run the country from behind the scenes until Biya and his allies pressured him into resigning. Biya began his administration by moving toward a more democratic government, but a failed <a href="Cameroonian%20Palace%20Guard%20Revolt">coup d'état</a> nudged him toward the leadership style of his predecessor.

An <a href="economic%20crisis%20of%20Cameroon">economic crisis</a> took effect in the mid-1980s to late 1990s as a result of international economic conditions, drought, falling <a href="petroleum">petroleum</a> prices, and years of corruption, mismanagement, and <a href="cronyism">cronyism</a>. Cameroon turned to foreign aid, cut government spending, and <a href="privatization">privatised</a> industries. With the reintroduction of multi-party politics in December 1990, the former British Southern Cameroons pressure groups called for greater autonomy, and the <a href="Southern%20Cameroons%20National%20Council">Southern Cameroons National Council</a> advocated complete secession as the Republic of <a href="Ambazonia">Ambazonia</a>.

In June 2006, talks concerning a territorial dispute over the <a href="Bakassi%20peninsula">Bakassi peninsula</a> were resolved. The talks involved President Paul Biya of Cameroon, then President <a href="Olusegun%20Obasanjo">Olusegun Obasanjo</a> of Nigeria and then UN Secretary General <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a>, and resulted in Cameroonian control of the oil-rich peninsula. The northern portion of the territory was formally handed over to the Cameroonian government in August 2006, and the remainder of the peninsula was left to Cameroon 2 years later, in 2008.

In February 2008, Cameroon experienced its worst violence in 15 years when a transport union strike in Douala escalated into <a href="2008%20Cameroonian%20anti-government%20protests">violent protests</a> in 31 municipal areas.

In May 2014, in the wake of the <a href="Chibok%20schoolgirl%20kidnapping">Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping</a>, presidents Paul Biya of Cameroon and <a href="Idriss%20D%C3%A9by">Idriss Déby</a> of <a href="Chad">Chad</a> announced they are waging war on <a href="Boko%20Haram">Boko Haram</a>, and deployed troops to the Nigerian border.

Since November 2016, protesters from the predominantly English-speaking <a href="Northwest%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">Northwest</a> and <a href="Southwest%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">Southwest</a> regions of the country have been campaigning for continued use of the English language in schools and courts. People were killed and hundreds jailed as a result of these protests. In 2017, Biya's government blocked the regions' access to the Internet for three months. In September, separatists started <a href="Anglophone%20Crisis">a guerilla war</a> for the indendence of the Anglophone region as the <a href="Ambazonia">Federal Republic of Ambazonia</a>. The government responded with a military offensive, and the insurgency spread across the Northwest and Southwest regions. , fighting between separatist guerillas and government forces continues. The conflict indirectly led to an upsurge in Boko Haram activities, as the Cameroonian military largely withdrew from the north to focus on fighting the Ambazonian separatists.

The <a href="Heads%20of%20state%20of%20Cameroon">President of Cameroon</a> is elected and creates policy, administers government agencies, commands the <a href="military%20of%20Cameroon">armed forces</a>, negotiates and ratifies treaties, and declares a state of emergency. The president appoints government officials at all levels, from the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Cameroon">prime minister</a> (considered the official head of government), to the provincial governors and divisional officers. The president is selected by popular vote every seven years. There have been 2 presidents since the independence of Cameroon.

The <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Cameroon">National Assembly</a> makes legislation. The body consists of 180 members who are elected for five-year terms and meet three times per year. Laws are passed on a majority vote. Rarely has the assembly changed or blocked legislation proposed by the president.

The 1996 constitution establishes a second house of parliament, the 100-seat <a href="Senate%20%28Cameroon%29">Senate</a>, was established in April 2013 and is headed by a President of the Senate who is the constitutional successor in case of untimely vacancy of the Presidency of the Republic. The government recognises the authority of traditional chiefs, fons, and <a href="lamido">lamibe</a> to govern at the local level and to resolve disputes as long as such rulings do not conflict with national law.

Cameroon's legal system is largely based on <a href="law%20of%20France">French civil law</a> with common law influences. Although nominally independent, the judiciary falls under the authority of the executive's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Justice%20of%20Cameroon">Ministry of Justice</a>. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20Cameroon">court of appeal</a>, and the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Cameroon">supreme court</a>. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice%20%28Cameroon%29">High Court of Justice</a> that judges high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.

Cameroon is viewed as rife with corruption at all levels of government. In 1997, Cameroon established anti-corruption bureaus in 29 ministries, but only 25% became operational, and in 2012, <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a> placed Cameroon at number 144 on a list of 176 countries ranked from least to most corrupt. On 18 January 2006, Biya initiated an anti-corruption drive under the direction of the <a href="National%20Anti-Corruption%20Observatory">National Anti-Corruption Observatory</a>. There are several high corruption risk areas in Cameroon, for instance, customs, public health sector and public procurement. Unfortunately, the corruption has gotten worse, regardless of the existing anti-corruption bureaus, as Transparency International ranked Cameroon 153 on a list of 180 countries in 2017.

Human rights organisations accuse police and military forces of mistreating and even torturing criminal suspects, ethnic minorities, <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Cameroon">homosexuals</a>, and political activists. Prisons are overcrowded with little access to adequate food and medical facilities, and prisons run by traditional rulers in the north are charged with holding political opponents at the behest of the government. However, since the first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of police and gendarmes have been prosecuted for improper conduct. A video showing Cameroonian soldiers <a href="Murder">executing</a> blindfolded women and children has emerged in 2018.

President Biya's <a href="Cameroon%20People%27s%20Democratic%20Movement">Cameroon People's Democratic Movement</a> (CPDM) was the only legal political party until December 1990. Numerous regional political groups have since formed. The primary opposition is the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Front%20%28Cameroon%29">Social Democratic Front</a> (SDF), based largely in the Anglophone region of the country and headed by <a href="John%20Fru%20Ndi">John Fru Ndi</a>.

Biya and his party have maintained control of the presidency and the National Assembly in national elections, which rivals contend were unfair. Human rights organisations allege that the government suppresses the freedoms of opposition groups by preventing demonstrations, disrupting meetings, and arresting opposition leaders and journalists. In particular, English-speaking people are discriminated against; protests often escalate into violent clashes and killings. In 2017, President Biya shut down the Internet in the English-speaking region for 94 days, at the cost of hampering five million people, including <a href="Silicon%20Mountain">Silicon Mountain</a> startups.

<a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a> ranks Cameroon as "not free" in terms of political rights and civil liberties. The last <a href="Cameroonian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202013">parliamentary elections</a> were held on 30 September 2013.

Cameroon is a member of both the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a> and <a href="Francophonie">La Francophonie</a>.

Its <a href="foreign%20relations%20of%20Cameroon">foreign policy</a> closely follows that of its main ally, France (one of its former colonial rulers). Cameroon relies heavily on France for its defence, although military spending is high in comparison to other sectors of government.

President Biya has engaged in a decades-long clash with the government of Nigeria over possession of the oil rich <a href="Bakassi">Bakassi</a> peninsula. Cameroon and Nigeria share a 1,000 mile border and have disputed the sovereignty of the Bakassi peninsula. In 1994 Cameroon petitioned the <a href="International%20Court%20of%20Justice">International Court of Justice</a> to resolve the dispute. The two countries attempted to establish a cease-fire in 1996, however, fighting continued for years. In 2002, the ICJ ruled that the <a href="Anglo-German%20Agreement%20of%201913">Anglo-German Agreement of 1913</a> gave sovereignty to Cameroon. The ruling called for a withdrawal by both countries and denied the request by Cameroon for compensation due to Nigeria's long-term occupation. By 2004, Nigeria had failed to meet the deadline to handover the peninsula. A UN-mediated summit in June 2006 facilitated an agreement for Nigeria to withdraw from the region and both leaders signed the Greentree Agreement. The withdrawal and handover of control was completed by August 2006.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20Cameroon">constitution</a> divides Cameroon into 10 semi-autonomous regions, each under the administration of an elected <a href="Regional%20Council%20%28Cameroon%29">Regional Council</a>. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor.

These leaders are charged with implementing the will of the president, reporting on the general mood and conditions of the regions, administering the civil service, keeping the peace, and overseeing the heads of the smaller administrative units. Governors have broad powers: they may order propaganda in their area and call in the army, <a href="gendarmerie">gendarmes</a>, and police. All local government officials are employees of the central government's Ministry of Territorial Administration, from which local governments also get most of their budgets.

The regions are subdivided into 58 divisions (French ). These are headed by presidentially appointed divisional officers (). The divisions are further split into sub-divisions (), headed by assistant divisional officers (). The districts, administered by district heads (), are the smallest administrative units.

The three northernmost regions are the <a href="Far%20North%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">Far North</a> (), <a href="North%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">North</a> (), and <a href="Adamawa%20Region">Adamawa</a> (). Directly south of them are the <a href="Centre%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">Centre</a> () and <a href="East%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">East</a> (). The <a href="South%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">South Province</a> () lies on the Gulf of Guinea and the southern border. Cameroon's western region is split into four smaller regions: the <a href="Littoral%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">Littoral</a> () and <a href="Southwest%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">Southwest</a> () regions are on the coast, and the <a href="Northwest%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">Northwest</a> () and <a href="West%20Region%20%28Cameroon%29">West</a> () regions are in the western grassfields.

In 2013, the total adult <a href="literacy">literacy</a> rate of Cameroon was estimated to be 71.3%. Among youths age 15–24 the literacy rate was 85.4% for males and 76.4% for females. Most children have access to state-run schools that are cheaper than private and religious facilities. The educational system is a mixture of British and French precedents with most instruction in English or French.

Cameroon has one of the highest school attendance rates in Africa. Girls attend school less regularly than boys do because of cultural attitudes, domestic duties, early marriage, pregnancy, and sexual harassment. Although attendance rates are higher in the south, a disproportionate number of teachers are stationed there, leaving northern schools chronically understaffed. In 2013, the primary school enrollment rate was 93.5%.

School attendance in Cameroon is also affected by <a href="child%20labour">child labour</a>. Indeed, the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Labor">U.S. Department of Labor</a> Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor reported that 56% of children aged 5 to 14 were working children and that almost 53% of children aged 7 to 14 combined work and school. In December 2014, a "<a href="List%20of%20Goods%20Produced%20by%20Child%20Labor%20or%20Forced%20Labor">List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor</a>" issued by the <a href="Bureau%20of%20International%20Labor%20Affairs">Bureau of International Labor Affairs</a> mentioned Cameroon among the countries that resorted to child labor in the production of cocoa.

The quality of health care is generally low. Life expectancy at birth is estimated to be 56 years in 2012, with 48 healthy life years expected. Fertility rate remain high in Cameroon with an average of 4.8 births per woman and an average mothers' age of 19.7 years old at first birth. In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization. In 2014, just 4.1% of total GDP expenditure was allocated to healthcare. Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.

In 2012, the top three deadly diseases were <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>, <a href="Lower%20respiratory%20infection">Lower Respiratory Infection</a>, and <a href="Diarrheal%20diseases">Diarrheal Diseases</a>. Endemic diseases include <a href="dengue%20fever">dengue fever</a>, <a href="filariasis">filariasis</a>, <a href="leishmaniasis">leishmaniasis</a>, <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>, <a href="schistosomiasis">schistosomiasis</a>, and <a href="African%20trypanosomiasis">sleeping sickness</a>. The <a href="HIV">HIV</a>/<a href="AIDS">AIDS</a> prevalence rate in 2016 was estimated at 3.8% for those aged 15–49, although a strong stigma against the illness keeps the number of reported cases artificially low. 46,000 children under age 14 were estimated to be living with HIV in 2016. In Cameroon, 58% of those living with HIV know their status, and just 37% receive <a href="Antiretroviral">ARV</a> treatment. In 2016, 29,000 death due to AIDS occurred in both adults and children.

<a href="Breast%20ironing">Breast ironing</a>, a traditional practice that is prevalent in Cameroon, may affect girls' health. <a href="Female%20genital%20mutilation">Female genital mutilation</a> (FGM), while not widespread, is practiced among some populations; according to a 2013 UNICEF report, 1% of women in Cameroon have undergone FGM. Also impacting women and girls' health, the contraceptive prevalence rate is estimated to be just 34.4% in 2014. <a href="Traditional%20medicine">Traditional healers</a> remain a popular alternative to <a href="evidence-based%20medicine">evidence-based medicine</a>.

At , Cameroon is the world's 53rd-largest country. It is slightly larger than the nation of <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> and the state of California; Cameroon is comparable in size to <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. The country is located in <a href="Central%20Africa">Central</a> and West Africa, known as the hinge of Africa, on the <a href="Bight%20of%20Bonny">Bight of Bonny</a>, part of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Guinea">Gulf of Guinea</a> and the Atlantic Ocean. Cameroon lies between latitudes <a href="1st%20parallel%20north">1°</a> and <a href="13th%20parallel%20north">13°N</a>, and longitudes <a href="8th%20meridian%20east">8°</a> and <a href="17th%20meridian%20east">17°E</a>. Cameroon controls 12 nautical miles of the Atlantic Ocean.

Tourist literature describes Cameroon as "Africa in miniature" because it exhibits all major climates and vegetation of the continent: coast, desert, mountains, rainforest, and savanna. The country's neighbours are Nigeria and the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to the west; <a href="Chad">Chad</a> to the northeast; the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a> to the east; and <a href="Equatorial%20Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a>, Gabon and the <a href="Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Republic of the Congo</a> to the south.

Cameroon is divided into five major geographic zones distinguished by dominant physical, climatic, and vegetative features. The coastal plain extends inland from the Gulf of Guinea and has an average elevation of . Exceedingly hot and humid with a short <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>, this belt is densely forested and includes some of the <a href="Debundscha">wettest places</a> on earth, part of the <a href="Cross-Sanaga-Bioko%20coastal%20forests">Cross-Sanaga-Bioko coastal forests</a>.

The <a href="South%20Cameroon%20Plateau">South Cameroon Plateau</a> rises from the coastal plain to an average elevation of . Equatorial rainforest dominates this region, although its alternation between <a href="wet%20season">wet</a> and dry seasons makes it is less humid than the coast. This area is part of the <a href="Atlantic%20Equatorial%20coastal%20forests">Atlantic Equatorial coastal forests</a> <a href="ecoregion">ecoregion</a>.

An irregular chain of mountains, hills, and plateaus known as the <a href="Cameroon%20line">Cameroon range</a> extends from <a href="Mount%20Cameroon">Mount Cameroon</a> on the coast—Cameroon's highest point at —almost to <a href="Lake%20Chad">Lake Chad</a> at Cameroon's northern border at 13°05'N. This region has a mild climate, particularly on the <a href="Western%20High%20Plateau">Western High Plateau</a>, although rainfall is high. Its soils are among Cameroon's most fertile, especially around volcanic Mount Cameroon. Volcanism here has created <a href="crater%20lake">crater lake</a>s. On 21 August 1986, one of these, <a href="Lake%20Nyos">Lake Nyos</a>, belched carbon dioxide and killed between 1,700 and 2,000 people. This area has been delineated by the <a href="World%20Wildlife%20Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a> as the <a href="Cameroonian%20Highlands%20forests">Cameroonian Highlands forests</a> ecoregion.

The southern plateau rises northward to the grassy, rugged <a href="Adamawa%20Plateau">Adamawa Plateau</a>. This feature stretches from the western mountain area and forms a barrier between the country's north and south. Its average elevation is , and its average temperature ranges from to with high rainfall between April and October peaking in July and August. The <a href="East%20Sudanian%20savanna">northern lowland region</a> extends from the edge of the Adamawa to Lake Chad with an average elevation of . Its characteristic vegetation is savanna scrub and grass. This is an arid region with sparse rainfall and high median temperatures.

Cameroon has four patterns of drainage. In the south, the principal rivers are the <a href="Ntem%20River">Ntem</a>, <a href="Nyong%20River">Nyong</a>, <a href="Sanaga%20River">Sanaga</a>, and Wouri. These flow southwestward or westward directly into the Gulf of Guinea. The <a href="Dja%20River">Dja</a> and <a href="Kad%C3%A9%C3%AF%20River">Kadéï</a> drain southeastward into the <a href="Congo%20River">Congo River</a>. In northern Cameroon, the <a href="Benue%20River">Bénoué River</a> runs north and west and empties into the <a href="Niger%20River">Niger</a>. The <a href="Logon%20River">Logone</a> flows northward into Lake Chad, which Cameroon shares with three neighbouring countries.

Cameroon's per-capita GDP (<a href="Purchasing%20power%20parity">Purchasing power parity</a>) was estimated as US$2,300 in 2008, one of the ten highest in <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>. Major <a href="export">export</a> markets include France, Italy, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Cameroon is aiming to become an emerging country by 2035.

Cameroon has had a decade of strong economic performance, with GDP growing at an average of 4% per year. During the 2004–2008 period, public debt was reduced from over 60% of GDP to 10% and official reserves quadrupled to over US$3 billion. Cameroon is part of the <a href="Bank%20of%20Central%20African%20States">Bank of Central African States</a> (of which it is the dominant economy), the <a href="Customs%20and%20Economic%20Union%20of%20Central%20Africa">Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa</a> (UDEAC) and the <a href="Organization%20for%20the%20Harmonization%20of%20Business%20Law%20in%20Africa">Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa</a> (OHADA). Its currency is the <a href="CFA%20franc">CFA franc</a>.

Unemployment was estimated at 4.4% in 2014, and about a third of the population was living below the international <a href="poverty%20threshold">poverty threshold</a> of US$1.25 a day in 2009. Since the late 1980s, Cameroon has been following programmes advocated by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> and <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> (IMF) to reduce poverty, privatise industries, and increase economic growth. The government has taken measures to encourage <a href="Tourism%20in%20Cameroon">tourism</a> in the country.

Cameroon's natural resources are very well suited to agriculture and arboriculture. An estimated 70% of the population farms, and agriculture comprised an estimated 19.8% of GDP in 2009. Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools. They sell their surplus produce, and some maintain separate fields for commercial use. Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs. Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas, cocoa, oil palms, rubber, and tea. Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau, cash crops include coffee, sugar, and tobacco. Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands, and in the north, natural conditions favour crops such as cotton, groundnuts, and rice. Reliance on agricultural exports makes Cameroon vulnerable to shifts in their prices.

Livestock are raised throughout the country. Fishing employs 5,000 people and provides over 100,000 tons of seafood each year. <a href="Bushmeat">Bushmeat</a>, long a staple food for rural Cameroonians, is today a delicacy in the country's urban centres. The commercial bushmeat trade has now surpassed deforestation as the main threat to wildlife in Cameroon.

The southern rainforest has vast timber reserves, estimated to cover 37% of Cameroon's total land area. However, large areas of the forest are difficult to reach. Logging, largely handled by foreign-owned firms, provides the government US$60 million a year in taxes (), and laws mandate the safe and sustainable exploitation of timber. Nevertheless, in practice, the industry is one of the least regulated in Cameroon.

Factory-based industry accounted for an estimated 29.7% of GDP in 2009. More than 75% of Cameroon's industrial strength is located in <a href="Douala">Douala</a> and <a href="Bonab%C3%A9ri">Bonabéri</a>. Cameroon possesses substantial mineral resources, but these are not extensively mined (see "<a href="Mining%20in%20Cameroon">Mining in Cameroon</a>"). Petroleum exploitation has fallen since 1986, but this is still a substantial sector such that dips in prices have a strong effect on the economy. Rapids and waterfalls obstruct the southern rivers, but these sites offer opportunities for hydroelectric development and supply most of Cameroon's energy. The Sanaga River powers the largest hydroelectric station, located at Edéa. The rest of Cameroon's energy comes from oil-powered thermal engines. Much of the country remains without reliable power supplies.

<a href="Transport%20in%20Cameroon">Transport in Cameroon</a> is often difficult. Except for the several relatively good <a href="toll%20road">toll road</a>s which connect major cities (all of them one-lane) roads are poorly maintained and subject to inclement weather, since only 10% of the roadways are tarred. Roadblocks often serve little other purpose than to allow police and gendarmes to collect bribes from travellers. Road banditry has long hampered transport along the eastern and western borders, and since 2005, the problem has intensified in the east as the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a> has further destabilised.

<a href="Intercity%20bus%20service">Intercity bus service</a>s run by multiple private companies connect all major cities. They are the most popular means of transportation followed by the rail service "<a href="Camrail">Camrail</a>". Rail service runs from <a href="Kumba">Kumba</a> in the west to <a href="B%C3%A9labo">Bélabo</a> in the east and north to <a href="Ngaound%C3%A9r%C3%A9">Ngaoundéré</a>. International airports are located in <a href="Douala%20International%20Airport">Douala</a> and <a href="Yaound%C3%A9%20Nsimalen%20International%20Airport">Yaoundé</a>, with a third under construction in <a href="Maroua">Maroua</a>. Douala is the country's principal seaport. In the north, the Bénoué River is seasonally navigable from Garoua across into Nigeria.

Although press freedoms have improved since the first decade of the 21st century, the press is corrupt and beholden to special interests and political groups. Newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. The major radio and television stations are state-run and other <a href="communications%20in%20Cameroon">communications</a>, such as land-based telephones and telegraphs, are largely under government control. However, cell phone networks and Internet providers have increased dramatically since the first decade of the 21st century and are largely unregulated.

The Cameroon Armed Forces, (French: "Forces armées camerounaises", FAC) , consists of the country's army (<a href="French%20language">French</a>: "Armée de Terre"), the country's navy (French: "Marine Nationale de la République" (MNR), includes naval infantry), the Cameroonian Air Force (French: "Armée de l'Air du Cameroun", AAC), Fire Fighter Corps, Rapid Intervention Brigade and the <a href="Gendarmerie">Gendarmerie</a>.

Males and females that are 18 years of age up to 23 years of age and have graduated high school are eligible for military service. Those that do so are obliged 4 years of service. There is no conscription in Cameroon, but the government makes periodic calls for volunteers.

The population total in Cameroon was in . The life expectancy is 56 years (55.9 years for males and 58.6 years for females).

According to the latest census, Cameroon still has slightly more women (50.6%) than men (49.4%). Nearly 60% of the population is under age 25. People over 65 years of age account for only 3.2% of the total population.

Cameroon's population is almost evenly divided between urban and rural dwellers. Population density is highest in the large urban centres, the western highlands, and the northeastern plain. Douala, Yaoundé, and <a href="Garoua">Garoua</a> are the largest cities. In contrast, the Adamawa Plateau, southeastern Bénoué depression, and most of the South Cameroon Plateau are sparsely populated.

According to the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization">World Health Organization</a>, the <a href="fertility%20rate">fertility rate</a> was 4.8 in 2013 with a population growth rate of 2.56%.

People from the overpopulated western highlands and the underdeveloped north are moving to the coastal plantation zone and urban centres for employment. Smaller movements are occurring as workers seek employment in lumber mills and plantations in the south and east. Although the national sex ratio is relatively even, these out-migrants are primarily males, which leads to unbalanced ratios in some regions.
Both <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a> and <a href="polygamy">polygamous</a> marriage are practised, and the average Cameroonian family is large and extended. In the north, women tend to the home, and men herd cattle or work as farmers. In the south, women grow the family's food, and men provide meat and grow cash crops. Like most societies, Cameroonian society is male-dominated, and violence and discrimination against women is common.

Estimates identify anywhere from 230 to 282 different folks and linguistic groups in Cameroon. The Adamawa Plateau broadly bisects these into northern and southern divisions. The northern peoples are Sudanese groups, who live in the central highlands and the northern lowlands, and the Fulani, who are spread throughout northern Cameroon. A small number of <a href="Baggara">Shuwa</a> Arabs live near Lake Chad. Southern Cameroon is inhabited by speakers of <a href="Bantu%20languages">Bantu</a> and <a href="Semi-Bantu">Semi-Bantu</a> languages. Bantu-speaking groups inhabit the coastal and equatorial zones, while speakers of Semi-Bantu languages live in the Western grassfields. Some 5,000 Gyele and Baka <a href="Pygmy%20peoples">Pygmy peoples</a> roam the southeastern and coastal rainforests or live in small, roadside settlements. Nigerians make up the largest group of foreign nationals.

In 2007, Cameroon hosted a total population of refugees and asylum seekers of approximately 97,400. Of these, 49,300 were from the Central African Republic (many driven west by war), 41,600 from <a href="Chad">Chad</a>, and 2,900 from <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>. Kidnappings of Cameroonian citizens by Central African bandits have increased since 2005.

In the first months of 2014, thousands of refugees fleeing the violence in the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a> arrived in Cameroon.

On 4 June 2014, AlertNet reported:

Almost 90,000 people have fled to neighbouring Cameroon since December and up to 2,000 a week, mostly women and children, are still crossing the border, the United Nations said.

"Women and children are arriving in Cameroon in a shocking state, after weeks, sometimes months, on the road, foraging for food," said Ertharin Cousin, executive director of the <a href="World%20Food%20Programme">World Food Programme</a> (WFP).

Both English and French are official languages, although French is by far the most understood language (more than 80%). German, the language of the original colonisers, has long since been displaced by French and English. <a href="Cameroonian%20Pidgin%20English">Cameroonian Pidgin English</a> is the lingua franca in the formerly British-administered territories. A mixture of English, French, and Pidgin called <a href="Camfranglais">Camfranglais</a> has been gaining popularity in urban centres since the mid-1970s. The government encourages bilingualism in English and French, and as such, official government documents, new legislation, ballots, among others, are written and provided in both languages. As part of the initiative to encourage bilingualism in Cameroon, six of the eight universities in the country are entirely bilingual.

In addition to the colonial languages, there are approximately 250 other languages spoken by nearly 20 million Cameroonians. It is because of this that Cameroon is considered one of the most linguistically diverse countries in the world.

In 2017 there were language protests by the anglophone population against perceived oppression by the francophone. The military was deployed against the protesters and people have been killed, hundreds imprisoned and thousands fled the country.

Cameroon has a high level of <a href="Religion%20in%20Cameroon">religious freedom</a> and diversity. The predominant faith is <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>, practised by about two-thirds of the population, while <a href="Islam">Islam</a> is a significant minority faith, adhered to by about one-fifth. In addition, traditional faiths are practised by many. Muslims are most concentrated in the north, while Christians are concentrated primarily in the southern and western regions, but practitioners of both faiths can be found throughout the country. Large cities have significant populations of both groups. Muslims in Cameroon are divided into <a href="Sufis">Sufis</a> (and <a href="Salafi">Salafi</a>s), <a href="Shia">Shia</a>s, and <a href="non-denominational%20Muslims">non-denominational Muslims</a>.

People from the North-West and South-West provinces, which used to be a part of <a href="British%20Cameroons">British Cameroons</a>, have the highest proportion of Protestants. The French-speaking regions of the southern and western regions are largely Catholic. Southern ethnic groups predominantly follow Christian or traditional African <a href="Animism">animist</a> beliefs, or a <a href="Syncretism">syncretic</a> combination of the two. People widely believe in witchcraft, and the government outlaws such practices. Suspected witches are often subject to mob violence. The Islamist jihadist group <a href="Ansar%20al-Islam">Ansar al-Islam</a> has been reported as operating in North Cameroon.

In the northern regions, the locally dominant <a href="Fulani">Fulani</a> ethnic group is mostly Muslim, but the overall population is fairly evenly divided among Muslims, Christians, and followers of indigenous religious beliefs (called "<a href="Kirdi">Kirdi</a>" ("pagan") by the Fulani). The <a href="Bamum%20people">Bamum</a> ethnic group of the West Region is largely Muslim. Native traditional religions are practised in rural areas throughout the country but rarely are practised publicly in cities, in part because many indigenous religious groups are intrinsically local in character.

The Norwegian Missionary Society first established a mission in Cameroon in the early 1920s. Many of the churches still stands. At the time there were few Christians but now there are many. In cooperation with the local Evangelical Lutheran Church of Cameroon EELC and the American ELCA the NMS built several hospitals among these the Protestant Hospital of Ngaoundéré, high schools and several other institutions. Ngaoundéré once held one of the largest Norwegian contingencies of any place in the world, with over 100 Norwegians living there in the 1980s. Some of the families have been there in several generations among these Kaldhol, Bjaanes, Stavenjord and Dankel. The neighbourhood was even dubbed "Norvège" ("Norway" in French).

<a href="Music%20of%20Cameroon">Music</a> and <a href="dance%20in%20Cameroon">dance</a> are an integral part of Cameroonian ceremonies, festivals, social gatherings, and storytelling. Traditional dances are highly choreographed and separate men and women or forbid participation by one sex altogether. The goals of dances range from pure entertainment to religious devotion. Traditionally, music is transmitted orally. In a typical performance, a chorus of singers echoes a soloist.

Musical accompaniment may be as simple as clapping hands and stomping feet, but traditional instruments include bells worn by dancers, clappers, drums and <a href="talking%20drum">talking drum</a>s, flutes, horns, rattles, scrapers, stringed instruments, whistles, and xylophones; the exact combination varies with ethnic group and region. Some performers sing complete songs by themselves, accompanied by a harplike instrument.

Popular music styles include <a href="ambasse%20bey">ambasse bey</a> of the coast, <a href="assiko">assiko</a> of the Bassa, <a href="mangambeu">mangambeu</a> of the <a href="Bamileke">Bangangte</a>, and <a href="tsamassi">tsamassi</a> of the Bamileke. <a href="Music%20of%20Nigeria">Nigerian music</a> has influenced Anglophone Cameroonian performers, and <a href="Prince%20Nico%20Mbarga">Prince Nico Mbarga</a>'s <a href="highlife">highlife</a> hit "<a href="Sweet%20Mother">Sweet Mother</a>" is the top-selling African record in history.

The two most popular styles of music are <a href="makossa">makossa</a> and <a href="bikutsi">bikutsi</a>. Makossa developed in Douala and mixes folk music, highlife, <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>, and <a href="soukous">Congo music</a>. Performers such as <a href="Manu%20Dibango">Manu Dibango</a>, <a href="Francis%20Bebey">Francis Bebey</a>, <a href="Moni%20Bil%C3%A9">Moni Bilé</a>, and <a href="Petit-Pays">Petit-Pays</a> popularised the style worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s. Bikutsi originated as war music among the Ewondo. Artists such as <a href="Anne-Marie%20Nzi%C3%A9">Anne-Marie Nzié</a> developed it into a popular dance music beginning in the 1940s, and performers such as <a href="Mama%20Ohandja">Mama Ohandja</a> and <a href="Les%20T%C3%AAtes%20Brul%C3%A9es">Les Têtes Brulées</a> popularised it internationally during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.

<a href="Cuisine%20of%20Cameroon">Cuisine</a> varies by region, but a large, one-course, evening meal is common throughout the country. A typical dish is based on cocoyams, <a href="maize">maize</a>, <a href="cassava">cassava</a> (manioc), <a href="millet">millet</a>, <a href="Plantain%20%28cooking%29">plantains</a>, <a href="potato">potato</a>es, <a href="rice">rice</a>, or <a href="Yam%20%28vegetable%29">yams</a>, often pounded into dough-like <a href="fufu">fufu</a>. This is served with a sauce, soup, or stew made from greens, <a href="groundnut">groundnut</a>s, <a href="palm%20oil">palm oil</a>, or other ingredients. Meat and fish are popular but expensive additions, with chicken often reserved for special occasions. Dishes are often quite hot, spiced with salt, red pepper sauce, and <a href="Maggi">Maggi</a>.

Cutlery is common, but food is traditionally manipulated with the right hand. Breakfast consists of leftovers of bread and fruit with <a href="coffee">coffee</a> or <a href="tea">tea</a>. Generally breakfast is made from wheat flour in various different foods such as puff-puff (doughnuts), accra banana made from <a href="banana">banana</a>s and flour, bean cakes and many more. Snacks are popular, especially in larger towns where they may be bought from <a href="street%20vendor">street vendor</a>s.

Water, <a href="palm%20wine">palm wine</a>, and <a href="millet%20beer">millet beer</a> are the traditional mealtime drinks, although beer, soda, and wine have gained popularity. 33 Export beer is the official drink of the <a href="Cameroon%20national%20football%20team">national soccer team</a> and one of the most popular brands, joining Castel, <a href="Amstel%20Brewery">Amstel Brewery</a>, and <a href="Guinness%20Foreign%20Extra%20Stout">Guinness</a>.

Traditional arts and crafts are practiced throughout the country for commercial, decorative, and religious purposes. Woodcarvings and sculptures are especially common. The high-quality clay of the western highlands is suitable for pottery and ceramics. Other crafts include <a href="basket%20weaving">basket weaving</a>, beadworking, brass and bronze working, calabash carving and painting, embroidery, and leather working. Traditional housing styles make use of locally available materials and vary from temporary wood-and-leaf shelters of nomadic <a href="Wodaabe">Mbororo</a> to the rectangular mud-and-thatch homes of southern peoples. Dwellings made from materials such as cement and tin are increasingly common. <a href="Contemporary%20art">Contemporary art</a> is mainly promoted by independent cultural organizations (<a href="Doual%27art">Doual'art</a>, <a href="Africr%C3%A9a">Africréa</a>) and <a href="artist-run%20initiative">artist-run initiative</a>s (<a href="Art%20Wash">Art Wash</a>, <a href="Atelier%20Viking">Atelier Viking</a>, <a href="ArtBakery">ArtBakery</a>).

Cameroonian literature has concentrated on both European and African themes. Colonial-era writers such as <a href="Louis-Marie%20Pouka">Louis-Marie Pouka</a> and <a href="Sankie%20Maimo">Sankie Maimo</a> were educated by European missionary societies and advocated <a href="cultural%20assimilation">assimilation</a> into European culture as the means to bring Cameroon into the modern world. After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, writers such as <a href="Mongo%20Beti">Mongo Beti</a> and <a href="Ferdinand%20Oyono">Ferdinand Oyono</a> analysed and criticised colonialism and rejected assimilation.

Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as <a href="Jean-Paul%20Ngassa">Jean-Paul Ngassa</a> and <a href="Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se%20Sita-Bella">Thérèse Sita-Bella</a> explored similar themes. In the 1960s, <a href="Mongo%20Beti">Mongo Beti</a>, <a href="Ferdinand%20L%C3%A9opold%20Oyono">Ferdinand Léopold Oyono</a> and other writers explored post-colonialism, problems of African development, and the recovery of African identity. Meanwhile, in the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as <a href="Jean-Pierre%20Dikongu%C3%A9%20Pipa">Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Kamwa">Daniel Kamwa</a> dealt with the conflicts between traditional and post-colonial society. Literature and films during the next two decades concentrated more on wholly Cameroonian themes.

National policy strongly advocates sport in all forms. Traditional sports include canoe racing and wrestling, and several hundred runners participate in the <a href="Mount%20Cameroon%20Race%20of%20Hope">Mount Cameroon Race of Hope</a> each year. Cameroon is one of the few tropical countries to have <a href="Cameroon%20at%20the%202002%20Winter%20Olympics">competed</a> in the <a href="Winter%20Olympic%20Games">Winter Olympics</a>.

Sport in Cameroon is dominated by football. Amateur football clubs abound, organised along ethnic lines or under corporate sponsors. The <a href="Cameroon%20national%20football%20team">national team</a> has been one of the most successful in Africa since its strong showing in the <a href="1982%20Football%20World%20Cup">1982</a> and <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990 FIFA World Cup</a>s. Cameroon has won five <a href="African%20Cup%20of%20Nations">African Cup of Nations</a> titles and the gold medal at the <a href="Football%20at%20the%202000%20Summer%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20tournament">2000 Olympics</a>.

Cameroon was the host country of the <a href="Africa%20Women%20Cup%20of%20Nations">Women Africa Cup of Nations</a> in November–December 2016. The <a href="Cameroon%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">women's football team</a> is known as the "Indomitable Lionesses."

The Office of the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Human%20Rights">United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights</a> reports that Cameroon Government forces are responsible for killings, the excessive use of force, burning down of houses, arbitrary detentions and torture. UN figures indicate that more than 21,000 people have fled to neighboring countries, while 160,000 have been internally displaced by the violence, many reportedly hiding in forests.
On 25 July 2018, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights <a href="Zeid%20Raad%20Al%20Hussein">Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein</a> expressed deep concern about reports of violations and abuses in the English-speaking Northwest and Southwest regions of Cameroon.

Chad

Chad (; , ; , ), officially the Republic of Chad ( ""; "Republic of the Chad"), is a <a href="landlocked%20country">landlocked country</a> in <a href="North%20Africa">north</a>-<a href="central%20Africa">central Africa</a>. It is bordered by <a href="Libya">Libya</a> to the north, <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> to the east, the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a> to the south, <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> and <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> to the southwest, and <a href="Niger">Niger</a> to the west. It is the fifth largest country in Africa and the second-largest in Central Africa in terms of area.

Chad has several regions: a <a href="desert">desert</a> zone in the north, an arid <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>ian belt in the centre and a more fertile <a href="Sudanian%20Savanna">Sudanian Savanna</a> zone in the south. <a href="Lake%20Chad">Lake Chad</a>, after which the country is named, is the largest <a href="wetland">wetland</a> in Chad and the second-largest in Africa. The capital <a href="N%27Djamena">N'Djamena</a> is the largest <a href="List%20of%20cities%20in%20Chad">city</a>. Chad's official languages are <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a>. Chad is home to over 200 different <a href="List%20of%20ethnic%20groups%20in%20Chad">ethnic</a> and <a href="Languages%20of%20Chad">linguistic groups</a>. The most popular religion of Chad is <a href="Islam%20in%20Chad">Islam</a> (at 55%), followed by <a href="Christianity%20in%20Chad">Christianity</a> (at 40%).

Beginning in the 7th millennium BC, human populations moved into the Chadian basin in great numbers. By the end of the 1st millennium AD, a series of states and empires had risen and fallen in Chad's Sahelian strip, each focused on controlling the <a href="trans-Saharan%20trade">trans-Saharan trade</a> routes that passed through the region. <a href="France">France</a> conquered the territory by 1920 and incorporated it as part of <a href="French%20Equatorial%20Africa">French Equatorial Africa</a>. In 1960, Chad obtained independence under the leadership of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Tombalbaye">François Tombalbaye</a>. Resentment towards his policies in the Muslim north culminated in the eruption of a long-lasting <a href="The%20Tombalbaye%20Regime%23Rebellion%20in%20Chad">civil war</a> in 1965. In 1979 <a href="Transitional%20Government%20of%20National%20Unity">the rebels</a> conquered the capital and put an end to the south's hegemony. However, the rebel commanders fought amongst themselves until <a href="Hiss%C3%A8ne%20Habr%C3%A9">Hissène Habré</a> defeated his rivals. He was overthrown in 1990 by his general <a href="Idriss%20D%C3%A9by">Idriss Déby</a>. Since 2003 the <a href="War%20in%20Darfur">Darfur crisis</a> in Sudan has spilt over the border and <a href="Chadian%20Civil%20War%20%282005%E2%80%932010%29">destabilised the nation</a>, with hundreds of thousands of <a href="Sudanese%20refugees">Sudanese refugees</a> living in and around camps in eastern Chad. An uneven inclusion into the global political economy as a site for colonial resource extraction (primarily cotton and crude oil), a global economic system that does not promote nor encourage the development of Chadian industrialization, and the failure to support local agricultural production has meant that the majority of Chadians live in daily uncertainty and hunger. 

While many political parties are active, power lies firmly in the hands of President Déby and his political party, the <a href="Patriotic%20Salvation%20Movement">Patriotic Salvation Movement</a>. Chad remains plagued by <a href="political%20violence">political violence</a> and recurrent attempted <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coups d'état</a>. 
Since 2003, <a href="petroleum">crude oil</a> has become the country's primary source of export earnings, superseding the traditional <a href="cotton">cotton</a> industry.

In the 7th millennium BC, ecological conditions in the northern half of Chadian territory favored human settlement, and the region experienced a strong population increase. Some of the most important <a href="African%20archaeology">African archaeological</a> sites are found in Chad, mainly in the <a href="Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti%20Region">Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region</a>; some date to earlier than 2000 BC.

For more than 2,000 years, the Chadian Basin has been inhabited by agricultural and sedentary people. The region became a crossroads of civilizations. The earliest of these were the legendary <a href="Sao%20civilisation">Sao</a>, descendants of the Hyksos who conquered Ancient Egypt known for skills in designing weapons and artifacts, they are also known for their oral histories. After a century of rule, the Sao fell to the <a href="Kanem%20Empire">Kanem Empire</a>, the first and longest-lasting of the empires that developed in Chad's <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>ian strip by the end of the 1st millennium AD. Two other states in the region, <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Bagirmi">Sultanate of Bagirmi</a> and <a href="Wadai%20Empire">Wadai Empire</a> emerged in the 16th and 17th centuries. The power of Kanem and its successors was based on control of the <a href="trans-Saharan%20trade">trans-Saharan trade</a> routes that passed through the region. These states, at least tacitly <a href="Islam%20in%20Africa">Muslim</a>, never extended their control to the southern grasslands except to <a href="Arab%20slave%20trade">raid for slaves</a>. In Kanem, about a third of the population were slaves.

French colonial expansion led to the creation of the in 1900. By 1920, France had secured full control of the colony and incorporated it as part of <a href="French%20Equatorial%20Africa">French Equatorial Africa</a>. <a href="Colonial%20Chad">French rule in Chad</a> was characterised by an absence of policies to unify the territory and sluggish modernisation compared to other French colonies.

The French primarily viewed the colony as an unimportant source of untrained labour and raw cotton; France introduced large-scale cotton production in 1929. The colonial administration in Chad was critically understaffed and had to rely on the dregs of the French civil service. Only the <a href="Sara%20people">Sara</a> of the south was governed effectively; French presence in the Islamic north and east was nominal. The educational system was affected by this neglect.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, France granted Chad the status of <a href="Overseas%20departments%20and%20territories%20of%20France">overseas territory</a> and its inhabitants the right to elect representatives to the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28France%29">National Assembly</a> and a <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Chad%29">Chadian assembly</a>. The largest political party was the <a href="Chadian%20Progressive%20Party">Chadian Progressive Party</a> (PPT), based in the southern half of the colony. Chad was granted independence on 11 August 1960 with the PPT's leader, <a href="Sara%20people">Sara</a> <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Tombalbaye">François Tombalbaye</a>, as its first <a href="Heads%20of%20state%20of%20Chad">president</a>.

Two years later, Tombalbaye banned opposition parties and established a one-party system. Tombalbaye's autocratic rule and insensitive mismanagement exacerbated inter-ethnic tensions. In 1965, Muslims in the north, led by the <a href="FROLINAT">National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT)</a>, began a <a href="Transitional%20Government%20of%20National%20Unity">civil war</a>. Tombalbaye was <a href="1975%20Chadian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">overthrown and killed</a> in 1975, but the insurgency continued. In 1979 the rebel factions led by <a href="Hiss%C3%A8ne%20Habr%C3%A9">Hissène Habré</a> took the capital, and all central authority in the country collapsed. Armed factions, many from the north's rebellion, contended for power.

The disintegration of Chad caused the collapse of France's position in the country. <a href="Libya">Libya</a> moved to fill the power vacuum and became <a href="Chadian-Libyan%20conflict">involved in Chad's civil war</a>. Libya's adventure <a href="Toyota%20War">ended in disaster</a> in 1987; the French-supported president, <a href="Hiss%C3%A8ne%20Habr%C3%A9">Hissène Habré</a>, evoked a united response from Chadians of a kind never seen before and forced the Libyan army off Chadian soil.

Habré consolidated his dictatorship through a power system that relied on corruption and violence with thousands of people estimated to have been killed under his rule. The president favoured his own <a href="Toubou%20people">Toubou</a> ethnic group and discriminated against his former allies, the <a href="Zaghawa%20people">Zaghawa</a>. His general, <a href="Idriss%20D%C3%A9by">Idriss Déby</a>, overthrew him in 1990. Attempts to prosecute Habré led to his placement under house arrest in <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a> in 2005; in 2013, Habré was formally charged with war crimes committed during his rule. In May 2016, he was found guilty of human-rights abuses, including rape, sexual slavery, and ordering the killing of 40,000 people, and sentenced to life in prison. 

Déby attempted to reconcile the rebel groups and reintroduced multiparty politics. Chadians approved a <a href="Constitution%20of%20Chad">new constitution</a> by <a href="Chadian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201996">referendum</a>, and in 1996, Déby easily won a <a href="Chadian%20presidential%20election%2C%201996">competitive presidential election</a>. He won a <a href="Chadian%20presidential%20election%2C%202001">second term</a> five years later. <a href="Petroleum">Oil</a> exploitation began in Chad in 2003, bringing with it hopes that Chad would at last have some chances of peace and prosperity. Instead, internal dissent worsened, and a <a href="War%20in%20Chad%20%282005%E2%80%93present%29">new civil war</a> broke out. Déby <a href="Chadian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%202005">unilaterally modified the constitution</a> to remove the two-term limit on the presidency; this caused an uproar among the civil society and opposition parties.

In 2006 Déby won <a href="Chadian%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">a third mandate</a> in elections that the opposition boycotted. Ethnic violence in eastern Chad has increased; the <a href="United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> has warned that a <a href="genocide">genocide</a> like that in <a href="Darfur%20conflict">Darfur</a> may yet occur in Chad. <a href="Battle%20of%20N%27Djamena%20%282006%29">In 2006</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20N%27Djamena%20%282008%29">in 2008</a> rebel forces attempted to take the capital by force, but on both occasions failed. An agreement for the restoration of harmony between Chad and Sudan, signed 15 January 2010, marked the end of a five-year war. The fix in relations led to the Chadian rebels from Sudan returning home, the opening of the border between the two countries after seven years of closure, and the deployment of a joint force to secure the border. In May 2013, security forces in Chad foiled a coup against President <a href="Idriss%20Deby">Idriss Deby</a> that had been in preparation for several months.

Chad is currently one of the leading partners in a <a href="Multinational%20Joint%20Task%20Force">West African coalition</a> in the <a href="Boko%20Haram%20insurgency">fight</a> against <a href="Boko%20Haram">Boko Haram</a>. Chad has also been included on Presidential Proclamation 9645, the expanded version of United States president <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump's</a> <a href="Executive%20Order%2013780">Executive Order 13780</a>, which restricts entry by nationals from 8 countries, including Chad, into the US. This move has angered the Chadian government.

At , Chad is the world's <a href="List%20of%20countries%20and%20outlying%20territories%20by%20total%20area">22nd-largest country</a>. It is slightly smaller than <a href="Peru">Peru</a> and slightly larger than South Africa. Chad is in north central Africa, lying between latitudes <a href="7th%20parallel%20north">7°</a> and <a href="24th%20parallel%20north">24°N</a>, and <a href="13th%20meridian%20east">13°</a> and <a href="24th%20meridian%20east">24°E</a>.
Chad is bounded to the north by <a href="Libya">Libya</a>, to the east by <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>, to the west by <a href="Niger">Niger</a>, <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a> and <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, and to the south by the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>. The country's capital is from the nearest seaport, <a href="Douala">Douala</a>, Cameroon. Because of this distance from the sea and the country's largely <a href="desert">desert</a> climate, Chad is sometimes referred to as the "Dead Heart of Africa".

The dominant physical structure is a wide basin bounded to the north and east by the <a href="Ennedi%20Plateau">Ennedi Plateau</a> and <a href="Tibesti%20Mountains">Tibesti Mountains</a>, which include <a href="Emi%20Koussi">Emi Koussi</a>, a dormant volcano that reaches above sea level. <a href="Lake%20Chad">Lake Chad</a>, after which the country is named (and which in turn takes its name from the <a href="Kanuri%20language">Kanuri</a> word for "lake"), is the remains of an immense lake that occupied of the <a href="Chad%20Basin">Chad Basin</a> 7,000 years ago. Although in the 21st century it covers only , and its surface area is subject to heavy seasonal fluctuations, the lake is Africa's second largest wetland.

The region's tall grasses and extensive marshes make it favourable for birds, reptiles, and large mammals. Chad's major rivers—the <a href="Chari%20River">Chari</a>, <a href="Logone%20River">Logone</a> and their tributaries—flow through the southern savannas from the southeast into Lake Chad.

Each year a tropical weather system known as the <a href="Intertropical%20Convergence%20Zone">intertropical front</a> crosses Chad from south to north, bringing a <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a> that lasts from May to October in the south, and from June to September in the Sahel. Variations in local rainfall create three major geographical zones. The <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> lies in the country's northern third. Yearly precipitations throughout this belt are under ; only the occasional spontaneous palm grove survives, and the only ones to do so are south of the <a href="Tropic%20of%20Cancer">Tropic of Cancer</a>.

The Sahara gives way to a <a href="Sahel">Sahel</a>ian belt in Chad's centre; precipitation there varies from per year. In the Sahel, a steppe of thorny bushes (mostly <a href="acacia">acacia</a>s) gradually gives way to the south to <a href="East%20Sudanian%20savanna">East Sudanian savanna</a> in Chad's <a href="Sudan%20%28region%29">Sudanese</a> zone. Yearly rainfall in this belt is over .

Chad's animal and plant life correspond to the three climatic zones. In the Saharan region, the only flora is the date-palm groves of the oasis. Palms and <a href="acacia%20tree">acacia tree</a>s grow in the Sahelian region. The southern, or Sudanic, zone consists of broad grasslands or prairies suitable for grazing. As of 2002, there were at least 134 species of mammals, 509 species of birds (354 species of residents and 155 migrants), and over 1,600 species of plants throughout the country.

<a href="Elephant">Elephant</a>s, <a href="lion">lion</a>s, <a href="African%20buffalo">buffalo</a>, <a href="hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a>es, <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>es, <a href="giraffe">giraffe</a>s, <a href="antelope">antelope</a>s, <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s, <a href="cheetah">cheetah</a>s, <a href="hyena">hyena</a>s, and many species of <a href="snake">snake</a>s are found here, although most large carnivore populations have been drastically reduced since the early 20th century. <a href="Elephant%20hunting%20in%20Chad">Elephant poaching</a>, particularly in the south of the country in areas such as <a href="Zakouma%20National%20Park">Zakouma National Park</a>, is a severe problem. The small group of surviving <a href="West%20African%20crocodile">West African crocodile</a>s in the <a href="Ennedi%20Plateau">Ennedi Plateau</a> represents one of the last colonies known in the Sahara today.

Extensive deforestation has resulted in loss of trees such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; one of the main reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.

Efforts have been made by the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> to improve relations between farmers, agro-pastoralists and pastoralists in the Zakouma National Park (ZNP), Siniaka-Minia, and Aouk reserve in southeastern Chad to promote sustainable development. As part of the national conservation effort, more than 1.2 million trees have been replanted to check the advancement of the desert, which incidentally also helps the local economy by way of financial return from acacia trees, which produce <a href="gum%20arabic">gum arabic</a>, and also from fruit trees.

Poaching is a serious problem in the country, particularly of elephants for the profitable <a href="ivory">ivory</a> industry and a threat to lives of rangers even in the national parks such as Zakouma. Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized poaching. The problem is worsened by the fact that the parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.

Chad's national statistical agency projected the country's 2015 population between 13,630,252 and 13,679,203, with 13,670,084 as its medium projection; based on the medium projection, 3,212,470 people lived in urban areas and 10,457,614 people lived in rural areas. The country's population is young: an estimated 47.3% is under 15. The birth rate is estimated at 42.35 births per 1,000 people, the mortality rate at 16.69. The life expectancy is 52 years.
Chad's population is unevenly distributed. Density is in the Saharan <a href="Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti%20Region">Borkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region</a> but in the <a href="Logone%20Occidental%20Region">Logone Occidental Region</a>. In the capital, it is even higher. About half of the nation's population lives in the southern fifth of its territory, making this the most densely populated region.

Urban life is concentrated in the capital, whose population is mostly engaged in commerce. The other major towns are <a href="Sarh">Sarh</a>, <a href="Moundou">Moundou</a>, <a href="Ab%C3%A9ch%C3%A9">Abéché</a> and <a href="Doba%2C%20Chad">Doba</a>, which are considerably smaller but growing rapidly in population and economic activity. Since 2003, 230,000 <a href="Sudanese%20refugees%20in%20Chad">Sudanese refugees</a> have fled to eastern Chad from war-ridden Darfur. With the 172,600 Chadians displaced by the civil war in the east, this has generated increased tensions among the region's communities.

<a href="Polygamy">Polygamy</a> is common, with 39% of women living in such unions. This is sanctioned by law, which automatically permits polygamy unless spouses specify that this is unacceptable upon marriage. Although violence against women is prohibited, domestic violence is common. <a href="Female%20genital%20cutting">Female genital mutilation</a> is also prohibited, but the practice is widespread and deeply rooted in tradition; 45% of Chadian women undergo the procedure, with the highest rates among <a href="Arab">Arab</a>s, <a href="Hadjarai">Hadjarai</a>, and Ouaddaians (90% or more). Lower percentages were reported among the <a href="Sara%20people">Sara</a> (38%) and the <a href="Toubou">Toubou</a> (2%). Women lack equal opportunities in education and training, making it difficult for them to compete for the relatively few formal-sector jobs. Although property and inheritance laws based on the French code do not discriminate against women, local leaders adjudicate most inheritance cases in favour of men, according to traditional practice.

The peoples of Chad carry significant ancestry from <a href="East%20Africa">Eastern</a>, <a href="Central%20Africa">Central</a>, <a href="West%20Africa">Western</a>, and <a href="North%20Africa">Northern Africa</a>. 

Chad has more than 200 distinct ethnic groups, which create diverse social structures. The colonial administration and independent governments have attempted to impose a national society, but for most Chadians the local or regional society remains the most important influence outside the immediate family. Nevertheless, Chad's people may be classified according to the geographical region in which they live.
In the south live sedentary people such as the <a href="Sara%20people">Sara</a>, the nation's main ethnic group, whose essential <a href="social%20unit">social unit</a> is the lineage. In the Sahel sedentary peoples live side-by-side with nomadic ones, such as the Arabs, the country's second major ethnic group. The north is inhabited by nomads, mostly Toubous.

Chad's official languages are <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a>, but over 100 languages and dialects are spoken. Due to the important role played by itinerant Arab traders and settled merchants in local communities, <a href="Chadian%20Arabic">Chadian Arabic</a> has become a <a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>.

Chad is a religiously diverse country. Estimates from Pew Research Center in 2010 found that 55.7% of the population was Muslim, while 22.5% was Catholic and a further 17.6% was Protestant. Among Muslims, 48% professed to be <a href="Sunni">Sunni</a>, 21% <a href="Shia">Shia</a>, 4% <a href="Ahmadiyya">Ahmadi</a> and 23% <a href="Non-denominational%20Muslim">just Muslim</a>. A small proportion of the population continues to practice indigenous religions. Animism includes a variety of ancestor and place-oriented religions whose expression is highly specific. Islam is expressed in diverse ways; for example, 55% of Muslim Chadians belong to <a href="Sufism">Sufi</a> <a href="tariqa">orders</a>. <a href="Christianity%20in%20Africa">Christianity</a> arrived in Chad with the French and American missionaries; as with Chadian Islam, it <a href="syncretism">syncretises</a> aspects of pre-Christian religious beliefs. Muslims are largely concentrated in northern and eastern Chad, and animists and Christians live primarily in southern Chad and <a href="Gu%C3%A9ra%20Region">Guéra</a>. The constitution provides for a secular state and guarantees religious freedom; different religious communities generally co-exist without problems.
The majority of Muslims in the country are adherents of a moderate branch of mystical Islam (<a href="Sufism">Sufism</a>). Its most common expression is the <a href="Tijaniyah">Tijaniyah</a>, an order followed by the 35% of Chadian Muslims which incorporates some local African religious elements. A small minority of the country's Muslims hold more fundamentalist practices, which, in some cases, may be associated with Saudi-oriented <a href="Salafi%20movement">Salafi movement</a>s.

Roman Catholics represent the largest Christian denomination in the country. Most Protestants, including the Nigeria-based "Winners' Chapel", are affiliated with various evangelical Christian groups. Members of the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD">Bahá'í</a> and <a href="Jehovah%27s%20Witnesses">Jehovah's Witnesses</a> religious communities also are present in the country. Both faiths were introduced after independence in 1960 and therefore are considered to be "new" religions in the country.

Chad is home to foreign missionaries representing both <a href="Christians">Christian</a> and Islamic groups. Itinerant <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> preachers, primarily from <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>, <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a>, and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, also visit. Saudi Arabian funding generally supports social and educational projects and extensive mosque construction.

Chad's constitution provides for a strong executive branch headed by a president who dominates the political system. The president has the power to appoint the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Chad">prime minister</a> and the cabinet, and exercises considerable influence over appointments of judges, generals, provincial officials and heads of Chad's para-statal firms. In cases of grave and immediate threat, the president, in consultation with the <a href="National%20Assembly%20%28Chad%29">National Assembly</a>, may declare a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a>. The president is <a href="Elections%20in%20Chad">directly elected</a> by popular vote for a five-year term; in 2005 constitutional term limits were removed,
allowing a president to remain in power beyond the previous two-term limit. Most of Déby's key advisers are members of the Zaghawa ethnic group, although southern and opposition personalities are represented in <a href="Government%20of%20Chad">government</a>.

Chad's legal system is based on <a href="law%20of%20France">French civil law</a> and Chadian customary law where the latter does not interfere with public order or constitutional guarantees of equality. Despite the constitution's guarantee of judicial independence, the president names most key judicial officials. The legal system's highest jurisdictions, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Chad">Supreme Court</a> and the <a href="Constitutional%20Council%20of%20Chad">Constitutional Council</a>, have become fully operational since 2000. The Supreme Court is made up of a chief justice, named by the president, and 15 councillors, appointed for life by the president and the National Assembly. The Constitutional Court is headed by nine judges elected to nine-year terms. It has the power to review legislation, treaties and international agreements prior to their adoption.

The National Assembly makes legislation. The body consists of 155 members elected for four-year terms who meet three times per year. The Assembly holds regular sessions twice a year, starting in March and October, and can hold special sessions when called by the prime minister. Deputies elect a National Assembly president every two years. The president must sign or reject newly passed laws within 15 days. The National Assembly must approve the prime minister's plan of government and may force the prime minister to resign through a majority vote of no confidence. However, if the National Assembly rejects the executive branch's programme twice in one year, the president may disband the Assembly and call for new legislative elections. In practice, the president exercises considerable influence over the National Assembly through his party, the <a href="Patriotic%20Salvation%20Movement">Patriotic Salvation Movement</a> (MPS), which holds a large majority.

Until the legalisation of opposition parties in 1992, Déby's MPS was the sole legal party in Chad. Since then, <a href="list%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Chad">78 registered political parties</a> have become active. In 2005, opposition parties and human rights organisations supported the boycott of the constitutional referendum that allowed Déby to stand for re-election for a third term amid reports of widespread irregularities in voter registration and government censorship of independent media outlets during the campaign. Correspondents judged the 2006 presidential elections a mere formality, as the opposition deemed the polls a farce and boycotted them.

Déby faces armed opposition from groups who are deeply divided by leadership clashes but united in their intention to overthrow him. These forces <a href="Battle%20of%20N%27Djamena%20%282006%29">stormed the capital</a> on 13 April 2006, but were ultimately repelled. Chad's greatest foreign influence is France, which maintains 1,000 soldiers in the country. Déby relies on the French to help repel the rebels, and France gives the <a href="Military%20of%20Chad">Chadian army</a> logistical and intelligence support for fear of a complete collapse of regional stability. Nevertheless, Franco-Chadian relations were soured by the granting of oil drilling rights to the American <a href="ExxonMobil">Exxon</a> company in 1999.

Chad is listed as a <a href="failed%20state">failed state</a> by the <a href="Fund%20for%20Peace">Fund for Peace</a> (FFP). In 2007 Chad had the seventh highest score on the failed state index. Since then the trend has been upwards each year. Chad had the fourth highest score (behind Sudan) on the Failed State Index of 2012 and , is ranked fifth.

Corruption is rife at all levels; <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a>'s <a href="Corruption%20Perceptions%20Index">Corruption Perceptions Index</a> for 2005 named Chad (tied with <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a>) as the most corrupt country in the world. Chad's ranking on the index has improved only marginally in recent years. Since its first inclusion on the index in 2004, Chad's best score has been 2/10 for 2011. Critics of President Déby have accused him of <a href="cronyism">cronyism</a> and <a href="tribalism">tribalism</a>.

Since 2012 Chad has been divided into <a href="regions%20of%20Chad">23 regions</a>. The subdivision of Chad in regions came about in 2003 as part of the decentralisation process, when the government abolished the previous <a href="prefectures%20of%20Chad">14 prefectures</a>. Each region is headed by a presidentially appointed governor. Prefects administer the <a href="departments%20of%20Chad">61 departments</a> within the regions. The departments are divided into <a href="Sub-prefectures%20of%20Chad">200 sub-prefectures</a>, which are in turn composed of 446 cantons.

The cantons are scheduled to be replaced by "communautés rurales", but the legal and regulatory framework has not yet been completed. The constitution provides for decentralised government to compel local populations to play an active role in their own development. To this end, the constitution declares that each administrative subdivisions be governed by elected local assemblies, but no local elections have taken place, and communal elections scheduled for 2005 have been repeatedly postponed.

The CIA World Factbook estimates the military budget of Chad to be 4.2% of GDP as of 2006.. Given the then GDP ($7.095 bln) of the country, military spending was estimated to be about $300 million. This estimate however dropped after the end of the <a href="Civil%20war%20in%20Chad%20%282005%E2%80%932010%29">Civil war in Chad (2005–2010)</a> to 2.0% as estimated by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> for the year 2011. There aren't any more recent estimates available for 2012, 2013.

There have been numerous rebel groups in Chad throughout the last few decades.
In 2007, a peace treaty was signed that integrated <a href="United%20Front%20for%20Democratic%20Change">United Front for Democratic Change</a> or FUC soldiers into the Chadian Army. The <a href="Movement%20for%20Justice%20and%20Democracy%20in%20Chad">Movement for Justice and Democracy in Chad</a> or MDJT also clashed with government forces in 2003 in an attempt to overthrow President <a href="Idriss%20D%C3%A9by">Idriss Déby</a>. In addition, there have been various conflicts with <a href="Khartoum">Khartoum</a>'s <a href="Janjaweed">Janjaweed</a> rebels in eastern Chad, who killed civilians by use of <a href="helicopter%20gunship">helicopter gunship</a>s. Presently, the <a href="Union%20of%20Resistance%20Forces">Union of Resistance Forces</a> or UFR are a rebel group that continues to battle with the government of Chad. In 2010, the UFR reportedly had a force estimating 6,000 men and 300 vehicles.

In Chad, <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20Chad">homosexual acts</a> are illegal and can be punished by 15 to 20 years in prison. In December 2016, Chad passed a law criminalising both male and female same-sex sexual activity by a vote of 111 to 1.

In southern Chad, bitter conflicts over land are becoming more and more common. They frequently turn violent. Long-standing community culture is being eroded – and so are the livelihoods of many farmers.

The United Nations' <a href="Human%20Development%20Index">Human Development Index</a> ranks Chad as the seventh poorest country in the world, with 80% of the population living below the poverty line. The <a href="Gross%20domestic%20product">GDP</a> (<a href="Purchasing%20power%20parity">Purchasing power parity</a>) per capita was estimated as <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>1,651 in 2009. Chad is part of the <a href="Bank%20of%20Central%20African%20States">Bank of Central African States</a>, the <a href="Customs%20and%20Economic%20Union%20of%20Central%20Africa">Customs and Economic Union of Central Africa</a> (UDEAC) and the <a href="Organization%20for%20the%20Harmonization%20of%20Business%20Law%20in%20Africa">Organization for the Harmonization of Business Law in Africa</a> (<a href="OHADA">OHADA</a>).

Chad's currency is the <a href="Central%20African%20CFA%20franc">CFA franc</a>. In the 1960s, the <a href="Mining%20industry%20of%20Chad">Mining industry of Chad</a> produced <a href="sodium%20carbonate">sodium carbonate</a>, or natron. There have also been reports of <a href="gold">gold</a>-bearing quartz in the <a href="Biltine%20Prefecture">Biltine Prefecture</a>. However, years of civil war have scared away foreign investors; those who left Chad between 1979 and 1982 have only recently begun to regain confidence in the country's future. In 2000 major direct foreign investment in the oil sector began, boosting the country's economic prospects.
Over 80% of Chad's population relies on subsistence farming and livestock raising for its livelihood. The crops grown and the locations of herds are determined by the local climate. In the southernmost 10% of the territory lies the nation's most fertile cropland, with rich yields of <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a> and <a href="millet">millet</a>. In the Sahel only the hardier varieties of millet grow, and these with much lower yields than in the south. On the other hand, the Sahel is ideal pastureland for large herds of commercial cattle and for goats, sheep, donkeys and horses. The Sahara's scattered <a href="oasis">oases</a> support only some dates and legumes. Chad's cities face serious difficulties of municipal infrastructure; only 48% of urban residents have access to potable water and only 2% to basic sanitation.

Before the development of oil industry, cotton dominated industry and the labour market had accounted for approximately 80% of export earnings. Cotton remains a primary export, although exact figures are not available. Rehabilitation of <a href="Cotontchad">Cotontchad</a>, a major cotton company weakened by a decline in world cotton prices, has been financed by France, the Netherlands, the European Union, and the <a href="International%20Bank%20for%20Reconstruction%20and%20Development">International Bank for Reconstruction and Development</a> (IBRD). The <a href="parastatal">parastatal</a> is now expected to be privatised. Other than Cotton, <a href="Cattle">Cattle</a> and <a href="Gum%20Arabic">Gum Arabic</a> are dominant.

If Chad can maintain a semblance of stability foreign investments will eventually return, but even 24 years after the last successful coup that brought President Idris Deby to power, investors are still wary of investing in Chad.

According to the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, Chad has been affected by a <a href="humanitarian%20crisis">humanitarian crisis</a> since at least 2001. , the country of Chad hosts over 280,000 refugees from the <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a>'s <a href="Darfur">Darfur</a> region, over 55,000 from the <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>, as well as over 170,000 <a href="internally%20displaced%20person">internally displaced person</a>s.

In February 2008 in the aftermath of the <a href="Battle%20of%20N%27Djamena%20%282008%29">battle of N'Djamena</a>, UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs <a href="John%20Holmes%20%28British%20diplomat%29">John Holmes</a> expressed "extreme concern" that the crisis would have a negative effect on the ability of humanitarians to deliver life-saving assistance to half a million beneficiaries, most of whom – according to him – heavily rely on humanitarian aid for their survival. UN spokesperson <a href="Maurizio%20Giuliano">Maurizio Giuliano</a> stated to "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>": "If we do not manage to provide aid at sufficient levels, the humanitarian crisis might become a humanitarian catastrophe". In addition, organizations such as <a href="Save%20the%20Children">Save the Children</a> have suspended activities due to killings of aid workers.

Civil war crippled the development of <a href="transport%20in%20Chad">transport infrastructure</a>; in 1987, Chad had only of paved roads. Successive road rehabilitation projects improved the network to by 2004. Nevertheless, the road network is limited; roads are often unusable for several months of the year. With no railways of its own, Chad depends heavily on Cameroon's rail system for the transport of Chadian exports and imports to and from the seaport of <a href="Douala">Douala</a>.

 Chad had an estimated 59 airports, only 9 of which had paved runways. An <a href="N%27Djamena%20International%20Airport">international airport</a> serves the capital and provides regular nonstop flights to Paris and several African cities.

Chad's energy sector has had years of mismanagement by the parastatal Chad Water and Electric Society (STEE), which provides power for 15% of the capital's citizens and covers only 1.5% of the national population. Most Chadians burn biomass fuels such as wood and animal manure for power.

<a href="ExxonMobil">ExxonMobil</a> leads a consortium of <a href="Chevron%20Corporation">Chevron</a> and <a href="Petronas">Petronas</a> that has invested $3.7 billion to develop oil reserves estimated at one billion barrels in southern Chad. Oil production began in 2003 with the <a href="Chad-Cameroon%20Petroleum%20Development%20and%20Pipeline%20Project">completion of a pipeline</a> (financed in part by the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a>) that links the southern oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast of Cameroon. As a condition of its assistance, the World Bank insisted that 80% of oil revenues be spent on development projects. In January 2006 the World Bank suspended its loan programme when the Chadian government passed laws reducing this amount. On 14 July 2006, the World Bank and Chad signed a memorandum of understanding under which the Government of Chad commits 70% of its spending to priority poverty reduction programmes.

The <a href="Communications%20in%20Chad">telecommunication system</a> is basic and expensive, with fixed telephone services provided by the state telephone company <a href="SotelTchad">SotelTchad</a>. Only 14,000 fixed telephone lines serve all of Chad, one of the lowest telephone density rates in the world.

<a href="Gateway%20Communications">Gateway Communications</a>, a pan-African wholesale connectivity and telecommunications provider also has a presence in Chad. In September 2013, Chad's Ministry for Posts and Information & Communication Technologies (PNTIC) announced that the country will be seeking a partner for <a href="Optical%20fiber">fiber optic</a> technology.

In September 2010 the penetration rate was estimated at 24.3% over a population estimate of 10.7 million.

Chad is ranked last in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Chad ranked number 148 out of 148 overall in the 2014 NRI ranking, down from 142 in 2013.

Chad's television audience is limited to N'Djamena. The only television station is the state-owned Télé Tchad. Radio has a far greater reach, with 13 private radio stations. Newspapers are limited in quantity and distribution, and circulation figures are small due to transportation costs, low literacy rates, and poverty. While the constitution defends liberty of expression, the government has regularly restricted this right, and at the end of 2006 began to enact a system of prior <a href="censorship">censorship</a> on the media.

<a href="Education%20in%20Chad">Educators</a> face considerable challenges due to the nation's dispersed population and a certain degree of reluctance on the part of parents to send their children to school. Although attendance is compulsory, only 68 percent of boys attend primary school, and more than half of the population is illiterate. <a href="List%20of%20universities%20in%20Chad">Higher education</a> is provided at the <a href="University%20of%20N%27Djamena">University of N'Djamena</a>. At 33 percent, Chad has one of the lowest literacy rates of <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>.

In 2013, the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Labor">U.S. Department of Labor</a>'s Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor in Chad reported that school attendance of children aged 5 to 14 was as low as 39%. This can also be related to the issue of <a href="child%20labor">child labor</a> as the report also stated that 53% of children aged 5 to 14 were working children, and that 30% of children aged 7 to 14 combined work and school. A more recent DOL <a href="List%20of%20Goods%20Produced%20by%20Child%20Labor%20or%20Forced%20Labor">report</a> listed cattle herding as a major agricultural activity that employed underage children.

Because of its great variety of peoples and languages, Chad possesses a rich cultural heritage. The Chadian government has actively promoted Chadian culture and national traditions by opening the <a href="Chad%20National%20Museum">Chad National Museum</a> and the <a href="Chad%20Cultural%20Centre">Chad Cultural Centre</a>. Six <a href="public%20holidays%20in%20Chad">national holidays</a> are observed throughout the year, and movable holidays include the Christian holiday of <a href="Easter%20Monday">Easter Monday</a> and the Muslim holidays of <a href="Eid%20ul-Fitr">Eid ul-Fitr</a>, <a href="Eid%20ul-Adha">Eid ul-Adha</a>, and <a href="Mawlid">Eid Milad Nnabi</a>.

The <a href="music%20of%20Chad">music of Chad</a> includes a number of unusual instruments such as the "kinde", a type of bow harp; the "<a href="kakaki">kakaki</a>", a long tin horn; and the "hu hu", a stringed instrument that uses <a href="calabash">calabash</a>es as loudspeakers. Other instruments and their combinations are more linked to specific ethnic groups: the Sara prefer whistles, <a href="balafon">balafon</a>es, harps and "kodjo" drums; and the <a href="Kanembu%20people">Kanembu</a> combine the sounds of drums with those of flute-like instruments.
The music group <a href="Chari%20Jazz">Chari Jazz</a> formed in 1964 and initiated Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned groups such as African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on "sai", a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy and a lack of legal protections for artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.

<a href="Millet">Millet</a> is the staple food throughout Chad. It is used to make balls of paste that are dipped in sauces. In the north this dish is known as "alysh"; in the south, as "biya". Fish is popular, which is generally prepared and sold either as "salanga" (sun-dried and lightly smoked "<a href="Alestes">Alestes</a>" and "<a href="Hydrocynus">Hydrocynus</a>") or as "banda" (smoked large fish). "Carcaje" is a popular sweet red tea extracted from hibiscus leaves. Alcoholic beverages, though absent in the north, are popular in the south, where people drink <a href="millet%20beer">millet beer</a>, known as "billi-billi" when brewed from red millet, and as "coshate" when from <a href="Proso%20millet">white millet</a>.

As in other Sahelian countries, literature in Chad has seen an economic, political and spiritual drought that has affected its best known writers. Chadian authors have been forced to write from exile or expatriate status and have generated literature dominated by themes of political oppression and historical discourse. Since 1962, 20 Chadian authors have written some 60 works of fiction. Among the most internationally renowned writers are <a href="Joseph%20Brahim%20Se%C3%AFd">Joseph Brahim Seïd</a>, <a href="Baba%20Moustapha">Baba Moustapha</a>, <a href="Antoine%20Bangui">Antoine Bangui</a> and <a href="Koulsy%20Lamko">Koulsy Lamko</a>. In 2003 Chad's sole literary critic, <a href="Ahmat%20Taboye">Ahmat Taboye</a>, published his to further knowledge of Chad's literature internationally and among youth and to make up for Chad's lack of publishing houses and promotional structure.

The development of a Chadian film industry was hampered by the devastations of civil war and from the lack of <a href="movie%20theater">cinemas</a>, of which there is only one in the whole country. The first Chadian <a href="feature%20film">feature film</a>, the <a href="docudrama">docudrama</a> "<a href="Bye%20Bye%20Africa">Bye Bye Africa</a>", was made in 1999 by <a href="Mahamat%20Saleh%20Haroun">Mahamat Saleh Haroun</a>. His later film "<a href="Abouna">Abouna</a>" was critically acclaimed, and his "<a href="Daratt">Daratt</a>" won the Grand Special Jury Prize at the <a href="63rd%20Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">63rd Venice International Film Festival</a>. The 2010 feature film "<a href="A%20Screaming%20Man">A Screaming Man</a>" won the <a href="Jury%20Prize%20%28Cannes%20Film%20Festival%29">Jury Prize</a> at the <a href="2010%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2010 Cannes Film Festival</a>, making Haroun the first Chadian director to enter, as well as win, an award in the main Cannes competition. <a href="Issa%20Serge%20Coelo">Issa Serge Coelo</a> directed Chad's two other films, "<a href="Daresalam">Daresalam</a>" and "".

<a href="Association%20football">Football</a> is Chad's most popular <a href="sport%20in%20Chad">sport</a>.

Caspar David Friedrich

Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century <a href="German%20Romanticism">German Romantic</a> <a href="Landscape%20painting">landscape</a> painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period <a href="allegorical">allegorical</a> landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-<a href="Classicism">classical</a> work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs "the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension".

Friedrich was born in the town of <a href="Greifswald">Greifswald</a> on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time <a href="Swedish%20Pomerania">Swedish Pomerania</a>. He studied in <a href="Copenhagen">Copenhagen</a> until 1798, before settling in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of <a href="spirituality">spirituality</a>. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a> and <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a> sought to depict nature as a "divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization".

Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor <a href="Pierre%20Jean%20David">David d'Angers</a> spoke of him as a man who had discovered "the tragedy of landscape". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his paintings in Berlin. By the 1920s his paintings had been discovered by the <a href="Expressionism">Expressionists</a>, and in the 1930s and early 1940s <a href="Surrealism">Surrealists</a> and <a href="Existentialism">Existentialists</a> frequently drew ideas from his work. The rise of <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a> in the early 1930s again saw a resurgence in Friedrich's popularity, but this was followed by a sharp decline as his paintings were, by association with the Nazi movement, interpreted as having a <a href="German%20nationalism">nationalistic</a> aspect. It was not until the late 1970s that Friedrich regained his reputation as an icon of the German Romantic movement and a painter of international importance.

Caspar David Friedrich was born on 5 September 1774, in <a href="Greifswald">Greifswald</a>, <a href="Swedish%20Pomerania">Swedish Pomerania</a>, on the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> coast of Germany. The sixth of ten children, he was brought up in the strict <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> creed of his father Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich, a <a href="History%20of%20candle%20making">candle-maker</a> and soap boiler. Records of the family's financial circumstances are contradictory; while some sources indicate the children were privately tutored, others record that they were raised in relative poverty. Caspar David was familiar with death from an early age. His mother, Sophie Dorothea Bechly, died in 1781 when he was just seven. A year later, his sister Elisabeth died, while a second sister, Maria, succumbed to <a href="typhus%20fever">typhus</a> in 1791. Arguably the greatest tragedy of his childhood happened in 1787 when his brother Johann Christoffer died: at the age of thirteen, Caspar David witnessed his younger brother fall through the ice of a frozen lake, and drown. Some accounts suggest that Johann Christoffer perished while trying to rescue Caspar David, who was also in danger on the ice.

Friedrich began his formal study of art in 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the <a href="University%20of%20Greifswald">University of Greifswald</a> in his home city, at which the art department is now named "Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institut" in his honour. Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions; as a result, Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age. Through Quistorp, Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian <a href="Ludwig%20Gotthard%20Kosegarten">Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten</a>, who taught that nature was a revelation of God. Quistorp introduced Friedrich to the work of the German 17th-century artist <a href="Adam%20Elsheimer">Adam Elsheimer</a>, whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape, and nocturnal subjects. During this period he also studied literature and <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a> with Swedish professor <a href="Thomas%20Thorild">Thomas Thorild</a>. Four years later Friedrich entered the prestigious <a href="Royal%20Danish%20Academy%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Academy of Copenhagen</a>, where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life. Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the <a href="Statens%20Museum%20for%20Kunst">Royal Picture Gallery's</a> collection of 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. At the Academy he studied under teachers such as <a href="Christian%20August%20Lorentzen">Christian August Lorentzen</a> and the landscape painter <a href="Jens%20Juel%20%28painter%29">Jens Juel</a>. These artists were inspired by the "<a href="Sturm%20und%20Drang">Sturm und Drang</a>" movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding Romantic aesthetic and the waning <a href="Neoclassicism%23In%20architecture%20and%20in%20the%20decorative%20and%20visual%20arts">neo-classical</a> ideal. Mood was paramount, and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of <a href="Edda">Edda</a>, the poems of <a href="Ossian">Ossian</a> and <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>.

Friedrich settled permanently in Dresden in 1798. During this early period, he experimented in <a href="printmaking">printmaking</a> with <a href="etching">etching</a>s and designs for <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a>s which his furniture-maker brother cut. By 1804 he had produced 18 etchings and four woodcuts; they were apparently made in small numbers and only distributed to friends. Despite these forays into other media, he gravitated toward working primarily with <a href="India%20ink">ink</a>, <a href="watercolour">watercolour</a> and <a href="sepia%20%28color%29">sepia</a>s. With the exception of a few early pieces, such as "" (1797), he did not work extensively with <a href="oil%20painting">oils</a> until his reputation was more established. Landscapes were his preferred subject, inspired by frequent trips, beginning in 1801, to the <a href="Baltic%20coast">Baltic coast</a>, <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, the <a href="Krkono%C5%A1e">Krkonoše</a> and the <a href="Harz%20Mountains">Harz Mountains</a>. Mostly based on the landscapes of northern Germany, his paintings depict woods, hills, harbors, morning mists and other light effects based on a close observation of nature. These works were modeled on sketches and studies of scenic spots, such as the cliffs on <a href="R%C3%BCgen">Rügen</a>, the surroundings of Dresden and the river <a href="Elbe">Elbe</a>. He executed his studies almost exclusively in pencil, even providing topographical information, yet the subtle atmospheric effects characteristic of Friedrich's mid-period paintings were rendered from memory. These effects took their strength from the depiction of light, and of the illumination of sun and moon on clouds and water: optical phenomena peculiar to the Baltic coast that had never before been painted with such an emphasis.

His reputation as an artist was established when he won a prize in 1805 at the Weimar competition organised by <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>. At the time, the Weimar competition tended to draw mediocre and now-forgotten artists presenting derivative mixtures of neo-classical and pseudo-Greek styles. The poor quality of the entries began to prove damaging to Goethe's reputation, so when Friedrich entered two sepia drawings—"Procession at Dawn" and "Fisher-Folk by the Sea"—the poet responded enthusiastically and wrote, "We must praise the artist's resourcefulness in this picture fairly. The drawing is well done, the procession is ingenious and appropriate... his treatment combines a great deal of firmness, diligence and neatness... the ingenious watercolour... is also worthy of praise."

Friedrich completed the first of his major paintings in 1808, at the age of 34. "<a href="Cross%20in%20the%20Mountains%20%28Tetschen%20Altar%29">Cross in the Mountains</a>", today known as the "Tetschen Altar", is an <a href="altarpiece">altarpiece</a> panel said to have been commissioned for a family chapel in <a href="D%C4%9B%C4%8D%C3%ADn">Tetschen</a>, <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>. The panel depicts a cross in profile at the top of a mountain, alone, and surrounded by pine trees. Controversially, for the first time in <a href="Christian%20art">Christian art</a>, an altarpiece had showcased a landscape. According to art historian Linda Siegel, Friedrich's design was the "logical climax of many earlier drawings of his which depicted a cross in nature's world."

Although the altarpiece was generally coldly received, it was Friedrich's first painting to receive wide publicity. The artist's friends publicly defended the work, while art critic <a href="Basilius%20von%20Ramdohr">Basilius von Ramdohr</a> published a long article challenging Friedrich's use of landscape in a religious context. He rejected the idea that landscape painting could convey explicit meaning, writing that it would be "a veritable presumption, if landscape painting were to sneak into the church and creep onto the altar". Friedrich responded with a programme describing his intentions in 1809, comparing the rays of the evening sun to the light of the <a href="God%20the%20Father">Holy Father</a>. This statement marked the only time Friedrich recorded a detailed interpretation of his own work, and the painting was among the few commissions the artist ever received.

Following the purchase of two of his paintings by the Prussian Crown Prince, Friedrich was elected a member of the <a href="Prussian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Berlin Academy</a> in 1810. Yet in 1816, he sought to distance himself from Prussian authority and applied that June for Saxon citizenship. The move was not expected; the Saxon government was pro-French, while Friedrich's paintings were seen as generally patriotic and distinctly anti-French. Nevertheless, with the aid of his Dresden-based friend Graf Vitzthum von Eckstädt, Friedrich attained citizenship, and in 1818, membership in the Saxon Academy with a yearly dividend of 150 <a href="thalers">thalers</a>. Although he had hoped to receive a full professorship, it was never awarded him as, according to the German Library of Information, "it was felt that his painting was too personal, his point of view too individual to serve as a fruitful example to students." Politics too may have played a role in stalling his career: Friedrich's decidedly Germanic subjects and costuming frequently clashed with the era's prevailing pro-French attitudes.

On 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a <a href="dye">dye</a>r from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820. <a href="Physiologist">Physiologist</a> and painter <a href="Carl%20Gustav%20Carus">Carl Gustav Carus</a> notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including "<a href="Chalk%20Cliffs%20on%20R%C3%BCgen">Chalk Cliffs on Rügen</a>"—painted after his honeymoon—display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that "the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art."

Around this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke <a href="Nicholas%20I%20of%20Russia">Nikolai Pavlovich</a>, at the behest of his wife <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Charlotte%20of%20Prussia%29">Alexandra Feodorovna</a>, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet <a href="Vasily%20Zhukovsky">Vasily Zhukovsky</a>, tutor to <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II</a>, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings "please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind."

Friedrich was acquainted with <a href="Philipp%20Otto%20Runge">Philipp Otto Runge</a>, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of <a href="Georg%20Friedrich%20Kersting">Georg Friedrich Kersting</a>, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter <a href="Johan%20Christian%20Clausen%20Dahl">Johan Christian Clausen Dahl</a> (1788–1857). Dahl was close to Friedrich during the artist's final years, and he expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only "curiosities". While the poet Zhukovsky appreciated Friedrich's psychological themes, Dahl praised the descriptive quality of Friedrich's landscapes, commenting that "artists and connoisseurs saw in Friedrich's art only a kind of <a href="Mysticism">mystic</a>, because they themselves were only looking out for the mystic... They did not see Friedrich's faithful and conscientious study of nature in everything he represented".

During this period Friedrich frequently sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for <a href="mausoleums">mausoleums</a>, reflecting his obsession with death and the afterlife; he even created designs for some of the <a href="funerary%20art">funerary art</a> in Dresden's cemeteries. Some of these works were lost in the fire that destroyed <a href="Munich">Munich</a>'s <a href="Glaspalast%20%28Munich%29">Glass Palace</a> (1931) and later in the 1945 <a href="bombing%20of%20Dresden%20in%20World%20War%20II">bombing of Dresden</a>.

Friedrich's reputation steadily declined over the final fifteen years of his life. As the ideals of early Romanticism passed from fashion, he came to be viewed as an eccentric and melancholy character, out of touch with the times. Gradually his patrons fell away. By 1820, he was living as a recluse and was described by friends as the "most solitary of the solitary". Towards the end of his life he lived in relative poverty. He became isolated and spent long periods of the day and night walking alone through woods and fields, often beginning his strolls before sunrise.

In June 1835, Friedrich suffered his first <a href="stroke">stroke</a>, which left him with minor limb paralysis and greatly reduced his ability to paint. As a result, he was unable to work in oil; instead he was limited to watercolour, sepia and reworking older compositions.

Although his vision remained strong, he had lost the full strength of his hand. Yet he was able to produce a final 'black painting', "Seashore by Moonlight" (1835–36), described by Vaughan as the "darkest of all his shorelines, in which richness of tonality compensates for the lack of his former finesse".

Symbols of death appeared in his other work from this period. Soon after his stroke, the <a href="House%20of%20Romanov">Russian royal family</a> purchased a number of his earlier works, and the proceeds allowed him to travel to <a href="Teplice">Teplitz</a>—in today's Czech Republic—to recover.

During the mid-1830s, Friedrich began a series of portraits and he returned to observing himself in nature. As the art historian <a href="William%20Vaughan%20%28art%20historian%29">William Vaughan</a> has observed, however, "He can see himself as a man greatly changed. He is no longer the upright, supportive figure that appeared in "<a href="Two%20Men%20Contemplating%20the%20Moon">Two Men Contemplating the Moon</a>" in 1819. He is old and stiff... he moves with a stoop".

By 1838, he was capable only of working in a small format. He and his family were living in poverty and grew increasingly dependent for support on the charity of friends.

Friedrich died in Dresden on 7 May 1840, and was buried in Dresden's Trinitatis-Friedhof (Trinity Cemetery) east of the city centre (the entrance to which he had painted some 15 years earlier). The simple flat gravestone lies north-west of the central roundel within the main avenue.

By the time of his death, his reputation and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.

After his death, <a href="Carl%20Gustav%20Carus">Carl Gustav Carus</a> wrote a series of articles which paid tribute to Friedrich's transformation of the conventions of landscape painting. However, Carus' articles placed Friedrich firmly in his time, and did not place the artist within a continuing tradition. Only one of his paintings had been reproduced as a print, and that was produced in very few copies.

The visualisation and portrayal of landscape in an entirely new manner was Friedrich's key innovation. He sought not just to explore the blissful enjoyment of a beautiful view, as in the classic conception, but rather to examine an instant of <a href="Sublime%20%28philosophy%29">sublimity</a>, a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature. Friedrich was instrumental in transforming landscape in art from a backdrop subordinated to human drama to a self-contained emotive subject. Friedrich's paintings commonly employed the "<a href="R%C3%BCckenfigur">Rückenfigur</a>"—a person seen from behind, contemplating the view. The viewer is encouraged to place himself in the position of the "Rückenfigur", by which means he experiences the sublime potential of nature, understanding that the scene is as perceived and idealised by a human. Friedrich created the notion of a landscape full of romantic feeling—"die romantische Stimmungslandschaft". His art details a wide range of geographical features, such as rock coasts, forests, and mountain scenes. He often used the landscape to express religious themes. During his time, most of the best-known paintings were viewed as expressions of a religious <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>.

Friedrich said, "The artist should paint not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him. If, however, he sees nothing within him, then he should also refrain from painting that which he sees before him. Otherwise, his pictures will be like those <a href="folding%20screen">folding screen</a>s behind which one expects to find only the sick or the dead." Expansive skies, storms, mist, forests, ruins and crosses bearing witness to the presence of God are frequent elements in Friedrich's landscapes. Though death finds symbolic expression in boats that move away from shore—a <a href="Charon%20%28mythology%29">Charon</a>-like motif—and in the poplar tree, it is referenced more directly in paintings like "<a href="The%20Abbey%20in%20the%20Oakwood">The Abbey in the Oakwood</a>" (1808–10), in which monks carry a coffin past an open grave, toward a cross, and through the portal of a church in ruins.

He was one of the first artists to portray winter landscapes in which the land is rendered as stark and dead. Friedrich's winter scenes are solemn and still—according to the art historian Hermann Beenken, Friedrich painted winter scenes in which "no man has yet set his foot. The theme of nearly all the older winter pictures had been less winter itself than life in winter. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was thought impossible to leave out such motifs as the crowd of skaters, the wanderer... It was Friedrich who first felt the wholly detached and distinctive features of a natural life. Instead of many tones, he sought the one; and so, in his landscape, he subordinated the composite chord into one single basic note".

Bare oak trees and tree stumps, such as those in "" (c. 1822), "<a href="Two%20Men%20Contemplating%20the%20Moon">Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon</a>" (c. 1824), and "Willow Bush under a Setting Sun" (c. 1835), are recurring elements of Friedrich's paintings, symbolizing death. Countering the sense of despair are Friedrich's symbols for redemption: the cross and the clearing sky promise <a href="Immortality">eternal life</a>, and the slender moon suggests hope and the growing closeness of Christ. In his paintings of the sea, anchors often appear on the shore, also indicating a spiritual hope. German literature scholar Alice Kuzniar finds in Friedrich's painting a <a href="temporality">temporality</a>—an evocation of the passage of time—that is rarely highlighted in the visual arts. For example, in "The Abbey in the Oakwood", the movement of the monks away from the open grave and toward the cross and the horizon imparts Friedrich's message that the final destination of man's life lies beyond the grave.

With dawn and dusk constituting prominent themes of his landscapes, Friedrich's own later years were characterized by a growing pessimism. His work becomes darker, revealing a fearsome monumentality. "The Wreck of the Hope"—also known as "The Polar Sea" or "<a href="The%20Sea%20of%20Ice">The Sea of Ice</a>" (1823–24)—perhaps best summarizes Friedrich's ideas and aims at this point, though in such a radical way that the painting was not well received. Completed in 1824, it depicted a grim subject, a shipwreck in the Arctic Ocean; "the image he produced, with its grinding slabs of <a href="travertine">travertine</a>-colored <a href="Drift%20ice">floe</a> ice chewing up a wooden ship, goes beyond documentary into allegory: the frail bark of human aspiration crushed by the world's immense and glacial indifference."

Friedrich's written commentary on aesthetics was limited to a collection of <a href="aphorism">aphorism</a>s set down in 1830, in which he explained the need for the artist to match natural observation with an introspective scrutiny of his own personality. His best-known remark advises the artist to "close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye. Then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards." He rejected the overreaching portrayals of nature in its "totality", as found in the work of contemporary painters like <a href="Adrian%20Ludwig%20Richter">Adrian Ludwig Richter</a> (1803–84) and <a href="Joseph%20Anton%20Koch">Joseph Anton Koch</a> (1768–1839).

Both Friedrich's life and art have at times been perceived by some to have been marked with an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Art historians and some of his contemporaries attribute such interpretations to the losses suffered during his youth to the bleak outlook of his adulthood, while Friedrich's pale and withdrawn appearance helped reinforce the popular notion of the "taciturn man from the North".

Friedrich suffered depressive episodes in 1799, 1803–1805, c.1813, in 1816 and between 1824 and 1826. There are noticeable thematic shifts in the works he produced during these episodes, which see the emergence of such motifs and symbols as vultures, owls, graveyards and ruins. From 1826 these motifs became a permanent feature of his output, while his use of color became more dark and muted. Carus wrote in 1929 that Friedrich "is surrounded by a thick, gloomy cloud of spiritual uncertainty", though the noted art historian and curator Hubertus Gassner disagrees with such notions, seeing in Friedrich's work a positive and life-affirming subtext inspired by <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasonry</a> and religion.

Reflecting Friedrich's patriotism and resentment during the 1813 French occupation of the dominion of <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>, motifs from <a href="German%20folklore">German folklore</a> became increasingly prominent in his work. An anti-French German nationalist, Friedrich used motifs from his native landscape to celebrate Germanic culture, customs and <a href="Continental%20Germanic%20mythology">mythology</a>. He was impressed by the anti-<a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleonic</a> poetry of <a href="Ernst%20Moritz%20Arndt">Ernst Moritz Arndt</a> and <a href="Theodor%20K%C3%B6rner%20%28author%29">Theodor Körner</a>, and the patriotic literature of <a href="Adam%20M%C3%BCller">Adam Müller</a> and <a href="Heinrich%20von%20Kleist">Heinrich von Kleist</a>. Moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against France, as well as by Kleist's 1808 drama "Die Hermannsschlacht", Friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscape—a first in the history of art.

In "" (1812), a dilapidated monument inscribed "<a href="Arminius">Arminius</a>" invokes the Germanic chieftain, a symbol of nationalism, while the four tombs of fallen heroes are slightly ajar, freeing their spirits for eternity. Two French soldiers appear as small figures before a cave, lower and deep in a grotto surrounded by rock, as if farther from heaven. A second political painting, "" (c. 1813), depicts a lost French soldier dwarfed by a dense forest, while on a tree stump a raven is perched—a prophet of doom, symbolizing the anticipated defeat of France.

Alongside other Romantic painters, Friedrich helped position <a href="landscape%20painting">landscape painting</a> as a major genre within Western art. Of his contemporaries, Friedrich's style most influenced the painting of <a href="Johan%20Christian%20Dahl">Johan Christian Dahl</a> (1788–1857). Among later generations, <a href="Arnold%20B%C3%B6cklin">Arnold Böcklin</a> (1827–1901) was strongly influenced by his work, and the substantial presence of Friedrich's works in Russian collections influenced many Russian painters, in particular <a href="Arkhip%20Kuindzhi">Arkhip Kuindzhi</a> (c. 1842–1910) and <a href="Ivan%20Shishkin">Ivan Shishkin</a> (1832–98). Friedrich's spirituality anticipated American painters such as <a href="Albert%20Pinkham%20Ryder">Albert Pinkham Ryder</a> (1847–1917), <a href="Ralph%20Albert%20Blakelock">Ralph Blakelock</a> (1847–1919), the painters of the <a href="Hudson%20River%20School">Hudson River School</a> and the <a href="Luminism%20%28American%20art%20style%29">New England Luminists</a>.

At the turn of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art historian <a href="Andreas%20Aubert%20%28art%20historian%29">Andreas Aubert</a> (1851–1913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolist</a> painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist <a href="Edvard%20Munch">Edvard Munch</a> (1863–1944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print "The Lonely Ones" echoes Friedrich's "Rückenfigur (back figure)", although in Munch's work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.

Friedrich's modern revival gained momentum in 1906, when thirty-two of his works were featured in an exhibition in Berlin of Romantic-era art. His landscapes exercised a strong influence on the work of German artist <a href="Max%20Ernst">Max Ernst</a> (1891–1976), and as a result other <a href="Surrealist">Surrealist</a>s came to view Friedrich as a precursor to their movement. In 1934, the Belgian painter <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Magritte">René Magritte</a> (1898–1967) paid tribute in his work "<a href="The%20Human%20Condition%20%28painting%29">The Human Condition</a>", which directly echoes motifs from Friedrich's art in its questioning of perception and the role of the viewer. A few years later, the Surrealist journal "<a href="Minotaure">Minotaure</a>" featured Friedrich in a 1939 article by critic Marie Landsberger, thereby exposing his work to a far wider circle of artists. The influence of "The Wreck of Hope" (or "The Sea of Ice") is evident in the 1940–41 painting "<a href="Totes%20Meer">Totes Meer</a>" by <a href="Paul%20Nash%20%28artist%29">Paul Nash</a> (1889–1946), a fervent admirer of Ernst. Friedrich's work has been cited as an inspiration by other major 20th-century artists, including <a href="Mark%20Rothko">Mark Rothko</a> (1903–1970), <a href="Gerhard%20Richter">Gerhard Richter</a> (b. 1932), <a href="Gotthard%20Graubner">Gotthard Graubner</a> and <a href="Anselm%20Kiefer">Anselm Kiefer</a> (b. 1945). Friedrich's Romantic paintings have also been singled out by writer <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a> (1906–89), who, standing before "Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon", said "This was the source of "<a href="Waiting%20for%20Godot">Waiting for Godot</a>", you know."

In his 1961 article "The Abstract Sublime", originally published in "<a href="ARTnews">ARTnews</a>", the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the <a href="Abstract%20Expressionist">Abstract Expressionist</a> paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrich's 1809 painting "<a href="The%20Monk%20by%20the%20Sea">The Monk by the Sea</a>", Turner's "The Evening Star" and Rothko's 1954 "Light, Earth and Blue" as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, "Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us on the threshold of those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail—a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape—is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night."

The contemporary artist <a href="Christiane%20Pooley">Christiane Pooley</a> gets inspired by Friedrich's work for her landscapes reinterpreting the <a href="history%20of%20Chile">history of Chile</a>.

Until 1890, and especially after his friends had died, Friedrich's work lay in near-oblivion for decades. Yet, by 1890, the symbolism in his work began to ring true with the artistic mood of the day, especially in central Europe. However, despite a renewed interest and an acknowledgment of his originality, his lack of regard for "painterly effect" and thinly rendered surfaces jarred with the theories of the time.

During the 1930s, Friedrich's work was used in the promotion of <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> ideology, which attempted to fit the Romantic artist within the nationalistic "<a href="Blood%20and%20soil">Blut und Boden</a>". It took decades for Friedrich's reputation to recover from this association with Nazism. His reliance on symbolism and the fact that his work fell outside the narrow definitions of <a href="modernism">modernism</a> contributed to his fall from favour. In 1949, art historian <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a> wrote that Friedrich "worked in the frigid technique of his time, which could hardly inspire a school of modern painting", and suggested that the artist was trying to express in painting what is best left to poetry. Clark's dismissal of Friedrich reflected the damage the artist's reputation sustained during the late 1930s.

Friedrich's reputation suffered further damage when his imagery was adopted by a number of Hollywood directors, such as <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a>, built on the work of such German cinema masters as <a href="Fritz%20Lang">Fritz Lang</a> and <a href="F.%20W.%20Murnau">F. W. Murnau</a>, within the horror and fantasy genres. His rehabilitation was slow, but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as <a href="Werner%20Hofmann%20%28art%20historian%29">Werner Hofmann</a>, Helmut Börsch-Supan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work, and placed it within a purely art-historical context. By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world, as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians.

Today, his international reputation is well established. He is a national icon in his native Germany, and highly regarded by art historians and art connoisseurs across the Western World. He is generally viewed as a figure of great psychological complexity, and according to Vaughan, "a believer who struggled with doubt, a celebrator of beauty haunted by darkness. In the end, he transcends interpretation, reaching across cultures through the compelling appeal of his imagery. He has truly emerged as a butterfly—hopefully one that will never again disappear from our sight".

Friedrich was a prolific artist who produced more than 500 attributed works. In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as "<a href="The%20Stages%20of%20Life">The Stages of Life</a>", were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted during one of the revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, in part because he often did not directly name or date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates.

Courtney Love

Courtney Michelle Love (; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter, actress, and visual artist. A notable figure in the <a href="punk%20rock">punk</a> and <a href="grunge">grunge</a> scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the <a href="lead%20vocalist">lead vocalist</a> of the <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Hole%20%28band%29">Hole</a>, which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a> frontman <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>.

Born to <a href="counterculture">countercultural</a> parents in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After being interned in a juvenile hall, she spent a year abroad living in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> and <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> before returning to the United States and being cast in the <a href="Alex%20Cox">Alex Cox</a> films "<a href="Sid%20and%20Nancy">Sid and Nancy</a>" (1986) and "<a href="Straight%20to%20Hell%20%28film%29">Straight to Hell</a>" (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's <a href="Pretty%20on%20the%20Inside">1991 debut album</a>, produced by <a href="Kim%20Gordon">Kim Gordon</a>. Hole's second release, "<a href="Live%20Through%20This">Live Through This</a>" (1994), was met with critical accolades and <a href="RIAA%20certification">multi-platinum</a> sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture%20%E2%80%93%20Drama">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination for her performance as <a href="Althea%20Flynt">Althea Leasure</a> in <a href="Milo%C5%A1%20Forman">Miloš Forman</a>'s "<a href="The%20People%20vs.%20Larry%20Flynt">The People vs. Larry Flynt</a>" (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, "<a href="Celebrity%20Skin">Celebrity Skin</a>" (1998), was nominated for three <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s.

Love continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as "<a href="Man%20on%20the%20Moon%20%28film%29">Man on the Moon</a>" (1999) and "<a href="Trapped%20%282002%20film%29">Trapped</a>" (2002), before releasing her first solo album, "<a href="America%27s%20Sweetheart%20%28album%29">America's Sweetheart</a>", in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and <a href="drug%20addiction">drug addiction</a>, which resulted in a mandatory lockdown <a href="drug%20rehabilitation">rehabilitation</a> sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became "<a href="Nobody%27s%20Daughter">Nobody's Daughter</a>", released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> and returned to acting in the network series "<a href="Sons%20of%20Anarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a>" and "<a href="Empire%20%282015%20TV%20series%29">Empire</a>".

Love has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a <a href="manga">manga</a>, "<a href="Princess%20Ai">Princess Ai</a>", between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, "" (2006). In 2012, she premiered an exhibit of <a href="mixed%20media">mixed media</a> visual art, "And She's Not Even Pretty".

Love was born Courtney Michelle Harrison on July 9, 1964, at <a href="Saint%20Francis%20Memorial%20Hospital">Saint Francis Memorial Hospital</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, California, the first child of psychotherapist <a href="Linda%20Carroll">Linda Carroll</a> (née Risi) and Hank Harrison, a publisher and road manager for the <a href="Grateful%20Dead">Grateful Dead</a>. Love's <a href="godparent">godfather</a> is the founding Grateful Dead bassist <a href="Phil%20Lesh">Phil Lesh</a>. Her mother, who was adopted at birth and raised by a prominent <a href="Italians">Italian</a>-<a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> family in San Francisco, was later revealed to be the biological daughter of novelist <a href="Paula%20Fox">Paula Fox</a>; Love's maternal great-grandmother was screenwriter <a href="Elsie%20Fox">Elsie Fox</a>. According to Love, she was named after Courtney Farrell, the protagonist of <a href="Pamela%20Moore%20%28author%29">Pamela Moore</a>'s 1956 novel "<a href="Chocolates%20for%20Breakfast">Chocolates for Breakfast</a>". She is of <a href="Cubans">Cuban</a>, <a href="English%20people">English</a>, <a href="Germans">German</a>, <a href="Irish%20people">Irish</a>, and <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> descent.
Love spent her early years in the <a href="Haight-Ashbury">Haight-Ashbury</a> district of San Francisco until her parents' 1969 divorce, spurred by her mother's allegations that her father had fed Courtney <a href="LSD">LSD</a> when she was a toddler. Though he denied the claim, full custody of Love was awarded to her mother. In 1970, Carroll relocated with Love to the rural community of <a href="Marcola%2C%20Oregon">Marcola, Oregon</a> where they lived along the <a href="Mohawk%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Mohawk River</a> while she completed her psychology degree at the <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a>. There, Love was adopted by her then-stepfather, Frank Rodriguez. He and her mother had two daughters and a son who died in infancy of a <a href="heart%20defect">heart defect</a> when Love was ten; they also adopted a boy. Love attended a <a href="Montessori%20education">Montessori school</a> in <a href="Eugene%2C%20Oregon">Eugene</a>, where she struggled academically and had trouble making friends. At age nine, a psychologist noted that she exhibited signs of <a href="autism">autism</a>.

In 1972, Love's mother divorced Rodriguez, remarried, and moved the family to <a href="Nelson%2C%20New%20Zealand">Nelson</a>, New Zealand. There, she enrolled Love at <a href="Nelson%20College%20for%20Girls">Nelson College for Girls</a>, from which she was soon expelled. In 1973, she was sent back to live in the United States, where she was raised in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a> by her former stepfather and other family friends. During this time, her mother gave birth to two of Love's other half-brothers. At age fourteen, she was arrested for shoplifting a T-shirt from a <a href="F.%20W.%20Woolworth%20Company">Woolworth's</a>, and was sent to <a href="Hillcrest%20Youth%20Correctional%20Facility">Hillcrest Correctional Facility</a>, a juvenile hall in <a href="Salem%2C%20Oregon">Salem</a>, Oregon. She was subsequently placed in <a href="Foster%20care%20in%20the%20United%20States">foster care</a> until she became legally emancipated at age 16. She supported herself by working illegally as a topless dancer at <a href="Mary%27s%20Club">Mary's Club</a> in downtown Portland adopting the last name "Love" to conceal her identity; she later adopted "Love" as her surname. She also worked various odd jobs, including picking berries at a farm in <a href="Troutdale%2C%20Oregon">Troutdale, Oregon</a>, and as a disc jockey at a gay disco. During this time, she enrolled at <a href="Portland%20State%20University">Portland State University</a>, studying English and philosophy. Love has said that she "didn't have a lot of social skills," and that she learned them while frequenting gay clubs and spending time with <a href="drag%20queen">drag queen</a>s.

In 1981, she was granted a small <a href="United%20States%20trust%20law">trust fund</a> that had been left by her adoptive grandparents, which she used to travel to <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, Ireland, where her biological father was living. While there, she enrolled in courses at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Dublin">Trinity College</a>, studying theology for two semesters. She would later receive <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary patronage</a> from Trinity's <a href="University%20Philosophical%20Society">University Philosophical Society</a> in 2010. After leaving Trinity, Love relocated to <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, where she became acquainted with musician <a href="Julian%20Cope">Julian Cope</a> and his band, <a href="The%20Teardrop%20Explodes">The Teardrop Explodes</a>, and briefly lived in his house. "They kind of took me in", she recalled. "I was sort of a mascot; I would get them coffee or tea during rehearsal." In Cope's autobiography "Head-On", Love is referred to as "the adolescent." After spending a year abroad, Love returned to Portland: "I thought that [going to the United Kingdom] was my peak life experience," she said in 2011. "—that nothing else [would] happen to me again." In 1983, she took short-lived jobs working as an erotic dancer in Japan and later Taiwan, but was <a href="deportation">deported</a> after the club was shut down by the government.

Love began several music projects in the 1980s, first forming Sugar Babylon (later <a href="Sugar%20Babydoll">Sugar Babydoll</a>) in Portland with her friends Ursula Wehr and Robin Barbur. In 1982, Love attended a <a href="Faith%20No%20More">Faith No More</a> concert in San Francisco and convinced the members to let her join as a singer. The group recorded material with Love as a vocalist, but she was subsequently kicked out of the band. According to the Faith No More keyboardist <a href="Roddy%20Bottum">Roddy Bottum</a>, who remained Love's friend in the years after, the band wanted a "male energy."
She later formed the <a href="Pagan%20Babies%20%28band%29">Pagan Babies</a> with friend <a href="Kat%20Bjelland">Kat Bjelland</a>, whom she met at the <a href="Satyricon%20%28nightclub%29">Satyricon</a> club in Portland in 1984. As Love later reflected, "The best thing that ever happened to me in a way, was Kat." Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they recruited bassist <a href="Jennifer%20Finch">Jennifer Finch</a> and drummer <a href="Janis%20Tanaka">Janis Tanaka</a>. According to Bjelland, "[Courtney] didn't play an instrument at the time" aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group <a href="Babes%20in%20Toyland%20%28band%29">Babes in Toyland</a>, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.

Deciding to shift her focus to acting, Love enrolled at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Art%20Institute">San Francisco Art Institute</a> and studied film under experimental director <a href="George%20Kuchar">George Kuchar</a>. Love featured in one of his short films, titled "Club Vatican". In 1985 she submitted an audition tape for the role of <a href="Nancy%20Spungen">Nancy Spungen</a> in the <a href="Sid%20Vicious">Sid Vicious</a> biopic "<a href="Sid%20and%20Nancy">Sid and Nancy</a>" (1986), and was given a minor supporting role by director <a href="Alex%20Cox">Alex Cox</a>. After filming "Sid and Nancy" in New York City, she worked at a <a href="peep%20show">peep show</a> in <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a> and <a href="squatting">squatted</a> at the <a href="ABC%20No%20Rio">ABC No Rio</a> social center and <a href="Pyramid%20Club%20%28New%20York%29">Pyramid Club</a> in the <a href="East%20Village%2C%20Manhattan">East Village</a>. The same year, Cox cast her in a leading role in his film "<a href="Straight%20to%20Hell%20%28film%29">Straight to Hell</a>" (1987), a <a href="spaghetti%20western">spaghetti western</a> starring <a href="Joe%20Strummer">Joe Strummer</a> and <a href="Grace%20Jones">Grace Jones</a> filmed in Spain in 1986. The film caught the attention of <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>, who featured Love in an episode of "<a href="Andy%20Warhol%27s%20Fifteen%20Minutes">Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes</a>". She also had a part in the 1988 <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a> music video for "<a href="I%20Wanna%20Be%20Sedated">I Wanna Be Sedated</a>," appearing as a bride among dozens of party guests.

In 1988, Love aborted her acting career and left New York, returning to the West Coast, citing the "<a href="celebutante">celebutante</a>" fame she'd attained as the central reason. She returned to stripping in the small town of <a href="McMinnville%2C%20Oregon">McMinnville, Oregon</a>, where she was recognized by customers at the bar. This prompted Love to go into isolation, so she relocated to <a href="Anchorage%2C%20Alaska">Anchorage, Alaska</a>, where she lived for three months to "gather her thoughts," supporting herself by working at a strip club frequented by local fishermen. "I decided to move to Alaska because I needed to get my shit together and learn how to work", she said in retrospect. "So I went on this sort of <a href="vision%20quest">vision quest</a>. I got rid of all my earthly possessions. I had my bad little strip clothes and some big sweaters, and I moved into a trailer with a bunch of other strippers."

At the end of 1988, Love taught herself to play guitar and relocated to Los Angeles, where she placed an ad in a local music zine: "I want to start a band. My influences are <a href="Big%20Black">Big Black</a>, <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a>, and <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>." Love recruited lead guitarist <a href="Eric%20Erlandson">Eric Erlandson</a>; Lisa Roberts, her neighbor, as bassist; and drummer Caroline Rue, whom she met at a <a href="Gwar">Gwar</a> concert. Love named the band <a href="Hole%20%28band%29">Hole</a> after a line from <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>' "<a href="Medea">Medea</a>" ("There is a hole that pierces right through me") as well as a conversation she had had with her mother, in which she told her that she couldn't live her life "with a hole running through her." Just prior to forming Hole, Love married James Moreland (vocalist of <a href="The%20Leaving%20Trains">The Leaving Trains</a>) in <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a>, a marriage she later said was "a joke," ending in an <a href="annulment">annulment</a> filed by Love several months later. After forming Hole, she and bandmate Eric Erlandson had a romantic relationship that lasted over a year.

Love continued to work at strip clubs in Hollywood (including <a href="Jumbo%27s%20Clown%20Room">Jumbo's Clown Room</a> and the Seventh Veil) in the band's formative stages, saving money to purchase <a href="backline%20%28stage%29">backline</a> equipment and a touring van, and rehearsed at a studio in Hollywood that was loaned to her by the <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>. Hole played their first show in November 1989 at <a href="Raji%27s">Raji's</a>, a rock club in central Hollywood. The band's debut single, "<a href="Retard%20Girl">Retard Girl</a>", was issued in April 1990 through the Long Beach indie label <a href="Sympathy%20for%20the%20Record%20Industry">Sympathy for the Record Industry</a>, and was given airtime by <a href="Rodney%20Bingenheimer">Rodney Bingenheimer</a>'s show on local rock station <a href="KROQ-FM">KROQ</a>. That fall, the band appeared on the cover of "<a href="Flipside%20%28fanzine%29">Flipside</a>", a Los Angeles-based punk <a href="fanzine">fanzine</a>. In early 1991, the band released their second single, "<a href="Dicknail">Dicknail</a>", through <a href="Sub%20Pop%20Records">Sub Pop Records</a>.
With <a href="no%20wave">no wave</a>, <a href="noise%20rock">noise rock</a> and <a href="grindcore">grindcore</a> bands being major influences on Love, Hole's first studio album, "<a href="Pretty%20on%20the%20Inside">Pretty on the Inside</a>", captured a particularly abrasive sound and contained disturbing, graphic lyrics, described by "<a href="Q%20magazine">Q</a>" magazine as "confrontational [and] genuinely uninhibited." The record was released in September 1991 on <a href="Caroline%20Records">Caroline Records</a>, produced by <a href="Kim%20Gordon">Kim Gordon</a> of Sonic Youth with assistant production from <a href="Gumball%20%28band%29">Gumball</a>'s Don Fleming; Love and Gordon had initially met when Hole opened for Sonic Youth during their promotional tour for "<a href="Goo%20%28album%29">Goo</a>" at the <a href="Whisky%20a%20Go%20Go">Whisky a Go Go</a> in November 1990. In early 1991, Love sent Gordon a personal letter asking her to produce the record for the band, to which she agreed.

Though Love would later say it was "unlistenable" and "[un]melodic," the album received generally positive critical reception from indie and punk rock critics and was labeled one of the twenty best albums of the year by "<a href="Spin%20Magazine">Spin</a>" magazine. It also gained a following in the United Kingdom, charting at 59 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, and its lead single, "<a href="Teenage%20Whore">Teenage Whore</a>", entered the country's indie chart at number one. The underlying feminist slant of some of the album's songs led many to mistakenly tag the band as being part of the <a href="riot%20grrrl">riot grrrl</a> movement, a movement that Love did not associate with. The band toured in support of the record, headlining with <a href="Mudhoney">Mudhoney</a> in Europe; in the United States, they opened for the <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">Smashing Pumpkins</a>, and performed at <a href="CBGB">CBGB</a> in New York City.

During this tour, Love briefly dated <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a> of the rock band <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a> before formally dating <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a> frontman <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>. It is uncertain when they first met, and there are <a href="%23Cobain">varying accounts</a> of how they came to know one another. Journalist <a href="Michael%20Azerrad">Michael Azerrad</a> states that the two met in 1989 at the <a href="Satyricon%20%28nightclub%29">Satyricon</a> nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer <a href="Charles%20R.%20Cross">Charles Cross</a> has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like <a href="Dave%20Pirner">Dave Pirner</a> of <a href="Soul%20Asylum">Soul Asylum</a>. According to Love, she first met him at a <a href="Dharma%20Bums%20%28band%29">Dharma Bums</a> show in Portland, while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain in a parking lot after a <a href="Butthole%20Surfers">Butthole Surfers</a> concert at the <a href="Hollywood%20Palladium">Hollywood Palladium</a> on May 17, 1991. Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became reacquainted through <a href="Jennifer%20Finch">Jennifer Finch</a>, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.

Shortly after completing the tour for "Pretty on the Inside", Love married Cobain on <a href="Waikiki%20Beach">Waikiki Beach</a> in <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, Hawaii on February 24, 1992. She wore a satin and lace dress once owned by actress <a href="Frances%20Farmer">Frances Farmer</a>, and Cobain wore plaid pajamas. During Love's pregnancy, Hole recorded a cover of "Over the Edge" for a <a href="Wipers">Wipers</a> tribute album, and recorded their fourth single, "<a href="Beautiful%20Son">Beautiful Son</a>", which was released in April 1993. On August 18 of that year, the couple's only child, a daughter, <a href="Frances%20Bean%20Cobain">Frances Bean Cobain</a>, was born in Los Angeles. The couple subsequently relocated to <a href="Carnation%2C%20Washington">Carnation, Washington</a> and then to <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>. 

Love's first major media exposure came in a September 1992 profile of herself and Cobain for "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" by journalist Lynn Hirschberg, entitled "Strange Love." After being asked to participate in a cover story for the magazine, Love was urged by her manager to accept the request. In the year prior, Love and Cobain had developed a <a href="heroin">heroin</a> addiction, and the profile painted the couple in an unflattering light and suggested that Love had been addicted to heroin during her pregnancy. The article ultimately resulted in the Los Angeles <a href="Department%20of%20Children%20and%20Family%20Services%20%28Los%20Angeles%20County%29">Department of Children and Family Services</a> investigating, and custody of Love and Cobain's newborn daughter, Frances, was temporarily awarded to Love's sister, Jaimee. Love claimed she was misquoted by Hirschberg, and asserted that she had immediately quit using heroin during her <a href="first%20trimester">first trimester</a> after she discovered she was pregnant. Love would later claim that the publication of the article had serious implications for her marriage as well as Cobain's mental state, suggesting it was a factor in his suicide.
On September 8, 1993, Love and Cobain made their only public performance together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Hollywood, performing two <a href="acoustic%20music">acoustic</a> duets of "<a href="Pennyroyal%20Tea">Pennyroyal Tea</a>" and "<a href="Where%20Did%20You%20Sleep%20Last%20Night">Where Did You Sleep Last Night</a>." Love also performed electric versions of two new Hole songs, "<a href="Doll%20Parts">Doll Parts</a>" and "<a href="Miss%20World%20%28song%29">Miss World</a>," both written for the band's upcoming second album. In October 1993, Hole recorded their second album, "<a href="Live%20Through%20This">Live Through This</a>", in Atlanta. The album featured a new lineup with bassist <a href="Kristen%20Pfaff">Kristen Pfaff</a> and drummer <a href="Patty%20Schemel">Patty Schemel</a>. "Live Through This" was released on <a href="Geffen%20Records">Geffen</a>'s subsidiary label <a href="DGC%20Records">DGC</a> in April 1994, four days after <a href="death%20of%20Kurt%20Cobain">Cobain died</a> of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in their Seattle home while Love was in rehab in Los Angeles. In the following months, Love was rarely seen in public, holing up in her Seattle home with friends and family members. After the <a href="cremation">cremation</a> of Cobain's remains, Love divided portions of his ashes, keeping some in a teddy bear and some in an urn. In June 1994, she traveled to the <a href="Namgyal%20Monastery%20Institute%20of%20Buddhist%20Studies">Namgyal Buddhist Monastery</a> in <a href="Ithaca%2C%20New%20York">Ithaca, New York</a>, where she had his ashes ceremonially blessed by <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> monks, and a portion were mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures. On June 16, 1994, Hole's bassist Kristen Pfaff died of a heroin overdose in Seattle. For the band's impending tour, Love recruited Canadian bassist <a href="Melissa%20Auf%20der%20Maur">Melissa Auf der Maur</a>.

"Live Through This" was a commercial and critical success, hitting <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">platinum RIAA certification</a> in April 1995 and receiving numerous critical accolades. The success of the record combined with Cobain's suicide resulted in a high level of publicity for Love, and she was featured on <a href="Barbara%20Walters">Barbara Walters</a>' "<a href="Barbara%20Walters%27%2010%20Most%20Fascinating%20People">10 Most Fascinating People</a>" in 1995. Simultaneously, her erratic onstage behavior and various legal troubles during Hole's 1994–1995 world tour compounded the media coverage of her. 

Hole's performance on August 26, 1994 at the <a href="Reading%20Festival">Reading Festival</a>— Love's first public performance following Cobain's death—was described by <a href="MTV">MTV</a> as "by turns macabre, frightening and inspirational." <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" that Love's disheveled appearance "would have drawn whistles of astonishment in <a href="Bethlem%20Royal%20Hospital">Bedlam</a>", and that her performance "verged on the heroic ... Love steered her band through a set which dared you to pity either her recent history or that of the band ... the band teetered on the edge of chaos, generating a tension which I cannot remember having felt before from any stage." The band performed a series of riotous concerts over the following year, with Love frequently appearing hysterical onstage, <a href="exhibitionism">flashing</a> crowds, <a href="stage%20diving">stage diving</a>, and getting into fights with audience members. One journalist reported that at the band's show in Boston in December 1994, "Love interrupted the music and talked about her deceased husband Kurt Cobain, and also broke out into <a href="Tourette%20syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a>-like rants. The music was great, but the raving was vulgar and offensive, and prompted some of the audience to shout back at her." 

The tour was also marked by a series of legal troubles for Love: In January 1995, she was arrested in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> for disrupting a <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> Airways flight after getting into an argument with a stewardess. On July 4, 1995, at the <a href="Lollapalooza%20Festival">Lollapalooza Festival</a> in <a href="George%2C%20Washington">George, Washington</a>, Love threw a lit cigarette at musician <a href="Kathleen%20Hanna">Kathleen Hanna</a> before punching her in the face, alleging that Hanna had made a joke about her daughter. She pleaded guilty to an <a href="assault">assault</a> charge and was sentenced to <a href="anger%20management">anger management</a> classes. In November 1995, two male teenagers attempted to sue Love for allegedly punching them during a Hole concert they attended in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a> in March 1995. The judge ultimately dismissed the case on grounds that the teens "weren't exposed to any greater amount of violence than could reasonably be expected at an alternative rock concert." Love would later say that she retained little memory of 1994–1995, blaming the fact that she had been using large quantities of heroin and <a href="Flunitrazepam">Rohypnol</a> at the time.

After Hole's world tour concluded in 1996, Love made a return to acting, first in small roles in the <a href="Jean-Michel%20Basquiat">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> biopic "<a href="Basquiat%20%28film%29">Basquiat</a>" and the drama "<a href="Feeling%20Minnesota">Feeling Minnesota</a>" (1996), before landing the co-starring role of <a href="Larry%20Flynt">Larry Flynt</a>'s wife <a href="Althea%20Flynt">Althea</a> in <a href="Milo%C5%A1%20Forman">Miloš Forman</a>'s critically acclaimed 1996 film "<a href="The%20People%20vs.%20Larry%20Flynt">The People vs. Larry Flynt</a>". In order to appear in the film, Love went through rehabilitation and quit using heroin at the insistence of Forman; she was ordered to take multiple urine tests under the supervision of <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> while filming the movie, and passed all of them. Despite Columbia Pictures' initial reluctance to hire Love due to her troubled past, she received critical acclaim for her performance in the film after its release in December 1996, earning a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe</a> nomination for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture%20%E2%80%93%20Drama">Best Actress</a>, and a <a href="New%20York%20Film%20Critics%20Circle%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress</a>. Critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called her work in the film "quite a performance; Love proves she is not a rock star pretending to act, but a true actress." She won several other awards from various film critic associations for the film. During this time, Love maintained what the media noted as a more decorous public image, and she appeared in ad campaigns for <a href="Versace">Versace</a> and in a "<a href="Vogue%20Italia">Vogue Italia</a>" spread. Following the release of "The People vs. Larry Flynt", she dated her co-star <a href="Edward%20Norton">Edward Norton</a>, with whom she remained until 1999.

In late 1997, Hole released a <a href="My%20Body%2C%20the%20Hand%20Grenade">compilation album</a> and <a href="The%20First%20Session">extended play</a>, both of which featured previously-recorded material. Love subsequently attracted media attention in May 1998 after punching journalist Belissa Cohen in the face at a party; the suit was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. In September 1998, Hole released their third studio album, "<a href="Celebrity%20Skin">Celebrity Skin</a>", which featured a stark <a href="power%20pop">power pop</a> sound that contrasted with the group's earlier punk influences. Love divulged her ambition of making an album where "art meets commerce ... there are no compromises made, it has commercial appeal, and it sticks to [our] original vision." She said she was influenced by <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a>, Fleetwood Mac, and <a href="My%20Bloody%20Valentine%20%28band%29">My Bloody Valentine</a> when writing the album. Smashing Pumpkins frontman <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a> co-wrote several songs on the album. "Celebrity Skin" was well received by critics; "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" called it "accessible, fiery and intimate—often at the same time ... a basic guitar record that's anything but basic". "Celebrity Skin" went multi-platinum, and topped "Best of Year" lists at "Spin" and "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>". The album garnered the band their only No. 1 hit single on the <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart with the title track "<a href="Celebrity%20Skin%20%28song%29">Celebrity Skin</a>". The band promoted the album through MTV performances and at the 1998 <a href="Billboard%20Music%20Awards">Billboard Music Awards</a>, and were subsequently nominated for three <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s at the <a href="41st%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">41st Grammy Awards</a> ceremony.

Hole toured with <a href="Marilyn%20Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> on the <a href="Beautiful%20Monsters%20Tour">Beautiful Monsters Tour</a> in 1999, but dropped out of the tour nine dates in after a dispute over production costs between Love and Manson, in addition to the fact that Hole was forced the open for Manson under an agreement with <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a>. Hole resumed touring with <a href="Imperial%20Teen">Imperial Teen</a>. Love would later make claims that an additional reason the band left the tour was due to Manson and <a href="Korn">Korn</a>'s (whom they also toured with in Australia) sexualized treatment of teenage female audience members. Love told interviewers at <a href="WWWQ-HD2">99X.FM</a> in Atlanta: "What I really don't like—there are certain girls that like us, or like me, who are really messed up... and they do not need to be—they're very young—and they do not need to be taken and raped, or filmed having enema contests... going out into the audience and picking up fourteen and fifteen-year-old girls who obviously <a href="self-harm">cut themselves</a>, and then having to see them in the morning... it's just uncool."

Before the release and promotion of "Celebrity Skin", Love and <a href="Fender%20Musical%20Instruments%20Corporation">Fender</a> designed a low-priced <a href="Squier">Squier</a> brand guitar, called <a href="Squier%20Venus">Vista Venus</a>. The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, a little-known independent guitar manufacturer, <a href="Fender%20Stratocaster">Stratocaster</a>, and <a href="Rickenbacker">Rickenbacker</a>'s <a href="solid%20body">solid body</a> guitars and had a single-coil and a <a href="humbucker">humbucker</a> pickup, and was available in 6-string and 12-string versions. In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: "I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty ... And something that could also be your first band guitar. I didn't want it all teched out. I wanted it real simple, with just one <a href="pickup%20%28music%20technology%29">pickup switch</a>." In 1999, Love was awarded an <a href="Orville%20H.%20Gibson">Orville H. Gibson</a> award for Best Female Rock Guitarist. During this time, she also starred opposite <a href="Jim%20Carrey">Jim Carrey</a> as his longtime partner Lynne Margulies in the <a href="Andy%20Kaufman">Andy Kaufman</a> biopic "<a href="Man%20on%20the%20Moon%20%28film%29">Man on the Moon</a>" (1999), which was followed with a role as <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>'s wife <a href="Joan%20Vollmer">Joan Vollmer</a> in "<a href="Beat%20%282000%20film%29">Beat</a>" (2000) alongside <a href="Kiefer%20Sutherland">Kiefer Sutherland</a>. Love was subsequently cast as the lead in <a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a>'s sci-fi horror film "<a href="Ghosts%20of%20Mars">Ghosts of Mars</a>", but backed out of the role after injuring her foot. The part instead went to <a href="Natasha%20Henstridge">Natasha Henstridge</a>. The following year, she starred in several additional films, including in "<a href="Julie%20Johnson">Julie Johnson</a>" (2001) as <a href="Lili%20Taylor">Lili Taylor</a>'s lesbian lover, for which she won an Outstanding Actress award at L.A.'s <a href="Outfest">Outfest</a>, and in the thriller "<a href="Trapped%20%282002%20film%29">Trapped</a>" (2002), alongside <a href="Kevin%20Bacon">Kevin Bacon</a> and <a href="Charlize%20Theron">Charlize Theron</a>.

In the interim, Hole had become dormant, and in March 2001, Love began a "punk rock femme <a href="supergroup%20%28music%29">supergroup</a>" called Bastard, enlisting Schemel, <a href="Veruca%20Salt%20%28band%29">Veruca Salt</a> co-frontwoman <a href="Louise%20Post">Louise Post</a>, and bassist Gina Crosley. Post recalled of the group: "[Love] was like, 'Listen, you guys: I've been in my Malibu, manicure, movie star world for two years, alright? I wanna make a record. And let's leave all that <a href="grunge">grunge</a> shit behind us, eh? We were being so improvisational, and singing together, and with a trust developing between us. It was the shit." The group recorded a demo tape, but by September 2001, Post and Crosley had left the band, with Post citing "unhealthy and unprofessional working conditions." In May 2002, Hole formally announced their breakup amid continuing litigation with <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a> over their record contract.

After the breakup of Hole, Love began composing material with songwriter <a href="Linda%20Perry">Linda Perry</a>, and in July 2003 signed a contract with <a href="Virgin%20Records">Virgin Records</a>. She began recording her new album, titled "<a href="America%27s%20Sweetheart%20%28album%29">America's Sweetheart</a>", in France shortly after. A total of 32 songs were recorded during these sessions. A series of legal issues simultaneously occurred during this period: In February 2003, Love had been banned from <a href="Virgin%20Atlantic">Virgin Airlines</a> after being arrested at <a href="Heathrow%20Airport">Heathrow Airport</a> for disrupting a flight. In October of that year, she was arrested in Los Angeles after breaking several windows of her producer and then-boyfriend James Barber's home, and was charged with being under the influence of a controlled substance; the ordeal resulted in her temporarily losing custody of her daughter.

Virgin Records released "America's Sweetheart" in February 2004, upon which it received mixed reviews. Charles Aaron of "Spin" called it a "jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994's "Live Through This"" and awarded it eight out of ten stars, while Amy Phillips of "The Village Voice" wrote: "[Love is] willing to act out the dream of every teenage brat who ever wanted to have a glamorous, high-profile hissyfit, and she turns those egocentric nervous breakdowns into art. Sure, the art becomes less compelling when you've been pulling the same stunts for a decade. But, honestly, is there anybody out there who fucks up better?" The album sold less than 100,000 copies. Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame. Shortly after the record was released, she told <a href="Kurt%20Loder">Kurt Loder</a> on "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">TRL</a>": "I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke." 

On March 17, 2004, Love appeared on the "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>" to promote the recently-released "America's Sweetheart". Her appearance drew media coverage when, during the interview segment, she lifted her shirt multiple times, <a href="Exhibitionism">flashed</a> Letterman, and stood on his desk. A "New York Times" article noted: "The episode was not altogether surprising for Ms. Love, 39, whose most public moments have veered from extreme pathos—like the time she read the suicide note of her famous husband, Kurt Cobain, on MTV—to angry feminism to catfights to incoherent ranting." Hours later, in the early morning of March 18, Love was arrested in Manhattan for allegedly striking a 23-year-old male fan with a microphone stand during a small concert she performed at an East Village venue. She was released within hours of the incident, enabling her to perform a concert scheduled for the following evening at the <a href="Bowery%20Ballroom">Bowery Ballroom</a>. Four days later, on March 22, she called in multiple times to "<a href="The%20Howard%20Stern%20Show">The Howard Stern Show</a>", claiming in broadcast conversations with Stern that the incident had not occurred, and that actress <a href="Natasha%20Lyonne">Natasha Lyonne</a>, who was at the concert, was told by the alleged victim that he had been paid $10,000 to file a false claim leading to Love's arrest.

On July 9, 2004, Love's 40th birthday, she was arrested for failing to make a court appearance for the March 2004 charges, and taken to <a href="Bellevue%20Hospital">Bellevue Hospital</a>, allegedly incoherent, where she was placed on a 72-hour watch. According to police, she was believed to be a potential "danger to herself," but was deemed mentally sound and released to a rehab facility two days later. Amidst public criticism and press coverage, comedian <a href="Margaret%20Cho">Margaret Cho</a> published an opinion piece on her official website in defense of Love, titled "Courtney [Love] Deserves Better from Feminists," arguing that negative associations of Love with her drug and personal problems (including from feminists) overshadowed discussion of her music and, more importantly, her personal well-being. Love would ultimately plead guilty in October 2004 to <a href="disorderly%20conduct">disorderly conduct</a> over the alleged striking of the audience member.
Her appearance as a <a href="Roast%20%28comedy%29">roaster</a> on the "<a href="Comedy%20Central%20Roast">Comedy Central Roast</a>" of <a href="Pamela%20Anderson">Pamela Anderson</a> in August 2005 attracted Love further media attention due to her appearing visibly intoxicated and disheveled. One review of the program noted that Love "acted as if she belonged in a [psychiatric] institution." Six days after the show's airing, she was sentenced to a 28-day lockdown rehab program for allegedly being under the influence of a controlled substance, violating her <a href="probation">probation</a>. To avoid jail time, she accepted an additional 180-day rehab sentence in September 2005. In November 2005, after successfully completing the program, Love was discharged from the rehab center under the provision that she complete further <a href="Ambulatory%20care">outpatient</a> rehab. In subsequent interviews in the following years, she would admit to having been dealing with various addictions during this time to prescription drugs, <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>, and <a href="crack%20cocaine">crack cocaine</a>. She has stated she has been sober since completing rehabilitation in 2007, and cited her <a href="Nichiren%20Buddhism">Nichiren Buddhist</a> practice (which she began in 1989) as integral to her sobriety. 

In the midst of her legal troubles, Love had endeavors in writing and publishing: She collaborated on a semi-autobiographical <a href="manga">manga</a> titled "<a href="Princess%20Ai">Princess Ai</a>" (<a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>: プリンセス·アイ物語), which she co-wrote with Stu Levy. The manga was illustrated by Misaho Kujiradou and <a href="Ai%20Yazawa">Ai Yazawa</a>, and was released in three volumes in both the United States and Japan between 2004 and 2006. Also in 2006, she published a memoir, "", and began recording what would become her second solo album, "How Dirty Girls Get Clean", collaborating again with Perry and Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled "Loser Dust", during her time in rehab in 2005. She told "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>": "My hand-eye coordination was so bad [after the drug use], I didn't even know chords anymore. It was like my fingers were frozen. And I wasn't allowed to make noise [in rehab] ... I never thought I would work again." Tracks and demos for the album (planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled "<a href="The%20Return%20of%20Courtney%20Love">The Return of Courtney Love</a>", detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network <a href="More4">More4</a> in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of "Never Go Hungry Again", recorded during an interview for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in November, was also released. Incomplete audio clips of the song "<a href="Samantha%20%28Hole%20song%29">Samantha</a>", originating from an interview with <a href="NPR">NPR</a>, were distributed on the internet in 2007.

In March 2009, fashion designer Dawn Simorangkir brought a <a href="libel">libel</a> suit against Love concerning a defamatory post Love made on her <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account, which was eventually settled for $450,000. Several months later, in June 2009, "<a href="NME">NME</a>" published an article detailing Love's plan to reunite Hole and release a new album, "<a href="Nobody%27s%20Daughter">Nobody's Daughter</a>". In response, former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson stated in "Spin" magazine that contractually no reunion could take place without his involvement; therefore "Nobody's Daughter" would remain Love's solo record, as opposed to a "Hole" record. Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> post, claiming "he's out of his mind, Hole is my band, my name, and my Trademark". "Nobody's Daughter" was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist <a href="Micko%20Larkin">Micko Larkin</a>, Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). "Nobody's Daughter" featured material written and recorded for Love's unfinished solo album, "How Dirty Girls Get Clean", including "Pacific Coast Highway", "Letter to God", "Samantha", and "Never Go Hungry", although they were re-produced in the studio with Larkin and engineer <a href="Michael%20Beinhorn">Michael Beinhorn</a>. The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a> sound, and more acoustic guitar work than previous Hole albums.
The first single from "Nobody's Daughter" was "<a href="Skinny%20Little%20Bitch">Skinny Little Bitch</a>", released to promote the album in March 2010. The album received mixed reviews. Robert Sheffield of "Rolling Stone" gave the album three out of five, saying Love "worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the way she did on her 2004 flop, "America's Sweetheart"". Sal Cinquemani of "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" also gave the album three out of five: "It's <a href="Marianne%20Faithfull">Marianne Faithfull</a>'s substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like 'Honey' and 'For Once in Your Life'. The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date ... the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim." Love and the band toured internationally from 2010 into late 2012 promoting the record, with their pre-release shows in London and at <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a> receiving critical acclaim. In 2011, Love participated in "<a href="Hit%20So%20Hard">Hit So Hard</a>", a documentary chronicling bandmate Schemel's time in Hole. 

In May 2012, Love debuted an art collection at Fred Torres Collaborations in New York titled ""And She's Not Even Pretty"", which contained over forty drawings and paintings by Love composed in ink, colored pencil, pastels, and watercolors. Later in the year, she collaborated with <a href="Michael%20Stipe">Michael Stipe</a> on the track "Rio Grande" for <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a>'s sea shanty album "", and in 2013, co-wrote and contributed vocals on "Rat A Tat" from <a href="Fall%20Out%20Boy">Fall Out Boy</a>'s album "<a href="Save%20Rock%20and%20Roll">Save Rock and Roll</a>", also appearing in the song's music video.

After dropping the Hole name and performing as a solo artist in December 2012 and January 2013, Love appeared in advertisements for <a href="Yves%20Saint%20Laurent%20%28brand%29">Yves Saint Laurent</a> alongside <a href="Kim%20Gordon">Kim Gordon</a> and <a href="Ariel%20Pink">Ariel Pink</a>. Love completed a solo tour of North America in mid-2013, which was purported to be in promotion of an upcoming solo album; however, it was ultimately dubbed a "greatest hits" tour, and featured songs from Love's and Hole's back catalogue. Love told "Billboard" at the time that she had recorded eight songs in the studio.

Love was subject of a second landmark <a href="libel">libel</a> lawsuit brought against her in January 2014 by her former attorney Rhonda Holmes, who accused Love of online defamation, seeking $8 million in damages. It was the first case of alleged Twitter-based libel in U.S. history to make it to trial. The jury, however, found in Love's favor. A subsequent defamation lawsuit filed by fashion Simorangkir in February 2014, however, resulted in Love being ordered to pay a further $350,000 in recompense. 

On April 22, 2014, Love debuted the song "<a href="You%20Know%20My%20Name%20%28Courtney%20Love%20song%29">You Know My Name</a>" on <a href="BBC%20Radio%206">BBC Radio 6</a> to promote her tour of the United Kingdom. It was released as a double A-side single with the song "<a href="Wedding%20Day%20%28song%29">Wedding Day</a>" on May 4, 2014, on her own label Cherry Forever Records via <a href="Kobalt%20Label%20Services">Kobalt Label Services</a>. The tracks were produced by Michael Beinhorn, and feature <a href="Tommy%20Lee">Tommy Lee</a> on drums. In an interview with the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, Love revealed that she and former Hole guitarist Eric Erlandson had reconciled, and had been rehearsing new material together, along with former bassist Melissa Auf der Maur and drummer Patty Schemel, though she did not confirm a reunion of the band. On May 1, 2014, in an interview with "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>", Love commented further on the possibility of Hole reuniting, saying:
"I'm not going to commit to it happening, because we want an element of surprise. There's a lot of "i"s to be dotted and "t"s to be crossed."
Love was cast in several television series in supporting parts throughout 2014 including the <a href="FX%20Network">FX</a> series "<a href="Sons%20of%20Anarchy">Sons of Anarchy</a>", "<a href="Revenge%20%28TV%20series%29">Revenge</a>", and <a href="Lee%20Daniels">Lee Daniels</a>' network series "<a href="Empire%20%282015%20TV%20series%29">Empire</a>" in a recurring guest role as <a href="Empire%20%28season%201%29%23Cast%20and%20characters">Elle Dallas</a>. The track "Walk Out on Me" featuring Love was included on the "" album, which debuted at number 1 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">Billboard 200</a>. <a href="Alexis%20Petridis">Alexis Petridis</a> of "<a href="The%20Guardian%20%28newspaper%29">The Guardian</a>" praised the track, saying: "The idea of Courtney Love singing a ballad with a group of gospel singers seems faintly terrifying ... the reality is brilliant. Love's voice fits the careworn lyrics, effortlessly summoning the kind of ravaged darkness that Lana Del Rey nearly ruptures herself trying to conjure up."

In January 2015, Love starred in a New York City stage production titled "Kansas City Choir Boy", a "pop opera" conceived by and co-starring Todd Almond. Charles Isherwood of "The New York Times" praised her performance, noting a "soft-edged and bewitching" stage presence, adding: "Her voice, never the most supple or rangy of instruments, retains the singular sound that made her an electrifying front woman for the band Hole: a single sustained noted can seem to simultaneously contain a plea, a wound and a threat." The show toured later in the year, with performances in Boston and Los Angeles. Love saw further legal troubles in April 2015 when journalist <a href="Anthony%20Bozza">Anthony Bozza</a> sued her over an alleged contractual violation regarding his co-writing of her memoir. Love subsequently joined <a href="Lana%20Del%20Rey">Lana Del Rey</a> on her <a href="The%20Endless%20Summer%20Tour">Endless Summer Tour</a>, performing as an opener on the tour's eight West Coast shows in May–June 2015. During her tenure on Del Rey's tour, Love debuted a new single, "<a href="Miss%20Narcissist">Miss Narcissist</a>", released on <a href="Wavves">Wavves</a>' independent label Ghost Ramp. She also was cast in a supporting role in <a href="James%20Franco">James Franco</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Long%20Home">The Long Home</a>", based on <a href="William%20Gay%20%28author%29">William Gay</a>'s novel of the same name, marking her first film role in over ten years. 

In January 2016, Love released a clothing line in collaboration with <a href="Sophia%20Amoruso">Sophia Amoruso</a> titled "Love, Courtney", featuring eighteen pieces reflecting her personal style. In November 2016, she began filming the <a href="television%20pilot">pilot</a> for "A Midsummer's Nightmare", a Shakespeare anthology series adapted for <a href="Lifetime%20%28TV%20network%29">Lifetime</a>. She then starred as Kitty Menendez in "", a biopic television film based on the lives of <a href="Lyle%20and%20Erik%20Menendez">Lyle and Erik Menendez</a>, which premiered on Lifetime in June 2017. The same year, she was cast in <a href="Justin%20Kelly%20%28director%29">Justin Kelly</a>'s biopic "<a href="JT%20LeRoy%20%28film%29">JT LeRoy</a>", opposite <a href="Laura%20Dern">Laura Dern</a>, <a href="Kristen%20Stewart">Kristen Stewart</a>, <a href="Diane%20Kruger">Diane Kruger</a>, and <a href="Kelvin%20Harrison%20Jr.">Kelvin Harrison Jr.</a>. In March 2018, Love appeared in the music video for Marilyn Manson's "<a href="Tattooed%20in%20Reverse">Tattooed in Reverse</a>," which she followed with an April 5 guest-judge appearance on "<a href="RuPaul%27s%20Drag%20Race">RuPaul's Drag Race</a>". 

In December 2018, Love filed and was awarded a <a href="restraining%20order">restraining order</a> against <a href="Sam%20Lutfi">Sam Lutfi</a>, who had acted as her manager for the previous six years, alleging verbal abuse and harassment. Her daughter, Frances, and sister, Jaimee, were also awarded restraining orders against Lutfi. In January 2019, a Los Angeles County judge extended the three-year duration of the order to a total of five years, citing Lutfi's apparent tendency to "prey upon people."

Love has been candid about her diverse musical influences, the earliest being <a href="Patti%20Smith">Patti Smith</a>, <a href="The%20Runaways">The Runaways</a>, and <a href="The%20Pretenders">The Pretenders</a>, artists she discovered while in juvenile hall at age fifteen. As a child, her first exposure to music was records that her parents retrieved each month through <a href="Columbia%20House">Columbia Record Club</a>. The first record Love owned was <a href="Leonard%20Cohen">Leonard Cohen</a>'s "<a href="Songs%20of%20Leonard%20Cohen">Songs of Leonard Cohen</a>" (1967), which she obtained from her mother: "He was so lyric-conscious and morbid, and I was a pretty morbid kid," she recalled. As a teenager, she named <a href="Flipper%20%28band%29">Flipper</a>, <a href="Kate%20Bush">Kate Bush</a>, <a href="Soft%20Cell">Soft Cell</a>, <a href="Joni%20Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a>, <a href="Laura%20Nyro">Laura Nyro</a>, <a href="Lou%20Reed">Lou Reed</a>, and <a href="Dead%20Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> among her favorite artists. She has also spoken of her appreciation for <a href="new%20wave%20music">new wave</a> and post-punk bands she became acquainted with while living as a teenager in the United Kingdom, such as <a href="Echo%20and%20the%20Bunnymen">Echo and the Bunnymen</a>, <a href="The%20Smiths">The Smiths</a>, <a href="Siouxsie%20and%20the%20Banshees">Siouxsie and the Banshees</a>, <a href="Television%20%28band%29">Television</a>, <a href="Bauhaus%20%28band%29">Bauhaus</a>, and <a href="Joy%20Division">Joy Division</a>.

While in Dublin at age fifteen, Love attended a <a href="Virgin%20Prunes">Virgin Prunes</a> concert, an event she credited as being a pivotal influence: "I had never seen so much sex, snarl, poetry, evil, restraint, grace, filth, raw power and the very essence of rock and roll," she recalled. "[I had seen] <a href="U2">U2</a> [who] gave me lashes of love and inspiration, and a few nights later the Virgin Prunes fuckedmeup." Decades later, in 2009, Love introduced the band's frontman <a href="Gavin%20Friday">Gavin Friday</a> at a <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> event, and performed a song with him.

Love's diverse genre interests were illustrated in a 1991 interview with "Flipside", in which she stated: "There's a part of me that wants to have a <a href="grindcore">grindcore</a> band and another that wants to have a <a href="Raspberries%20%28band%29">Raspberries</a>-type pop band." Discussing the abrasive sound of Hole's debut album, she said she felt she had to "catch up with all my hip peers who'd gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking <a href="R.E.M.%20%28band%29">R.E.M.</a> and The Smiths." She has also embraced the influence of experimental artists and punk rock groups, including <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a>, <a href="Swans%20%28band%29">Swans</a>, <a href="Big%20Black">Big Black</a>, <a href="Diamanda%20Gal%C3%A1s">Diamanda Galás</a>, the <a href="Germs%20%28band%29">Germs</a>, and <a href="The%20Stooges">The Stooges</a>. While writing "Celebrity Skin", she drew influence from <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a> and <a href="My%20Bloody%20Valentine%20%28band%29">My Bloody Valentine</a>. She has also cited her contemporary <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a> as an influence, saying: "The one rock star that makes me know I'm shit is Polly Harvey. I'm nothing next to the purity that she experiences." In 2014, she named "<a href="Bitter%20Sweet%20Symphony">Bitter Sweet Symphony</a>" by <a href="The%20Verve">The Verve</a> as one of her favorite songs.

Literature and poetry have often been a major influence on her songwriting; Love said she had "always wanted to be a poet, but there was no money in it." She has named the works of <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a> and <a href="Charles%20Baudelaire">Charles Baudelaire</a> as influential, and referenced works by <a href="Dante%20Gabriel%20Rossetti">Dante Rossetti</a>, <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>, and <a href="Anne%20Sexton">Anne Sexton</a> in her lyrics.

Musically, Love's work with Hole and her solo efforts have been characterized as <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>. "Spin"s October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, she stated that Hole had "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I always talked about it, if you go back ... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework."

Love's lyrical content is composed from a female's point of view, and her lyrics have been described as "literate and mordant" and noted by scholars for "articulating a <a href="third-wave%20feminism">third-wave feminist</a> consciousness." <a href="Simon%20Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a>, in reviewing Hole's debut album, noted: "Ms. Love's songs explore the full spectrum of female emotions, from vulnerability to rage. The songs are fueled by adolescent traumas, feelings of disgust about the body, passionate friendships with women and the desire to escape domesticity. Her lyrical style could be described as emotional nudism." Journalist and critic <a href="Kim%20France">Kim France</a>, in critiquing Love's lyrics, referred to her as a "dark genius" and likened her work to that of Anne Sexton.

Love has remarked that lyrics have always been the most important component of songwriting for her: "The important thing for me...  is it has to look good on the page. I mean, you can love <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> and not love their lyrics...  but I made a big effort in my career to have what’s on the page mean something." A great deal of her songwriting has been <a href="diary">diaristic</a> in nature. Common themes present in Love's songs during her early career included body image, rape, suicide, conformity, elitism, pregnancy, prostitution, and death. In a 1991 interview with <a href="Everett%20True">Everett True</a>, she said: "I try to place [beautiful imagery] next to fucked up imagery, because that's how I view things ... I sometimes feel that no one's taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there's a certain female point of view that's never been given space."

Critics have noted that Love's later musical work is more lyrically introspective. "Celebrity Skin" and "America's Sweetheart" are lyrically centered on celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while continuing Love's interest in vanity and body image. "Nobody's Daughter" was lyrically reflective of Love's past relationships and her struggle for sobriety, with the majority of its lyrics written while she was in rehab in 2006.

Love possesses a <a href="contralto">contralto</a> vocal range, and her vocal style has been described as "raw and distinctive." According to Love, she never wanted to be a singer, but rather aspired to be a skilled guitarist: "I'm such a lazy bastard though that I never did that," she said. "I was always the only person with the nerve to sing, and so I got stuck with it." She has been regularly noted by critics for her husky vocals as well as her "<a href="banshee">banshee</a> [-like]" <a href="screaming%20%28music%29">screaming</a> abilities. Her vocals have been compared to those of <a href="Johnny%20Rotten">Johnny Rotten</a>, and David Fricke of "Rolling Stone" described them as "lung-busting" and "a corrosive, lunatic wail." Upon the release of Hole's 2010 album, "Nobody's Daughter", <a href="Amanda%20Petrusich">Amanda Petrusich</a> of "Pitchfork" compared Love's raspy, unpolished vocals to those of <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>.

She has played a variety of <a href="Fender%20Musical%20Instruments%20Corporation">Fender</a> guitars throughout her career, including a <a href="Fender%20Jaguar">Jaguar</a> and a vintage 1965 <a href="Fender%20Jazzmaster">Jazzmaster</a>; the latter was purchased by the <a href="Hard%20Rock%20Cafe">Hard Rock Cafe</a> and is on display in New York City. Between 1989 and 1991, Love primarily played a <a href="Rickenbacker">Rickenbacker</a> 425 because she "preferred the 3/4 neck," but she destroyed the guitar onstage at a 1991 concert opening for The Smashing Pumpkins. In the mid-1990s, she often played a guitar made by Mercury, an obscure company that manufactured custom guitars, as well as a <a href="Univox%20Hi-Flier">Univox Hi-Flier</a>. Fender's <a href="Vista%20Venus">Vista Venus</a>, designed by Love in 1998, was partially inspired by Rickenbacker guitars as well as her Mercury. During tours after the release of "Nobody's Daughter" (post-2010), Love has played a <a href="Rickenbacker%20360">Rickenbacker 360</a> onstage. Her setup has included Fender tube gear, <a href="Matchless%20Amplifiers">Matchless</a>, <a href="Ampeg">Ampeg</a>, Silvertone and a solid-state 1976 Randall Commander.

Love has referred to herself as "a shit guitar player," further commenting in a 2014 interview: "I can still write a song, but [the guitar playing] sounds like shit ... I used to be a good <a href="rhythm%20guitar">rhythm</a> player but I am no longer dependable." Throughout her career, she has also garnered a reputation for unpredictable live shows. In the 1990s, her performances with Hole were characterized by confrontational behavior, with Love stage diving, smashing guitars or throwing them into the audience, wandering into the crowd at the end of sets, and engaging in sometimes incoherent rants. Critics and journalists have noted Love for her comical, often stream-of-consciousness-like stage banter. In a review of a live performance published in 2010, it was noted that Love's onstage "one-liners [were] worthy of the <a href="The%20Comedy%20Store">Comedy Store</a>." 

In 1993, Love and husband Kurt Cobain performed an acoustic set together at the Rock Against Rape benefit in Los Angeles, which raised awareness and provided resources for victims of sexual abuse. In 2000, Love publicly advocated for reform of the record industry in a personal letter published by "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>". In the letter, Love said: "It's not <a href="music%20piracy">piracy</a> when kids swap music over the Internet using <a href="Napster">Napster</a> or <a href="Gnutella">Gnutella</a> or <a href="Freenet">Freenet</a> or <a href="iMesh">iMesh</a> or beaming their CDs into a <a href="MP3.com">My.MP3.com</a> or MyPlay.com music locker. It's piracy when those guys that run those companies make side deals with the cartel lawyers and label heads so that they can be 'the label's' friend', and not the artists." In a subsequent interview with <a href="Carrie%20Fisher">Carrie Fisher</a>, she said that she was interested in starting a <a href="trade%20union">union</a> for recording artists, and also discussed <a href="race%20relations">race relations</a> in the music industry, advocating for record companies to "put money back into the black community [whom] white people have been stealing from for years."

Love has been a long-standing supporter of <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> causes. She has frequently collaborated with <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Gay%20and%20Lesbian%20Center">Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center</a>, taking part in the center's "An Evening with Women" events. The proceeds of the event help provide food and shelter for homeless youth; services for seniors; legal assistance; domestic violence services; health and mental health services, and cultural arts programs. Love participated with Linda Perry for the event in 2012, and performed alongside <a href="Aimee%20Mann">Aimee Mann</a> and comedian <a href="Wanda%20Sykes">Wanda Sykes</a>. Speaking on her collaboration on the event, Love said: "Seven thousand kids in Los Angeles a year go out on the street, and forty percent of those kids are <a href="gay">gay</a>, <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a>, or <a href="transgender">transgender</a>ed. They <a href="coming%20out%20of%20the%20closet">come out</a> to their parents, and become homeless... for whatever reason, I don't really know why, but gay men have a lot of foundations—I've played many of them—but the lesbian side of it doesn't have as much money and/or donors, so we're excited that this has grown to cover women and women's affairs."

She has also contributed to <a href="HIV/AIDS">AIDS</a> organizations, partaking in benefits for <a href="amfAR%2C%20The%20Foundation%20for%20AIDS%20Research">amfAR</a> and the <a href="Product%20Red">RED Campaign</a>. In May 2011, she donated six of her husband Cobain's personal vinyl records for auction at <a href="Mariska%20Hargitay">Mariska Hargitay</a>'s Joyful Heart Foundation event for victims of child abuse, rape, and domestic violence. She has also supported the <a href="Murder%20of%20Sophie%20Lancaster">Sophie Lancaster Foundation</a>.

Love has had a notable impact on female-fronted alternative acts and performers. She has been cited as influential on young female instrumentalists in particular, having once infamously proclaimed: "I want every girl in the world to pick up a guitar and start screaming... I strap on that motherfucking guitar and you cannot fuck with me. That's my feeling." In "The Electric Guitar: A History of an American Icon", it is noted: 

With over 3 million records sold in the United States alone, Hole became one of the most successful rock bands of all time fronted by a woman. <a href="VH1">VH1</a> ranked Love 69 in their list of "The 100 Greatest Women in Music History" in 2012. In 2015, the "<a href="Phoenix%20New%20Times">Phoenix New Times</a>" declared Love the number one greatest female rock star of all time, writing: "To build a perfect rock star, there are several crucial ingredients: musical talent, physical attractiveness, tumultuous relationships, substance abuse, and public meltdowns, just to name a few. These days, Love seems to have rebounded from her epic tailspin and has leveled out in a slightly more normal manner, but there's no doubt that her life to date is the type of story people wouldn't believe in a novel or a movie."

Among the alternative musicians who have cited Love as an influence are <a href="Scout%20Niblett">Scout Niblett</a>; <a href="Brody%20Dalle">Brody Dalle</a> of <a href="The%20Distillers">The Distillers</a>; Dee Dee Penny of <a href="Dum%20Dum%20Girls">Dum Dum Girls</a>; and <a href="Nine%20Black%20Alps">Nine Black Alps</a>. Contemporary female pop artists <a href="Lana%20Del%20Rey">Lana Del Rey</a>, <a href="Avril%20Lavigne">Avril Lavigne</a>, <a href="Tove%20Lo">Tove Lo</a>, and <a href="Sky%20Ferreira">Sky Ferreira</a> have also cited Love as an influence. Love has frequently been recognized as the most high-profile contributor of <a href="Feminism%23Music">feminist music</a> during the 1990s, and for "subverting [the] mainstream expectations of how a woman should look, act, and sound." According to music journalist <a href="Maria%20Raha">Maria Raha</a>, "Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism." <a href="Patti%20Smith">Patti Smith</a>, a major influence of Love's, also praised her, saying: "I hate genderizing things ... [but] when I heard Hole, I was amazed to hear a girl sing like that. <a href="Janis%20Joplin">Janis Joplin</a> was her own thing; she was into <a href="Big%20Mama%20Thornton">Big Mama Thornton</a> and <a href="Bessie%20Smith">Bessie Smith</a>. But what Courtney Love does, I'd never heard a girl do that."

She has also been noted as a <a href="gay%20icon">gay icon</a> since the mid-1990s, and has jokingly referred to her fanbase as consisting of "females, gay guys, and a few advanced, evolved heterosexual men." Love's aesthetic image, particularly in the early 1990s, also became influential, and was dubbed "<a href="kinderwhore">kinderwhore</a>" by critics and media. The subversive fashion mainly consisted of vintage <a href="babydoll">babydoll</a> dresses accompanied by smeared makeup and red lipstick. <a href="MTV">MTV</a> reporter <a href="Kurt%20Loder">Kurt Loder</a> described Love as looking like "a debauched rag doll" onstage. Love later said she had been influenced by the fashion of <a href="Chrissy%20Amphlett">Chrissy Amphlett</a> of the <a href="Divinyls">Divinyls</a>.

Californium

Californium is a <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a> <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Cf and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 98. The element was first synthesized in 1950 at the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a> (then the University of California Radiation Laboratory), by bombarding <a href="curium">curium</a> with <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s (<a href="helium-4">helium-4</a> <a href="ion">ion</a>s). It is an <a href="actinide">actinide</a> element, the sixth <a href="transuranium%20element">transuranium element</a> to be <a href="synthetic%20element">synthesized</a>, and has the second-highest atomic mass of all the elements that have been produced in amounts large enough to see with the <a href="naked%20eye">unaided eye</a> (after <a href="einsteinium">einsteinium</a>). The element was named after the university and the state of <a href="California">California</a>.

Two <a href="Crystal%20structure">crystalline forms</a> exist for californium under normal pressure: one above and one below . A third form exists at high pressure. Californium slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature. <a href="Compounds%20of%20californium">Compounds of californium</a> are dominated by the +3 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>. The most stable of californium's twenty known <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s is californium-251, which has a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 898 years. This short half-life means the element is not found in significant quantities in the Earth's crust. Californium-252, with a half-life of about 2.645 years, is the most common isotope used and is produced at the <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> in the United States and the <a href="Research%20Institute%20of%20Atomic%20Reactors">Research Institute of Atomic Reactors</a> in Russia.

Californium is one of the few transuranium elements that have practical applications. Most of these applications exploit the property of certain <a href="isotopes%20of%20californium">isotopes of californium</a> to emit <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s. For example, californium can be used to help start up <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s, and it is employed as a source of neutrons when studying materials using <a href="neutron%20diffraction">neutron diffraction</a> and <a href="neutron%20spectroscopy">neutron spectroscopy</a>. Californium can also be used in nuclear synthesis of higher mass elements; <a href="oganesson">oganesson</a> (element 118) was synthesized by bombarding californium-249 atoms with <a href="calcium-48">calcium-48</a> ions. Users of californium must take into account radiological concerns and the element's ability to disrupt the formation of <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s by <a href="Bioaccumulation">bioaccumulating</a> in skeletal tissue.

Californium is a silvery white <a href="actinide">actinide</a> metal with a <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> of and an estimated <a href="boiling%20point">boiling point</a> of . The pure metal is malleable and is easily cut with a razor blade. Californium metal starts to vaporize above when exposed to a vacuum. Below californium metal is either <a href="Ferromagnetism">ferromagnetic</a> or <a href="Ferrimagnetism">ferrimagnetic</a> (it acts like a magnet), between 48 and 66 K it is <a href="antiferromagnetic">antiferromagnetic</a> (an intermediate state), and above it is <a href="Paramagnetism">paramagnetic</a> (external magnetic fields can make it magnetic). It forms <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s with <a href="lanthanide">lanthanide</a> metals but little is known about them.

The element has two <a href="Crystal%20structure">crystalline forms</a> under 1 standard atmosphere of pressure: a double-<a href="Close-packing%20of%20spheres">hexagonal close-packed</a> form dubbed alpha (α) and a <a href="Cubic%20crystal%20system">face-centered cubic</a> form designated beta (β). The α form exists below 600–800 °C with a density of 15.10 g/cm and the β form exists above 600–800 °C with a density of 8.74 g/cm. At 48 <a href="pascal%20%28unit%29">GPa</a> of pressure the β form changes into an <a href="orthorhombic%20crystal%20system">orthorhombic crystal system</a> due to delocalization of the atom's <a href="Electron%20shell">5f electrons</a>, which frees them to bond.

The <a href="bulk%20modulus">bulk modulus</a> of a material is a measure of its resistance to uniform pressure. Californium's bulk modulus is , which is similar to trivalent lanthanide metals but smaller than more familiar metals, such as aluminium (70 GPa).

Californium exhibits oxidation states of 4, 3, or 2. It typically forms eight or nine bonds to surrounding atoms or ions. Its chemical properties are predicted to be similar to other primarily 3+ valence actinide elements and the element <a href="dysprosium">dysprosium</a>, which is the lanthanide above californium in the periodic table. The element slowly tarnishes in air at room temperature, with the rate increasing when moisture is added. Californium reacts when heated with <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a>, <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, or a <a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a> (oxygen family element); reactions with dry hydrogen and aqueous <a href="mineral%20acid">mineral acid</a>s are rapid. 

Californium is only <a href="aqueous%20solution">water-soluble</a> as the californium(III) <a href="cation">cation</a>. Attempts to <a href="redox">reduce or oxidize</a> the +3 ion in solution have failed. The element forms a water-soluble <a href="chloride">chloride</a>, <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>, <a href="perchlorate">perchlorate</a>, and <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a> and is precipitated as a <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a>, <a href="oxalate">oxalate</a>, or <a href="hydroxide">hydroxide</a>. Californium is the heaviest actinide to exhibit covalent properties, as is observed in the californium borate.

Twenty <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s of californium have been characterized, the most stable being californium-251 with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 898 years, californium-249 with a half-life of 351 years, californium-250 with a half-life of 13.08 years, and californium-252 with a half-life of 2.645 years. All the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than a year, and the majority of these have half-lives shorter than 20 minutes. The isotopes of californium range in <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> from 237 to 256.

Californium-249 is formed from the <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a> of berkelium-249, and most other californium isotopes are made by subjecting berkelium to intense neutron radiation in a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>. Although californium-251 has the longest half-life, its production yield is only 10% due to its tendency to collect neutrons (high <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a>) and its tendency to interact with other particles (high <a href="neutron%20cross-section">neutron cross-section</a>).

Californium-252 is a very strong <a href="neutron">neutron</a> emitter, which makes it extremely <a href="radioactive">radioactive</a> and harmful. Californium-252 undergoes <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> 96.9% of the time to form <a href="curium">curium</a>-248 while the remaining 3.1% of decays are <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a>. One <a href="microgram">microgram</a> (µg) of californium-252 emits 2.3 million neutrons per second, an average of 3.7 neutrons per spontaneous fission. Most of the other isotopes of californium decay to isotopes of curium (<a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 96) via alpha decay.

Californium was <a href="discovery%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">first synthesized</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a> <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a> in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley</a>, by the physics researchers <a href="Stanley%20Gerald%20Thompson">Stanley G. Thompson</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Street%2C%20Jr.">Kenneth Street, Jr.</a>, <a href="Albert%20Ghiorso">Albert Ghiorso</a>, and <a href="Glenn%20T.%20Seaborg">Glenn T. Seaborg</a> on or about February 9, 1950. It was the sixth <a href="transuranium%20element">transuranium element</a> to be discovered; the team announced its discovery on March 17, 1950.

To produce californium, a microgram-sized target of curium-242 () was bombarded with 35 MeV-<a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s () in the <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> at Berkeley, which produced californium-245 () plus one <a href="free%20neutron">free neutron</a> ().
Only about 5,000 atoms of californium were produced in this experiment, and these atoms had a half-life of 44 minutes.

The discoverers named the new element after the university and the state. This was a break from the convention used for elements 95 to 97, which drew inspiration from how the elements directly above them in the periodic table were named. However, the element directly above element 98 in the periodic table, <a href="dysprosium">dysprosium</a>, has a name that simply means "hard to get at" so the researchers decided to set aside the informal naming convention. They added that "the best we can do is to point out [that] ... searchers a century ago found it difficult to get to California."

Weighable quantities of californium were first produced by the irradiation of plutonium targets at the <a href="Materials%20Testing%20Reactor">Materials Testing Reactor</a> at the <a href="Idaho%20National%20Laboratory">National Reactor Testing Station</a> in <a href="eastern%20Idaho">eastern Idaho</a>; and these findings were reported in 1954. The high spontaneous fission rate of californium-252 was observed in these samples. The first experiment with californium in concentrated form occurred in 1958. The isotopes californium-249 to californium-252 were isolated that same year from a sample of <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a> that had been irradiated with neutrons in a nuclear reactor for five years. Two years later, in 1960, <a href="Burris%20Cunningham">Burris Cunningham</a> and <a href="James%20Wallman">James Wallman</a> of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory of the University of California created the first californium compounds—californium trichloride, <a href="californium%20oxychloride">californium oxychloride</a>, and californium oxide—by treating californium with steam and hydrochloric acid.

The <a href="High%20Flux%20Isotope%20Reactor">High Flux Isotope Reactor</a> (HFIR) at the <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) in <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, started producing small batches of californium in the 1960s. By 1995, the HFIR nominally produced of californium annually. Plutonium supplied by the United Kingdom to the United States under the <a href="1958%20US-UK%20Mutual%20Defence%20Agreement">1958 US-UK Mutual Defence Agreement</a> was used for californium production.

The <a href="U.S.%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a> sold californium-252 to industrial and academic customers in the early 1970s for $10 per microgram and an average of of californium-252 were shipped each year from 1970 to 1990. Californium metal was first prepared in 1974 by Haire and Baybarz who reduced californium(III) oxide with lanthanum metal to obtain microgram amounts of sub-micrometer thick films.

Traces of californium can be found near facilities that use the element in mineral prospecting and in medical treatments. The element is fairly insoluble in water, but it adheres well to ordinary soil; and concentrations of it in the soil can be 500 times higher than in the water surrounding the soil particles.

<a href="Fallout">Fallout</a> from atmospheric <a href="nuclear%20testing">nuclear testing</a> prior to 1980 contributed a small amount of californium to the environment. Californium isotopes with <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a>s 249, 252, 253, and 254 have been observed in the radioactive dust collected from the air after a nuclear explosion. Californium is not a major radionuclide at <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> legacy sites since it was not produced in large quantities.

Californium was once believed to be produced in <a href="supernova">supernova</a>s, as their decay matches the 60-day half-life of Cf. However, subsequent studies failed to demonstrate any californium spectra, and supernova light curves are now thought to follow the decay of <a href="Isotopes%20of%20nickel">nickel-56</a>.

The <a href="transuranic%20element">transuranic element</a>s from <a href="americium">americium</a> to <a href="fermium">fermium</a>, including californium, occurred naturally in the <a href="natural%20nuclear%20fission%20reactor">natural nuclear fission reactor</a> at <a href="Oklo">Oklo</a>, but no longer do so.

Californium is produced in <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s and <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a>s. Californium-250 is made by bombarding berkelium-249 () with neutrons, forming berkelium-250 () via <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> (n,γ) which, in turn, quickly <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>s (β) to californium-250 () in the following reaction:
Bombardment of californium-250 with neutrons produces californium-251 and californium-252.

Prolonged irradiation of <a href="americium">americium</a>, curium, and plutonium with neutrons produces milligram amounts of californium-252 and microgram amounts of californium-249. As of 2006, curium isotopes 244 to 248 are irradiated by neutrons in special reactors to produce primarily californium-252 with lesser amounts of isotopes 249 to 255.

Microgram quantities of californium-252 are available for commercial use through the U.S. <a href="Nuclear%20Regulatory%20Commission">Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>. Only two sites produce californium-252: the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States, and the <a href="Research%20Institute%20of%20Atomic%20Reactors">Research Institute of Atomic Reactors</a> in <a href="Dimitrovgrad%2C%20Russia">Dimitrovgrad, Russia</a>. As of 2003, the two sites produce 0.25 grams and 0.025 grams of californium-252 per year, respectively.

Three californium isotopes with significant half-lives are produced, requiring a total of 15 neutron captures by <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> without <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> or alpha decay occurring during the process. Californium-253 is at the end of a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several <a href="isotopes%20of%20plutonium">isotopes of plutonium</a>, <a href="isotopes%20of%20americium">americium</a>, <a href="isotopes%20of%20curium">curium</a>, <a href="isotopes%20of%20berkelium">berkelium</a>, and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).

Californium-252 has a number of specialized applications as a strong neutron emitter, and each microgram of fresh californium produces 139 million neutrons per minute. This property makes californium useful as a <a href="neutron%20startup%20source">neutron startup source</a> for some nuclear reactors and as a portable (non-reactor based) neutron source for <a href="neutron%20activation%20analysis">neutron activation analysis</a> to detect trace amounts of elements in samples. Neutrons from californium are employed as a treatment of certain <a href="Cervical%20cancer">cervical</a> and <a href="brain%20cancer">brain cancer</a>s where other <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a> is ineffective. It has been used in educational applications since 1969 when the <a href="Georgia%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Georgia Institute of Technology</a> received a loan of 119 µg of californium-252 from the <a href="Savannah%20River%20Plant">Savannah River Plant</a>. It is also used with online elemental <a href="coal%20analyzer">coal analyzer</a>s and <a href="bulk%20material%20analyzer">bulk material analyzer</a>s in the coal and cement industries.

Neutron penetration into materials makes californium useful in detection instruments such as <a href="fuel%20rod">fuel rod</a> scanners; <a href="neutron%20radiography">neutron radiography</a> of aircraft and weapons components to detect <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a>, bad welds, cracks and trapped moisture; and in portable metal detectors. <a href="Neutron%20moisture%20gauge">Neutron moisture gauge</a>s use californium-252 to find water and petroleum layers in oil wells, as a portable <a href="neutron%20source">neutron source</a> for gold and silver prospecting for on-the-spot analysis, and to detect ground water movement. The major uses of californium-252 in 1982 were, in order of use, reactor start-up (48.3%), fuel rod scanning (25.3%), and activation analysis (19.4%). By 1994 most californium-252 was used in neutron radiography (77.4%), with fuel rod scanning (12.1%) and reactor start-up (6.9%) as important but distant secondary uses.

Californium-251 has a very small calculated <a href="critical%20mass%20%28nuclear%29">critical mass</a> of about , high lethality, and a relatively short period of toxic environmental irradiation. The low critical mass of californium led to some exaggerated claims about possible uses for the element.

In October 2006, researchers announced that three atoms of <a href="oganesson">oganesson</a> (element 118) had been identified at the <a href="Joint%20Institute%20for%20Nuclear%20Research">Joint Institute for Nuclear Research</a> in <a href="Dubna">Dubna</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, as the product of bombardment of californium-249 with <a href="calcium">calcium</a>-48, making it the heaviest element ever synthesized. The target for this experiment contained about 10 mg of californium-249 deposited on a titanium foil of 32 cm area. Californium has also been used to produce other transuranium elements; for example, element 103 (later named <a href="lawrencium">lawrencium</a>) was first synthesized in 1961 by bombarding californium with <a href="boron">boron</a> nuclei.

Californium that <a href="bioaccumulate">bioaccumulate</a>s in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the body's ability to form <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s. The element plays no natural biological role in any organism due to its intense radioactivity and low concentration in the environment.

Californium can enter the body from ingesting contaminated food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be deposited in the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium deposited in the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.

The element is most dangerous if taken into the body. In addition, californium-249 and californium-251 can cause tissue damage externally, through <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a> emission. <a href="Ionizing%20radiation">Ionizing radiation</a> emitted by californium on bone and in the liver can cause cancer.
