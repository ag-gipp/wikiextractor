Northern bald ibis

The northern bald ibis, hermit ibis, or waldrapp ("Geronticus eremita") is a migratory bird found in barren, semi-desert or rocky habitats, often close to running water. This glossy black <a href="ibis">ibis</a>, which, unlike many members of the ibis family, is non-wading, has an unfeathered red face and head, and a long, curved red bill. It breeds colonially on coastal or mountain cliff ledges, where it typically lays two to three eggs in a stick nest, and feeds on lizards, insects, and other small animals.

The northern bald ibis was once widespread across the Middle East, northern Africa, southern and central Europe, with a fossil record dating back at least 1.8 million years. It disappeared from Europe over 300 years ago, although reintroduction programs in the region are underway. There are believed to be about 500 wild birds remaining in southern <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, and fewer than 10 in <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, where it was rediscovered in 2002. To combat this ebb in numbers, recent <a href="reintroduction">reintroduction</a> programs have been instituted internationally, with a semi-wild breeding colony in Turkey, as well as sites in Austria, Spain, and northern Morocco. These programs helped to downlist the northern bald ibis from <a href="Critically%20endangered">Critically Endangered</a> to <a href="Endangered%20species">Endangered</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> in 2018.

The reasons for the species' long-term decline are unclear, but hunting, loss of foraging habitat, and <a href="pesticide%20poisoning">pesticide poisoning</a> have been implicated in the rapid loss of colonies in recent decades.

The ibises are gregarious, long-legged wading birds with long down-curved bills. Along with the <a href="spoonbill">spoonbill</a>s they form one subfamily within the family <a href="Threskiornithidae">Threskiornithidae</a>. The northern bald ibis' closest relative, and the only other member of the genus, is the <a href="southern%20bald%20ibis">southern bald ibis</a>, "G. calvus", of southern Africa. The two "Geronticus" species differ from other ibises in that they have unfeathered faces and heads, breed on cliffs rather than in trees, and prefer arid habitats to the wetlands used by their relatives.

The northern bald ibis was described and illustrated by Swiss naturalist <a href="Conrad%20Gesner">Conrad Gesner</a> in his "<a href="Historiae%20animalium%20%28Gesner%29">Historiae animalium</a>" in 1555, and given the <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a> "Upupa eremita" by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his 1758 "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>". It was moved to its current genus by the German <a href="herpetologist">herpetologist</a> <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Wagler">Johann Georg Wagler</a> in 1832. This species has an interesting history of description, oblivion and rediscovery.

The species probably split into two distinct populations at least 400 years ago and, since then, the two populations have been diverging <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a>, <a href="ecology">ecologically</a>, and genetically; nevertheless, the Turkish and Moroccan populations of this ibis are not currently classed as separate subspecies. One consistent difference between the eastern and western birds is a single mutation in the <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome b</a> <a href="gene">gene</a> of their <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>.

Fossils of the northern bald ibis have been found at a <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> (c. 10,000 years ago) site in southern France, in middle <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> (c. 900,000 years ago) strata in Sicily, and in <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>-Pleistocene boundary (c. 1.8 million years ago) deposits on the Mediterranean coast of Spain. What appears to be an ancestral form, "Geronticus balcanicus", was found in the late Pliocene of Bulgaria, further illustrating the early widespread presence of this genus in Europe, and suggesting that "Geronticus eremita" may have originated in south-eastern Europe or the Middle East.

The genus name, "Geronticus", is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> , meaning "old man" and refers to the bald head of the aged. "Eremita" is <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> for "hermit", from the Greek , meaning "desert", and refers to the arid habitats inhabited by this species. The alternative common name "waldrapp" is German for "forest crow", the equivalent of the Latin "Corvo sylvatico" of Gesner, adapted as "Corvus sylvaticus" by Linnaeus.

The northern bald ibis is a large, glossy black bird, long with a wingspan and an average weight of . The plumage is black, with bronze-green and violet iridescence, and there is a wispy ruff on the bird's hind neck. The face and head are dull red and unfeathered, and the long, curved bill and the legs are red. In flight, this bird has powerful, shallow, and flexible wing beats. It gives guttural "hrump" and high, hoarse "hyoh" calls at its breeding colonies, but is otherwise silent.

The sexes are similar in plumage, although males are generally larger than females, and, as with other ibises that breed in colonies, have longer <a href="Beak">bills</a>. The longer-billed males are more successful in attracting a mate. The downy chick has uniformly pale brown plumage, and the fledged juvenile resembles the adult except that it has a dark head, light grey legs, and a pale bill. The unfeathered areas of the young bird's head and neck gradually become red as it matures. Moroccan birds have a significantly longer bill than Turkish birds of the same sex.
If the eastern and western populations are considered to be separable subspecies, it is unclear which should be considered to be the <a href="Subspecies%23Nomenclature">nominate (first-named) form</a>, since the first description of this species was based on a now-extinct population from Switzerland which is of unknown race.

The northern bald ibis is readily distinguished from its close relative, the southern bald ibis of Southern Africa, by the southern species' whitish face. The northern bald can also be confused with the similarly dark-plumaged <a href="glossy%20ibis">glossy ibis</a>, which overlaps its range, but it is larger and stockier than that species. In flight, when the bill and face colouration may not be visible, the bald ibis' less rounded wings and shorter neck give it a different profile from glossy ibis, and its relatively short legs mean that its feet do not project beyond the tail, unlike those of the glossy ibis.

Unlike many other ibises, which nest in trees and feed in wetlands, the northern bald ibis breeds on undisturbed cliff ledges, and forages for food in irregularly cultivated, grazed dry areas such as semi-arid <a href="steppe">steppe</a>s, and fallow fields. The close proximity of adequate steppe feeding areas to breeding cliffs is an important habitat requirement.

The northern bald ibis was once widespread across the Middle East, northern Africa, and southern and central Europe; fossil bones have been found at <a href="Solothurn">Solothurn</a> dated to the Mesolithic and Neolithic Periods. It bred along the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> and <a href="Rhone">Rhone</a> Rivers, and in the mountains of Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland (Gesner's original description was of a Swiss bird), and most probably also in the Upper <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic</a> region. It used castle battlements as well as cliff ledges for nesting before vanishing from Europe at least three centuries ago. It is also extinct over most of its former range, and now almost the entirety of the wild breeding population of just over 500 birds is in Morocco, at <a href="Souss-Massa%20National%20Park">Souss-Massa National Park</a>, where there are three documented colonies, and near the mouth of the <a href="Oued%20Tamri">Oued Tamri</a> (north of <a href="Agadir">Agadir</a>), where there is a single colony containing almost half the Moroccan breeding population. There is some movement of birds between these two sites.

Religious traditions helped this species to survive in one Turkish colony long after the species had disappeared from Europe, since it was believed that the ibis <a href="bird%20migration">migrated</a> each year to guide <a href="Hajj">Hajj</a> pilgrims to <a href="Mecca">Mecca</a>. The ibis was protected by its religious significance, and a festival was held annually to celebrate its return north. The Turkish ibis population was centred near the small town of <a href="Birecik">Birecik</a> in the south-east of the country, and during the first half of the 20th century, the Birecik colony maintained a relatively stable population of about 500 breeding pairs, reaching an estimated total population of about 3,000 around 1930. By the 1970s, numbers had drastically declined and a captive breeding program was initiated in 1977 with one adult pair and nine chicks taken from the wild. This program largely failed to revert the decline; there were 400 birds in 1982, five pairs in 1986, and seven pairs in 1987. Only three birds returned from their wintering grounds in 1989, and just one in 1990. The returning birds died before they could reproduce, thus rendering the species extinct in the wild in Turkey as of 1992. Once the wild Turkish population became non-viable, the colony was maintained as a flock which was free-flying for most of the year but caged in autumn to prevent migration.

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of <a href="Bedouin">Bedouin</a> nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near <a href="Palmyra">Palmyra</a>, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a> of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.

The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>, and Cape Verde.

Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years. They travelled south on the eastern side of the Red Sea via Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and returned north through Sudan and Eritrea.

The northern bald ibis breeds in loosely spaced colonies, nesting on cliff ledges or amongst boulders on steep slopes, usually on the coast or near a river. Volunteer climbers have created extra ledge spaces in the <a href="Souss-Massa%20National%20Park">Souss-Massa</a> colonies to ensure that breeding population is not limited by the availability of nest ledges, and artificial <a href="nest%20box">nest box</a>es are used in the managed colony at <a href="Birecik">Birecik</a>. In the past, the birds also nested in buildings.

This ibis starts breeding at three to five years of age, and pairs for life. The male chooses a nest site, cleans it, and then advertises for a female by waving his crest and giving low rumbling calls. Once the birds have paired, the bond is reinforced through bowing displays and mutual <a href="preening%20%28bird%29">preening</a>. The nest is a loose construction of twigs lined with grass or straw. "G. eremita" normally lays two to four rough-surfaced eggs, which weigh an average of , and are initially blue-white with brown spots, becoming brown during <a href="Avian%20incubation">incubation</a>. An egg in the collection of the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> was marked more thickly at the broad end, with "spots and very small blotches of yellowish brown and pale rufous". It was 0.93 in long and 0.68 in wide (2.37 × 1.73 cm). The clutch is incubated for 24–25 days to hatching, the chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in another 40–50 days, and the first flight takes place at about two months. Both parents incubate and feed the chicks.

The northern bald ibis lives for an average of 20 to 25 years in captivity (oldest recorded male 37 years, oldest recorded female 30 years). The average age in the wild has been estimated as 10 to 15 years.

This gregarious species <a href="Commuting">commutes</a> in flocks from the cliff breeding sites or winter roosts to its feeding areas, flying in a <a href="V%20formation">V formation</a>. The flocks may contain up to 100 birds in winter. During the breeding season, the ibises regularly forage up to from the colony, and, although <a href="steppe">steppe</a> not in current cultivation is preferred for feeding, they will also use <a href="Crop%20rotation">fallow ground</a>, and occasionally even actively cultivated fields.

The northern bald ibis consumes a very wide variety of mainly animal food; <a href="faeces">faecal</a> analysis of the Moroccan breeding population has shown that lizards and <a href="Darkling%20beetle">tenebrionid beetles</a> predominate in the diet, although small mammals, ground-nesting birds, and invertebrates such as snails, scorpions, spiders, and caterpillars are also taken. Males will sometimes "scrounge" food from females. As the flock moves across the ground, the ibis uses its long bill to feel for food items in the loose, sandy soil. Since this bird hunts mainly by probing, a soft surface seems to be vital, and it is important that any vegetation is sparse, and not more than high.

Although the northern bald ibis was long extinct in Europe, many colonies in Morocco and Algeria survived until the early 20th century, when they began to decline more rapidly, the last colony in Algeria disappearing in the late 1980s. In Morocco there were about 38 colonies in 1940 and 15 in 1975, but the last migratory populations in the <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a> had vanished by 1989. The species is <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a> according to the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a> scale, with an estimated population in 2018 of around 147 breeding pairs in the wild and over 1,000 in captivity. It was formerly considered <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> until heavy conservation action secured the breeding sites in Morocco and even allowed the birds to expand to other sites, as well as the semi-wild population conserved in Turkey as well as the reintroduction projects in Europe. The northern bald ibis is one of the key species to which the draft "Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds" (<a href="AEWA">AEWA</a>) applies, and it has a detailed, internationally agreed conservation action plan under the agreement. As a species that is threatened with extinction, it is listed on Appendix 1 of <a href="CITES">CITES</a> (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora), which means that trade in wild-caught birds is illegal, and may be licensed only in exceptional circumstances.

The northern bald ibis has declined for several centuries, at least partly as a consequence of unidentified natural causes. The more rapid decline in the past hundred years, with a loss of 98% of the population between 1900 and 2002, is the result of a combination of factors. These include significant human persecution, especially hunting, and also the loss of steppe and non-intensive agricultural areas (particularly in Morocco), pesticide poisoning, disturbance, and dam construction. The discovery in Jordan of three dead adults from the Turkish colony seemed to confirm that the overuse of pesticides is still a cause of death on migration. These birds were tracked by satellite after leaving Birecik; they stopped off briefly at the Syrian colony, and were later found dead in the Jordanian desert. Although the cause of death was initially thought to have been from poison, probably laid by chicken farmers to kill rodents, the autopsy revealed that they had actually been
electrocuted whilst standing on electricity pylons

Monitoring of Moroccan wild population is guaranteed by <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> partners, especially by <a href="RSPB">RSPB</a>, <a href="SEO/BirdLife">SEO/BirdLife</a> and, recently <a href="GREPOM">GREPOM</a> in cooperation with <a href="Souss-Massa%20National%20Park">Souss-Massa National Park</a> administration and the support of institutions like <a href="Prince%20Albert%20II%20of%20Monaco%20Foundation">Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation</a> which is the Species Champion for Northern Bald Ibis. For the first time in the species' recorded history, there is now evidence of population growth in the wild, and the population in Morocco increased to 100 breeding pairs in the decade prior to 2008 and reached a record of 113 breeding pairs in 2013. Simple site and species protection has facilitated this growth. Quantitative assessments of the importance of sites for breeding, roosting, and foraging have guided actions to prevent disturbance and the loss of key areas to mass tourism development. Wardening by members of the local community has reduced human intrusion and increased the perceived value of the birds. The provision of drinking water and the removal and deterrence of predators and competitors enhances breeding prospects, and monitoring has confirmed that <a href="steppe">steppe</a> and two-year <a href="Crop%20rotation">fallows</a> are key feeding habitats. 
In early 2019 the total population in the two colonies of Souss-Massa National Park and Tamri reached 708 birds after 147 breeding pairs that laid eggs have produced 170 chicks in the last breeding season.

Maintaining such non-intensive land uses in the future may present major management challenges, and the recovery in the <a href="Souss-Massa%20National%20Park">Souss-Massa</a> region remains precarious because the population is concentrated in just a few places. However, it could provide opportunities for natural extension of the range to formerly occupied sites further north in Morocco.
The main cause of breeding failure at the Souss-Massa National Park is the loss of eggs to predators, especially the <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a> which nest monitoring has shown to have had a serious impact at one sub-colony. The effects of predators on adult birds have not been studied, but the very similar southern bald ibis, "Geronticus calvus", is hunted by large <a href="bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a>, particularly those that share its breeding cliffs. There is evidence of chick starvation in some years, but the main threats to breeding birds are human disturbance and the loss of feeding habitat. There was a dramatic mortality incident at the Moroccan colonies in May 1996, when 40 adults died or disappeared over a period of nine days. Although analyses have not identified the cause, an obscure virus, a toxin, or <a href="botulism">botulism</a> are thought to be the most likely causes of the deaths.

Conservation efforts for the Northern bald ibis in Syria began with the discovery of an unreported relict colony of this species in early 2002 in the Palmyra desert. The bald ibises still breeding in Syria, discovered during an extensive biodiversity survey carried out as part of a FAO cooperation project, are the last living descendants of those depicted in Egyptian hieroglyphs from 4500 years ago. The discovery was made possible through the use of traditional ecological knowledge of the Bedouin nomads.

Following the discovery in Syria, a successful community-based ibis breeding intensive protection program was established in Palmyra during years 2002-2004, in parallel with an extensive capacity building program in the benefit of the local community and staff from the Syrian Steppe Commission. Fourteen chicks successfully fledged during this period.

Beside protection and training operations, data on threats and on feeding and breeding ecology were collected in the field. An Ibis Protected Area was recommended and established, and an awareness and education program was also launched and successfully implemented.
Two breeding failures were recorded in 2005 and 2008 following a change of project management and of ibis protection strategy, that occurred between 2004 and 2005. Three birds were tagged with satellite tags and the migratory route and wintering site of the colony were discovered in 2006. Three surveys were undertaken at the wintering site on the Ethiopian highlands between 2006 and 2009, establishing that no immediate threats were present at the site.
Thanks to an IUCN project the Ibis Protected Area in Palmyra desert was further developed in 2008-2009, addressing the threats of infrastructure proliferation and oil company heavy prospection schemes.

Meanwhile, it became apparent that only adults were reaching the wintering site in Ethiopia and that it was the low survival rate of immature birds - and thus an insufficient recruitment at the breeding colony in Palmyra - that was causing the slow and steady decline of the colony from 3 breeding pairs in 2002 to just 1 in 2010. Satellite tracking and surveys conducted in western Saudi Arabia during 2009-2010, with key cooperation of the Saudi Wildlife Authority, suggested that a combination of hunting and electrocution were causing a high mortality of dispersing immature ibises. This mortality is currently regarded as the main cause of the low recruitment occurred at the Palmyra colony during the years following the high breeding performance of period 2002-2004 (only 3 recruitment events out of 14 chicks fledged).

A supplementation trial could be eventually conducted in 2010 by introducing captive-born chicks into the wild colony in Palmyra. For this aim, a first captive breeding center was established in Palmyra. Three chicks introduced at the wild colony in Palmyra followed a migrating wild adult for more than 1000 km from Palmyra well into south-west Saudi Arabia.

The success of the trial, unique of its kind, reinvigorated the hopes that the colony could be still saved. Conservation efforts were interrupted in March 2011 due to the worsening of the political situation in Syria. Palmyra trained rangers have reportedly continued to protect the breeding birds even during the subsequent years. The last year a lone bird was seen returning to Palmyra is 2014 (it returned alone also in 2013). In 2015 no birds came back. As of 2017, some birds are still seen at the wintering grounds.

With the loss of the genuinely wild Turkish population, the Ministry of Environment and Forestry's Directorate of Natural Preservation and National Parks established a new semi-wild colony at Birecik. This was heavily managed, with birds taken into captivity after the breeding season to prevent migration. The program was successful, with numbers at 205 as of March 2016. The intent is to allow the birds to migrate once the population reaches a stable 100 pairs, excluding young.

The birds are released in late January or early February to breed outside the cages on ledges and, mainly, in the nest boxes in the breeding station compound. The ibises are free flying and forage around the Birecik area in forest nurseries, agricultural fields, and along the <a href="Euphrates">Euphrates</a>, but supplementary food is also provided. Following the end of the breeding season, the birds are taken into cages in late July or early August to prevent migration. A trial migration using tagged birds confirmed the risks presented to travelling birds by pesticides. Later on the Syrian Civil War added one more reason to keep preventing migration.

The guidelines for the conservation and reintroduction of the northern bald ibis were established in 2003 at an International Advisory Group for Northern Bald Ibis (IAGNBI) conference in <a href="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a> at the Alpenzoo, which maintains the European <a href="Breed%20registry">studbook</a> for the northern bald ibis.

Decisions taken at the meeting included:

A second conference in Spain in 2006 stressed the need to survey potential and former sites in north-west Africa and the Middle East for currently undetected colonies. The need to raise the standards of hygiene and husbandry in the <a href="Birecik">Birecik</a> aviaries was reiterated, and the prevalence of skin problems in a number of zoos reinforced the view that no zoo birds should be used for any free-flying trials. In future captive breeding and releasing programmes, only birds of known origin should be used.

There are 850 northern bald ibises in European zoos and a further 250 in captivity in Japan and North America. The 49 European zoos keeping this species produce 80 to 100 young birds per year, and earlier attempts at releasing captive-bred birds included close to 150 birds between 1976 and 1986 from an aviary at Birecik, 75 from <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> Zoo in 1983, and an unspecified number from a project in <a href="Almer%C3%ADa">Almería</a>, Spain, from 1991 to 1994; all these attempts were unsuccessful. All northern bald ibises in zoos, other than those in Turkey, are of the western population, and were imported from Morocco. Three bloodlines exist; the earliest relates to importations to <a href="Zoo%20Basel">Zoo Basel</a>, Switzerland in the 1950s and 1960s, the next is the descendants of birds taken in the 1970s to stock <a href="Rabat">Rabat</a> Zoo, and the last captured wild birds were those taken to the Naturzoo, <a href="Rheine">Rheine</a>, in 1976 and 1978. Captive birds have a high incidence of skin problems, and 40% of those birds that had to be put down suffered from chronic ulcerative <a href="dermatitis">dermatitis</a>, characterised by feather loss, rawness, and ulceration on the back, neck, and the undersides of the wings. The cause of this disease is unknown. Other major disease problems reported in zoo collections have been avian <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, gastric foreign bodies, bone disease, and heart problems. An outbreak of <a href="West%20Nile%20virus">West Nile virus</a> in <a href="Bronx%20Park">Bronx Park</a>, New York, involved northern bald ibises amongst many other species of birds and mammals.

In 1504, a decree by <a href="Leonhard%20von%20Keutschach">Archbishop Leonhard</a> of <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> made the northern bald ibis one of the world's earliest officially protected species. They nested in the cliffs and on castles and ruins in the Graz/Steiermark and Salzburg regions of Austria and vanished around 1630-1645. Young birds were hunted as a delicacy at feasts for the nobility.Despite the decree, it died out in Austria as elsewhere in Europe. There are now two ibis reintroduction projects in the country, at Grünau and Kuchl.<a href="http%3A//waldrapp.eu/index.php/en/project-sites/breeding-area-kuchl"></a> A research station at <a href="Gr%C3%BCnau%20im%20Almtal">Grünau</a> has a breeding colony managed, like the Turkish population, as a free-flying flock which is caged at migration time. The aim here is to investigate flock interactions and hormonal status, behavioural and ecological aspects of natural foraging, and the establishment of traditions via social learning.

The Scharnstein Project is an attempt to establish a migratory "waldrapp" colony by using <a href="Ultralight%20aviation">ultralight planes</a> to teach a migration route. The scheme builds on the Grünau research by developing a method to control and guide the autumn migration of a founder population, which then can pass this migration tradition to subsequent generations. In May 2002, 11 birds from the Vienna Zoo and the Grünau colony were trained to follow two microlight planes, and in 2003, a first attempt was made to lead a group of birds from <a href="Scharnstein">Scharnstein</a> to southern Tuscany. Due to adverse weather and technical problems, the birds had to be transported by road over a considerable part of the distance. The subsequent releases were more successful, with birds wintering in Tuscany, and, from 2005, returning to northern Austria. In 2008, a female ibis named Aurelia flew back to Austria for her fourth return to the breeding site. The hazards of the journey are shown by the loss of her two offspring and her mate while on the southern journey in the autumn of 2007.

"Proyecto Eremita" is a Spanish reintroduction involving the release of nearly 30 birds in the Ministry of Defence training ground in <a href="La%20Janda">La Janda</a> district, <a href="Barbate">Barbate</a>, <a href="C%C3%A1diz%20%28province%29">Cádiz Province</a>. It had its first success in 2008, when a pair laid two eggs. This is probably the first attempt to breed in the wild in Spain for 500 years as the last definite reference to the northern bald ibis breeding in Spain is from a 15th-century falconry book. This effort has been undertaken by the <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>n government's Environmental Ministry, the Spanish Ministry of Defence, and the <a href="Zoobot%C3%A1nico%20de%20Jer%C3%A9z">Zoobotánico de Jeréz</a> (<a href="Jerez%20de%20la%20Frontera">Jerez</a> Zoo and Botanical Gardens), with the assistance of the <a href="Estaci%C3%B3n%20Biol%C3%B3gica%20de%20Do%C3%B1ana">Doñana Biological Station</a>, <a href="Spanish%20National%20Research%20Council">CSIC</a> and volunteers from the Cádiz Natural History Society. Previously, two birds left the area in 2005 and 14 in 2006, but nothing is known of their whereabouts other than that a ringed bird from Spain was seen in the <a href="Middle%20Atlas">Middle Atlas</a>, Morocco in 2005. Internet pictures of this species taken near Armacao da Pera, Algarve, Portugal in 2009 and later, may be related to those releases in Spain. In the interim, the Spanish colony has been growing very well, from 9 breeding pairs in 2011, 10 in 2012 and 15 in 2013 to 23 breeding pairs in 2014, which successfully raised 25 chicks in 2014 (). In 2014 the total population of this colony was 78 wild birds split into two colonies, originally along the cliffs of the Atlantic coast and in 2012 with a second colony of 5–6 breeding pairs that started at the cliffs 10 km inland next to a country road at La Barca de Vejer (<a href="Vejer%20de%20la%20Frontera">Vejer de la Frontera</a>).

There is a planned reintroduction of the ibis at Ain Tijja-<a href="Mezguitem">Mezguitem</a> in the north-east of <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. Since the wild populations further south remain vulnerable, and the porous sandstone of their breeding ledges is exposed to erosion, the intention is to establish a non-migratory population (stocked from German, Swiss, and Austrian zoos) in an area where this species was known to have bred up to about 1980. The station in the <a href="Rif">Rif</a> mountains was built in 2000, and stocked with the first group of zoo-bred birds. A second importation of zoo-bred birds and the construction of an information centre took place in 2004. Six pairs bred in 2006 subsequent to a change in the birds' diet, and six offspring from five nests were successfully reared. In 2007 there were 19 birds (13 adults and six juveniles) in the aviary.

The rock walls of the mountains have many potential breeding ledges, and an artificial lake provides water to the birds and to the local human population. Steppe pasture which is not exposed to herbicides or pesticides gives good foraging. Once the population reaches around 40 birds, a release will be initiated, subject to international agreement. The reintroduction site is from Agadir on the other side of the Atlas Mountains, so accidental contamination of the wild colonies is unlikely.

According to local legend in the <a href="Birecik">Birecik</a> area, the northern bald ibis was one of the first birds that <a href="Noah">Noah</a> released from the <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">Ark</a> as a symbol of fertility, and a lingering religious sentiment in Turkey helped the colonies there to survive long after the demise of the species in Europe, as described above.

This ibis was revered as a holy bird and a symbol of brilliance and splendour in Ancient Egypt, where, together with the <a href="sacred%20ibis">sacred ibis</a>, it was regarded as an embodiment of <a href="Thoth">Thoth</a>, scribe of the gods, who was usually depicted with a man's body and the head of an ibis. The <a href="Old%20Egyptian">Old Egyptian</a> word "akh", "to be resplendent, to shine", was denoted in <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyphs</a> by a bald ibis, presumably as a reference to its glossy plumage. In a more abstract sense, "akh" stood for excellence, glory, honour, and virtue. It has also been used to signify the <a href="Egyptian%20soul">soul</a> or spirit, one of five elements constituting personality.

<a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> wrote of the man-eating <a href="Stymphalian%20birds">Stymphalian birds</a>, which had wings of brass and sharp metallic feathers they could fire at their victims. Ridding <a href="Lake%20Stymphalia">Lake Stymphalia</a> in <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a> of these creatures was one of the twelve <a href="labours%20of%20Hercules">labours of Heracles</a>. These mythical birds are sometimes considered to be based on the northern bald ibis, but since they were described as marsh birds, and usually depicted without crests, the legendary species is more likely to be derived from the sacred ibis. Some depictions, such as the 6th-century BC Athenian black-figure amphora in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>, clearly show the black head and white body of the sacred ibis. After the bald ibis became extinct in Central Europe, some later writers thought that Gesner's description was one of several in his book depicting mythical creatures.

The bird painted in 1490 in one of the <a href="Gothic%20fresco">Gothic fresco</a>es in the <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20Church%2C%20Hrastovlje">Holy Trinity Church in Hrastovlje</a> (now south-western Slovenia) in the <a href="Karst%20Plateau">Karst</a> by <a href="John%20of%20Kastav">John of Kastav</a> was most probably the northern bald ibis. A small illustration of the northern bald ibis is found in the illuminated "St Galler Handschrift" of 1562, a drawing by <a href="Joris%20Hoefnagel">Joris Hoefnagel</a> in "Missale Romanum" (1582-1590) and in paintings in the collection of Rudolf II at Vienna. It is believed that it had also been depicted at other places in <a href="Istria">Istria</a> and <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>, where it was presumably endemic in the Middle Ages, e.g. in the local church in <a href="Gradi%C5%A1%C4%8De%20pri%20Diva%C4%8Di">Gradišče pri Divači</a> and in the coat of arms of the noble family Elio from <a href="Koper">Koper</a>. The portal of <a href="Lukovec%20Castle">Lukovec Castle</a> in <a href="Lukovica%20pri%20Brezovici">Lukovica pri Brezovici</a> (central Slovenia) also features this species.

In Birecik, Turkey an ancient celebration 'Kelaynak yortusu' held in mid-February to mark the return of the birds from Africa was revived in the 1950s.

Several countries have produced postage stamps which depict the northern bald ibis. They include Algeria, Morocco, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, and Yemen, which are breeding or migration locations; Austria, which is seeking to reintroduce the bird; and <a href="Jersey">Jersey</a>, which has a small captive population.

Kitsune

Foxes and humans lived close together in <a href="History%20of%20Japan%23Ancient%20and%20Classical%20Japan">ancient Japan</a>; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with <a href="Inari%20%C5%8Ckami">Inari</a>, a <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> "<a href="kami">kami</a>" or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make sacrifices to them as to a deity.

Conversely foxes were often seen as "witch animals", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats).

Japanese fox myths had their origins in <a href="Chinese%20mythology">Chinese mythology</a>. Chinese folk tales tell of fox spirits called "<a href="Huli%20jing">húli jīng</a>" () that may have up to nine tails ("<a href="Fox%20spirit">Kyūbi no Kitsune</a>" in Japanese). Many of the earliest surviving stories are recorded in the "<a href="Konjaku%20Monogatarish%C5%AB">Konjaku Monogatarishū</a>", an 11th-century collection of <a href="Chinese%20literature">Chinese</a>, <a href="Indian%20literature">Indian</a>, and Japanese narratives. The nine-tailed foxes came to be adapted as a motif from Chinese mythology to Japanese mythology.

Smyers (1999) notes that the idea of the fox as seductress and the connection of the fox myths to <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a> were introduced into Japanese folklore through similar Chinese stories, but she maintains that some fox stories contain elements unique to Japan.

The full etymology is unknown. The oldest known usage of the word is in the 794 text "<a href="Shin%27yaku%20Kegonky%C5%8D%20Ongi%20Shiki">Shin'yaku Kegonkyō Ongi Shiki</a>". Other old sources include <a href="Nihon%20Ry%C5%8Diki">Nihon Ryōiki</a> (810–824) and <a href="Wamy%C5%8D%20Ruijush%C5%8D">Wamyō Ruijushō</a> (c. 934). These oldest sources are written in <a href="Man%27y%C5%8Dgana">Man'yōgana</a> which clearly identifies the <a href="J%C5%8Ddai%20Tokushu%20Kanazukai">historical spelling</a> as "kitune". Following several diachronic phonological changes, this becomes "kitsune".

Many etymological suggestions have been made, though there is no general agreement:

"Kitsu" is now archaic; in modern Japanese, a fox's cry is transcribed as "kon kon" or "gon gon".

One of the oldest surviving kitsune tales provides a widely known <a href="folk%20etymology">folk etymology</a> of the word "kitsune". Unlike most tales of kitsune who become human and marry human males, this one does not end tragically:

Because the fox returns to her husband each night as a woman but leaves each morning as a fox she is called Kitsune. In classical Japanese, "kitsu-ne" means "come and sleep", and "ki-tsune" means "always comes".

Kitsune are believed to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of "<a href="y%C5%8Dkai">yōkai</a>"; the word "kitsune" is often translated as "<a href="fox%20spirit">fox spirit</a>". However, this does not mean that kitsune are <a href="ghost">ghost</a>s, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word "spirit" is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.

There are two common classifications of kitsune:


Local traditions add further types. For example, a "ninko" is an invisible fox spirit that human beings can only perceive when it <a href="spiritual%20possession">possesses</a> them.
Physically, kitsune are noted for having as many as nine tails. Generally, a greater number of tails indicates an older and more powerful fox; in fact, some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has lived 100 years. One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common numbers in folk stories. When a kitsune gains its ninth tail, its fur becomes white or gold. These gain the abilities to see and hear anything happening anywhere in the world. Other tales credit them with infinite wisdom (<a href="omniscience">omniscience</a>). After reaching 1,000 years of age and gaining its ninth tail, a kitsune turns a golden color, becoming a , the most powerful form of the kitsune, and then ascends to the heavens.

A kitsune may <a href="shapeshifting">take on human form</a>, an ability learned when it reaches a certain age—usually 100 years, although some tales say 50. As a common prerequisite for the transformation, the fox must place reeds, a leaf, or a skull over its head. Common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women, young girls, elderly men, and even young boys. These shapes are not limited by the fox's age or gender, and a kitsune can <a href="human%20guise">duplicate the appearance of a specific person</a>. Foxes are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in <a href="History%20of%20Japan%23Feudal%20Japan%20%281185-1603%29">medieval Japan</a> was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox. "Kitsune-gao" or "fox-faced" refers to human females who have a narrow face with close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, and high cheekbones. Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form. Variants on the theme have the kitsune retain other foxlike traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form.

In some stories, kitsune have difficulty hiding their tails when they take human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature. A particularly devout individual may even be able to see through a fox's disguise merely by perceiving them. Kitsune can also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee.

One folk story illustrating these imperfections in the kitsune's human shape concerns Koan, a historical person credited with wisdom and magical powers of <a href="divination">divination</a>. According to the story, he was staying at the home of one of his devotees when he scalded his foot entering a bath because the water had been drawn too hot. Then, "in his pain, he ran out of the bathroom naked. When the people of the household saw him, they were astonished to see that Koan had fur covering much of his body, along with a fox's tail. Then Koan transformed in front of them, becoming an elderly fox and running away."

Other supernatural abilities commonly attributed to the kitsune include possession, generating fire or lightning, willful manifestation in the dreams of others, flight, invisibility, and the creation of illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality. Some tales speak of kitsune with even greater powers, able to bend time and space, drive people mad, or take fantastic shapes such as an incredibly tall tree or a second moon in the sky. Other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of <a href="vampire">vampire</a>s or <a href="succubus">succubi</a> and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through sexual contact.

, also written "kitsune-tsuki", literally means "the state of being possessed by a fox". The victim is usually a young woman, whom the fox enters beneath her fingernails or through her breasts. In some cases, the victims' facial expressions are said to change in such a way that they resemble those of a fox. Japanese tradition holds that fox possession can cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read. Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary <a href="Witchcraft%23Japan">fox employers</a>.

Folklorist <a href="Lafcadio%20Hearn">Lafcadio Hearn</a> describes the condition:
He goes on to note that, once freed from the possession, the victim will never again be able to eat tofu, "azukimeshi", or other foods favored by foxes:
In Japan, kitsunetsuki was noted as a disease as early as the <a href="Heian%20period">Heian period</a> and remained a common diagnosis for <a href="mental%20illness">mental illness</a> until the early 20th century. Possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Dr. Shunichi Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered kitsunetsuki. The belief has lost favor, but stories of fox possession still occur, such as allegations that members of the <a href="Aum%20Shinrikyo">Aum Shinrikyo</a> cult had been possessed.

In medicine, kitsunetsuki is a <a href="culture-bound%20syndrome">culture-bound syndrome</a> unique to <a href="Culture%20of%20Japan">Japanese culture</a>. Those who suffer from the condition believe they are possessed by a fox. Symptoms include cravings for rice or sweet adzuki beans, listlessness, restlessness, and aversion to eye contact. Kitsunetsuki is similar to but distinct from <a href="clinical%20lycanthropy">clinical lycanthropy</a>.

In <a href="folk%20religion">folk religion</a>, stories of fox possession can be found in all lands of Japan. Those possessed by a fox are thought to suffer from a <a href="mental%20illness">mental illness</a>-like condition.

There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a <a href="kuda-gitsune">kuda-gitsune</a>, <a href="osaki">osaki</a>, <a href="yako%20%28fox%29">yako</a>, and <a href="hitogitsune">hitogitsune</a> are also called "kitsunetsuki." These families are said to have been able to use their fox to gain fortune, but marriage into such a family was considered forbidden as it would enlarge the family. They are also said to be able to bring about illness and curse the possessions, crops, and livestock of ones that they hate, and as a result of being considered taboo by the other families, it has led to societal problems.

The great amount of faith given to foxes can be seen in how, as a result of the Inari belief where foxes were believed to be <a href="Inari%20%C5%8Ckami">Inari no Kami</a> or its servant, they were employed in practices of <a href="Dakini%23In_Japanese_Buddhism">dakini-ten</a> by <a href="mikky%C5%8D">mikkyō</a> practitioners and shugendō practitioners and in the oracles of miko and other practitioners, and the customs related to kitsunetsuki can be seen as having developed in such a religious background.

Depictions of kitsune or their possessed victims may feature round white balls known as . Tales describe these as glowing with <a href="kitsunebi">kitsunebi</a>. Some stories identify them as magical jewels or pearls. When not in human form or possessing a human, a kitsune keeps the ball in its mouth or carries it on its tail. Jewels are a common symbol of Inari, and representations of sacred Inari foxes without them are rare.

One belief is that when a "kitsune" changes shape, its "hoshi no tama" holds a portion of its magical power. Another tradition is that the pearl represents the kitsune's soul; the kitsune will die if separated from it for long. Those who obtain the ball may be able to extract a promise from the "kitsune" to help them in exchange for its return. For example, a 12th-century tale describes a man using a fox's "hoshi no tama" to secure a favor:

"Confound you!" snapped the fox. "Give me back my ball!" The man ignored its pleas till finally it said tearfully, "All right, you've got the ball, but you don't know how to keep it. It won't be any good to you. For me, it's a terrible loss. I tell you, if you don't give it back, I'll be your enemy forever. If you "do" give it back though, I'll stick to you like a protector god."

The fox later saves his life by leading him past a band of armed robbers.

Embedded in Japanese folklore as they are, kitsune appear in numerous Japanese works. <a href="Noh">Noh</a>, <a href="kyogen">kyogen</a>, <a href="bunraku">bunraku</a>, and <a href="kabuki">kabuki</a> plays derived from folk tales feature them, as do contemporary works such as <a href="anime">anime</a>, <a href="manga">manga</a> and <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s. Japanese metal idol band <a href="Babymetal">Babymetal</a> refer to the kitsune myth in their lyrics and include the use of fox masks, hand signs, and animation interludes during live shows. Western authors of fiction have also made use of the kitsune legends.

Kitsune are associated with Inari, the <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a> deity of rice. This association has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance. Originally, kitsune were Inari's messengers, but the line between the two is now blurred so that Inari Ōkami may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune, where devotees can leave <a href="Offering%20%28Buddhism%29">offering</a>s. Fox spirits are said to be particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called "<a href="aburage">aburage</a>", which is accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune <a href="udon">udon</a> and kitsune <a href="soba">soba</a>. Similarly, "Inari-zushi" is a type of <a href="sushi">sushi</a> named for Inari Ōkami that consists of rice-filled pouches of fried tofu. There is speculation among folklorists as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long been worshipped as "kami".

Inari's kitsune are white, a color of good <a href="omen">omen</a>. They possess the power to ward off evil, and they sometimes serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene on behalf of the locals and particularly to aid against troublesome "nogitsune", those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.

According to beliefs derived from "fusui" ("<a href="feng%20shui">feng shui</a>"), the fox's power over evil is such that a mere statue of a fox can dispel the evil "<a href="qi">kimon</a>", or energy, that flows from the northeast. Many Inari shrines, such as the famous <a href="Fushimi%20Inari">Fushimi Inari</a> shrine in <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, feature such statues, sometimes large numbers of them.

Kitsune are connected to the Buddhist religion through the <a href="Dakini">Dakini</a>ten, goddesses conflated with Inari's female aspect. Dakiniten is depicted as a female <a href="boddhisattva">boddhisattva</a> wielding a sword and riding a flying white fox.

Kitsune are often presented as <a href="trickster">trickster</a>s, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud <a href="samurai">samurai</a>, greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their victims are usually men; women are possessed instead. For example, kitsune are thought to employ their <a href="kitsunebi">kitsunebi</a> to lead travelers astray in the manner of a <a href="will%20o%27%20the%20wisp">will o' the wisp</a>. Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its target with illusions or visions. Other common goals of trickster kitsune include seduction, theft of food, humiliation of the prideful, or vengeance for a perceived slight.

A traditional game called "kitsune-ken" ("fox-fist") references the kitsune's powers over human beings. The game is similar to <a href="rock-paper-scissors">rock, paper, scissors</a>, but the three hand positions signify a fox, a hunter, and a village headman. The headman beats the hunter, whom he outranks; the hunter beats the fox, whom he shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.

This ambiguous portrayal, coupled with their reputation for vengefulness, leads people to try to discover a troublesome fox's motives. In one case, the 16th-century leader <a href="Toyotomi%20Hideyoshi">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> wrote a letter to the "kami" Inari:

Kitsune keep their promises and strive to repay any favor. Occasionally a kitsune attaches itself to a person or household, where they can cause all sorts of mischief. In one story from the 12th century, only the homeowner's threat to exterminate the foxes convinces them to behave. The kitsune patriarch appears in the man's dreams:
Other kitsune use their magic for the benefit of their companion or hosts as long as the human beings treat them with respect. As "<a href="y%C5%8Dkai">yōkai</a>", however, kitsune do not share human morality, and a kitsune who has adopted a house in this manner may, for example, bring its host money or items that it has stolen from the neighbors. Accordingly, common households thought to harbor kitsune are treated with suspicion. Oddly, samurai families were often reputed to share similar arrangements with kitsune, but these foxes were considered "zenko" and the use of their magic a sign of prestige. Abandoned homes were common haunts for kitsune. One 12th-century story tells of a minister moving into an old mansion only to discover a family of foxes living there. They first try to scare him away, then claim that the house "has been ours for many years, and ... we wish to register a vigorous protest." The man refuses, and the foxes resign themselves to moving to an abandoned lot nearby.

Tales distinguish kitsune gifts from kitsune payments. If a kitsune offers a payment or reward that includes money or material wealth, part or all of the sum will consist of old paper, leaves, twigs, stones, or similar valueless items under a magical illusion. True kitsune gifts are usually intangibles, such as protection, knowledge, or long life.

Kitsune are commonly portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune who takes the form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if from a dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.

Many stories tell of fox-wives bearing children. When such progeny are human, they possess special physical or <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> qualities that often pass to their own children. The <a href="astrology">astrologer</a>-magician <a href="Abe%20no%20Seimei">Abe no Seimei</a> was reputed to have inherited such extraordinary powers.

Other stories tell of kitsune marrying one another. Rain falling from a clear sky — a <a href="sunshower">sunshower</a> — is called "<a href="kitsune%20no%20yomeiri">kitsune no yomeiri</a>" or "the kitsune's wedding", in reference to a folktale describing a wedding ceremony between the creatures being held during such conditions. The event is considered a good omen, but the kitsune will seek revenge on any uninvited guests, as is depicted in the 1990 <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a> film "<a href="Dreams%20%281990%20film%29">Dreams</a>".

Stephen Turnbull, in "Nagashino 1575", relates the tale of the Takeda clan's involvement with a fox-woman. The warlord <a href="Takeda%20Shingen">Takeda Shingen</a>, in 1544, defeated in battle a lesser local warlord named <a href="Suwa%20Yorishige">Suwa Yorishige</a> and drove him to suicide after a "humiliating and spurious" peace conference, after which Shingen forced marriage on Suwa Yorishige's beautiful 14-year-old daughter Lady Koi—Shingen's own niece. Shingen, Turnbull writes, "was so obsessed with the girl that his superstitious followers became alarmed and believed her to be an incarnation of the white fox-spirit of the <a href="Suwa%20Taisha">Suwa Shrine</a>, who had bewitched him in order to gain revenge." When their son <a href="Takeda%20Katsuyori">Takeda Katsuyori</a> proved to be a disastrous leader and led the clan to their devastating defeat at the <a href="battle%20of%20Nagashino">battle of Nagashino</a>, Turnbull writes, "wise old heads nodded, remembering the unhappy circumstances of his birth and his magical mother".

Black stork

The black stork ("Ciconia nigra") is a large bird in the <a href="stork">stork</a> family Ciconiidae. It was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>." Measuring on average from beak tip to end of tail with a wingspan, the adult black stork has mainly black <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, with white underparts, long red legs and a long pointed red beak. A widespread, but uncommon, species, it breeds in scattered locations across Europe (predominantly in Spain, and central and eastern parts), and Asia to the Pacific Ocean. It is a long-distance <a href="bird%20migration">migrant</a>, with European populations wintering in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asian populations in the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a> and detours via the <a href="Levant">Levant</a> in the east or the <a href="Strait%20of%20Gibraltar">Strait of Gibraltar</a> in the west. An isolated, non-migratory, population occurs in Southern Africa.

Unlike the closely related <a href="white%20stork">white stork</a>, the black stork is a shy and wary species. It is seen singly or in pairs, usually in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. It feeds on <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s, small <a href="fish">fish</a> and <a href="insect">insect</a>s, generally wading slowly in shallow water stalking its prey. Breeding pairs usually build nests in large forest trees—most commonly <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> but also <a href="conifer">conifer</a>ous—which can be seen from long distances, as well as on large boulders, or under overhanging ledges in mountainous areas. The female lays two to five greyish-white <a href="egg">egg</a>s, which become soiled over time in the nest. <a href="Egg%20incubation">Incubation</a> takes 32 to 38 days, with both sexes sharing duties, and <a href="Fledge">fledging</a> takes 60 to 71 days.

The black stork is considered to be a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>, but its actual status is uncertain. Despite its large range, it is nowhere abundant, and it appears to be declining in parts of its range, such as in India, China and parts of Western Europe, though increasing in others such as the Iberian Peninsula. Various conservation measures have been taken for the black stork, like the Conservation Action Plan for African black storks by <a href="Wetlands%20International">Wetlands International</a>. It is also covered under the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement</a> and the <a href="CITES">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a>.

English naturalist <a href="Francis%20Willughby">Francis Willughby</a> wrote about the black stork in the 17th century, having seen one in Frankfurt. He named it "Ciconia nigra", from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> words for "stork" and "black" respectively. It was one of the many <a href="Aves%20in%20the%2010th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">species originally described</a> by Swedish <a href="Zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in the landmark 1758 <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", where it was given the binomial name of "Ardea nigra". It was moved to the new <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Ciconia">Ciconia</a>" by French <a href="zoologist">zoologist</a> <a href="Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson">Mathurin Jacques Brisson</a> two years later. The word "stork" is derived from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word "storc", thought to be related to the <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> "storah", meaning "stork", and the Old English "stearc", meaning "stiff".

The black stork is a member of the genus "Ciconia", or typical storks, a group of seven <a href="extant%20taxon">extant</a> species, characterised by straight bills and mainly black and white <a href="plumage">plumage</a>. The black stork was long thought to be most closely related to the <a href="white%20stork">white stork</a> ("C. ciconia"). However, genetic analysis via <a href="DNA%E2%80%93DNA%20hybridization">DNA–DNA hybridization</a> and mitochondrial <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome b</a> DNA by Beth Slikas in 1997 found that it was <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (an early offshoot) in the genus "Ciconia". <a href="Fossil">Fossil</a> remains have been recovered from <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> beds on <a href="Rusinga%20Island">Rusinga</a> and <a href="Maboko%20Island">Maboko Island</a>s in Kenya, which are indistinguishable from the white and black storks.

The black stork is a large bird, measuring between in length with a wingspan, and weighing around . Standing as tall as , it has long red legs, a long neck and a long, straight, pointed red <a href="beak">beak</a>. It bears some resemblance to <a href="Abdim%27s%20stork">Abdim's stork</a> ("C. abdimii"), which can be distinguished by its much smaller build, predominantly green bill, legs and feet, and white rump and lower back. The plumage is black with a purplish green sheen, except for the white lower breast, belly, armpits, <a href="Glossary%20of%20bird%20terms%23axillaries">axillaries</a> and <a href="Covert%20feather">undertail coverts</a>. The breast feathers are long and shaggy, forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The black stork has brown <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>, and bare red skin around its eyes. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. <a href="Moulting%23Birds">Moulting</a> takes place in spring, with the iridescent sheen brighter in new plumage. It walks slowly and steadily on the ground and like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched.

The <a href="Juvenile%20%28organism%29">juvenile</a> resembles the adult in plumage, but the areas corresponding to the adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It could possibly be confused with the juvenile <a href="yellow-billed%20stork">yellow-billed stork</a>, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.

During the summer, the black stork is found from Eastern Asia (<a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> and northern China) west to <a href="Central%20Europe">Central Europe</a>, reaching Estonia in the north, Poland, <a href="Lower%20Saxony">Lower Saxony</a> and <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> in Germany, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy and Greece in the south, with an outlying population in the central-southwest region of the Iberian Peninsula (<a href="Extremadura">Extremadura</a> and surrounding provinces of Spain, plus Portugal). It is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering in tropical Africa and Asia, although certain populations of black storks are sedentary or dispersive. An isolated population exists in <a href="Southern%20Africa">Southern Africa</a>, where the species is more numerous in the east, in eastern South Africa and Mozambique, and is also found in Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Botswana and less commonly Namibia.

Most of the black storks that summer in Europe migrate to Africa, with those from western Germany and points west heading south via the Iberian Peninsula and the rest via Turkey and the Levant. Those flying via Spain spend winter in the <a href="Fal%C3%A9m%C3%A9%20River">Falémé River</a> basin of eastern Senegal, Guinea, southern Mauritania, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and western and central Mali, while those flying via the Sinai end up in northern Ethiopia, the <a href="Kotto%20River">Kotto River</a> basin in the Central African Republic, the <a href="Mbomou%20River">Mbokou river basin</a> in Chad and northeastern Nigeria. Black storks summering in <a href="western%20Asia">western Asia</a> migrate to <a href="North%20India">northern</a> and <a href="Northeast%20India">northeastern</a> India, ranging mainly from <a href="Punjab%2C%20India">Punjab</a> south to <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, and Africa. They are occasional visitors to Sri Lanka. Those summering further east in eastern Russia and China winter mainly in <a href="South%20China">southern China</a>, and occasionally in Hong Kong, Myanmar, <a href="northern%20Thailand">northern Thailand</a>, and Laos. They were first recorded in western Myanmar in 1998.

The black stork prefers more wooded areas than the better-known white stork, and breeds in large marshy <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s with interspersed <a href="conifer">conifer</a>ous or <a href="Flowering%20plant">broadleaved</a> <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s, but also inhabits hills and mountains with sufficient networks of <a href="creek%20%28stream%29">creek</a>s. It usually inhabits ponds, rivers, edges of lakes, estuaries and other freshwater wetlands. The black stork does inhabit more agricultural areas in the <a href="Caspian%20Depression">Caspian lowlands</a>, but even here it avoids close contact with people. Its wintering habitat in India comprises reservoirs or rivers with nearby scrub or forest, which provide trees that black storks can roost in at night. In southern Africa it is found in shallow water in rivers or lakes, or swamps, but is occasionally encountered on dry land.

After disappearing from Belgium before the onset of the 20th century, it has returned to breed in the <a href="Ardennes">Belgian Ardennes</a>, Luxembourg and <a href="Burgundy">Burgundy</a>, France, by 2000. It appears to be increasing in numbers in Spain and Portugal, where the population was estimated at 405 to 483 pairs in 2006. The black stork is a rare vagrant to the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>, turning up in the warmer months—particularly in spring—generally in the south and east. Sightings have become more common since the 1970s as its breeding range moves northwards. It has been recorded in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> six times between 1946 and 1983, including from Shetland, Orkney and the Highlands, as well as the Scottish Borders (<a href="Peebles">Peebles</a>). It is not abundant in the western parts of its distribution, but more densely inhabits eastern <a href="Transcaucasia">Transcaucasia</a>. Further east, it has been recorded from locations across Iran, though little is known about its habits there; breeding has been recorded from near Aliabad in <a href="Fars%20Province">Fars</a> province, <a href="Baft%23Khabr%20National%20Park">Khabr National Park</a> in <a href="Kerman%20Province">Kerman</a> province, <a href="Karun">Karun</a> river in <a href="Khuzestan%20Province">Khuzestan</a> province, Qaranqu River in <a href="East%20Azerbaijan%20Province">East Azarbaijan</a> province, and Aliabad river in <a href="Razavi%20Khorasan%20Province">Razavi Khorasan</a> province. The population has declined in Iran due to draining of wetlands. East of the <a href="Ural%20Mountains">Ural Mountains</a>, the black stork is patchily found in forested and mountainous areas up to <a href="60th%20parallel%20north">60°</a>‒<a href="63rd%20parallel%20north">63° N</a> across Siberia to the Pacific Ocean. South of Siberia, it breeds in <a href="Xinjiang">Xinjiang</a>, northwestern China, northern Mongolia south to the <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai Mountains</a>, and northeastern China south to the vicinity of Beijing. In the <a href="Korean%20Peninsula">Korean Peninsula</a>, the black stork is an uncommon summer visitor, no longer breeding in the south since 1966. Birds have been seen in the northeast but it is not known whether they breed there. Similarly it has been seen in the summer in Afghanistan, but its breeding status is uncertain.

Migration takes place from early August to October, with a major exodus in September. Some of the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian</a> populations, and also those in southern Africa, are essentially non-migratory, though they may wander freely in the non-breeding areas. A broad-winged soaring bird, the black stork is assisted by thermals of hot air for long-distance flight, although is less dependent on them than is the white stork. Since thermals only form over land, the black stork, together with large <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptor</a>s, must cross the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> at the narrowest points, and many black storks travel south through the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a>, as well as the Sinai and Gibraltar. The trip is around via the western route and via the eastern route, with satellite tracking yielding an average travel time of 37 and 80 days respectively. The western route goes over the <a href="Rock%20of%20Gibraltar">Rock of Gibraltar</a> or over the <a href="Bay%20of%20Gibraltar">Bay of Gibraltar</a>, generally on a southwesterly track that takes them to the central part of the strait, from where they reach Morocco. Many birds fly around the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a> next to the coast. About 10% of the western storks choose the passage <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> – <a href="Cap%20Bon">Cap Bon</a>, Tunisia.

Spain contains several important areas—<a href="Monfrag%C3%BCe">Monfragüe</a> National Park, <a href="Sierra%20de%20Gredos%20Regional%20Park">Sierra de Gredos Regional Park</a>, <a href="National%20Hunting%20Reserve%20in%20C%C3%ADjara">National Hunting Reserve in Cíjara</a>, <a href="Natural%20Park%20of%20the%20Sierra%20Hornachuelos">Natural Park of the Sierra Hornachuelos</a> and <a href="Do%C3%B1ana%20National%20Park">Doñana National Park</a>—where black storks stop over on the western migration route. Pesticide use has threatened birdlife in nearby Doñana. Further south, <a href="Lake%20Faguibine">Lake Faguibine</a> in Mali is another stopover point but it has been affected by drought in recent years.

A wary species, the black stork avoids contact with people. It is generally found alone or in pairs, or in flocks of up to a hundred birds when migrating, or over winter.

The black stork has a wider range of calls than the white stork, its main call being a "chee leee", which sounds like a loud inhalation. It makes a hissing call as a warning or threat. Displaying males produce a long series of wheezy raptor-like squealing calls rising in volume and then falling. It rarely indulges in mutual bill-clattering when adults meet at the nest. Adults will do so as part of their mating ritual or when angered. The young clatter their bills when aroused.

The "up-down display" is used for a number of interactions with other members of the species. Here a stork positions its body horizontally and quickly bobs its head up from down-facing to around 30 degrees above horizontal and back again, while displaying the white segments of its plumage prominently, and this is repeated several times. The display is used as a greeting between birds, and—more vigorously—as a <a href="threat%20display">threat display</a>. The species' solitary nature means that this threat display is rarely witnessed.

The black stork breeds between April and May in the Northern Hemisphere, with eggs usually laid in late April. In southern Africa, breeding takes place in the months between September and March, possibly to take advantage of abundant water prey rendered easier to catch as the rivers dry up and recede—from April and May in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern South Africa, and as late as July further south.

The nest is large, constructed from sticks and twigs, and sometimes also large branches, at an elevation of . The black stork prefers to construct its nest in forest trees with large canopies where the nest can be built far from the main trunk—generally in places far from human disturbance. For the most part, deciduous trees are chosen for nesting sites, though conifers are used as well. A 2003 field study in Estonia found that the black stork preferred oak ("<a href="Quercus%20robur">Quercus robur</a>"), European aspen ("<a href="Populus%20tremula">Populus tremula</a>"), and to a lesser extent Scots pine ("<a href="Pinus%20sylvestris">Pinus sylvestris</a>"), and ignored Norway spruce ("<a href="Picea%20abies">Picea abies</a>"), in part due to the canopy structure of the trees. Trees with nests averaged around high and had a <a href="diameter%20at%20breast%20height">diameter at breast height</a> of . Furthermore, 90% of the trees chosen were at least 80 years old, highlighting the importance of conserving old-growth forests. A 2004 field study of nesting sites in Dadia-Lefkimi-Soufli National Park in north-eastern Greece found that it preferred the Calabrian pine ("<a href="Pinus%20brutia">Pinus brutia</a>"), which had large side branches that allowed it to build the nest away from the trunk, as well as black pine ("<a href="Pinus%20nigra">Pinus nigra</a>") and to a lesser extent Turkey oak ("<a href="Quercus%20cerris">Quercus cerris</a>"). It chose the largest trees in an area, generally on steeper ground and near streams. Trees chosen were on average over 90 years old. In the Iberian peninsula it nests in pine and cork oak ("<a href="Quercus%20suber">Quercus suber</a>").

In steeply mountainous areas such as parts of Spain, South Africa and the <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathian Mountains</a> it nests on cliffs, on large boulders, in caves and under overhanging ledges. The black stork's solitary nests are usually at least 1 km (0.6 mi) apart, even where the species is numerous. Although newly constructed nests may be significantly smaller, older nests can be in diameter. In southern Africa, the black stork may occupy the nests of other bird species such as <a href="hamerkop">hamerkop</a> ("Scopus umbretta") or <a href="Verreaux%27s%20eagle">Verreaux's eagle</a> ("Aquila verreauxi") and commonly reuses them in successive years. They are repaired with earth and grass, and lined with leaves, <a href="moss">moss</a>, grass, animal fur, paper, clay and rags. In a clutch, there are two to five, or rarely even six large oval grey-white eggs, which become soiled during incubation. They can be long and wide, averaging about in length and in width. The eggs are laid with an interval of two days. Hatching is asynchronous, and takes place at the end of May. <a href="Egg%20incubation">Incubation</a> takes 32 to 38 days, with both sexes sharing duties, which commence after the first or second egg is laid. The young start flying by the end of July. <a href="Fledge">Fledging</a> takes 60 to 71 days, after which the young joins the adults at their feeding grounds. However, for another 2 weeks, the young continue to return to the nest, to be fed and to roost at night.

At least one adult remains in the nest for two to three weeks after hatching to protect the young. Both parents feed the young by regurgitating onto the floor of the nest. Black stork parents have been known to kill one of their fledglings, generally the weakest, in times of food shortage to reduce brood size and hence increase the chance of survival of the remaining nestlings. Stork nestlings do not attack each other, and their parents' method of feeding them (disgorging large amounts of food at once) means that stronger siblings cannot outcompete weaker ones for food directly, hence parental infanticide is an efficient way of reducing brood size. This behaviour has only rarely been observed in the species, although the shyness of the species and difficulties in studying its nesting habits mean that it might not be an uncommon phenomenon.

The black stork mainly <a href="Piscivore">eats fish</a>, including small <a href="Cyprinidae">cyprinids</a>, <a href="Esox">pikes</a>, roaches, <a href="eel">eel</a>s, budds, <a href="perch">perch</a>es, <a href="burbot">burbot</a>s, <a href="Stickleback">sticklebacks</a> and muddy <a href="Cypriniformes">loaches</a> ("<a href="Misgurnus">Misgurnus</a>" and "<a href="Cobitis">Cobitis</a>"). It may feed on <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s, small <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s, <a href="crab">crab</a>s, <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s and <a href="bird">bird</a>s, and invertebrates such as <a href="snail">snail</a>s, <a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a>, <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s, and <a href="insect">insect</a>s like <a href="water%20beetle">water beetle</a>s and their <a href="larva">larva</a>e.

Foraging for food takes place mostly in fresh water, though the black stork may look for food on dry land at times. The black stork wades patiently and slowly in shallow water, often alone or in a small group if food is plentiful. It has been observed shading the water with its wings while hunting. In India, it often forages in mixed species flocks with the white stork, <a href="woolly-necked%20stork">woolly-necked stork</a> ("Ciconia episcopus"), <a href="demoiselle%20crane">demoiselle crane</a> ("Grus virgo") and <a href="bar-headed%20goose">bar-headed goose</a> ("Anser indicus"). The black stork also follows large mammals such as deer and livestock, presumably to eat the invertebrates and small animals flushed by their presence.

The black stork hosts more than 12 species of <a href="helminth">helminth</a>, with "<a href="Cathaemasia%20hians">Cathaemasia hians</a>" and "<a href="Dicheilonema%20ciconiae">Dicheilonema ciconiae</a>" reported to be the most dominant. The juvenile black stork, although having a less diverse helminth population, is parasitized more frequently than the adult. A new species of "<a href="Corynebacterium">Corynebacterium</a>"—"C. ciconiae"—has been isolated from the trachea of healthy black storks, and is thought to be part of the natural flora of the species. A diverse array of predatory <a href="Mesostigmata">mesostigmatid</a> mites—particularly the genera "<a href="Dendrolaelaps">Dendrolaelaps</a>" and "<a href="Macrocheles">Macrocheles</a>"—have been recovered from black stork nests. Their role is unknown, though they could prey on parasitic arthropods.

Since 1998, the black stork has been rated as a species of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bof%20Endangered%20Species">IUCN Red List of Endangered Species</a>. This is because it has a large range—more than 20,000 km (7,700 mi)—and because its population is thought not to have declined by 30% over ten years or three generations and thus is not a rapid enough decline to warrant a <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a> rating. Even so, the state of the population overall is unclear, and although it is widespread, it is not abundant anywhere. Black stork numbers have declined for many years in western Europe, and the species has already been extirpated from <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>. The population in India—a major wintering ground—is declining. Previously a regular winter visitor to the <a href="Mai%20Po%20Marshes">Mai Po Marshes</a>, it is now seldom seen there, and appears to be in decline in China overall. Its habitat is changing rapidly in much of eastern Europe and Asia. Various conservation measures have been taken, including <a href="Wetlands%20International">Wetlands International</a>'s Conservation Action Plan for African black storks, which focuses on improving the wintering conditions of the birds which breed in Europe. It is protected by the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a> (AEWA) and the <a href="Convention%20on%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species%20of%20Wild%20Fauna%20and%20Flora">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES).

Hunters threaten the black stork in some countries of southern Europe and Asia, such as Pakistan, and breeding populations may have been eliminated there. The black stork vanished from the <a href="Ticino%20%28river%29">Ticino River</a> valley in northern Italy, with hunting a likely contributor. In 2005, black storks were released into the <a href="Parco%20Lombardo%20del%20Ticino">Parco Lombardo del Ticino</a> in an attempt to re-establish the species there.

Doolittle (album)

Doolittle is the second studio album by American <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>, released in April 1989 on <a href="4AD">4AD</a>. The album's offbeat and dark subject material, featuring references to <a href="surrealism">surrealism</a>, <a href="The%20Bible">Biblical</a> violence, <a href="torture">torture</a> and death, contrasts with the clean production sound achieved by the newly hired producer <a href="Gil%20Norton">Gil Norton</a>. "Doolittle" was the Pixies' first international release, with <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> as the album's distributor in the United States and <a href="PolyGram">PolyGram</a> in Canada.

Pixies released two singles from "Doolittle", "<a href="Here%20Comes%20Your%20Man">Here Comes Your Man</a>" and "<a href="Monkey%20Gone%20to%20Heaven">Monkey Gone to Heaven</a>", both of which were chart successes on the US chart for <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock Tracks</a>. The album itself reached number eight on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, an unexpected success for the band. In retrospect, album tracks such as "<a href="Debaser">Debaser</a>", "Wave of Mutilation", "Monkey Gone to Heaven", "Gouge Away", and "Hey" are highly acclaimed by critics, while the album, along with debut LP "<a href="Surfer%20Rosa">Surfer Rosa</a>", is often seen as the band's strongest work.

"Doolittle" has continued to sell consistently well in the years since its release, and in 1995 was <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified</a> gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>. The album has been cited as inspirational by many alternative artists, while numerous music publications have ranked it as one of the most influential albums ever. A 2003 poll of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" writers ranked "Doolittle" as the second-greatest album of all time, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" placed the album at 227 on its list of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>" and "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" ranked it as the fourth best album of the 80s.

Following their highly regarded but commercially unsuccessful 1988 album "<a href="Surfer%20Rosa">Surfer Rosa</a>", the band embarked on a European tour with fellow Bostonians <a href="Throwing%20Muses">Throwing Muses</a>, before beginning a tour of North American states. During this time <a href="Black%20Francis">Black Francis</a>, the group's frontman and principal songwriter, began to write new material for a future album, with songs such as "Dead", "Hey", "Tame", and "There Goes My Gun" emerging through the course of the year. Versions of the newly composed songs were recorded during several sessions for <a href="John%20Peel">John Peel</a>'s radio show in 1988, while a live recording of "Hey" appeared on a free EP circulated with a 1988 edition of "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>".

In mid-1988, the Pixies began to record demo sessions while on breaks from touring. The band headed to the Boston <a href="recording%20studio">recording studio</a> Eden Sound, which at the time comprised a small room in the basement of a <a href="hair%20salon">hair salon</a>. They recorded at the studio for a week, in circumstances similar to the previous year's <a href="Pixies%20%28EP%29">the Purple Tape</a> sessions. Francis gave the <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo tape</a> and upcoming album the provisional title of "Whore", though he later claimed his natural father had originally suggested the name. Francis has clarified that he was thinking of the word "in the more traditional sense ... the operatic, biblical sense, ... as in the great <a href="whore%20of%20Babylon">whore of Babylon</a>". After completing the demo tape, band manager Ken Goes suggested two producers for the album; <a href="Liverpool%2C%20England">Liverpudlian</a> <a href="Gil%20Norton">Gil Norton</a> and American <a href="Ed%20Stasium">Ed Stasium</a>. The band had previously worked with Norton while recording the single version of "<a href="Gigantic%20%28song%29">Gigantic</a>" in May 1988. Francis had no preference, although <a href="Ivo%20Watts-Russell">Ivo Watts-Russell</a>, head of the band's label 4AD, wanted Norton to produce the Pixies' next album. He was hired as producer, with Stasium not even approached for the position.

Norton arrived in Boston on October 31, 1988, and first visited Francis' apartment to review the album's demos. The two talked about arrangements, and spent two days intensively analyzing the album's songs. Norton learned to gauge Francis' reaction to changing arrangements, and later observed that the frontman "doesn't like to do anything twice". Norton spent a further two weeks in pre-production to familiarise himself with the Pixies' sound.

Recording sessions for the album began on October 31, 1988, at <a href="Downtown%20Recorders">Downtown Recorders</a> in Boston, Massachusetts, at the time a professional 24-track studio. 4AD allowed the Pixies a budget of $40,000, excluding producer's fees. This was a modest sum for a 1980s major label album; however, it quadrupled the amount spent on the band's previous album, "Surfer Rosa". Along with Norton, two assistant <a href="recording%20engineer">recording engineer</a>s and two second assistants were assigned to the project. The sessions lasted three weeks, concluding on November 23, with "nearly a song a day" being recorded.

Production and mixing began on November 28. The band relocated to <a href="Carriage%20House%20Studios">Carriage House Studios</a>, a residential studio in <a href="Stamford%2C%20Connecticut">Stamford, Connecticut</a>, to oversee production and record further tracks. Norton recruited Steve Haigler as <a href="Mix%20engineer">mixing engineer</a>, whom he had worked with at <a href="Fort%20Apache%20Studios">Fort Apache Studios</a>. During production, Haigler and Norton added layers of guitars and vocals to songs, including <a href="overdubbing">overdubbed</a> guitars on "<a href="Debaser">Debaser</a>" and double tracking vocals on "Wave of Mutilation". During the recordings, Norton advised Francis to alter several songs; a noted example being "There Goes My Gun" which was originally intended as a much faster <a href="H%C3%BCsker%20D%C3%BC">Hüsker Dü</a>-style song. However, at Norton's advice, Francis slowed down the tempo.

Norton's suggestions were not always welcome, and several instances of advice to add verses and increase track length contributed to the front man's building frustration. Eventually, Francis took Norton to a record store, where he handed him a copy of <a href="Buddy%20Holly">Buddy Holly</a>'s "<a href="Greatest%20Hits%20%28Buddy%20Holly%20album%29">Greatest Hits</a>", in which most of the songs are about two minutes long. He told Norton, "If it's good enough for Buddy Holly ..." In a "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" interview, Francis later recalled that "this record is him trying to make us, shall I say, commercial, and us trying to remain somewhat grungy". Production continued until December 12, 1988, with Norton and Haigler adding extra effects, including <a href="gated%20reverb">gated reverb</a> to the mix. The master tapes were then sent for final post-production later that month.

"Doolittle" features an eclectic mix of musical styles. While tracks such as "Tame" and "<a href="Crackity%20Jones">Crackity Jones</a>" are fast and aggressive, and incorporate the band's trademark loud–quiet dynamic, other songs such as "Silver", "I Bleed", and "Here Comes Your Man" reveal a quieter, slower and more melodic temperament. With "Doolittle", the band began to incorporate further instruments into their sound; for instance, "Monkey Gone to Heaven" features two <a href="violin">violin</a>s and two <a href="cello">cello</a>s.

"Tame" is based on a <a href="three-chord%20song">three chord</a> formula; including <a href="Joey%20Santiago">Joey Santiago</a>'s playing a "<a href="Hendrix%20chord">Hendrix chord</a>" over the main bass progression. "I Bleed" is melodically simple, and is formed around a single rhythmical repetition. Some songs are influenced by other <a href="Music%20genre">genres of music</a>; while "Crackity Jones" has a distinctly <a href="Music%20of%20Spain">Spanish sound</a>, and incorporates G and A triads over a C pedal, the song's <a href="rhythm%20guitar">rhythm guitar</a>, played by Francis, starts with an eighth-note downstroke typical of <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> music.

The lyrical themes explored on "Doolittle" range from the surrealism of "<a href="Debaser">Debaser</a>", to the environmental catastrophe of "<a href="Monkey%20Gone%20to%20Heaven">Monkey Gone to Heaven</a>". The <a href="Prostitution">prostitutes</a> of "Mr. Grieves", "Tame", and "Hey" share space with the Biblical analogies of "Dead" and "Gouge Away". Black Francis often claimed that "Doolittle"'s lyrics were words which just "fit together nicely", and that "the point [of the album] is to experience it, to enjoy it, to be entertained by it". Francis wrote all the material for the album with the exception of "Silver", which he co-wrote with <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a>.

The album's opening track "Debaser" references <a href="surrealism">surrealism</a>, a theme that runs throughout the album. "Debaser" alludes to <a href="Luis%20Bu%C3%B1uel">Luis Buñuel</a> and <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>'s 1929 surrealist film "<a href="Un%20Chien%20Andalou">Un Chien Andalou</a>", and the lyric "slicing up eyeballs" refers to an early scene in the film. Surrealism heavily influenced Francis in his college years and throughout his career with the Pixies. In 1989, Francis expressed his interest in surrealism and its influence on his songwriting method to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" by stating "I got into <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> movies and Surrealism as an escape from reality. ... To me, Surrealism is totally artificial. I recently read an interview with the director <a href="David%20Lynch">David Lynch</a> who said he had ideas and images but that he didn't know exactly what they meant. That's how I write."

Another of the album's main themes is environmental catastrophe. "Monkey Gone to Heaven" deals with man's destruction of the ocean and "confusion of man's place in the universe". As Francis put it: "On one hand, it's this big organic toilet. Things get flushed and repurified or decomposed and it's this big, dark, mysterious place. It's also a very mythological place where there are octopus's gardens, the <a href="Bermuda%20Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>, <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, and mermaids." "Monkey Gone to Heaven" is concerned with man's relationship to the divine, a theme shared with "Mr. Grieves".

Two songs on "Doolittle" are fashioned after Biblical stories: the story of <a href="Bathsheba">David and Bathsheba</a> in "Dead", and <a href="Samson">Samson</a> and Delilah in "Gouge Away". Francis' fascination with Biblical themes can be traced back to his teenage years; when he was twelve, he and his parents joined an evangelical church linked to the <a href="Assemblies%20of%20God">Assemblies of God</a>. This background was to be an influence in "Doolittle", where he referred to <a href="the%20Devil">the Devil</a> being "six" and <a href="God">God</a> being "seven" in "Monkey Gone to Heaven".

Other songs explored eccentric subjects, such as in "Wave of Mutilation", which Francis described as being about "Japanese businessmen doing murder-suicides with their families because they'd failed in business, and they're driving off a pier into the ocean."

The sea and underwater themes of "Wave of Mutilation", which also feature in "Mr. Grieves" and "Monkey Gone to Heaven", are explorations of one arena for man's death and destruction. Ben Sisario points out that the album begins ("Debaser") and ends ("Gouge Away") with songs about violence being done to eyes. "<a href="Crackity%20Jones">Crackity Jones</a>" covers another offbeat subject; Francis' roommate in his student exchange trip to <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">San Juan, Puerto Rico</a>, who he described as a "weird psycho gay roommate".

"Doolittle" also references more ostensibly conventional subjects. "La La Love You", sung by the band's drummer <a href="David%20Lovering">David Lovering</a>, is a <a href="love%20song">love song</a>—though with its "first base, second base, third base, home run" break, it's been referred to as "a dig at the very idea of a love song". Francis gave it to Lovering as a song to sing, "like a <a href="Ringo%20Starr">Ringo</a> thing"; Lovering at first refused to sing, but Norton said that soon he was unable to "get him away from the microphone". As well as lead vocals on "La La Love You", Lovering played <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a> on "Silver", with Deal playing slide guitar; this arrangement did not occur again.

"Doolittle" was the first album where <a href="Simon%20Larbalestier">Simon Larbalestier</a>, the Pixies' cover photographer, and <a href="Vaughan%20Oliver">Vaughan Oliver</a>, the band's cover artist, had access to the lyrics. According to Larbalestier, this "made a fundamental difference".

The surrealist and abstract images throughout the album booklet are linked to the album's content. "Gouge Away" is represented by a picture of a spoon containing hair, laid across a woman's <a href="torso">torso</a>; a direct pictorial representation of heroin, with the spoon and the hair being horses. "I Bleed" is referenced with the image "As Loud As Hell"; the image shows "a ringing bell", with a set of teeth; this references the line "it shakes my teeth". "Walking with the Crustaceans" is a visual representation of the lyrics to "Wave of Mutilation". Larbalestier later commented that he was interested in "early Surrealist stuff" at this time.

During the recording sessions, "Whore" was discarded as a potential album title, after Oliver changed the cover artwork idea to a monkey and halo cover. Francis later explained his rationale for the move:

Francis then named the album "Doolittle", from the "Mr. Grieves" lyric "Pray for a man in the middle / One that talks like Doolittle".

In the months following "Surfer Rosa", the Pixies' management fielded calls from a number of labels. <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> <a href="A%26amp%3BR">A&R</a> scout Peter Lubin first saw the band in October 1988, when they opened for <a href="The%20Jesus%20and%20Mary%20Chain">The Jesus and Mary Chain</a>. He immediately sought to convince the band to sign to his label. Pixies contracted to Elektra Records during a UK spring tour in 1989. Elektra followed by releasing a live promotional album, which contained two songs from their forthcoming album, "Debaser" and "Gouge Away", along with a selection of earlier material.

However Elektra had not yet attained distribution rights to the band's forthcoming album. 4AD, then a small British independent record label, held worldwide distribution rights to the Pixies, but did not have access to distribution outside of the United Kingdom; the band had had to import all its previous records from Europe. The Pixies' management sought international distribution; and while negotiations with Elektra and other record companies began in the third quarter of 1988, they were only completed just two weeks before "Doolittle"'s release on April 2, 1989. <a href="PolyGram">PolyGram</a> had already secured Canadian distribution rights by that time.

"Doolittle" was released in the United Kingdom on April 17, 1989, and in the United States the following day. Throughout the States, helped by <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>' <a href="World%20music%20market">major label</a> status, retail displays were constructed for the record, and "<a href="Monkey%20Gone%20to%20Heaven">Monkey Gone to Heaven</a>", the first single from the album, was released to <a href="radio%20station">radio station</a>s for inclusion on playlists. "Doolittle"s chart performance in the United States was unremarkable; the album entered the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> at number 171. However, with the help of <a href="Campus%20radio">college radio</a>-play of "Monkey Gone to Heaven", "Doolittle" eventually rose to number 98 and spent two weeks in the Top 100. In Britain, the record reached number eight on the <a href="UK%20Album%20Chart">UK Album Chart</a>. This chart placing was an unexpected success for the band, as their previous two records, "<a href="Come%20On%20Pilgrim">Come On Pilgrim</a>" and "Surfer Rosa", had failed to make such an impact on the British charts.

In June 1989, 4AD released "Here Comes Your Man" as the album's second single. It reached number three on the US <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart and number 56 in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. It was not the last single from the album: in 1997, "Debaser" was released as a single to promote the "<a href="Death%20to%20the%20Pixies">Death to the Pixies</a>" compilation.

Following its release, "Doolittle" sold steadily in America, and broke sales of 100,000 after six months. By early 1992, while the band were supporting <a href="U2">U2</a> on their <a href="Zoo%20TV%20Tour">Zoo TV Tour</a>, the album was selling 1,500 copies per week. The middle of 1993, two years after the band's last album, "<a href="Trompe%20le%20Monde">Trompe le Monde</a>", saw sales average 1,200 copies per week. "Doolittle" was <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified</a> gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> in 1995. Ten years after the breakup, "Doolittle" was still selling between 500 and 1,000 copies a week; the reunion tour saw sales creep back up to 1,200 copies per week. At the end of 2005, best estimates put total sales in America at between 800,000 and one million copies. As of 2015, sales in the United States have exceeded 834,000 copies, according to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>.

Reaction to "Doolittle" was positive in general, with the album garnering praise from several major music publications. "<a href="NME">NME</a>" writer Edwin Pouncey commented that "the songs on "Doolittle" have the power to make you literally jump out of your skin with excitement". "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" critic Peter Kane said that "Doolittle"s "carefully structured noise and straightforward rhythmic insistence makes perfect sense". Tim Rolston of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" praised "Doolittle" as "a scintillating rock'n'roll album" and the Pixies' "finest half-hour so far". Several other publications ran positive reviews of the album, including the British music weekly "<a href="Record%20Mirror">Record Mirror</a>", "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Inquirer">The Philadelphia Inquirer</a>", the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", and the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>". "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>"s <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" wrote, "They're in love and they don't know why—with rock and roll, which is heartening in a time when so many college dropouts have lost touch with the verities". However, he concluded that "getting famous too fast could ruin them", while suggesting the lyrics reflect somewhat of a disconnection with "the outside world".

Some reviewers were more critical. "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>" said that "Gil Norton's toy theatre production makes a drama out of what should have been a crisis". "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" ran a hundred-word review of the album, including critic Joe Levy's comment "the insanity less surreal and more silly, and the songs themselves more like songs and less like adventures". "Rolling Stone", reviewing the album in July 1989, gave the album three and a half stars. "Doolittle" appeared on several end-of-year "Best Album" lists; both "Rolling Stone" and "The Village Voice" placed the album tenth, and independent music magazines "Sounds" and "Melody Maker" both ranked the album as the second-best of the year. "NME" also ranked the album highly, placing it fourth in their end-of-year list.

The sudden loud to quiet dynamic present on "Doolittle", most notably in "Tame", has been very influential on <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>. After writing "<a href="Smells%20Like%20Teen%20Spirit">Smells Like Teen Spirit</a>", both <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> and <a href="Krist%20Novoselic">Krist Novoselic</a> of <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a> thought: "this really sounds like the Pixies. People are really going to nail us for this." Producer Gil Norton usually receives much credit for the album's dynamic, and is sought by bands seeking a similar sound. <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a> guitarist <a href="James%20Iha">James Iha</a> described "Doolittle" as less raw than "Surfer Rosa" but "more listenable" and "Here Comes Your Man" as a "classic pop record". Fellow alternative musician <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a> was "in awe" of "I Bleed" and "Tame", and described Francis' writing as "amazing". The album was also included in the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

During the recording of "Doolittle", tensions between Francis and Deal became visible to band members and the production team. Bickering and standoffs between the two marred the recording sessions and led to increased stress among the band members. John Murphy, Deal's husband at the time, later recalled that with "Doolittle" it "went from just all fun to work". Exhaustion from touring and from releasing three records in two years contributed to the friction. This culminated at the end of the US post-"Doolittle" "Fuck or Fight" tour, where they were too tired to attend the end-of-tour party. Soon afterwards the band announced that they were taking a break.

After they reconvened in 1990, Francis began to limit Deal's contributions to the band. He wrote and sang all the original material on the Pixies' two subsequent albums; 1990's "<a href="Bossanova%20%28Pixies%20album%29">Bossanova</a>" and 1991's "<a href="Trompe%20le%20Monde">Trompe le Monde</a>" (both produced by Norton and mixed by Haigler). This breakdown in the relationship between Deal and Francis, first apparent during the recording of "Doolittle", ultimately led to the band's breakup in late 1992 and early 1993.

A range of music magazines have since acclaimed "Doolittle" as one of the quintessential alternative rock albums of the 1980s. "Rolling Stone", reviewing "Doolittle" again in 2002, gave the album a maximum score of five stars, remarking that it laid the "groundwork for Nineties rock". "Doolittle" has received a number of international accolades and is consistently noted as one of the best albums of the 1980s in any genre.

The information regarding accolades attributed to "Doolittle" is taken from AcclaimedMusic.net.

The band announced that the album was reissued January 12, 2015, with two additional discs of material.

Surfer Rosa

Surfer Rosa is the debut studio album by the American <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>, released in March 1988 on the British label <a href="4AD">4AD</a>. It was produced by <a href="Steve%20Albini">Steve Albini</a>. "Surfer Rosa" contains many of the elements of Pixies' earlier output, including Spanish lyrics and references to <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. It includes references to <a href="mutilation">mutilation</a> and <a href="voyeurism">voyeurism</a> alongside experimental recording techniques and a distinctive drum sound.

As 4AD was an <a href="independent%20label">independent label</a>, distribution in the United States was handled by British label <a href="Rough%20Trade%20Records">Rough Trade Records</a>; however, it failed to chart in either country. Only one single was released, a rerecorded version of "<a href="Gigantic%20%28song%29">Gigantic</a>", and reached number 93 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. "Surfer Rosa" was rereleased in the US by <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> in 1992, and in 2005 was <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified</a> gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>.

"Surfer Rosa" is often included on critics' lists of the best rock albums. Alternative rock artists including <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a> and <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a> have cited it as an inspiration; it was an influence on <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>'s 1991 album "<a href="Nevermind">Nevermind</a>", and the band hired Albini to record their 1993 album "<a href="In%20Utero%20%28album%29">In Utero</a>".

Before the release of Pixies' debut <a href="mini-album">mini-album</a> "<a href="Come%20On%20Pilgrim">Come On Pilgrim</a>" in October 1987, <a href="Ivo%20Watts-Russell">Ivo Watts-Russell</a>, head of <a href="4AD">4AD</a>, suggested they return to the studio to record a full-length album. The original plan was to record new material at <a href="Fort%20Apache%20Studios">Fort Apache Studios</a>, where the band had produced "<a href="Pixies%20%28EP%29">The Purple Tape</a>" and "Come On Pilgrim". However, due to differences between the band's manager Ken Goes and "The Purple Tape" producer <a href="Gary%20Smith%20%28record%20producer%29">Gary Smith</a>, Pixies ended up looking for a new producer and recording studio. On the advice of a 4AD colleague, Watts-Russell looked to hire <a href="Steve%20Albini">Steve Albini</a>, ex-frontman of <a href="Big%20Black">Big Black</a>, as the record's engineer and producer. Having sent a pre-release tape of "Come On Pilgrim" to Albini, Pixies' manager, Ken Goes, invited him to a Boston dinner party at drummer <a href="David%20Lovering">David Lovering</a>'s house a few weeks after "Come On Pilgrim"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s release.

Albini met the band that evening, and they discussed how the next record should sound and be recorded. According to Albini, "[the band and I] were in the studio the next day." Paul Kolderie, who had worked at Fort Apache Studios with Smith, recommended the Boston recording studio <a href="Q%20Division%20Studios">Q Division</a> to Albini. This created tension between Smith and Kolderie, and Kolderie later remarked that "Gary almost killed me for the suggestion, he thought I was scheming to get the project."

Pixies entered Q Division in December 1987, booking ten working days of studio time in which to record the album. 4AD allocated the band a budget of US$10,000. Albini's producer's fee was US$1,500, and he received no royalties; Albini has a practice of refusing royalties from records he produces, viewing it as "an insult to the band." Along with Albini in the studio, Q Division's Jon Lupfer acted as studio assistant. The recording process took the entire booked period of ten working days to complete, with extra vocal mixes subsequently added in the studio. Albini planned to mix the record "somewhere else", but according to Lupfer, "He was unhappy there with it."

Albini used unusual recording techniques. For <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a>'s backing vocals in "<a href="Where%20Is%20My%20Mind%3F">Where Is My Mind?</a>" and her lead vocals on "Gigantic", Albini moved the studio equipment and recorded in a studio bathroom to achieve real, rather than studio, echo; according to John Murphy, Deal's husband at the time, "Albini didn't like the studio sound." Albini later said that the record could have been completed in a week, but "we ended up trying more experimental stuff basically to kill time and see if anything good materialized." An example was "Something Against You", where Albini filtered <a href="Black%20Francis">Black Francis</a>' voice through a guitar amp for "a totally ragged, vicious texture."

The recording of a conversation held between Francis and Albini can be heard at the end of "Oh My Golly!". According to Lupfer, "it was a concept he [Albini] was going for to get some studio banter." As Deal was leaving the studio to smoke a cigarette, she exclaimed "If anybody touches my stuff, I'll kill ya." Francis replied with "I'll kill you, you fucking die, if anybody touches my stuff". The track begins at this point, with Francis explaining the conversation to Albini, whose voice is not heard on the track. Lupfer later admitted that Albini knew "perfectly well what was going on."

"I'm Amazed" begins with Deal recounting a story in which one of her former teachers who was "into field hockey players" was discreetly fired. Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities was to try to join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on "Surfer Rosa": "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. There are times when things like that are revealing and entertaining and I kind of felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record."

Like "<a href="Come%20On%20Pilgrim">Come On Pilgrim</a>", "Surfer Rosa" displays a mix of musical styles; pop guitar songs such as "Broken Face", "Break My Body", and "Brick Is Red" are featured alongside slower, more melodic tracks exemplified by "<a href="Where%20Is%20My%20Mind%3F">Where Is My Mind?</a>". The album includes heavier material, and prominently features the band's trademark quiet-loud dynamic. Frontman and principal songwriter Black Francis wrote the material, the only exception being "Gigantic," which was co-written with Kim Deal. "Gigantic" is one of only two Pixies album tracks on which Deal sang lead vocals.

"Surfer Rosa"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s lyrical content includes examinations of <a href="mutilation">mutilation</a> and <a href="incest">incest</a> in "Break My Body" and "Broken Face", while references to superheroes appear on "Tony's Theme". Voyeurism appears in "Gigantic", and surrealistic lyrics are featured on "Bone Machine" and "Where Is My Mind?". Puerto Rico references and Spanish lyrics are found on the tracks "Oh My Golly!" and "Vamos." The latter track was previously featured on "Come On Pilgrim", and appears on "Surfer Rosa" as a rerecorded version of the original song. Many of the themes explored on previous recordings are revisited on "Surfer Rosa"; however, unlike on the band's later albums, the songs in "Surfer Rosa" are not preoccupied with one overarching topic.

Other unusual and offbeat subject matter is raised on the album. "<a href="Cactus%20%28Pixies%20song%29">Cactus</a>" is narrated by a prison inmate who requests his girlfriend smear her dress with blood and mail it to him. "Gigantic" is an "unabashed praisesong to a well-endowed black man," and borrows from the 1986 film "<a href="Crimes%20of%20the%20Heart%20%28film%29">Crimes of the Heart</a>", in which a married woman falls in love with a teenager. Francis was inspired to write "Where Is My Mind?" after <a href="scuba%20diving">scuba diving</a> in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. He later said he had "this very small fish trying to chase me. I don't know why—I don't know too much about fish behavior."

"Surfer Rosa" was released in the UK by 4AD on March 21, 1988, entering the <a href="UK%20Indie%20Chart">UK Indie Chart</a> the following week. It spent 60 weeks in the chart, peaking at number 2. Until August of that year it was only available in the U.S. as an import. Although the label held worldwide distribution rights to Pixies, they did not have access to a distributor outside the UK. When 4AD signed a distribution deal with <a href="Rough%20Trade%20Records">Rough Trade</a>'s U.S. branch, the album was released on vinyl and cassette as part of the "Surfer Rosa/Come On Pilgrim" release. While "Surfer Rosa/Come On Pilgrim" has remained in print on CD in the UK, subsequent U.S. releases have seen the two released on separate CDs. These separate releases first appeared in January 1992, when <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a> first reissued the band's first two albums. After 4AD reacquired rights to the band's U.S. distribution, they released both as separate CDs. "Surfer Rosa" was <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified</a> gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> in 2005, 17 years after its original release.

"<a href="Gigantic%20%28song%29">Gigantic</a>" was the only single taken from "Surfer Rosa". The track and its <a href="B-side">B-side</a>, "River Euphrates", were rerecorded by <a href="Gil%20Norton">Gil Norton</a> at Blackwing Studios in London, early in May 1988. The remixed single was well met by critics. The single failed to sell, and spent just one week at number 93 on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. Despite the poor commercial performance of both "Surfer Rosa" and "Gigantic", Ivo Watts-Russell has said that the response to the album was "times five" compared with "Come On Pilgrim".

"Surfer Rosa"s <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a>work features a photograph of a topless "friend of a friend" of the band, posing as a <a href="flamenco">flamenco</a> dancer, pitched against a wall which displays a <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a> and a torn poster. <a href="Simon%20Larbalestier">Simon Larbalestier</a>, who contributed pictures to all Pixies <a href="album%20sleeve">album sleeve</a>s, decided to build the set because "we couldn't find the atmosphere we wanted naturally." According to Larbalestier, Black Francis came up with the idea for the cover as he wrote songs in his father's "topless Spanish bar"; Larbalestier added the crucifix and torn poster, and they "sort of loaded that with all the Catholicism." Commenting on the cover in 2005, Francis said, "I just hope people find it tasteful." The cover booklet expands on the theme, and features photographs of the flamenco dancer in several other poses; there are no song lyrics or written content, apart from album credits, in the booklet.

Albini's name does not appear on the original record sleeve. The booklet's photographs were taken in one day at a pub opposite the 4AD offices, because, according to Larbalestier, "it was one of the few places that had a raised stage". In a 1988 interview with <a href="Joy%20Press">Joy Press</a>, Black Francis described the concept as referring to "a surfer girl," who "walks along the Beach of Binones, has a surfboard, very beautiful." When questioned about the topless element, he replied, "For the first record, I told them I liked nudity. I like body lines—not necessarily something in bad taste, didn't even have to be female, just body lines ... like that <a href="Obsession%20%28perfume%29">Obsession</a> ad, you know?" According to "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", the album was originally entitled "Gigantic" after Deal's song, but the band feared misinterpretation of the cover and changed it to "Surfer Rosa." The "name" of the cover woman, and the album title, comes from the "Oh My Golly!" lyric "Besando chichando con surfer rosa", which roughly translates to "Kissing Chicha with Surfer Rosa".

UK music press reviews of "Surfer Rosa" were generally positive. "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Ian Cranna wrote that "what sets the Pixies apart are their sudden bursts of memorable pop melody," and noted that "they could have a bright future ahead of them." "<a href="NME">NME</a>"s Mark Sinker, reviewing the album in March 1988, said "they force the past to sound like them", while Dave Henderson from "Underground" magazine found the songs "well crafted, well delivered sketches which embrace commercial ideals as well as bizarre left-field out of control moments". American music magazine "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" described it as "beautifully brutal", and named Pixies their musicians of the year. In a less enthusiastic contemporary review for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> found the band's guitar riffs recognizable and their strong rhythms unique, but felt they had been overrated by critics who hailed them as "the Amerindie find of the year". In a 2003 review of <a href="Pixies%20%28EP%29">the Pixies' 2002 self-titled EP</a>, Christgau wrote that while he initially found Francis' fey and philosophically limited lyrics somewhat annoying, "Surfer Rosa" now seemed "audaciously funny and musically prophetic".

At the end of 1988, "Surfer Rosa" was named one of the year's best albums on English critics' year-end lists. Independent music magazines "Melody Maker" and "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>" named "Surfer Rosa" as their album of the year; "<a href="NME">NME</a>" and "<a href="Record%20Mirror">Record Mirror</a>" placed the album 10th and 14th, respectively. However, "Surfer Rosa" failed to appear on "The Village Voice"s <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>, an annual poll of American critics. It also did not appear on any end-of-year list in the United States. A number of music magazines have since positioned "Surfer Rosa" as one of the quintessential alternative rock records of the 1980s. The album has appeared on several all-time best album lists, and is consistently placed as one of the best albums of the 1980s in any genre.

As of 2015, sales in the United States have exceeded 705,000 copies, according to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>.

Both "Surfer Rosa" and Steve Albini's production of the album have been influential on <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, and on <a href="grunge">grunge</a> in particular. <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>'s <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a> cited "Surfer Rosa" as the basis for "<a href="Nevermind">Nevermind</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he "heard songs off of "Surfer Rosa" that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody." Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album "<a href="In%20Utero%20%28album%29">In Utero</a>", primarily due to his contribution to "Surfer Rosa". <a href="The%20Smashing%20Pumpkins">The Smashing Pumpkins</a>' <a href="Billy%20Corgan">Billy Corgan</a> described "Surfer Rosa" as "the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame." Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a> said that "Surfer Rosa" "blew my mind," and that she "immediately went to track down Steve Albini." Cobain listed "Surfer Rosa" as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.

People connected with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: "I remember when I first heard "Surfer Rosa" thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like <a href="The%20Fall%20%28band%29">The Fall</a>.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw." Gary Smith, who at the time was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he "was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record." <a href="Dinosaur%20Jr.">Dinosaur Jr.</a>'s <a href="J%20Mascis">J Mascis</a>, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums "<a href="Bossanova%20%28Pixies%20album%29">Bossanova</a>" and "<a href="Trompe%20le%20Monde">Trompe le Monde</a>", said he thought that Steve Albini's production "sounded way better than the other ones."

In 1991, as Pixies were recording "<a href="Trompe%20le%20Monde">Trompe le Monde</a>", Albini described his impressions of Pixies during the recording of "Surfer Rosa" to the <a href="fan%20magazine">fan magazine</a> "<a href="Forced%20Exposure">Forced Exposure</a>": "A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock. Their willingness to be 'guided' by their manager, their record company and their producers is unparalleled. Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings." Albini later apologized for his remarks, saying, "to this day I regret having done it. I don't think that I regarded the band as significantly as I should have."

Lead(II) nitrate

Lead(II) nitrate is an <a href="inorganic%20compound">inorganic compound</a> with the <a href="chemical%20formula">chemical formula</a> <a href="lead">Pb</a>(<a href="Nitrate">NO</a>). It commonly occurs as a colourless <a href="crystal">crystal</a> or white powder and, unlike most other lead(II) <a href="salt%20%28chemistry%29">salts</a>, is <a href="solubility">soluble</a> in <a href="water%20%28molecule%29">water</a>.

Known since the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> by the name plumb dulcis, the production of lead(II) nitrate from either metallic <a href="lead">lead</a> or <a href="lead%28II%29%20oxide">lead oxide</a> in <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> was small-scale, for direct use in making other <a href="Inorganic%20compounds%20by%20element%23Lead%20%28Plumbum%29">lead compounds</a>. In the 19th century lead(II) nitrate began to be produced commercially in Europe and the United States. Historically, the main use was as a raw material in the production of <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s for <a href="lead%20paint">lead paint</a>s, but such paints have been superseded by less toxic paints based on <a href="titanium%20dioxide">titanium dioxide</a>. Other industrial uses included heat <a href="stabilizer%20%28chemistry%29">stabilization</a> in <a href="nylon">nylon</a> and <a href="polyester">polyester</a>s, and in coatings of <a href="thermography">photothermographic</a> paper. Since around the year 2000, lead(II) nitrate has begun to be used in <a href="gold%20cyanidation">gold cyanidation</a>.

Lead(II) nitrate is <a href="toxicity">toxic</a>, an <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizing agent</a>, and is categorised as "<a href="List%20of%20IARC%20Group%202A%20carcinogens">probably carcinogenic to humans</a>" by the <a href="International%20Agency%20for%20Research%20on%20Cancer">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a>. Consequently, it must be handled and stored with the appropriate safety precautions to prevent inhalation, ingestion and skin contact. Due to its <a href="Hazard">hazardous nature</a>, the limited applications of lead(II) nitrate are under constant scrutiny.

Since the Middle Ages, lead(II) nitrate has been produced as a raw material for the production of coloured pigments in <a href="lead%20paint">lead paint</a>s, such as <a href="chrome%20yellow">chrome yellow</a> (lead(II) chromate), <a href="chrome%20orange">chrome orange</a> (lead(II) hydroxide chromate) and similar <a href="Inorganic%20compounds%20by%20element%23Lead%20%28Plumbum%29">lead compounds</a>. These pigments were used for <a href="dyeing">dyeing</a> and printing <a href="calico%20%28textile%29">calico</a> and other textiles.

In 1597, the German <a href="alchemy">alchemist</a> <a href="Andreas%20Libavius">Andreas Libavius</a> first described the compound, coining the medieval names of "plumb dulcis" and "calx plumb dulcis", meaning "sweet lead", because of its taste. Although originally not understood during the following centuries, the <a href="decrepitation">decrepitation</a> property of lead(II) nitrate led to its use in matches and special <a href="explosive%20material">explosives</a> such as <a href="lead%28II%29%20azide">lead azide</a>.

The production process was and still is chemically straightforward, effectively dissolving <a href="lead">lead</a> in <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> and subsequently harvesting the <a href="Precipitation%20%28chemistry%29">precipitate</a>. However, the production remained small-scale for many centuries, and the commercial production of lead(II) nitrate as raw material for the manufacture of other lead compounds was not reported until 1835. In 1974, the <a href="United%20States">U.S.</a> consumption of lead compounds, excluding pigments and <a href="gasoline">gasoline</a> additives, was 642 tons.

The <a href="crystal%20structure">crystal structure</a> of solid lead(II) nitrate has been determined by <a href="neutron%20diffraction">neutron diffraction</a>. The compound <a href="crystallization">crystallizes</a> in the cubic system with the lead atoms in a <a href="cubic%20crystal%20system">face-centred cubic</a> system. Its <a href="space%20group">space group</a> is Pa3 (<a href="Bravais%20lattice">Bravais lattice</a> notation), with each side of the cube with length 784 <a href="picometre">picometre</a>s.

The black dots represent the lead atoms, the white dots the nitrate groups 27 picometres above the plane of the lead atoms, and the blue dots the nitrate groups the same distance below this plane. In this configuration, every lead atom is <a href="chemical%20bond">bonded</a> to twelve oxygen atoms (<a href="bond%20length">bond length</a>: 281 pm). All N–O bond lengths are identical, at 127 picometres.

Research interest in the crystal structure of lead(II) nitrate was partly based on the possibility of free internal rotation of the nitrate groups within the crystal lattice at elevated temperatures, but this did not materialise.

Lead(II) nitrate can be obtained by dissolving <a href="lead">metallic lead</a> in aqueous <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>:

More commonly, it is obtained by dissolving <a href="lead%28II%29%20oxide">lead(II) oxide</a> in nitric acid:

In either case, since the <a href="solvent">solvent</a> is concentrated nitric acid (in which lead(II) nitrate has very low solubility) and the resulting solution contains <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a> ions, anhydrous crystals of lead(II) nitrate spontaneously form as a result of the <a href="common%20ion%20effect">common ion effect</a>:

Most commercially available lead(II) nitrate, as well as <a href="laboratory">laboratory</a>-scale material, is produced accordingly. Supply is in 25 kilogram bags up to 1000 kilogram <a href="Flexible%20intermediate%20bulk%20container">big bags</a>, and in laboratory containers, both by general producers of laboratory chemicals and by producers of lead and <a href="Inorganic%20compounds%20by%20element%23Lead%20%28Plumbum%29">lead compounds</a>. No large-scale production has been reported.

In nitric acid treatment of lead-containing wastes, e.g., in the processing of lead–<a href="bismuth">bismuth</a> wastes from lead refineries, impure solutions of lead(II) nitrate are formed as <a href="by-product">by-product</a>. These solutions are reported to be used in the <a href="gold%20cyanidation">gold cyanidation</a> process.

Apart from <a href="lead%28II%29%20acetate">lead(II) acetate</a>, lead(II) nitrate is the only common soluble lead compound. Lead(II) nitrate readily <a href="solvation">dissolves</a> in water to give a clear, colourless solution. As an <a href="ionic%20compound">ionic substance</a>, the dissolution of lead(II) nitrate involves <a href="dissociation%20%28chemistry%29">dissociation</a> into its constituent ions.

When concentrated <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a> solution is added to lead(II) nitrate solution, <a href="Alkali%20salt">basic nitrates</a> are formed, even well past the <a href="equivalence%20point">equivalence point</a>. Up through the half equivalence point, Pb(NO)·Pb(OH) predominates, then after this point Pb(NO)·5Pb(OH) is formed. No simple Pb(OH) is formed up to at least <a href="pH">pH</a> 12.

Lead(II) nitrate is associated with interesting <a href="supramolecular%20chemistry">supramolecular chemistry</a> because of its <a href="complex%20%28chemistry%29">coordination</a> to <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> electron-donating compounds. The interest is largely academic, but with several potential applications. For example, combining lead nitrate and <a href="diethylene%20glycol">pentaethylene glycol</a> (EO) in a solution of <a href="acetonitrile">acetonitrile</a> and <a href="methanol">methanol</a> followed by slow <a href="evaporation">evaporation</a> produces a new crystalline material [Pb(NO)(EO)]. In the crystal structure for this compound, the EO chain is wrapped around the lead ion in an <a href="Celestial%20sphere">equatorial plane</a> similar to that of a <a href="crown%20ether">crown ether</a>. The two bidentate nitrate <a href="ligand">ligand</a>s are in <a href="Cis-trans%20isomerism">trans configuration</a>. The total <a href="coordination%20number">coordination number</a> is 10, with the lead ion in a bicapped <a href="square%20antiprism">square antiprism</a> <a href="molecular%20geometry">molecular geometry</a>.

The complex formed by lead(II) nitrate, <a href="lead%28II%29%20perchlorate">lead(II) perchlorate</a> and a <a href="thiazole">bithiazole</a> bidentate N-donor ligand is binuclear, with a nitrate group bridging the lead atoms with coordination number of 5 and 6. One interesting aspect of this type of complexes is the presence of a physical gap in the <a href="coordination%20sphere">coordination sphere</a>; i.e., the ligands are not placed symmetrically around the metal ion. This is potentially due to a lead <a href="lone%20pair">lone pair</a> of electrons, also found in lead complexes with an <a href="imidazole">imidazole</a> ligand.

This type of chemistry is not unique to the nitrate salt; other lead(II) compounds such as <a href="lead%28II%29%20bromide">lead(II) bromide</a> also form complexes, but the nitrate is frequently used because of its solubility properties and its bidentate nature.

Lead(II) nitrate is an <a href="oxidizing%20agent">oxidizing agent</a>. Depending on the reaction, this may be due to the Pb(aq) ion, which has a standard <a href="reduction%20potential">reduction potential</a> (E) of −0.125 V, or the nitrate ion, which under acidic conditions has an E of +0.956 V. The nitrate would function at high temperatures or in an acidic condition, while the lead(II) works best in a neutral aqueous solution.

When heated, lead(II) nitrate crystals decompose to <a href="lead%28II%29%20oxide">lead(II) oxide</a>, <a href="Oxygen%23Allotropes">oxygen</a> and <a href="nitrogen%20dioxide">nitrogen dioxide</a>.

Because of this property, lead nitrate is sometimes used in <a href="pyrotechnics">pyrotechnics</a> such as <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a>.

Lead(II) nitrate is soluble in water but is almost insoluble in nitric acid.

Because of the hazardous nature of lead(II) nitrate, there is a preference for using alternatives in industrial applications. In the formerly major application of <a href="lead%20paint">lead paint</a>s, it has largely been replaced by <a href="titanium%20dioxide">titanium dioxide</a>. Other historical applications of lead(II) nitrate, such as in matches and fireworks, have declined or ceased as well. Current applications of lead(II) nitrate include use as a heat stabiliser in nylon and polyesters, as a coating for <a href="thermography">photothermographic</a> paper, and in <a href="rodenticide">rodenticide</a>s.

On a laboratory scale, lead(II) nitrate provides one of two convenient and reliable sources of <a href="dinitrogen%20tetroxide">dinitrogen tetroxide</a>. By carefully drying lead(II) nitrate and then heating it in a steel vessel, <a href="nitrogen%20dioxide">nitrogen dioxide</a> is produced, which dimerizes into the desired compound.

To improve the <a href="Tank%20leaching">leaching</a> process in the <a href="gold%20cyanidation">gold cyanidation</a>, lead(II) nitrate solution is added. Although a bulk process, only limited amounts (10 to 100 milligrams lead(II) nitrate per kilogram gold) are required. Both the cyanidation itself, as well as the use of lead compounds in the process, are deemed controversial due to the compounds' toxic nature.

In organic chemistry, lead(II) nitrate has been used as an oxidant, for example as an alternative to the <a href="Sommelet%20reaction">Sommelet reaction</a> for oxidation of <a href="benzyl">benzyl</a>ic halides to aldehydes. It has also found use in the preparation of <a href="isothiocyanate">isothiocyanate</a>s from <a href="dithiocarbamate">dithiocarbamate</a>s. Because of its toxicity it has largely fallen out of favour, but it still finds occasional use, for example as a <a href="bromide">bromide</a> scavenger during <a href="SN1%20reaction">S1 substitution</a>.

Lead(II) nitrate is toxic, and ingestion may lead to acute lead poisoning, as is applicable for all soluble lead compounds. All <a href="Inorganic%20compounds%20by%20element%23Lead%20%28Plumbum%29">inorganic lead compounds</a> are classified by the <a href="International%20Agency%20for%20Research%20on%20Cancer">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a> (IARC) as <a href="List%20of%20IARC%20Group%202A%20carcinogens">probably carcinogenic to humans</a> (Category 2A). They have been linked to <a href="renal%20cell%20carcinoma">renal cancer</a> and <a href="glioma">glioma</a> in experimental animals and to renal cancer, <a href="brain%20tumor">brain cancer</a> and <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> in humans, although studies of workers exposed to lead are often complicated by concurrent exposure to <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>. Lead is known to substitute for <a href="zinc">zinc</a> in a number of <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s, including <a href="porphobilinogen%20synthase">δ-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase</a> (porphobilinogen synthase) in the <a href="heme">haem</a> biosynthetic pathway and <a href="Nucleotidase">pyrimidine-5′-nucleotidase</a>, important for the correct metabolism of <a href="DNA">DNA</a> and can therefore cause fetal damage.

Anna Anderson

Anna Anderson (16 December 1896 – 12 February 1984) was the best known of <a href="Romanov%20impostors">several impostors</a> who claimed to be <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Anastasia%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia</a>. Anastasia, the youngest daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a> and <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Alexandra</a>, was <a href="Execution%20of%20the%20Romanov%20family">killed along with her parents and siblings</a> on 17 July 1918 by <a href="communist">communist</a> revolutionaries in <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, but the location of her body was unknown until 2007.

In 1920, Anderson was institutionalized in a mental hospital after a suicide attempt in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. At first, she went by the name "Fräulein Unbekannt" (German for Miss Unknown) as she refused to reveal her identity. Later she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson. In March 1922, claims that Anderson was a <a href="Grand%20duke%23Russian%20grand%20dukes">Russian grand duchess</a> first received public attention. Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia's family and those who had known her, including court tutor <a href="Pierre%20Gilliard">Pierre Gilliard</a>, said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia. In 1927, a private investigation funded by the Tsarina's brother, <a href="Ernest%20Louis%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Hesse">Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse</a>, identified Anderson as Franziska Schanzkowska, a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness. After a lawsuit lasting many years, the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia, but through media coverage, her claim gained notoriety.

Between 1922 and 1968, Anderson lived in Germany and the United States with various supporters and in nursing homes and sanatoria, including at least one asylum. She emigrated to the United States in 1968. Shortly before the expiration of her visa she married history professor Jack Manahan, who was later characterized as "probably <a href="Charlottesville">Charlottesville</a>'s best-loved eccentric". Upon her death in 1984, Anderson's body was cremated, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at <a href="Seeon%20Abbey">Castle Seeon, Germany</a>.

After the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">collapse of communism</a> in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, the locations of the bodies of the Tsar, Tsarina, and all five of their children were revealed. Multiple laboratories in different countries confirmed their identity through <a href="DNA%20testing">DNA testing</a>. DNA tests on a lock of Anderson's hair and surviving medical samples of her tissue showed that her DNA did not match that of the Romanov remains or that of living relatives of the Romanovs. Instead, Anderson's <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> matched that of Karl Maucher, a great-nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska. Most scientists, historians and journalists who have discussed the case accept that Anderson and Schanzkowska were the same person.

On 27 February 1920, a young woman attempted to take her own life in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> by jumping off a bridge called the <a href="Bendlerblock">Bendlerbrücke</a> into the <a href="Landwehrkanal">Landwehrkanal</a>. She was rescued by a police sergeant and was admitted to the on <a href="L%C3%BCtzowplatz">Lützowstrasse</a>. As she was without papers and refused to identify herself, she was admitted as "Fräulein Unbekannt" ("Miss Unknown") to a mental hospital in Dalldorf (now <a href="Wittenau">Wittenau</a>, in <a href="Reinickendorf">Reinickendorf</a>), where she remained for the next two years. The unknown patient had scars on her head and body and spoke German with an accent described as "Russian" by medical staff.

In early 1922, Clara Peuthert, a fellow psychiatric patient, claimed that the unknown woman was <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Tatiana%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia</a>, one of the four daughters of <a href="Tsar%20Nicholas%20II">Tsar Nicholas II</a>. On her release, Peuthert told <a href="White%20%C3%A9migr%C3%A9">Russian émigré</a> Captain <a href="Nicholas%20von%20Schwabe">Nicholas von Schwabe</a> that she had seen Tatiana at Dalldorf. Schwabe visited the asylum and accepted the woman as Tatiana. Schwabe persuaded other émigrés to visit the unknown woman, including <a href="Zinaida%20Tolstoy">Zinaida Tolstoy</a>, a friend of <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Tsarina Alexandra</a>. Eventually <a href="Baroness%20Sophie%20Buxhoeveden">Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden</a>, a former <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a> to the Tsarina, visited the asylum with Tolstoy. On seeing the woman, Buxhoeveden declared "She's too short for Tatiana," and left convinced the woman was not a Russian grand duchess. A few days later, the unknown woman noted, "I did not say I was Tatiana."

A nurse at Dalldorf, Thea Malinovsky, claimed years after the patient's release from the asylum that the woman had told her she was another daughter of the Tsar, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Anastasia%20Nikolaevna%20of%20Russia">Anastasia</a>, in the autumn of 1921. However, the patient herself could not recall the incident. Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky's claim, or weave it into their narrative.

By May 1922, the woman was believed by Peuthert, Schwabe, and Tolstoy to be Anastasia, although Buxhoeveden said there was no resemblance. Nevertheless, the woman was taken out of the asylum and given a room in the Berlin home of Baron Arthur von Kleist, a Russian émigré who had been a police chief in <a href="Russian%20Poland">Russian Poland</a> before the fall of the Tsar. The Berlin policeman who handled the case, Detective Inspector Franz Grünberg, thought that Kleist "may have had ulterior motives, as was hinted at in émigré circles: if the old conditions should ever be restored in Russia, he hoped for great advancement from having looked after the young woman."

She began calling herself Anna Tschaikovsky, choosing "Anna" as a short form of "Anastasia", although Peuthert "described her everywhere as Anastasia". Tschaikovsky stayed in the houses of acquaintances, including Kleist, Peuthert, a poor working-class family called Bachmann, and at Inspector Grünberg's estate at Funkenmühle, near <a href="Zossen">Zossen</a>. At Funkenmühle, Grünberg arranged for the Tsarina's sister, <a href="Princess%20Irene%20of%20Hesse%20and%20by%20Rhine">Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine</a>, to meet Tschaikovsky, but Irene did not recognize her. Grünberg also arranged a visit from <a href="Crown%20Princess%20Cecilie%20of%20Prussia">Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia</a>, but Tschaikovsky refused to speak to her, and Cecilie was left perplexed by the encounter. Later, in the 1950s, Cecilie signed a declaration that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, but Cecilie's family disputed her statement and implied that she was suffering from dementia.

By 1925, Tschaikovsky had developed a tuberculous infection of her arm, and she was placed in a succession of hospitals for treatment. Sick and near death, she suffered significant loss of weight. She was visited by the Tsarina's groom of the chamber <a href="Aleksei%20Andreyevich%20Volkov">Alexei Volkov</a>; Anastasia's tutor <a href="Pierre%20Gilliard">Pierre Gilliard</a>; his wife, Shura, who had been Anastasia's nursemaid; and the Tsar's sister, <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Olga%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Olga</a>. Although they expressed sympathy, if only for Tschaikovsky's illness, and made no immediate public declarations, eventually they all denied she was Anastasia. In March 1926, she convalesced in <a href="Lugano">Lugano</a> with <a href="Harriet%20von%20Rathlef">Harriet von Rathlef</a> at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia's great-uncle, <a href="Prince%20Valdemar%20of%20Denmark">Prince Valdemar of Denmark</a>. Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance, through the Danish ambassador to Germany, <a href="Herluf%20Zahle">Herluf Zahle</a>, while her identity was investigated. To allow her to travel, the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a temporary certificate of identity as "Anastasia Tschaikovsky", with Grand Duchess Anastasia's personal details. After a quarrel with Rathlef, Tschaikovsky was moved to the Stillachhaus Sanatorium at <a href="Oberstdorf">Oberstdorf</a> in the <a href="Bavarian%20Alps">Bavarian Alps</a> in June 1926, and Rathlef returned to Berlin.

At Oberstdorf, Tschaikovsky was visited by Tatiana Melnik, "née" Botkin. Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin, the head of the Russian refugee office in Berlin, and the daughter of the imperial family's personal physician, Dr. <a href="Eugene%20Botkin">Eugene Botkin</a>, who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar's family in 1918. Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last spoken to her in February 1917. To Melnik, Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia, even though "the mouth has changed and coarsened noticeably, and because the face is so lean, her nose looks bigger than it was." In a letter, Melnik wrote: "Her attitude is childlike, and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult, but must be led and directed like a child. She has not only forgotten languages, but has in general lost the power of accurate narration ... even the simplest stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly; they are really only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical German ... Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight." Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia, and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state. Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to "aid the patient's weak memory" or as part of a deliberate charade, Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family.

In 1927, under pressure from his family, Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky with any further financial support, and the funds from Denmark were cut off. <a href="Duke%20of%20Leuchtenberg">Duke George of Leuchtenberg</a>, a distant relative of the Tsar, gave her a home at <a href="Seeon%20Abbey">Castle Seeon</a>. The Tsarina's brother, <a href="Ernest%20Louis%2C%20Grand%20Duke%20of%20Hesse">Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse</a>, hired a private detective, Martin Knopf, to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia.

During her stay at Castle Seeon, Knopf reported that Tschaikovsky was actually a Polish factory worker called Franziska Schanzkowska. Schanzkowska had worked in a munitions factory during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> when, shortly after her fiancé had been killed at the front, a grenade fell out of her hand and exploded. She had been injured in the head, and a foreman was killed in front of her. She became apathetic and depressed, was declared insane on 19 September 1916, and spent time in two lunatic asylums. In early 1920, she was reported missing from her Berlin lodgings, and since then had not been seen or heard from by her family. In May 1927, Franziska's brother Felix Schanzkowski was introduced to Tschaikovsky at a local inn in <a href="Wasserburg%20am%20Inn">Wasserburg</a> near Castle Seeon. Leuchtenberg's son, Dmitri, was completely certain that Tschaikovsky was an impostor and that she was recognized by Felix as his sister, but Leuchtenberg's daughter, Natalie, remained convinced of Tschaikovsky's authenticity. Leuchtenberg himself was ambivalent. According to one account, initially Felix declared that Tschaikovsky was his sister Franziska, but the affidavit he signed spoke only of a "strong resemblance", highlighted physical differences, and said she did not recognize him. Years later, Felix's family said that he knew Tschaikovsky was his sister, but he had chosen to leave her to her new life, which was far more comfortable than any alternative.

Visitors to Seeon included <a href="Prince%20Felix%20Yusupov">Prince Felix Yusupov</a>, husband of <a href="Princess%20Irina%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia</a>, who wrote, ""I claim categorically that she is not Anastasia Nicolaievna, but just an adventuress, a sick hysteric and a frightful playactress." I simply cannot understand how anyone can be in doubt of this. If you had seen her, I am "convinced" that you would recoil in horror at the thought that this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar." Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and <a href="Gleb%20Botkin">Gleb Botkin</a>, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik's brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.

By 1928, Tschaikovsky's claim had received interest and attention in the United States, where Gleb Botkin had published articles in support of her cause. Botkin's publicity caught the attention of a distant cousin of Anastasia's, <a href="Princess%20Xenia%20Georgievna%20of%20Russia">Xenia Leeds</a>, a former Russian princess who had married a wealthy American industrialist. Botkin and Leeds arranged for Tschaikovsky to travel to the United States on board the liner "<a href="SS%20Imperator">Berengaria</a>" at Leeds's expense. On the journey from Seeon to the States, Tschaikovsky stopped at Paris, where she met <a href="Grand%20Duke%20Andrei%20Vladimirovich%20of%20Russia">Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia</a>, the Tsar's cousin, who believed her to be Anastasia. For six months Tschaikovsky lived at the estate of the Leeds family in <a href="Oyster%20Bay%20%28hamlet%29%2C%20New%20York">Oyster Bay, New York</a>.

As the tenth anniversary of the Tsar's execution approached in July 1928, Botkin retained a lawyer, Edward Fallows, to oversee legal moves to obtain any of the Tsar's estate outside of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. As the death of the Tsar had never been proved, the estate could only be released to relatives ten years after the supposed date of his death. Fallows set up a company, called the Grandanor Corporation (an acronym of Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia), which sought to raise funds by selling shares in any prospective estate. Tschaikovsky claimed that the Tsar had deposited money abroad, which fed unsubstantiated rumors of a large Romanov fortune in England. The surviving relatives of the Romanovs accused Botkin and Fallows of fortune hunting, and Botkin accused them of trying to defraud "Anastasia" out of her inheritance. Except for a relatively small deposit in Germany, distributed to the Tsar's recognized relations, no money was ever found. After a quarrel, possibly over Tschaikovsky's claim to the estate (but not over her claim to be Anastasia), Tschaikovsky moved out of the Leeds' mansion, and the pianist <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a> arranged for her to live at the <a href="Garden%20City%20Hotel">Garden City Hotel</a> in <a href="Hempstead%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Hempstead, New York</a>, and later in a small cottage. To avoid the press, she was booked in as Mrs. Anderson, the name by which she was subsequently known. In October 1928, after the death of the Tsar's mother, the Dowager Empress <a href="Maria%20Feodorovna%20%28Dagmar%20of%20Denmark%29">Marie</a>, the 12 nearest relations of the Tsar met at Marie's funeral and signed a declaration that denounced Anderson as an impostor. The Copenhagen Statement, as it would come to be known, explained: "Our sense of duty compels us to state that the story is only a fairy tale. The memory of our dear departed would be tarnished if we allowed this fantastic story to spread and gain any credence." Gleb Botkin answered with a public letter to <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Xenia%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia</a>, which referred to the family as "greedy and unscrupulous" and claimed they were only denouncing Anderson for money.

From early 1929 Anderson lived with Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy <a href="Park%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Park Avenue</a> spinster happy to host someone she supposed to be a daughter of the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the <a href="New%20York%20Supreme%20Court">New York Supreme Court</a> signed an order committing her to a mental hospital. Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County, New York</a>, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1932, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner "<a href="SS%20Deutschland%20%281923%29">Deutschland</a>". Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at <a href="Ilten">Ilten</a> near <a href="Hanover">Hanover</a>. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.

Anderson's return to Germany generated press interest, and drew more members of the German aristocracy to her cause. She again lived itinerantly as a guest of her well-wishers. In 1932, the British tabloid "<a href="News%20of%20the%20World">News of the World</a>" published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud. Her lawyer, Fallows, filed suit for libel, but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany, and German residents could not sue in enemy countries. From 1938, lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested the distribution of the Tsar's estate to his recognized relations, and they in turn contested her identity. The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades; <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten</a> footed some of his German relations' legal bills against Anderson. The protracted proceedings became the longest-running lawsuit in German history.

Anderson had a final meeting with the Schanzkowski family in 1938. Gertrude Schanzkowska was insistent that Anderson was her sister, Franziska, but the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi</a> government had arranged the meeting to determine Anderson's identity, and if accepted as Schanzkowska she would be imprisoned. The Schanzkowski family refused to sign affidavits against her, and no further action was taken. In 1939, <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> began with Germany's attack on the western half of <a href="Poland">Poland</a>. In 1940, Edward Fallows died virtually destitute after wasting all his own money on trying to obtain the Tsar's non-existent fortune for the Grandanor Corporation. Towards the end of the war, Anderson lived at Schloss Winterstein with Louise of <a href="Saxe-Meiningen">Saxe-Meiningen</a>, in what became the <a href="Soviet%20occupation%20zone">Soviet occupation zone</a>. In 1946, Prince Frederick of <a href="Saxe-Altenburg">Saxe-Altenburg</a> helped her across the border to <a href="Bad%20Liebenzell">Bad Liebenzell</a> in the <a href="Allied-occupied%20Germany%23French%20Zone%20of%20Occupation">French occupation zone</a>.

Prince Frederick settled Anderson in a former army barracks in the small village of Unterlengenhardt, on the edge of the <a href="Black%20Forest">Black Forest</a>, where she became a sort of tourist attraction. <a href="Lili%20Dehn">Lili Dehn</a>, a friend of Tsarina Alexandra, visited her and acknowledged her as Anastasia, but when <a href="Charles%20Sydney%20Gibbes">Charles Sydney Gibbes</a>, English tutor to the imperial children, met Anderson he denounced her as a fraud. In an affidavit, he swore "She in no way resembles the true Grand Duchess Anastasia that I had known ... I am quite satisfied that she is an impostor." She became a recluse, surrounded by cats, and her house began to decay. In May 1968, Anderson was taken to a hospital at <a href="Neuenb%C3%BCrg">Neuenbürg</a> after being discovered semi-conscious in her cottage. In her absence, Prince Frederick cleaned up the property by order of the local board of health. Her Irish Wolfhound and 60 cats were put to death. Horrified by this, Anderson accepted her long-term supporter <a href="Gleb%20Botkin">Gleb Botkin</a>'s offer to move to the United States.

Botkin was living in the <a href="college%20town">university town</a> of <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville, Virginia</a>, and a local friend of his, history professor and genealogist John Eacott "Jack" Manahan, paid for Anderson's journey to the United States. She entered the country on a six-month visitor's visa, and shortly before it was due to expire, Anderson married Manahan, who was 20 years her junior, in a civil ceremony on 23 December 1968. Botkin was best man. Jack Manahan enjoyed this marriage of convenience, and described himself as "Grand Duke-in-Waiting" or "son-in-law to the Tsar". The couple lived in separate bedrooms in a house on University Circle in Charlottesville, and also owned a farm near <a href="Scottsville%2C%20Virginia">Scottsville</a>. Botkin died in December 1969. In February of the following year, 1970, the lawsuits finally came to an end, with neither side able to establish Anderson's identity.

Manahan and Anderson, now legally called Anastasia Manahan, became well known in the Charlottesville area as eccentrics. Though Jack Manahan was wealthy, they lived in squalor with large numbers of dogs and cats, and piles of garbage. On 20 August 1979, Anderson was taken to Charlottesville's <a href="Martha%20Jefferson%20Hospital">Martha Jefferson Hospital</a> with an intestinal obstruction. A gangrenous tumor and a length of intestine were removed by Dr. Richard Shrum.

With both Manahan and Anderson in failing health, in November 1983, Anderson was institutionalized, and an attorney, William Preston, was appointed as her guardian by the local <a href="Virginia%20Circuit%20Court">circuit court</a>. A few days later, Manahan "kidnapped" Anderson from the hospital, and for three days they drove around Virginia eating out of convenience stores. After a 13-state police alarm, they were found and Anderson was returned to a care facility. In January she may have had a stroke, and on 12 February 1984, she died of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. She was cremated the same day, and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at <a href="Seeon%20Abbey">Castle Seeon</a> on 18 June 1984. Manahan died on 22 March 1990.

In 1991, the bodies of Tsar <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a>, Tsarina <a href="Alexandra%20Feodorovna%20%28Alix%20of%20Hesse%29">Alexandra</a>, and three of their daughters were exhumed from a mass grave near <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a>. They were identified on the basis of both skeletal analysis and DNA testing. For example, <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> was used to match maternal relations, and mitochondrial DNA from the female bones matched that of <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, whose maternal grandmother <a href="Princess%20Victoria%20of%20Hesse%20and%20by%20Rhine">Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine</a> was a sister of Alexandra. The bodies of Tsarevich <a href="Tsarevich%20Alexei%20Nikolaevich%20of%20Russia">Alexei</a> and the remaining daughter were discovered in 2007. Repeated and independent DNA tests confirmed that the remains were the seven members of the <a href="House%20of%20Romanov">Romanov family</a>, and proved that none of the Tsar's four daughters survived the <a href="shooting%20of%20the%20Romanov%20family">shooting of the Romanov family</a>.

A sample of Anderson's tissue, part of her intestine removed during her operation in 1979, had been stored at <a href="Martha%20Jefferson%20Hospital">Martha Jefferson Hospital</a>, <a href="Charlottesville%2C%20Virginia">Charlottesville, Virginia</a>. Anderson's mitochondrial DNA was extracted from the sample and compared with that of the Romanovs and their relatives. It did not match that of the Duke of Edinburgh or that of the bones, confirming that Anderson was not related to the Romanovs. However, the sample matched DNA provided by Karl Maucher, a grandson of Franziska Schanzkowska's sister, Gertrude (Schanzkowska) Ellerik, indicating that Karl Maucher and Anna Anderson were maternally related and that Anderson was Schanzkowska. Five years after the original testing was done, Dr. Terry Melton of the Department of Anthropology, <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University">Pennsylvania State University</a>, stated that the DNA sequence tying Anderson to the Schanzkowski family was "still unique", though the database of DNA patterns at the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20DNA%20Identification%20Laboratory">Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory</a> had grown much larger, leading to "increased confidence that Anderson was indeed Franziska Schanzkowska".

Similarly, several strands of Anderson's hair, found inside an envelope in a book that had belonged to Anderson's husband, Jack Manahan, were also tested. Mitochondrial DNA from the hair matched Anderson's hospital sample and that of Schanzkowska's relative Karl Maucher, but not the Romanov remains or living relatives of the Romanovs.

Although communists had killed the entire imperial Romanov family in July 1918, including 17-year-old Grand Duchess Anastasia, for years afterwards <a href="Propaganda%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">communist disinformation</a> fed rumors that members of the Tsar's family had survived. The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make <a href="Romanov%20impostors">spurious claims that they were a surviving Romanov</a>.

Most of the impostors were dismissed; however, Anna Anderson's claim persisted. Books and pamphlets supporting her claims included <a href="Harriet%20von%20Rathlef">Harriet von Rathlef</a>'s book "Anastasia, ein Frauenschicksal als Spiegel der Weltkatastrophe" ("Anastasia, a Woman's Fate as Mirror of the World Catastrophe"), which was published in Germany and Switzerland in 1928, though it was serialized by the tabloid newspaper "Berliner Nachtausgabe" in 1927. This was countered by works such as "La Fausse Anastasie" ("The False Anastasia") by <a href="Pierre%20Gilliard">Pierre Gilliard</a> and Constantin Savitch, published by Payot of Paris in 1929. Conflicting testimonies and physical evidence, such as comparisons of facial characteristics, which alternately supported and contradicted Anderson's claim, were used either to bolster or to counter the belief that she was Anastasia. In the absence of any direct documentary proof or solid physical evidence, the question of whether Anderson was Anastasia was for many a matter of personal belief. As Anderson herself said in her own idiomatic English, "You either believe it or you don't believe it. It doesn't matter. In no anyway whatsoever." The German courts were unable to decide her claim one way or another, and eventually, after 40 years of deliberation, ruled that her claim was "neither established nor refuted". Dr. Günter von Berenberg-Gossler, attorney for Anderson's opponents in the later years of the legal case, said that during the German trials "the press were always more interested in reporting her side of the story than the opposing bench's less glamorous perspective; editors often pulled journalists after reporting testimony delivered by her side and ignored the rebuttal, resulting in the public seldom getting a complete picture."

In 1957, a version of Anderson's story, pieced together by her supporters and interspersed with commentary by , was published in Germany under the title "Ich, Anastasia, Erzähle" ("I, Anastasia, an autobiography"). The book included the "fantastic tale" that Anastasia escaped from Russia on a farm cart with a man called Alexander Tschaikovsky, whom she married and had a child by, before he was shot dead on a <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> street, and that the child, Alexei, disappeared into an orphanage. Even Anderson's supporters admitted that the details of the supposed escape "might seem bold inventions even for a dramatist", while her detractors considered "this barely credible story as a piece of far-fetched romance". Other works based on the premise that Anderson was Anastasia, written before the DNA tests, include biographies by Peter Kurth and James Blair Lovell. More recent biographies by <a href="John%20Klier">John Klier</a>, <a href="Robert%20Massie">Robert Massie</a>, and <a href="Greg%20King%20%28author%29">Greg King</a> that describe her as an impostor were written after the DNA tests proved that she was not Anastasia.

Assessments vary as to whether Anderson was a deliberate impostor, delusional, traumatized into adopting a new identity, or someone used by her supporters for their own ends. <a href="Pierre%20Gilliard">Pierre Gilliard</a> denounced Anderson as "a cunning psychopath". The equation of Anderson with members of the imperial family began with Clara Peuthert in the Dalldorf Asylum, rather than with Anderson herself. Anderson appeared to go along with it afterwards. Writer Michael Thornton thought, "Somewhere along the way she lost and rejected Schanzkowska. She lost that person totally and accepted completely she was this new person. I think it happened by accident and she was swept along on a wave of euphoria." <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten</a>, a first cousin of the Romanov children, thought her supporters "simply get rich on the royalties of further books, magazine articles, plays etc." <a href="Prince%20Michael%20Romanov">Prince Michael Romanov</a>, a grandson of <a href="Grand%20Duchess%20Xenia%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Russia">Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia</a>, stated the Romanov family always knew Anderson was a fraud, and that the family looked upon her and "the three-ringed circus which danced around her, creating books and movies, as a vulgar insult to the memory of the Imperial Family."

Since the 1920s, many fictional works have been inspired by Anderson's claim to be Anastasia. In 1928, the silent film "<a href="Clothes%20Make%20the%20Woman">Clothes Make the Woman</a>" was based very loosely on her story. In 1953, Marcelle Maurette wrote a play based on Rathlef's and Gilliard's books called "Anastasia", which toured Europe and America with <a href="Viveca%20Lindfors">Viveca Lindfors</a> in the title role. The play was so successful that in 1956 an English adaptation by <a href="Guy%20Bolton">Guy Bolton</a> was made into a film, "<a href="Anastasia%20%281956%20film%29">Anastasia</a>". The plot revolves around a group of swindlers who attempt to raise money among Russian émigrés by pretending that Grand Duchess Anastasia is still alive. A suitable amnesiac, "Anna", is groomed by the swindlers to impersonate Anastasia. Anna's origins are unknown and as the play progresses hints are dropped that she could be the real Anastasia, who has lost her memory. The viewer is left to decide whether Anna really is Anastasia. Another film was released at the same time, "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Anastasia">Is Anna Anderson Anastasia?</a>" starring <a href="Lilli%20Palmer">Lilli Palmer</a>, which covers much the same ground, but the central character is "perhaps even more lost, mad and pathetic, but she, too, has moments when she is a woman of presence and dignity".

Playwright <a href="Royce%20Ryton">Royce Ryton</a> wrote "I Am Who I Am" about Anna Anderson in 1978. Like the earlier plays, it depicts Anderson as "a person of intrinsic worth victimized by the greed and fears of others" and did not attempt to decide her real identity.

In 1965, the musical "<a href="Anya%20%28musical%29">Anya</a>", based on Guy Bolton's play and using the music of <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a>, opened on Broadway starring <a href="Constance%20Towers">Constance Towers</a> as Anya and <a href="Lillian%20Gish">Lillian Gish</a> as the Dowager Empress—it was not successful.

<a href="Kenneth%20MacMillan">Sir Kenneth MacMillan</a>'s ballet "Anastasia", first performed in 1967, used "I, Anastasia, an autobiography" as inspiration and "is a dramatic fantasy about Anna Anderson, the woman who believes herself to be Anastasia ... Either in memory or imagination, she experiences episodes from Anastasia's past ... The structure is a kind of free-wheeling nightmare, held together by the central figure of the heroine, played by <a href="Lynn%20Seymour">Lynn Seymour</a>". A contemporary reviewer thought Seymour's "tense, tormented portrait of the desperate Anna Anderson is quite extraordinary and really impressive". Anna Anderson was also used as a narrative device in <a href="Youri%20V%C3%A1mos">Youri Vámos</a>' 1992 ballet for <a href="Theater%20Basel">Theater Basel</a>, "Sleeping Beauty – Last Daughter of the Czar", based on <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sleeping%20Beauty%20%28ballet%29">Sleeping Beauty</a>".

In December 1986, <a href="NBC">NBC</a> ran a two-part fictionalized mini-series titled "" which starred <a href="Amy%20Irving">Amy Irving</a> and won her a <a href="Golden%20Globe">Golden Globe</a> nomination. In the words of Hal Erickson, "Irving plays the leading character in a lady-or-the-tiger fashion, so that we never know if she truly swallows her own tale or if she's merely a clever charlatan."

The central character ("Anastasia" or "Anya") of the 1997 animated fantasy "<a href="Anastasia%20%281997%20film%29">Anastasia</a>" is portrayed as the actual Grand Duchess Anastasia, even though the film was released after DNA tests proved that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia. The film is an entirely fictional musical entertainment, and in the words of one reviewer, "historical facts are treated with particular contempt".

Shielded metal arc welding

Shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), also known as manual metal arc welding (MMA or MMAW), flux shielded arc welding or informally as stick welding, is a manual <a href="arc%20welding">arc welding</a> process that uses a consumable <a href="electrode">electrode</a> covered with a <a href="flux%20%28metallurgy%29">flux</a> to lay the weld.

An <a href="current%20%28electricity%29">electric current</a>, in the form of either <a href="alternating%20current">alternating current</a> or <a href="direct%20current">direct current</a> from a <a href="welding%20power%20supply">welding power supply</a>, is used to form an <a href="electric%20arc">electric arc</a> between the electrode and the <a href="metal">metal</a>s to be <a href="Welding%20joint">joined</a>. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (<a href="weld%20pool">weld pool</a>) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a <a href="shielding%20gas">shielding gas</a> and providing a layer of <a href="slag%20%28welding%29">slag</a>, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.

Because of the versatility of the process and the simplicity of its equipment and operation, shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's first and most popular welding processes. It dominates other welding processes in the maintenance and repair industry, and though <a href="flux-cored%20arc%20welding">flux-cored arc welding</a> is growing in popularity, SMAW continues to be used extensively in the construction of heavy steel structures and in industrial fabrication. The process is used primarily to weld <a href="iron">iron</a> and <a href="steel">steel</a>s (including <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a>) but <a href="aluminium">aluminium</a>, <a href="nickel">nickel</a> and <a href="copper">copper</a> <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s can also be welded with this method.

After the discovery of the short pulsed electric arc in 1800 by <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Humphry Davy</a> and of the continuous electric arc in 1802 by <a href="Vasily%20Vladimirovich%20Petrov">Vasily Petrov</a>, there was little development in electrical welding until <a href="Auguste%20de%20M%C3%A9ritens">Auguste de Méritens</a> developed a carbon arc torch that was patented in 1881.

In 1885, <a href="Nikolay%20Benardos">Nikolay Benardos</a> and <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Olszewski">Stanisław Olszewski</a> developed <a href="carbon%20arc%20welding">carbon arc welding</a>, obtaining American patents from 1887 showing a rudimentary electrode holder. In 1888, the consumable metal electrode was invented by <a href="Nikolay%20Slavyanov">Nikolay Slavyanov</a>. Later in 1890, <a href="C.%20L.%20Coffin">C. L. Coffin</a> received for his arc welding method that utilized a metal electrode. The process, like SMAW, deposited melted electrode metal into the weld as filler.

Around 1900, A. P. Strohmenger and <a href="Oscar%20Kjellberg">Oscar Kjellberg</a> released the first coated electrodes. Strohmenger used <a href="clay">clay</a> and <a href="Lime%20%28mineral%29">lime</a> coating to stabilize the arc, while Kjellberg dipped iron wire into mixtures of <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a>s and <a href="silicate">silicate</a>s to coat the electrode. In 1912, Strohmenger released a heavily coated electrode, but high cost and complex production methods prevented these early electrodes from gaining popularity. In 1927, the development of an <a href="extrusion">extrusion</a> process reduced the cost of coating electrodes while allowing manufacturers to produce more complex coating mixtures designed for specific applications. In the 1950s, manufacturers introduced iron powder into the flux coating, making it possible to increase the welding speed.

In 1938 K. K. Madsen described an automated variation of SMAW, now known as <a href="gravity%20welding">gravity welding</a>. It briefly gained popularity in the 1960s after receiving publicity for its use in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese shipyards though today its applications are limited. Another little used variation of the process, known as <a href="firecracker%20welding">firecracker welding</a>, was developed around the same time by <a href="George%20Hafergut">George Hafergut</a> in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. In 1964 laser welding was developed in Bell Laboratory with the intention of using this technology as a communication tool. Due to the large force of energy coupled with the small area of focus, this laser became a powerful heat source for cutting and tooling.

To strike the electric arc, the electrode is brought into contact with the workpiece by a very light touch of the electrode to the base metal. The electrode is then pulled back slightly. This initiates the arc and thus the melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to the <a href="weld%20pool">weld pool</a>. Striking an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of the arc. As the electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> and other <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">atmospheric</a> gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces the amount of time that the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.

The actual welding technique utilized depends on the electrode, the composition of the workpiece, and the position of the joint being welded. The choice of electrode and welding position also determine the welding speed. Flat welds require the least operator skill, and can be done with electrodes that melt quickly but solidify slowly. This permits higher welding speeds.

Sloped, vertical or upside-down welding requires more operator skill, and often necessitates the use of an electrode that solidifies quickly to prevent the molten metal from flowing out of the weld pool. However, this generally means that the electrode melts less quickly, thus increasing the time required to lay the weld.

The most common quality problems associated with SMAW include weld spatter, porosity, poor fusion, shallow penetration, and cracking.

Weld spatter, while not affecting the integrity of the weld, damages its appearance and increases cleaning costs. Secondary finishing services are often required due to the aesthetic appearance caused by the occurrence of molten splatter. It can be caused by excessively high current, a long arc, or <a href="arc%20blow">arc blow</a>, a condition associated with direct current characterized by the electric arc being deflected away from the weld pool by magnetic forces. Arc blow can also cause porosity in the weld, as can joint contamination, high welding speed, and a long welding arc, especially when low-hydrogen electrodes are used.

Porosity, often not visible without the use of advanced <a href="nondestructive%20testing">nondestructive testing</a> methods, is a serious concern because it can potentially weaken the weld. Another defect affecting the strength of the weld is poor fusion, though it is often easily visible. It is caused by low current, contaminated joint surfaces, or the use of an improper electrode.

Shallow penetration, another detriment to weld strength, can be addressed by decreasing welding speed, increasing the current or using a smaller electrode. Any of these weld-strength-related defects can make the weld prone to cracking, but other factors are involved as well. High carbon, alloy or sulfur content in the base material can lead to cracking, especially if low-hydrogen electrodes and preheating are not employed. Furthermore, the workpieces should not be excessively restrained, as this introduces residual stresses into the weld and can cause cracking as the weld cools and contracts.

SMAW welding, like other welding methods, can be a dangerous and unhealthy practice if proper precautions are not taken. The process uses an open electric arc, which presents a risk of burns which are prevented by <a href="personal%20protective%20equipment">personal protective equipment</a> in the form of heavy <a href="leather">leather</a> <a href="glove">glove</a>s and long sleeve jackets. Additionally, the brightness of the weld area can lead to a condition called <a href="arc%20eye">arc eye</a>, in which <a href="ultraviolet%20light">ultraviolet light</a> causes inflammation of the <a href="cornea">cornea</a> and can burn the <a href="retina">retina</a>s of the eyes. Welding <a href="helmet">helmet</a>s with dark face plates are worn to prevent this exposure, and in recent years, new helmet models have been produced that feature a face plate that self-darkens upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. To protect bystanders, especially in industrial environments, translucent welding curtains often surround the welding area. These curtains, made of a <a href="polyvinyl%20chloride">polyvinyl chloride</a> plastic film, shield nearby workers from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc, but should not be used to replace the filter glass used in helmets.

In addition, the vaporizing metal and flux materials expose welders to dangerous gases and <a href="particulate">particulate</a> matter. The <a href="smoke">smoke</a> produced contains particles of various types of <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s. The size of the particles in question tends to influence the <a href="toxic">toxic</a>ity of the fumes, with smaller particles presenting a greater danger. Additionally, gases like <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and <a href="ozone">ozone</a> can form, which can prove dangerous if ventilation is inadequate. Some of the latest welding masks are fitted with an electric powered fan to help disperse harmful fumes.

Shielded metal arc welding is one of the world's most popular welding processes, accounting for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and <a href="gas%20metal%20arc%20welding">gas metal arc welding</a> has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.

SMAW is often used to weld <a href="carbon%20steel">carbon steel</a>, low and high <a href="alloy%20steel">alloy steel</a>, stainless steel, <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a>, and <a href="ductile%20iron">ductile iron</a>. While less popular for <a href="nonferrous">nonferrous</a> materials, it can be used on nickel and copper and their alloys and, in rare cases, on aluminium. The thickness of the material being welded is bounded on the low end primarily by the skill of the welder, but rarely does it drop below . No upper bound exists: with proper joint preparation and use of multiple passes, materials of virtually unlimited thicknesses can be joined. Furthermore, depending on the electrode used and the skill of the welder, SMAW can be used in any position.

Shielded metal arc welding equipment typically consists of a constant current welding power supply and an electrode, with an electrode holder, a 'ground' clamp, and welding cables (also known as welding leads) connecting the two.

The power supply used in SMAW has constant current output, ensuring that the current (and thus the heat) remains relatively constant, even if the arc distance and voltage change. This is important because most applications of SMAW are manual, requiring that an operator hold the torch. Maintaining a suitably steady arc distance is difficult if a constant voltage power source is used instead, since it can cause dramatic heat variations and make welding more difficult. However, because the current is not maintained absolutely constant, skilled welders performing complicated welds can vary the arc length to cause minor fluctuations in the current.
The preferred polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily upon the electrode being used and the desired properties of the weld. Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) causes heat to build up on the electrode, increasing the electrode melting rate and decreasing the depth of the weld. Reversing the polarity so that the electrode is positively charged (DCEP) and the workpiece is negatively charged increases the weld penetration. With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even heat distribution and providing a balance between electrode melting rate and penetration.

Typically, the equipment used for SMAW consists of a <a href="transformer">step-down transformer</a> and for direct current models a <a href="rectifier">rectifier</a>, which converts alternating current into direct current. Because the power normally supplied to the welding machine is high-voltage alternating current, the welding transformer is used to reduce the voltage and increase the current. As a result, instead of 220 <a href="Volt">V</a> at 50 <a href="Ampere">A</a>, for example, the power supplied by the transformer is around 17–45 V at currents up to 600 A. A number of different types of transformers can be used to produce this effect, including multiple coil and <a href="inverter%20%28electrical%29">inverter</a> machines, with each using a different method to manipulate the welding current. The multiple coil type adjusts the current by either varying the number of turns in the coil (in tap-type transformers) or by varying the distance between the primary and secondary coils (in movable coil or movable core transformers). Inverters, which are smaller and thus more portable, use electronic components to change the current characteristics.

<a href="Electrical%20generator">Electrical generator</a>s and <a href="alternator">alternator</a>s are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, but because of lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also tends to be more difficult, because of the complexities of using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.

In some units the alternator is essentially the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60 Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400 Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.

The choice of electrode for SMAW depends on a number of factors, including the weld material, welding position and the desired weld properties. The electrode is coated in a metal mixture called flux, which gives off gases as it decomposes to prevent weld contamination, introduces deoxidizers to purify the weld, causes weld-protecting slag to form, improves the arc stability, and provides alloying elements to improve the weld quality. Electrodes can be divided into three groups—those designed to melt quickly are called "fast-fill" electrodes, those designed to solidify quickly are called "fast-freeze" electrodes, and intermediate electrodes go by the name "fill-freeze" or "fast-follow" electrodes. Fast-fill electrodes are designed to melt quickly so that the welding speed can be maximized, while fast-freeze electrodes supply filler metal that solidifies quickly, making welding in a variety of positions possible by preventing the weld pool from shifting significantly before solidifying.

The composition of the electrode core is generally similar and sometimes identical to that of the base material. But even though a number of feasible options exist, a slight difference in alloy composition can strongly impact the properties of the resulting weld. This is especially true of alloy steels such as <a href="HSLA%20steel">HSLA steel</a>s. Likewise, electrodes of compositions similar to those of the base materials are often used for welding nonferrous materials like aluminium and copper. However, sometimes it is desirable to use electrodes with core materials significantly different from the base material. For example, stainless steel electrodes are sometimes used to weld two pieces of carbon steel, and are often utilized to weld stainless steel workpieces with carbon steel workpieces.

Electrode coatings can consist of a number of different compounds, including <a href="rutile">rutile</a>, <a href="calcium%20fluoride">calcium fluoride</a>, <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, and iron powder. Rutile electrodes, coated with 25%–45% TiO, are characterized by ease of use and good appearance of the resulting weld. However, they create welds with high hydrogen content, encouraging <a href="Hydrogen%20embrittlement">embrittlement</a> and cracking. Electrodes containing calcium fluoride (CaF), sometimes known as basic or low-hydrogen electrodes, are <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a> and must be stored in dry conditions. They produce strong welds, but with a coarse and convex-shaped joint surface. <a href="Cellulose%20electrode">Electrodes</a> coated with cellulose, especially when combined with rutile, provide deep weld penetration, but because of their high moisture content, special procedures must be used to prevent excessive risk of cracking. Finally, iron powder is a common coating additive that increases the rate at which the electrode fills the weld joint, up to twice as fast.

To identify different electrodes, the American Welding Society established a system that assigns electrodes with a four- or five-digit number. Covered electrodes made of mild or low alloy steel carry the prefix "E", followed by their number. The first two or three digits of the number specify the tensile strength of the weld metal, in thousand <a href="Pound-force%20per%20square%20inch">pounds per square inch</a> (ksi). The penultimate digit generally identifies the welding positions permissible with the electrode, typically using the values 1 (normally fast-freeze electrodes, implying all position welding) and 2 (normally fast-fill electrodes, implying horizontal welding only). The welding current and type of electrode covering are specified by the last two digits together. When applicable, a suffix is used to denote the alloying element being contributed by the electrode.

Common electrodes include the E6010, a fast-freeze, all-position electrode with a minimum tensile strength of which is operated using DCEP, and provides deep weld penetration with a forceful arc capable of burning through light rust or oxides on the workpiece. E6011 is similar except its flux coating allows it to be used with alternating current in addition to DCEP. E7024 is a fast-fill electrode, used primarily to make flat or horizontal welds using AC, DCEN, or DCEP. Examples of fill-freeze electrodes are the E6012, E6013, and E7014, all of which provide a compromise between fast welding speeds and all-position welding.

Though SMAW is almost exclusively a manual arc welding process, one notable process variation exists, known as gravity welding or gravity arc welding. It serves as an automated version of the traditional shielded metal arc welding process, employing an electrode holder attached to an inclined bar along the length of the weld. Once started, the process continues until the electrode is spent, allowing the operator to manage multiple gravity welding systems. The electrodes employed (often E6027 or E7024) are coated heavily in flux, and are typically in length and about thick. As in manual SMAW, a constant current welding power supply is used, with either negative polarity direct current or alternating current. Due to a rise in the use of semiautomatic welding processes such as flux-cored arc welding, the popularity of gravity welding has fallen as its economic advantage over such methods is often minimal. Other SMAW-related methods that are even less frequently used include firecracker welding, an automatic method for making butt and fillet welds, and massive electrode welding, a process for welding large components or structures that can deposit up to of weld metal per hour.

Execution by elephant

Execution by elephant was a common method of <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a> in <a href="south%20Asia">South</a> and <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, particularly in <a href="India">India</a>, where <a href="Asian%20elephant">Asian elephant</a>s were used to <a href="Crushing%20%28execution%29">crush</a>, dismember or torture captives in <a href="public%20execution">public execution</a>s. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims immediately or to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolute power</a> and his ability to control wild animals.

The sight of elephants executing captives both horrified and attracted the interest of European travellers and was recorded in numerous contemporary journals and accounts of life in Asia. The practice was eventually suppressed by the <a href="European%20colonialism">European empires</a> that colonised the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. While primarily confined to Asia, the practice was occasionally adopted by <a href="Western%20world">Western</a> powers, such as <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Rome</a> and <a href="Carthage">Carthage</a>, particularly to deal with mutinous soldiers.

The intelligence, domesticability and versatility of the elephant gave it considerable advantages over other wild animals such as <a href="lion">lion</a>s and <a href="bear">bear</a>s used as executioners by the Romans. Elephants are more tractable than <a href="horse">horse</a>s: while a horse can be trained to charge into battle, it will not willingly trample an enemy soldier, and will instead step over him. Elephants will trample their enemies, hence the popularity of <a href="war%20elephant">war elephant</a>s with generals such as <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>. Elephants can be trained to execute prisoners in a variety of ways, and can be taught to prolong the agony of the victim by inflicting a slow death by torture or to kill the condemned quickly by stepping on the head.

Historically, the elephants were under the constant control of a driver or "<a href="mahout">mahout</a>", thus enabling a ruler to grant a last-minute reprieve and display merciful qualities. Several such exercises of <a href="pardon">mercy</a> are recorded in various Asian kingdoms. The kings of <a href="Siam">Siam</a> trained their elephants to roll the convicted person "about the ground rather slowly so that he is not badly hurt". The <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> <a href="Emperor">Emperor</a> <a href="Akbar%20the%20Great">Akbar the Great</a> is said to have "used this technique to chastise 'rebels' and then in the end the prisoners, presumably much chastened, were given their lives". On one occasion, Akbar was recorded to have had a man thrown to the elephants to suffer five days of such treatment before pardoning him. Elephants were occasionally used in <a href="trial%20by%20ordeal">trial by ordeal</a> in which the condemned prisoner was released if he managed to fend off the elephant.

The use of elephants in such fashion went beyond the common royal power to dispense life and death. Elephants have long been used as symbols of royal authority (and still are in some places, such as <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, where <a href="White%20elephant%20%28pachyderm%29">white elephants</a> are held in reverence). Their use as instruments of state power sent the message that the ruler was able to preside over very powerful creatures who were under total command. The ruler was thus seen as maintaining a moral and spiritual domination over wild beasts, adding to their authority and mystique among subjects.

Execution by elephant has been done in many parts of the world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the <a href="Classical%20antiquity">classical period</a>. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While <a href="African%20elephant">African elephant</a>s are significantly larger than <a href="Asian%20elephant">Asian elephant</a>s, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals in warfare or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.

Elephants are widely reported to have been used to carry out executions in Southeast Asia, and were used in <a href="Burma">Burma</a> and <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> from the earliest historical times as well as in the kingdom of <a href="Champa">Champa</a> on the other side of the <a href="Indochina">Indochinese</a> Peninsula. In <a href="Siam">Siam</a>, elephants were trained to throw the condemned into the air before trampling them to death. <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton%20%28sailor%29">Alexander Hamilton</a> provides the following account from Siam:

The journal of <a href="John%20Crawfurd">John Crawfurd</a> records another method of execution by elephant in the kingdom of <a href="Cochinchina">Cochinchina</a> (modern south <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>), where he served as a British envoy in 1821. Crawfurd recalls an event where "the criminal is tied to a stake, and [Excellency's favourite] elephant runs down upon him and crushes him to death."

Elephants were used as executioners of choice in India for many centuries. Hindu and Muslim rulers executed tax evaders, rebels and enemy soldiers alike "under the feet of elephants". The Hindu "<a href="Manu%20Smriti">Manu Smriti</a>" or Laws of Manu, written down around AD 200, prescribed execution by elephants for a number of offences. If property was stolen, for instance, "the king should have any thieves caught in connection with its disappearance executed by an elephant." For example, in 1305, the <a href="Delhi%20Sultanate">sultan of Delhi</a> turned the deaths of <a href="Mongol">Mongol</a> prisoners into public entertainment by having them crushed by elephants.

During the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> era, "it was a common mode of execution in those days to have the offender trampled underfoot by an elephant." Captain <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton%20%28sailor%29">Alexander Hamilton</a>, writing in 1727, described how the Mughal ruler <a href="Shah%20Jahan">Shah Jahan</a> ordered an offending military commander to be carried "to the Elephant Garden, and there to be executed by an Elephant, which is reckoned to be a shameful and terrible Death". The <a href="List%20of%20Mughal%20emperors">Mughal Emperor</a> <a href="Humayun">Humayun</a> ordered the crushing by elephant of an <a href="imam">imam</a> he mistakenly believed to be critical of his reign. Some monarchs also adopted this form of execution for their own entertainment. Another Mughal ruler, the emperor <a href="Jahangir">Jahangir</a>, is said to have ordered a huge number of criminals to be crushed for his amusement. The <a href="France">French</a> traveler <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Bernier">François Bernier</a>, who witnessed such executions, recorded his dismay at the pleasure that the emperor derived from this cruel punishment. Nor was crushing the only method used by the Mughals' execution elephants; in the Mughal sultanate of <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a>, elephants were trained to slice prisoners to pieces "with pointed blades fitted to their tusks".
The Muslim traveler <a href="Ibn%20Battuta">Ibn Battuta</a>, visiting <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> in the 1330s, has left the following eyewitness account of this particular type of execution by elephants:
Other Indian polities also carried out executions by elephant. The <a href="Maratha">Maratha</a> <a href="Chatrapati">Chatrapati</a> <a href="Sambhaji">Sambhaji</a> ordered this form of death for a number of conspirators, including the Maratha official Anaji Datto in the late seventeenth century. Another Maratha leader, the general <a href="Santaji">Santaji</a>, inflicted the punishment for breaches in military discipline. The contemporary historian Khafi Khan reported that "for a trifling offense he [Santaji] would cast a man under the feet of an elephant."

The early-19th-century writer <a href="Robert%20Kerr%20%28writer%29">Robert Kerr</a> relates how the king of <a href="Goa">Goa</a> "keeps certain elephants for the execution of malefactors. When one of these is brought forth to dispatch a criminal, if his keeper desires that the offender be destroyed speedily, this vast creature will instantly crush him to atoms under his foot; but if desired to torture him, will break his limbs successively, as men are <a href="breaking%20wheel">broken on the wheel</a>." The naturalist <a href="Georges-Louis%20Leclerc%2C%20Comte%20de%20Buffon">Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon</a> cited this flexibility of purpose as evidence that elephants were capable of "human reasoning, [rather] than a simple, natural instinct".

Such executions were often held in public as a warning to any who may transgress. To that end, many of the elephants were especially large, often weighing in excess of nine tons. The executions were intended to be gruesome and often were. They were sometimes preceded by torture publicly inflicted by the same elephant used for the execution. An account of one such torture-and-execution at <a href="Baroda">Baroda</a> in 1814 has been preserved in "The Percy Anecdotes":

The use of elephants as executioners continued well into the latter half of the 19th century. During an expedition to central India in 1868, <a href="Louis%20Rousselet">Louis Rousselet</a> described the execution of a criminal by an elephant. A sketch depicting the execution showed the condemned being forced to place his head upon a pedestal, and then being held there while an elephant crushed his head underfoot. The sketch was made into a <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> and printed in "<a href="Le%20Tour%20du%20Monde">Le Tour du Monde</a>", a widely circulated French journal of travel and adventure, as well as foreign journals such as "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>".

The growing power of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> led to the decline and eventual end of elephant executions in India. Writing in 1914, Eleanor Maddock noted that in <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a>, since the arrival of Europeans, "many of the old customs are disappearing – and one of these is the dreadful custom of the execution of criminals by an elephant trained for the purpose and which was known by the hereditary name of 'Gunga Rao'."

Elephants were widely used across the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a> and South Asia as a method of execution. The English sailor <a href="Robert%20Knox%20%28sailor%29">Robert Knox</a>, writing in 1681, described a method of execution by elephant which he had witnessed while being held captive in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>. Knox says the elephants he witnessed had their <a href="tusk">tusk</a>s fitted with "sharp Iron with a socket with three edges". After impaling the victim's body with its tusks, the elephant would "then tear it in pieces, and throw it limb from limb".

The 19th century traveler <a href="James%20Emerson%20Tennent">James Emerson Tennent</a> comments that "a Kandyan [Sri Lankan] chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured us that the elephant never once applied his tusks, but, placing his foot on the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden movement of his trunk." Knox's book depicts exactly this method of execution in a famous drawing, "An Execution by an Eliphant".

Writing in 1850, the British diplomat <a href="Henry%20Charles%20Sirr">Henry Charles Sirr</a> described a visit to one of the elephants that had been used by <a href="Sri%20Vikrama%20Rajasinha">Sri Vikrama Rajasinha</a>, the last king of <a href="Kandy">Kandy</a>, to execute criminals. Crushing by elephant had been abolished by the British after they overthrew the Kandyan kingdom in 1815 but the king's execution elephant was still alive and evidently remembered its former duties. Sirr comments:

During the <a href="medieval">medieval</a> period, executions by elephants were used by several West Asian imperial powers, including the <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Byzantine</a>, <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid</a>, <a href="Seljuq%20dynasty">Seljuq</a> and <a href="Timurid%20dynasty">Timurid</a> empires. When the Sassanid king <a href="Khosrau%20II">Khosrau II</a>, who had a harem of 3,000 wives and 12,000 female slaves, demanded as a wife Hadiqah, the daughter of the Christian Arab <a href="Al-Nu%27man%20III%20ibn%20al-Mundhir">Na'aman</a>, Na'aman refused to permit his Christian daughter to enter the harem of a <a href="Zoroastrian">Zoroastrian</a>; for this refusal, he was trampled to death by an elephant.

The practice appears to have been adopted in parts of the Muslim Middle East. <a href="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> <a href="Petachiah%20of%20Ratisbon">Petachiah of Ratisbon</a>, a twelfth-century Jewish traveler, reported an execution by this means during his stay in <a href="Seljuq%20dynasty">Seljuk</a>-ruled northern <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> (modern <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>):

The <a href="Roman%20Empire">Romans</a>, <a href="Carthage">Carthaginians</a> and <a href="ancient%20Macedonians">ancient Macedonians</a> occasionally used elephants for executions while also making use of <a href="war%20elephant">war elephant</a>s for military purposes, most famously in the case of <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>. Deserters, prisoners of war and military criminals are recorded by ancient chroniclers to have been put to death under the foot of an elephant. <a href="Perdiccas">Perdiccas</a>, who became regent of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a> on the death of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> in 323 BC, had mutineers from the faction of <a href="Meleager%20%28general%29">Meleager</a> thrown to the elephants to be crushed in the city of <a href="Babylon">Babylon</a>. The Roman writer <a href="Quintus%20Curtius%20Rufus">Quintus Curtius Rufus</a> relates the story in his Historiae Alexandri Magni: "Perdiccas saw that they [the mutineers] were paralyzed and at his mercy. He withdrew from the main body some 300 men who had followed Meleager at the time when he burst from the first meeting held after Alexander's death, and before the eyes of the entire army he threw them to the elephants. All were trampled to death beneath the feet of the beasts...".

Similarly, the Roman writer <a href="Valerius%20Maximus">Valerius Maximus</a> records how the general <a href="Lucius%20Aemilius%20Paulus%20Macedonicus">Lucius Aemilius Paulus Macedonicus</a> "after King <a href="Perseus%20of%20Macedon">Perseus</a> was vanquished [in 167 BC], for the same fault (desertion) threw men under elephants to be trampled ... And indeed military discipline needs this kind of severe and abrupt punishment, because this is how strength of arms stands firm, which, when it falls away from the right course, will be subverted."

There are fewer records of elephants being used as straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> and the <a href="deuterocanonical%20books">deuterocanonical book</a> of <a href="3%20Maccabees">3 Maccabees</a> in connection with the <a href="Egyptian%20Jews">Egyptian Jews</a>, though the story is likely apocryphal. 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by <a href="Ptolemy%20IV%20Philopator">Ptolemy IV Philopator</a> (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of <a href="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants. The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.

Arctic tern

The Arctic tern ("Sterna paradisaea") is a <a href="tern">tern</a> in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Laridae">Laridae</a>. This <a href="bird">bird</a> has a <a href="%3Awiktionary%3Acircumpolar">circumpolar</a> breeding distribution covering the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> and sub-Arctic regions of Europe, Asia, and North America (as far south as <a href="Brittany%20%28administrative%20region%29">Brittany</a> and <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>). The <a href="species">species</a> is strongly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, seeing two summers each year as it migrates along a convoluted route from its northern breeding grounds to the Antarctic coast for the southern summer and back again about six months later. Recent studies have shown average annual roundtrip lengths of about for birds nesting in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> and <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> and about for birds nesting in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>. These are by far the longest migrations known in the animal kingdom. The Arctic tern flies as well as glides through the air. It nests once every one to three years (depending on its mating cycle); once it has finished nesting it takes to the sky for another long southern migration.

Arctic terns are medium-sized birds. They have a length of and a <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a> of . They are mainly grey and white plumaged, with a red/orangish beak and feet, white forehead, a black nape and crown (streaked white), and white cheeks. The grey mantle is 305 mm, and the scapulae are fringed brown, some tipped white. The upper wing is grey with a white leading edge, and the collar is completely white, as is the rump. The deeply forked tail is whitish, with grey outer webs.

Arctic terns are long-lived birds, with many reaching fifteen to thirty years of age. They eat mainly fish and small marine <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s. The species is abundant, with an estimated one million individuals. While the trend in the number of individuals in the species as a whole is not known, exploitation in the past has reduced this bird's numbers in the southern reaches of its range.

The Arctic tern was known as sea swallow describing their slender shape as they swoop over the water.

The genus name "Sterna" is derived from <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> "stearn", "tern". The specific "paradisaea" is from <a href="Late%20Latin">Late Latin</a> "paradisus", "paradise".
The <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> names "picktarnie", "tarrock" and their many variants are also believed to be <a href="Onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a>, derived from the distinctive call. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species, all the informal common names are shared with the <a href="common%20tern">common tern</a>.

The Arctic tern has a continuous worldwide circumpolar breeding distribution; there are no recognized <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>. It can be found in coastal regions in cooler temperate parts of <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> during the <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern</a> summer. During the <a href="southern%20hemisphere">southern</a> summer, it can be found at sea, reaching the northern edge of the Antarctic ice.

The Arctic tern is famous for its migration; it flies from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic and back again each year, the shortest distance between these areas being . The long journey ensures that this bird sees two summers per year and more daylight than any other creature on the planet. One example of this bird's remarkable long-distance flying abilities involves an Arctic tern <a href="bird%20ringing">ringed</a> as an unfledged chick on the <a href="Farne%20Islands">Farne Islands</a>, <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, UK, in the northern summer of 1982, which reached <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia in October 1982, just three months from fledging — a journey of over . Another example is that of a chick ringed in <a href="Labrador">Labrador</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, on 23 July 1928. It was found in South Africa four months later.

A 2010 study using tracking devices attached to the birds showed that the above examples are not unusual for the species. In fact, it turned out, previous research had seriously underestimated the annual distances travelled by the Arctic tern. Eleven birds that bred in Greenland or Iceland covered on average in a year, with a maximum of . The difference from previous estimates is due to the birds' taking meandering courses rather than following a straight route as was previously assumed. The birds follow a somewhat convoluted course in order to take advantage of prevailing winds. The average Arctic tern lives about thirty years, and will, based on the above research, travel some 2.4 million km (1.5 million mi) during its lifetime, the equivalent of a roundtrip from Earth to the Moon over 3 times.

A 2013 tracking study of half a dozen Arctic terns breeding in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> shows average annual migrations of c. . On their way south, these birds roughly followed the coastlines of <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. Having rounded the southern tip of <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, they then turned east, some flying approximately halfway to <a href="Australia">Australia</a> before again turning south to eventually reach <a href="Wilkes%20Land">Wilkes Land</a> in the north-eastern <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a>. One bird flew several hundred kilometres along the south coast of <a href="Australia">Australia</a> before turning south for the <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a>, while one flew along the entire south coast of <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, passing between <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. Having reached the <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> area, it turned south and flew in an arc to <a href="Wilkes%20Land">Wilkes Land</a> in the north-east <a href="Antarctic">Antarctic</a>, passing the south-western tip of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>'s <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a> en route. Once back in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, this bird had journeyed c. , the longest migration yet recorded for any animal.

Arctic terns usually migrate sufficiently far offshore that they are rarely seen from land outside the breeding season.

The Arctic tern is a medium-sized bird around from the tip of its beak to the tip of its tail. The wingspan is . The weight is . The <a href="beak">beak</a> is dark red, as are the short legs and webbed feet. Like most terns, the Arctic tern has <a href="bird%20flight">high aspect ratio wings</a> and a tail with a deep fork.

The adult <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is grey above, with a black nape and crown and white cheeks. The upperwings are pale grey, with the area near the wingtip being translucent. The tail is white, and the underparts pale grey. Both sexes are similar in appearance. The winter plumage is similar, but the crown is whiter and the bills are darker.

Juveniles differ from adults in their black bill and legs, "scaly" appearing wings, and mantle with dark feather tips, dark carpal wing bar, and short tail streamers. During their first summer, juveniles also have a whiter forecrown.

The species has a variety of <a href="bird%20call">calls</a>; the two most common being the "alarm call", made when possible predators (such as humans or other <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s) enter the colonies, and the "advertising call". The advertising call is social in nature, made when returning to the colony and during aggressive encounters between individuals. It is unique to each individual tern and as such it serves a similar role to the <a href="bird%20song">bird song</a> of <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, identifying individuals. Eight other calls have been described, from "begging calls" made by females during mating to "attack calls" made while swooping at intruders.

While the Arctic tern is similar to the <a href="common%20tern">common</a> and <a href="roseate%20tern">roseate tern</a>s, its colouring, profile, and call are slightly different. Compared to the common tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic tern's call is more nasal and rasping than that of the common, and is easily distinguishable from that of the roseate.

This bird's closest relatives are a group of South Polar species, the <a href="South%20American%20tern">South American</a> ("Sterna hirundinacea"), <a href="Kerguelen%20tern">Kerguelen</a> ("S. virgata"), and <a href="Antarctic%20tern">Antarctic</a> ("S. vittata") terns. On the wintering grounds, the Arctic tern can be distinguished from these relatives; the six-month difference in <a href="moult">moult</a> is the best clue here, with Arctic terns being in winter plumage during the southern summer. The southern species also do not show darker wingtips in flight.

The immature plumages of Arctic tern were originally described as separate species, "Sterna portlandica" and "Sterna pikei".

Breeding begins around the third or fourth year. Arctic terns mate for life and, in most cases, return to the same colony each year. <a href="Courtship%23Courtship%20in%20the%20animal%20kingdom">Courtship</a> is elaborate, especially in birds nesting for the first time. Courtship begins with a so-called "high flight", where a female will chase the male to a high altitude and then slowly descend. This display is followed by "fish flights", where the male will offer fish to the female. Courtship on the ground involves strutting with a raised tail and lowered wings. After this, both birds will usually fly and circle each other.
Both sexes agree on a site for a nest, and both will defend the site. During this time, the male continues to feed the female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in <a href="seabird%20colony">colonies</a> on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on <a href="tundra">tundra</a> near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the <a href="common%20tern">common tern</a>. It lays from one to three <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a> per clutch, most often two.
It is one of the most aggressive terns, fiercely defensive of its nest and young. It will attack humans and large predators, usually striking the top or back of the head. Although it is too small to cause serious injury to an animal of a human's size, it is still capable of drawing blood, and is capable of repelling many raptorial birds, polar bears and smaller mammalian predators such as foxes and cats. Other nesting birds, such as <a href="alcid">alcid</a>s, often incidentally benefit from the protection provided by nesting in an area defended by Arctic terns.
The nest is usually a depression in the ground, which may or may not be lined with bits of grass or similar materials. The eggs are mottled and camouflaged. Both sexes share incubation duties. The young hatch after 22–27 days and <a href="fledge">fledge</a> after 21–24 days. If the parents are disturbed and flush from the nest frequently the incubation period could be extended to as long as 34 days.

When hatched, the chicks are <a href="Down%20feather">downy</a>. Neither <a href="altricial">altricial</a> nor <a href="precocial">precocial</a>, the chicks begin to move around and explore their surroundings within one to three days after hatching. Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after hatching. Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter with the help of their parents.

Arctic terns are long-lived birds that spend considerable time raising only a few young, and are thus said to be <a href="R/K%20selection%20theory">K-selected</a>. The bird has life span that was thought be around 20 years, however <a href="National%20Geographic%20%28magazine%29">National Geographic</a>, <a href="The%20University%20of%20Alberta">The University of Alberta</a> & <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, concluded in 2010 that more than 50% of this species will live past their 30th birthday. A study in the Farne Islands estimated an annual survival rate of 82%.

The diet of the Arctic tern varies depending on location and time, but is usually <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a>. In most cases, it eats small <a href="fish">fish</a> or marine <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s. Fish species comprise the most important part of the diet, and account for more of the <a href="biomass">biomass</a> consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as <a href="herring">herring</a>, <a href="cod">cod</a>, <a href="sandlance">sandlance</a>s, and <a href="capelin">capelin</a>. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are <a href="amphipod">amphipod</a>s, <a href="crab">crab</a>s and <a href="krill">krill</a>. Sometimes, these birds also eat <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a>s, marine worms, or <a href="berry">berries</a>, and on their northern breeding grounds, <a href="insect">insect</a>s.

Arctic terns sometimes dip down to the surface of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, in spite of their small size, occasionally engage in <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitism</a> by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some <a href="auk">auk</a> and <a href="grebe">grebe</a> species.

While nesting, Arctic terns are vulnerable to predation by cats and other animals. Besides being a competitor for nesting sites, the larger <a href="American%20herring%20gull">herring gull</a> steals eggs and hatchlings. Camouflaged eggs help prevent this, as do isolated nesting sites. While feeding, <a href="skua">skua</a>s, gulls, and other tern species will often harass the birds and steal their food. They often form mixed colonies with other terns, such as <a href="common%20tern">common</a> and <a href="Sandwich%20tern">Sandwich tern</a>s.

Arctic terns are considered threatened or a species of concern in certain states. They are also among the species to which the "<a href="AEWA">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a>" applies. The species reduced population in <a href="New%20England">New England</a> in the late nineteenth-century because of hunting for the millinery trade. Exploitation continues in western <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, where the population of the species has been reduced greatly since 1950.

At the southern part of their range, the Arctic tern has been reducing in numbers. Much of this is due to lack of food. However, most of these birds' range is extremely remote, with no apparent trend in the species as a whole.

BirdLife International has considered the species to be at lower risk since 1988, believing that there are approximately one million individuals around the world.

The Arctic tern has appeared on the <a href="postage%20stamps">postage stamps</a> of several countries and dependent territories. The territories include the <a href="%C3%85land%20Islands">Åland Islands</a>, <a href="Alderney">Alderney</a>, and <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>. Countries include <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, and <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>.

Common tern

The common tern ("Sterna hirundo") is a <a href="seabird">seabird</a> in the family <a href="Laridae">Laridae</a>. This <a href="bird">bird</a> has a circumpolar distribution, its four <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> breeding in <a href="Temperateness">temperate</a> and <a href="subarctic">subarctic</a> regions of Europe, Asia and North America. It is strongly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering in coastal <a href="tropics">tropical</a> and <a href="subtropics">subtropical</a> regions. Breeding adults have light grey upperparts, white to very light grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill. Depending on the subspecies, the bill may be mostly red with a black tip or all black. There are a number of similar species, including the partly <a href="sympatry">sympatric</a> <a href="Arctic%20tern">Arctic tern</a>, which can be separated on <a href="plumage">plumage</a> details, leg and bill colour, or <a href="bird%20vocalization">vocalisations</a>.

Breeding in a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, the common tern nests on any flat, poorly vegetated surface close to water, including beaches and islands, and it readily adapts to artificial substrates such as floating rafts. The nest may be a bare <a href="Bird%20nest%23Scrape">scrape</a> in sand or gravel, but it is often lined or edged with whatever debris is available. Up to three eggs may be laid, their dull colours and blotchy patterns providing <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a> on the open beach. <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">Incubation</a> is by both sexes, and the eggs hatch in around 21–22 days, longer if the colony is disturbed by predators. The downy chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in 22–28 days. Like most terns, this species feeds by plunge-diving for fish, either in the sea or in freshwater, but <a href="mollusca">mollusc</a>s, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s and other <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> prey may form a significant part of the diet in some areas.

Eggs and young are vulnerable to predation by mammals such as <a href="rat">rat</a>s and <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a>, and large birds including <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="owl">owl</a>s and <a href="heron">heron</a>s. Common terns may be infected by <a href="louse">lice</a>, <a href="parasitic%20worm">parasitic worm</a>s, and <a href="mite">mite</a>s, although <a href="Haematozoa">blood parasites</a> appear to be rare. Its large population and huge breeding range mean that this species is classed as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>, although numbers in North America have declined sharply in recent decades. Despite international legislation protecting the common tern, in some areas populations are threatened by <a href="Habitat%20destruction">habitat loss</a>, pollution or the disturbance of <a href="Bird%20colony">breeding colonies</a>.

The terns are small to medium-sized seabirds closely related to the <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="skimmer">skimmer</a>s and <a href="skua">skua</a>s. They are gull-like in appearance, but typically have a lighter build, long pointed wings (which give them a fast, buoyant flight), a deeply forked tail, slender legs, and webbed feet. Most species are grey above and white below, and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the non-breeding season.

The common tern's closest relatives appear to be the <a href="Antarctic%20tern">Antarctic tern</a>, followed by the <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>n Arctic and <a href="roseate%20tern">roseate tern</a>s. <a href="Gene">Gene</a>tic evidence suggests that the common tern may have diverged from an ancestral stock earlier than its relatives. No <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s are known from North America, and those claimed in Europe are of uncertain age and species.

The common tern was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1758 under its current scientific name, "Sterna hirundo". The word "stearn" was used in <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> and a similar word was used by the <a href="Frisians">Frisians</a> for tern. "Stearn" appears in the poem "<a href="The%20Seafarer%20%28poem%29">The Seafarer</a>", written around 1000 AD. Linnaeus adopted this word for the genus name "Sterna". The Latin for <a href="swallow">swallow</a> is "hirundo" and refers here to the tern's superficial likeness to that unrelated bird, which has a similar light build and long forked tail. This resemblance also leads to the informal name "sea swallow", recorded from at least the seventeenth century. The <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> names "picktarnie", "tarrock" and their many variants are also believed to be <a href="Onomatopoeia">onomatopoeic</a>, derived from the distinctive call. Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species, all the informal common names are shared with the Arctic tern.

Four subspecies of the common tern are generally recognized, although "S. h. minussensis" is sometimes considered to be an <a href="intergradation">intergrade</a> between "S. h. hirundo" and "S. h. longipennis".

The nominate subspecies of the common tern is long, including a fork in the tail, with a wingspan. It weighs . Breeding adults have pale grey upperparts, very pale grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill that can be mostly red with a black tip, or all black, depending on the subspecies. The common tern's upperwings are pale grey, but as the summer wears on, the dark feather shafts of the outer <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s become exposed, and a grey wedge appears on the wings. The rump and tail are white, and on a standing bird the long tail extends no further than the folded wingtips, unlike the Arctic and roseate terns in which the tail protrudes beyond the wings. There are no significant differences between the sexes. In non-breeding adults the forehead and underparts become white, the bill is all black or black with a red base, and the legs are dark red or black. The upperwings have an obvious dark area at the front edge of the wing, the carpal bar. Terns that have not bred successfully may start <a href="moulting">moulting</a> into non-breeding adult plumage from June, but late July is more typical, with the moult suspended during migration. There is also some geographical variation, <a href="California">California</a>n birds often being in non-breeding plumage during migration.

Juvenile common terns have pale grey upperwings with a dark carpal bar. The crown and <a href="nape">nape</a> are brown, and the forehead is ginger, wearing to white by autumn. The upperparts are ginger with brown and white scaling, and the tail lacks the adult's long outer feathers. Birds in their first post-juvenile plumage, which normally remain in their wintering areas, resemble the non-breeding adult, but have a duskier crown, dark carpal bar, and often very worn plumage. By their second year, most young terns are either indistinguishable from adults, or show only minor differences such as a darker bill or white forehead.

The common tern is an agile flyer, capable of rapid turns and swoops, hovering, and vertical take-off. When commuting with fish, it flies close to the surface in a strong head wind, but above the water in a following wind. Unless migrating, normally it stays below , and averages in the absence of a tail wind. Its average flight speed during the <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a> migration flight is at a height of .

The juvenile starts moulting into adult plumage in its first October; the head, tail and body plumage is replaced first, mostly by February, then the wing feathers. The <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primaries</a> are replaced in stages; the innermost feathers moult first, then replacement is suspended during the southern winter (birds of this age staying in their wintering areas) and recommences in the autumn. In May to June of the second year a similar moult sequence starts, with a pause during primary moult for birds that return north, but not for those that stay in the winter quarters. A major moult to adult breeding plumage occurs in the next February to June, between 40–90% of feathers being replaced. Old primary feathers wear away to reveal the blackish barbs beneath. The moult pattern means that the oldest feathers are those nearest the middle of the wing, so as the northern summer progresses, a dark wedge appears on the wing due to this feather ageing process.

Terns are unusual in the frequency in which they moult their primaries, which are replaced at least twice, occasionally three times in a year. The visible difference in feather age is accentuated in the greater <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> reflectance of new primaries, and the freshness of the wing feathers is used by females in mate selection. Experienced females tend to accept mates which best show their <a href="Fitness%20%28biology%29">fitness</a> through the quality of their wing feathers. Rarely, a very early moult at the nesting colony may be linked to breeding failure, both the onset of moult and reproductive behaviour being linked to falling levels of the <a href="hormone">hormone</a> <a href="prolactin">prolactin</a>.

There are several terns of a similar size and general appearance to the common tern. A traditionally difficult species to separate is the Arctic tern, and until the key characteristics were clarified, distant or flying birds of the two species were often jointly recorded as "commic terns". Although similar in size, the two terns differ in structure and flight. The common tern has a larger head, thicker neck, longer legs, and more triangular and stiffer wings than its relative, and has a more powerful, direct flight. The Arctic tern has greyer underparts than the common, which make its white cheeks more obvious, whereas the rump of the common tern can be greyish in non-breeding plumage, compared to the white of its relative. The common tern develops a dark wedge on the wings as the breeding season progresses, but the wings of Arctic stay white throughout the northern summer. All the <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s of the Arctic tern are translucent against a bright sky, only the four innermost wing feathers of the common tern share this property. The trailing edge of the outer flight feathers is a thin black line in the Arctic tern, but thicker and less defined in the common. The bill of an adult common tern is orange-red with a black tip, except in black-billed "S. h. longipennis", and its legs are bright red, while both features are a darker red colour in the Arctic tern, which also lacks the black bill tip.

In the breeding areas, the roseate tern can be distinguished by its pale plumage, long, mainly black bill and very long tail feathers. The non-breeding plumage of roseate is pale above and white, sometimes pink-tinged, below. It retains the long tail streamers, and has a black bill. In flight, the roseate's heavier head and neck, long bill and faster, stiffer wingbeats are also characteristic. It feeds further out to sea than the common tern. In North America, the <a href="Forster%27s%20tern">Forster's tern</a> in breeding plumage is obviously larger than the common, with relatively short wings, a heavy head and thick bill, and long, strong legs; in all non-breeding plumages, its white head and dark eye patch make the American species unmistakable.

In the wintering regions, there are also confusion species, including the Antarctic tern of the southern oceans, the <a href="South%20American%20tern">South American tern</a>, the <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>n <a href="white-fronted%20tern">white-fronted tern</a> and the <a href="white-cheeked%20tern">white-cheeked tern</a> of the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. Identification may be aided by the plumage differences due to "opposite" breeding seasons. The Antarctic tern is more sturdy than the common, with a heavier bill. In breeding condition, its dusky underparts and full black cap outline a white cheek stripe. In non-breeding plumages, it lacks, or has only an indistinct, carpal bar, and young birds show dark bars on the <a href="Flight%20feather%23Tertials">tertials</a>, obvious on the closed wing and in flight. The South American tern is larger than the common, with a larger, more curved red bill, and has a smoother, more extensive black cap in non-breeding plumage. Like Antarctic, it lacks a strong carpal bar in non-breeding plumages, and it also shares the distinctive barring of the tertials in young birds. The white-fronted tern has a white forehead in breeding plumage, a heavier bill, and in non-breeding plumage is paler below than the common, with white underwings. The white-cheeked tern is smaller, has uniform grey upperparts, and in breeding pumage is darker above with whiter cheeks.

Juvenile common terns are easily separated from similar-aged birds of related species. They show extensive ginger colouration to the back, and have a pale base to the bill. Young Arctic terns have a grey back and black bill, and juvenile roseate terns have a distinctive scalloped "saddle". <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">Hybrids</a> between common and roseate terns have been recorded, particularly from the US, and the intermediate plumage and calls shown by these birds is a potential identification pitfall. Such birds may have more extensive black on the bill, but confirmation of mixed breeding may depend on the exact details of individual flight feathers.

The common tern has a wide repertoire of calls, which have a lower pitch than the equivalent calls of Arctic terns. The most distinctive sound is the <a href="alarm%20signal">alarm</a> "KEE-yah", stressed on the first syllable, in contrast to the second-syllable stress of the Arctic tern. The alarm call doubles up as a warning to intruders, although serious threats evoke a "kyar", given as a tern takes flight, and quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. A down-slurred "keeur" is given when an adult is approaching the nest while carrying a fish, and is possibly used for individual recognition (chicks emerge from hiding when they hear their parents giving this call). Another common call is a "kip" uttered during social contact. Other vocalizations include a "kakakakaka" when attacking intruders, and a staccato "kek-kek-kek" from fighting males.

Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and <a href="sibling">sibling</a>s also recognise each other's vocalisations from about the twelfth day from hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.

Most populations of the common tern are strongly migratory, wintering south of their temperate and subarctic Northern Hemisphere breeding ranges. First summer birds usually remain in their wintering quarters, although a few return to breeding colonies some time after the arrival of the adults. In North America, the common tern breeds along the Atlantic coast from <a href="Labrador">Labrador</a> to <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, and inland throughout much of Canada east of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. In the United States, some breeding populations can also be found in the states bordering the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>, and locally on the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf</a> coast. There are small, only partially migratory, colonies in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>; these are in The Bahamas and Cuba, and off Venezuela in the <a href="Los%20Roques%20archipelago">Los Roques</a> and <a href="Las%20Aves%20archipelago">Las Aves archipelago</a>s.

New World birds winter along both coasts of Central and South America, to Argentina on the east coast and to Northern Chile on the west coast. Records from South America and the Azores show that some birds may cross the Atlantic in both directions on their migration.

The common tern breeds across most of Europe, with the highest numbers in the north and east of the continent. There are small populations on the north African coast, and in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>, <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> and <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>. Most winter off western or southern Africa, birds from the south and west of Europe tending to stay north of the <a href="equator">equator</a> and other European birds moving further south. The breeding range continues across the temperate and <a href="taiga">taiga</a> zones of Asia, with scattered outposts on the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> and the coast of Iran. Small populations breed on islands off Sri Lanka, and in the <a href="Ladakh">Ladakh</a> region of the Tibetan plateau. Western Asian birds winter in the northern <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, and "S. h. tibetana" appears to be common off <a href="East%20Africa">East Africa</a> during the northern hemisphere winter. Birds from further north and east in Asia, such as "S. h. longipennis", move through Japan, Thailand and the western <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a> as far as southern Australia. There are small and erratic colonies in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, in Nigeria and Guinea-Bissau, unusual in that they are within what is mainly a wintering area. Only a few common terns have been recorded in New Zealand, and this species' status in <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a> is unclear. A bird <a href="bird%20ringing">ringed</a> at the nest in Sweden was found dead on <a href="Stewart%20Island">Stewart Island</a>, New Zealand, five months later, having flown an estimated 25,000 km (15,000 mi).

As long distance migrants, common terns sometimes occur well outside their normal range. Stray birds have been found inland in Africa (Zambia and Malawi), and on the Maldives and Comoros islands; the nominate subspecies has reached Australia, the Andes, and the interior of South America. Asian "S. h. longipennis" has recent records from western Europe.

The common tern breeds over a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, nesting from the <a href="taiga">taiga</a> of Asia to tropical shores, and at altitudes up to in Armenia, and in Asia. It avoids areas which are frequently exposed to excessive rain or wind, and also icy waters, so it does not breed as far north as the Arctic tern. The common tern breeds close to freshwater or the sea on almost any open flat habitat, including sand or <a href="shingle%20beach">shingle beach</a>es, firm dune areas, <a href="salt%20marsh">salt marsh</a>, or, most commonly, islands. Flat grassland or <a href="heath">heath</a>, or even large flat rocks may be suitable in an island environment. In mixed colonies, common terns will tolerate somewhat longer ground vegetation than Arctic terns, but avoid the even taller growth acceptable to roseate terns; the relevant factor here is the different leg lengths of the three species. Common terns adapt readily to artificial floating rafts, and may even nest on flat factory roofs. Unusual nest sites include hay bales, a stump above the water, and floating logs or vegetation. There is a record of a common tern taking over a <a href="spotted%20sandpiper">spotted sandpiper</a> nest and laying its eggs with those of the <a href="wader">wader</a>. Outside the breeding season, all that is needed in terms of habitat is access to fishing areas, and somewhere to land. In addition to natural beaches and rocks, boats, buoys and piers are often used both as perches and night-time roosts.

The common tern breeds in colonies which do not normally exceed 2,000 <a href="breeding%20pair">pairs</a>, but may occasionally number more than 20,000 pairs. Colonies inland tend to be smaller than on the coast. Common terns often nest alongside other coastal species, such as Arctic, roseate and <a href="Sandwich%20tern">Sandwich tern</a>s, <a href="black-headed%20gull">black-headed gull</a>s, and <a href="black%20skimmer">black skimmer</a>s. Especially in the early part of the breeding season, for no known reason, most or all of the terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea. This phenomenon is called a "dread".

On their return to the breeding sites, the terns may loiter for a few days before settling into a territory, and the actual start of nesting may be linked to a high availability of fish. Terns defend only a small area, with distances between nests sometimes being as little as , although is more typical. As with many birds, the same site is re-used year after year, with a record of one pair returning for 17 successive breeding seasons. Around 90% of experienced birds reuse their former territory, so young birds must nest on the periphery, find a bereaved mate, or move to another colony. A male selects a nesting territory a few days after his arrival in the spring, and is joined by his previous partner unless she is more than five days late, in which case the pair may separate.

The defence of the territory is mainly by the male, who repels intruders of either sex. He gives an alarm call, opens his wings, raises his tail and bows his head to show the black cap. If the intruder persists, the male stops calling and fights by bill grappling until the intruder submits by raising its head to expose the throat. Aerial trespassers are simply attacked, sometimes following a joint upward spiralling flight. Despite the aggression shown to adults, wandering chicks are usually tolerated, whereas in a gull colony they would be attacked and killed. The nest is defended until the chicks have fledged, and all the adults in the colony will collectively repel potential predators.

Pairs are established or confirmed through aerial <a href="courtship%20display">courtship display</a>s in which a male and a female fly in wide circles up to or more, calling all the while, before the two birds descend together in zigzag glides. If the male is carrying a fish, he may attract the attention of other males too. On the ground, the male courts the female by circling her with his tail and neck raised, head pointing down, and wings partially open. If she responds, they may both adopt a posture with the head pointed skywards. The male may tease a female with the fish, not parting with his offering until she has displayed to him sufficiently. Once courtship is complete, the male makes a shallow depression in the sand, and the female scratches in the same place. Several trials may take place until the pair settle on a site for the actual nest. The eggs may be laid on bare sand, gravel or soil, but a lining of debris or vegetation is often added if available, or the nest may be rimmed with seaweed, stones or shells. The saucer-shaped scrape is typically deep and across, but may extend to as much as wide including the surrounding decorative material. Breeding success in areas prone to flooding has been enhanced by the provision of artificial mats made from <a href="zostera">eelgrass</a>, which encourage the terns to nest in higher, less vulnerable areas, since many prefer the mats to bare sand. The common tern tends to use more nest material than roseate or Arctic terns, although roseate often nests in areas with more growing vegetation.

Terns are expert at locating their nests in a large colony. Studies show that terns can find and excavate their eggs when they are buried, even if the nest material is removed and the sand smoothed over. They will find a nest placed from its original site, or even further if it is moved in several stages. Eggs are accepted if reshaped with <a href="plasticine">plasticine</a> or coloured yellow (but not red or blue). This ability to locate the eggs is an adaptation to life in an unstable, wind-blown and tidal environment.

The peak time for egg production is early May, with some birds, particularly first-time breeders, laying later in the month or in June. The <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> size is normally three eggs; larger clutches probably result from two females laying in the same nest. Egg size averages , although each successive egg in a clutch is slightly smaller than the first laid. The average egg weight is , of which 5% is shell. The egg weight depends on how well-fed the female is, as well as on its position in the clutch. The eggs are cream, <a href="Buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a>, or pale brown, marked with streaks, spots or blotches of black, brown or grey which help to camouflage them. Incubation is by both sexes, although more often by the female, and lasts 21–22 days, extending to 25 days if there are frequent disturbances at the colony which cause the adults to leave the eggs unattended; nocturnal predation may lead to incubation taking up to 34 days. On hot days the incubating parent may fly to water to wet its belly feathers before returning to the eggs, thus affording the eggs some cooling. Except when the colony suffers disaster, 90% of the eggs hatch. The <a href="precocial">precocial</a> <a href="down%20feather">downy</a> chick is yellowish with black or brown markings, and like the eggs, is similar to the equivalent stage of the Arctic tern. The chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in 22–28 days, usually 25–26. Fledged juveniles are fed at the nest for about five days, and then accompany the adults on fishing expeditions. The young birds may receive supplementary feeds from the parents until the end of the breeding season, and beyond. Common terns have been recorded feeding their offspring on migration and in the wintering grounds, at least until the adults move further south in about December.

Like many terns, this species is very defensive of its nest and young, and will harass humans, dogs, <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>s and most <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> birds, but unlike the more aggressive Arctic tern, it rarely hits the intruder, usually swerving off at the last moment. Adults can discriminate between individual humans, attacking familiar people more intensely than strangers. Nocturnal predators do not elicit similar attacks; colonies can be wiped out by rats, and adults desert the colony for up to eight hours when <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a>s are present.

Common terns usually breed once a year. Second clutches are possible if the first is lost. Rarely, a second clutch may be laid and incubated while some chicks from the first clutch are still being fed. The first breeding attempt is usually at four years of age, sometimes at three years. The average number of young per pair surviving to fledging can vary from zero in the event of the colony being flooded to over 2.5 in a good year. In North America, productivity was between 1.0 and 2.0 on islands, but less than 1.0 at coastal and inland sites. Birds become more successful at raising chicks with age. This continues throughout their breeding lives, but the biggest increase is in the first five years. The maximum documented lifespan in the wild is 23 years in North America and 33 years in Europe, but 12 years is a more typical lifespan.

Like all "Sterna" terns, the common tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, from a height of , either in the sea or in freshwater lakes and large rivers. The bird may submerge for a second or so, but to no more than below the surface. When seeking fish, this tern flies head-down and with its bill held vertically. It may circle or hover before diving, and then plunges directly into the water, whereas the Arctic tern favours a "stepped-hover" technique, and the roseate tern dives at speed from a greater height, and submerges for longer. The common tern typically forages up to away from the breeding colony, sometimes as far as . It will follow schools of fish, and its west African migration route is affected by the location of huge shoals of <a href="sardine">sardine</a>s off the coast of Ghana; it will also track groups of <a href="predatory%20fish">predatory fish</a> or <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s, waiting for their prey to be driven to the sea's surface. Terns often feed in flocks, especially if food is plentiful, and the fishing success rate in a flock is typically about one-third higher than for individuals.

Terns have red oil droplets in the <a href="cone%20cell">cone cell</a>s of the <a href="retina">retina</a>s of their eyes. This improves contrast and sharpens distance <a href="bird%20vision">vision</a>, especially in hazy conditions. Birds that have to see through an air/water interface, such as terns and gulls, have more strongly coloured <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a> <a href="pigment">pigment</a>s in the cone oil drops than other avian species. The improved eyesight helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> on which the fish feed, or observing other terns diving for food. Tern's eyes are not particularly <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> sensitive, an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls.

The common tern preferentially hunts fish long. The species caught depend on what is available, but if there is a choice, terns feeding several chicks will take larger prey than those with smaller broods. The proportion of fish fed to chicks may be as high as 95% in some areas, but <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> prey may form a significant part of the diet elsewhere. This may include <a href="annelid">worms</a>, <a href="leech">leech</a>es, <a href="mollusca">mollusc</a>s such as small <a href="squid">squid</a>, and <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s (<a href="prawn">prawn</a>s, <a href="shrimp">shrimp</a> and <a href="Hippoidea">mole crabs</a>). In freshwater areas, large <a href="insect">insect</a>s may be caught, such as <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, <a href="cockchafer">cockchafer</a>s and <a href="moth">moth</a>s. Adult insects may be caught in the air, and <a href="larva">larva</a>e picked from the ground or from the water surface. Prey is caught in the bill and either swallowed head-first, or carried back to the chicks. Occasionally, two or more small fish may be carried simultaneously. When adults take food back to the nest, they recognise their young by call, rather than visual identification.

The common tern may attempt to steal fish from Arctic terns, but might itself be harassed by <a href="kleptoparasitism">kleptoparasitic</a> skuas, <a href="laughing%20gull">laughing gull</a>s, roseate terns, or by other common terns while bringing fish back to its nest. In one study, two males whose mates had died spent much time stealing food from neighbouring broods.

Terns normally drink in flight, usually taking seawater in preference to freshwater, if both are available. Chicks do not drink before fledging, reabsorbing water, and, like adults, excreting excess salt in a concentrated solution from a specialised nasal gland. Fish bones and the hard <a href="exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a>s of crustaceans or insects are regurgitated as <a href="pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellets</a>. Adults fly off the nest to <a href="defecation">defecate</a>, and even small chicks walk a short distance from the scrape to deposit their <a href="feces">faeces</a>. Adults attacking animals or humans will often defecate as they dive, often successfully fouling the intruder.

Rats will take tern eggs, and may even store large numbers in <a href="Hoarding%20%28animal%20behavior%29">caches</a>, and the <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a> is an important predator of hatched chicks, both in North America, and in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> where it has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a>. The <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a> can also be a local problem. Because common terns nest on islands, the most common predators are normally other birds rather than mammals. The <a href="ruddy%20turnstone">ruddy turnstone</a> will take eggs from unattended nests, and gulls may take chicks. Great horned owls and <a href="short-eared%20owl">short-eared owl</a>s will kill both adults and chicks, and <a href="black-crowned%20night%20heron">black-crowned night heron</a>s will also eat small chicks. <a href="Merlin%20%28bird%29">Merlins</a> and <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s may attack flying terns; as with other birds, it seems likely that one advantage of flocking behaviour is to confuse fast-flying predators.

The common tern hosts <a href="bird%20louse">feather lice</a>, which are quite different from those found in Arctic terns, despite the close relationship of the two birds. It may also be infected by parasitic worms, such as the widespread "<a href="Diphyllobothrium">Diphyllobothrium</a>" species, the duck parasite "<a href="Ligula%20intestinalis">Ligula intestinalis</a>", and "<a href="Schistocephalus">Schistocephalus</a>" species carried initially by fish. <a href="cestoda">Tapeworms</a> of the family <a href="Cyclophyllidea">Cyclophyllidea</a> may also infect this species. The <a href="mite">mite</a> "<a href="Reighardia%20sternae">Reighardia sternae</a>" has been found in common terns from Italy, North America and China. A study of 75 breeding common terns found that none carried blood parasites. Colonies have been affected by <a href="fowl%20cholera">avian cholera</a> and <a href="psittacosis">ornithosis</a>, and it is possible that the common tern may be threatened in the future by outbreaks of <a href="avian%20influenza">avian influenza</a> to which it is susceptible. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as infected with avian influenza, the <a href="Influenza%20A%20virus%20subtype%20H5N3">H5N3</a> variant being found in an outbreak of South African birds.

The common tern is classed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. It has a large population of 1,600,000–4,600,000 mature individuals and a huge breeding range estimated at . Breeding numbers have been estimated at 250,000–500,000 pairs, the majority breeding in Asia. Up to 140,000 pairs breed in Europe. Fewer than 80,000 pairs breed in North America, with most breeding on the northeast Atlantic coast and a declining population of less than 10,000 pairs breeding in the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region">Great Lakes region</a>.

In the nineteenth century, the use of tern feathers and wings in the <a href="Hatmaking">millinery</a> trade was the main cause of large reductions in common tern populations in both Europe and North America, especially on the Atlantic coasts and inland. Sometimes entire stuffed birds were used to make hats. Numbers largely recovered early in the twentieth century mainly due to legislation and the work of <a href="Conservation%20movement">conservation</a> organizations. Although some Eurasian populations are stable, numbers in North America have fallen by more than 70% in the last 40 years, and there is an overall negative trend in the global estimates for this species.

Threats come from habitat loss through building, pollution or vegetation growth, or disturbance of breeding birds by humans, vehicles, boats or dogs. Local natural flooding may lead to nest losses, and some colonies are vulnerable to predation by rats and large gulls. Gulls also compete with terns for nest sites. Some birds are hunted in the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> for commercial sale as food. Breeding success may be enhanced by the use of floating nest rafts, man-made islands or other artificial nest sites, and by preventing human disturbance. Overgrown vegetation may be burned to clear the ground, and gulls can be killed or discouraged by deliberate disturbance. Contamination with <a href="polychlorinated%20biphenyl">polychlorinated biphenyl</a>s (PCBs) resulted in enhanced levels of <a href="Feminization%20%28biology%29">feminisation</a> in male embryos, which seemed to disappear prior to fledging, with no effect on colony productivity, but <a href="dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene">dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene</a> (DDE), which results from the breakdown of <a href="DDT">DDT</a>, led to very low levels of successful breeding in some US locations.

The common tern is one of the species to which the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20African-Eurasian%20Migratory%20Waterbirds">Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</a> (AEWA) and the US-Canada <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a> apply. Parties to the AWEA agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, although there is a greater emphasis on protection.

Sieges of Taunton

The sieges of Taunton were a series of three <a href="blockade">blockade</a>s during the <a href="First%20English%20Civil%20War">First English Civil War</a>. The town of <a href="Taunton">Taunton</a>, in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, was considered to be of strategic importance because it controlled the main road from <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> to <a href="Devon">Devon</a> and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. <a href="Robert%20Blake%20%28admiral%29">Robert Blake</a> commanded the town's <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarian</a> defences during all three sieges, from September 1644 to July 1645.

The first siege was laid by <a href="Edmund%20Wyndham">Edmund Wyndham</a> on 23 September, and was primarily composed of <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> troops from local Somerset garrisons. After initial assaults drove Blake and his troops back into <a href="Taunton%20Castle">Taunton Castle</a>, the blockade was conducted from away, and concentrated more on starving the garrison than continued attacks. The town was relieved by a force under <a href="James%20Holborne%20of%20Menstrie">James Holborne</a> on 14 December.

Over the next three months, Blake was able to establish a network of earthen defences in Taunton, including a basic perimeter and several forts. The Royalists began the second, and bloodiest, siege in late March 1645, initially under Sir <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Grenville%2C%201st%20Baronet">Richard Grenville</a>. A series of disputes between the Royalist commanders allowed Taunton some respite at the start of the siege, but in May the attacks were fierce under the command of Sir <a href="Ralph%20Hopton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hopton">Ralph Hopton</a>. After five days of intense fighting, which had once again driven the defending army back to a small central perimeter including the castle, the Royalists retreated in the face of a Parliamentarian relief army commanded by <a href="Ralph%20Weldon">Ralph Weldon</a>.

<a href="George%20Goring%2C%20Lord%20Goring">Lord Goring</a>, who had proposed the second siege, renewed the blockade for a third time in mid-May, after engaging Weldon's departing army and forcing it back into Taunton. Goring's siege was lax and allowed provisions into the town, diminishing its effectiveness. The Parliamentarian defence tied up Goring and his 10–15,000 troops, who would have otherwise been available to fight for <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Naseby">Naseby</a>, where historians believe they could have tipped the battle in favour of the Royalists. Instead, after securing a Parliamentarian victory at Naseby, <a href="Thomas%20Fairfax">Thomas Fairfax</a> marched his army to relieve Taunton on 9 July 1645.

Loyalties in Somerset were divided at the start of the <a href="First%20English%20Civil%20War">First English Civil War</a>; many of the prominent landowners and those living in the countryside favoured <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles I</a>, but most of the towns, including Taunton, were Parliamentarian, predominantly due to their <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> beliefs. By August 1642, the town was held by a small Parliamentarian force. In June the following year, Sir <a href="Ralph%20Hopton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Hopton">Ralph Hopton</a> led his Royalist army, consisting of eighteen regiments equally split between foot and cavalry, out of Cornwall and into Somerset. He forced the surrender of Taunton to the King without engaging in battle, and established a garrison in <a href="Taunton%20Castle">Taunton Castle</a>.

In mid-1644, <a href="Robert%20Devereux%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex</a>, the Chief Commander of the Parliamentary army, decided to reclaim the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a>. He moved through Dorset, retaking <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a> and <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a>, and then left the coast and headed towards <a href="Chard%2C%20Somerset">Chard</a>. At the time, Taunton was held by a garrison of 800 men commanded by Colonel <a href="John%20Stawell">John Stawell</a>, but the proximity of the Earl of Essex's army led the town to be abandoned, leaving only 80 men to defend the castle. The historian Robert Morris, in "The Sieges of Taunton 1644–1645", suggests that Stawell and his men retreated to Bridgwater, but in "<a href="The%20History%20of%20the%20Rebellion">The History of the Rebellion</a>", the 17th-century historian <a href="Edward%20Hyde%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Clarendon">Edward Hyde</a> claims that the troops were requisitioned by <a href="Maurice%20of%20the%20Palatinate">Prince Maurice</a> during his retreat from <a href="Lyme%20Regis">Lyme Regis</a> to <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>.

On 8 July 1644, the Earl of Essex sent a Parliamentarian force, led by Colonel Sir <a href="Robert%20Pye%20%28Roundhead%29">Robert Pye</a> with Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Robert%20Blake%20%28admiral%29">Robert Blake</a> as his second in command, to reclaim Taunton. They took the town without a fight, and surrounded the castle. The Royalist forces under Major William Reeve that were garrisoned at Taunton Castle surrendered and retreated to <a href="Bridgwater">Bridgwater</a>. Pye left Taunton shortly after the capture, leaving Blake to hold the town. Blake had an army of about 1,000 men, and was charged with trying to blockade the roads to support the Earl of Essex's campaign in Devon and Cornwall.

The Earl of Essex's campaign failed, suffering a total defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lostwithiel">Battle of Lostwithiel</a> in early September 1644. His remaining forces retreated back to Dorset, leaving only Plymouth, Lyme Regis and Taunton under Parliamentarian control in the South West. Blake was aware of the vulnerability of Taunton, which, unlike many towns and cities of the time, did not have any <a href="Defensive%20wall">town walls</a>. On the eastern side of the town, which was the most vulnerable, he dug trenches outside the Eastern gate and erected a barricade across the street within it. At least three earthen forts were also built in that end of town. King Charles I held council in Chard, and shortly after ordered a Royalist force numbering 3,000 troops to set up the first siege of Taunton. Initially, Sir Francis Dodington was going to command the attack, but the only available men were those in Bridgwater under the command of Colonel <a href="Edmund%20Wyndham">Edmund Wyndham</a>.

The siege began on 23 September 1644. Wyndham was assisted in the attack by his brother, <a href="Sir%20Francis%20Wyndham%2C%201st%20Baronet">Francis Wyndham</a>, who brought his garrison from <a href="Dunster%20Castle">Dunster Castle</a>, and <a href="Edward%20Rodney">Edward Rodney</a>, who commanded an infantry regiment. The Royalist forces initially set themselves up around the town, where they were able to use their artillery to bombard the castle from the west and the town from the east. In his record of the siege, Morris claims that the besieging forces were unable to establish a presence in the town, and set up a wide perimeter roughly away. However, almost all other sources agree that after initial skirmishes, the Royalists broke through the eastern defences and forced Blake's troops back into the castle itself.

During the siege, Edmund Wyndham and Blake exchanged letters; Wyndham initially wrote to explain that he felt the siege was a gentle method of attack, rather than using "fire and sword". He offered generous terms for surrender, and signed the letter "Your well-wishing Neighbour and Country-man"; the pair had served as <a href="Member%20of%20parliament">members of parliament</a> together for Bridgwater in 1640. Blake was unmoved, and wrote back to unequivocally reject the offer. Blake sent skirmishing parties out against the attackers with some success, though food and ammunition began to run out for the defending troops. To further this, Wyndham heavily rationed the town's population to prevent them smuggling food to the garrison. A petition to Parliament for help was answered when Sir <a href="William%20Waller">William Waller</a>, who commanded the Parliamentarian army in Wiltshire, sent a force of 3,000 men under the command of his deputy, Major General <a href="James%20Holborne%20of%20Menstrie">James Holborne</a>, in support of the town.

Wyndham had initially planned to attack Holborne's forces at Chard, but instead retreated back to his garrison at Bridgwater on 14 December. He recorded that during his retreat, "the enemy sallied upon me but they were so hungry that they could not follow me." The day after the arrival of Holborne, a supply caravan containing food, 2,000 muskets and 40 barrels of gunpowder restocked the town. Fearing further Royalist assaults, Holborne provided 1,000 of his own men as reinforcements for the town's defence.

In early 1645, Blake sent raiding parties out from Taunton that, according to Hyde, controlled a large area and disrupted activities throughout Somerset. Around that time, <a href="George%20Goring%2C%20Lord%20Goring">Lord Goring</a>, the lieutenant-general of the south-eastern counties in the Royalist army, requested troops from the King so that he could mount a "large-scale southeastern campaign". His request was rejected, and he was despatched to the South West instead. He duly changed his focus, electing to target first Weymouth, and then Taunton, both Parliamentarian strongholds in the area. He took Weymouth, but was unable to hold it in the face of Parliamentarian reinforcements. In a letter he received from the King shortly after that loss, he was ordered to gather the Royalist forces of the area together in order to "[clear] those parts of the rebels' forces."
The King sent orders for Sir <a href="Sir%20Richard%20Grenville%2C%201st%20Baronet">Richard Grenville</a> and <a href="John%20Berkeley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Berkeley%20of%20Stratton">John Berkeley</a> to support Goring in the attack on Taunton. Goring arrived outside Taunton on 11 March, and a sizeable part of Berkeley's garrison from Exeter arrived soon after. Grenville did not leave his siege of Plymouth and, coupled with the threat from a Parliamentarian force formed by Waller and <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> combining their armies in Hampshire, the attack on Taunton was postponed. After further urging from the King and the Prince of Wales, Grenville did eventually travel up towards Taunton and was ordered to follow Goring to support the King in the north, as Grenville's force of 3,000 men was considered too small to assault Taunton. He refused, claiming that "he had promised the commissioners of Devon and Cornwall, that he would not advance beyond Taunton", while also boasting that he could claim the town in ten days. He was delegated command of the siege, and arrived outside Taunton on 2 April. Only a day after his arrival, Grenville was injured while attacking Wellington House, and as the wound was serious, he was carried to Exeter.

The blockade set by Grenville was initially some distance from the town, and did not prevent Blake from sending and receiving messages. The besieging army was reinforced soon after with Goring's infantry and artillery units, and so, with a large force, the attackers closed in on the town, establishing entrenchments within musket-shot of Taunton's defences. Command of the siege passed to Berkeley, though Grenville's troops often failed to follow the new commander's orders, and some of them deserted. Despite Grenville's retirement from the battle due to injury, he and Berkeley clashed; Grenville complained to the Prince of Wales that Berkeley was conducting the siege badly, while Berkeley claimed that Grenville had given his men orders to desert. These disagreements led Hopton, by now the commander of the Royalist forces in the West Country, to be given command of the siege.

As the siege continued, supplies once again began to run out for the defending army, and Parliament identified the relief of Taunton as being a priority. On 28 April, they ordered <a href="Thomas%20Fairfax">Thomas Fairfax</a>, the Commander in Chief of the recently established <a href="New%20Model%20Army">New Model Army</a>, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before he could reach London, but Prince Rupert convinced them instead to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel <a href="Ralph%20Weldon">Ralph Weldon</a>, while Fairfax led the rest north.

Aware that the Parliamentarians under Fairfax were on their way, Hopton increased the attacks on the town on 6 May. Further attacks the following day focused on the east side of the town, first bombarding it with cannon shot, and then storming the earthen <a href="redoubt">redoubt</a> that Blake had established. After some early success in which they captured one of the earthen forts, the attackers were forced back by a combination of musket shot, stones and boiling water. The next day, after yet more attacks made little impact, Hopton staged a battle on the south side of the town between two parties of his own army in an attempt to make Blake believe the Parliamentarian army had arrived. Hopton hoped that Blake would send out some of his own men to support the relieving force, but the feint failed. That evening, at around 7 pm, the Royalist force, which consisted of around 4,200 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, launched an all-out assault against the town. In heavy fighting, the attackers captured two of the earthen forts on the eastern side of town, and broke through the defences. Once inside Blake's outer perimeter, the besieging army discovered that there were Parliamentarian musketeers within every house, which prevented them advancing any further, though they did set fire to buildings, hoping to force the defenders to retreat. The tactic failed when the wind blew the flames back towards the Royalists, halting their attack.

The attack was renewed around 11 am on 9 May, and over the next seven hours, Hopton's army advanced slowly through the town. His forces pushed the Parliamentarian troops back one building at a time, until they were left with only a small area of land in the middle of the town. Within the perimeter was the castle, an entrenchment in the market square, <a href="St%20Mary%20Magdalene%2C%20Taunton">St Mary Magdalene Church</a> and an earthen defence known as "Maiden's fort". By this time, a combination of artillery and arson attacks had set most of the east side of town on fire. An attempt by three people—two men and a woman—to set fires inside the remaining defences was quashed, and the culprits <a href="Lynching">lynched</a>.

Further assaults were made on 10 May, along with a demand for Blake and his men to surrender, to which Blake responded that he "had four pairs of boots left and would eat three of them before he yielded." Weldon's relieving force had met with small parties of the Royalist army around <a href="Chard%2C%20Somerset">Chard</a> and <a href="Pitminster">Pitminster</a>, and they sent an advance party ahead of them, which reached <a href="Orchard%20Portman">Orchard Portman</a>, roughly south of Taunton, on 10 May. Fearing that they were facing the entirety of Fairfax's army, Hopton ordered his forces to abandon their attacks and retreat to Bridgwater. As they left, they felled trees across roads to slow the Parliamentarian advance. Weldon's army arrived in Taunton on 11 May, relieving and restocking the town. Accounts of Taunton's losses vary between 50 and 200 killed, with 200 or more casualties on top of that, while two thirds of the houses in the town had been razed. Having relieved Taunton, Weldon and his army left the following day and marched eastwards.

Over the course of the siege, Lord Goring had been with the King in Oxford, and on 10 May he returned to Bristol with a royal warrant pronouncing him the Commander of the Royalist Army in the West Country, replacing Hopton. Goring began his operations by harrying Weldon's army, and forcing them to retreat back to Taunton. Goring, commanding about 10,000 men, established a third siege of the town in under a year. He ignored orders from the King for him to support the Royalist efforts in <a href="the%20Midlands">the Midlands</a>, claiming that "Taunton would be taken in a few days." Despite his promises, he soon discovered that his army was too small to enact a rapid takeover of the town, and he established a loose blockade. Hyde, who is frequently scathing of Goring in his description of the Civil War, recalls that "Goring was so far from making any advance upon Taunton, that he grew much more negligent in it than he had been; suffered provisions, in great quantities, to be carried into the town." As well as being lax in his siege, Goring was often drunk and—reminiscent of the earlier siege—was deserted by many of his troops.

The regional commander of the Parliamentarian forces, Colonel <a href="Edward%20Massey">Edward Massey</a>, was ordered to relieve Taunton in June, but he could only raise 3,000 men; far less than was needed to dispel Goring's army. The New Model Army, with Fairfax at their head, were busy in the Midlands defeating the bulk of the Royalist army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Naseby">Battle of Naseby</a>, described by modern sources as "the decisive clash of the English Civil War". Goring had been ordered by the King to abandon his siege and join the Royalist forces at Naseby, and it has been suggested by modern historians that with his forces, and his leadership, the Royalists might have won the battle. Immediately after securing that victory, Fairfax led his army down towards Taunton once again. Aware of the approaching army, Lord Goring mounted a final assault on the town, hoping to catch Blake unaware by sending his cavalry towards the town on 9 July. The attack was neutralised by a section of Fairfax's army in <a href="Ilminster">Ilminster</a>, and Goring withdrew from Taunton to meet Fairfax at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Langport">Battle of Langport</a>, relieving the third and final siege of Taunton during the English Civil War.

In his history of Taunton, H. J. Wickenden suggests that over half of the town was burned or destroyed during the three sieges, while <a href="Diane%20Purkiss">Diane Purkiss</a> claims that it was as high as two thirds of the town. Several compensation payouts were made to the town and some of its residents, funded by fines against those who had fought for the Royalists, such as Sir <a href="Sir%20William%20Portman%2C%205th%20Baronet">William Portman</a>, who had been the Member of Parliament for Taunton at the outbreak of the war and was fined £7,000. Although the Parliamentarians destroyed many of the castles that had featured in the Civil War, Taunton Castle was considered a Parliamentarian stronghold, and remained intact. In 1647, only two years after the end of the sieges, the castle was sold as part of the estate of Taunton Manor. In 1660, shortly after taking the throne, <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> stripped Taunton of its town charter for its part in the Civil War, and had the castle's outer walls removed.

After commanding the defence of Taunton, Blake was ordered to capture Dunster Castle, which he achieved after a nine-month siege. After the war, he was honoured by Parliament for his efforts and rewarded with £500, while a further £2,000 was split amongst his men. He took no side during the <a href="Second%20English%20Civil%20War">Second Civil War</a> and, three years later, under the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth of England</a>, he became a <a href="general%20at%20sea">general at sea</a>, as one of the three commissioners of the navy, and spent the rest of his life as a naval commander, for which he remains best known.

Terry-Thomas

Terry-Thomas (born Thomas Terry Hoar-Stevens; 14 July 19118 January 1990) was an English comedian and <a href="character%20actor">character actor</a> who became known to a worldwide audience through his films during the 1950s and 1960s. He often portrayed disreputable members of the <a href="Social%20structure%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Upper%20class">upper classes</a>, especially <a href="wikt%3Acad">cads</a>, <a href="toff">toff</a>s and <a href="wikt%3Abounder">bounders</a>, using his distinctive voice; his costume and props tended to include a monocle, waistcoat and cigarette holder. His striking dress sense was set off by a <a href="Diastema%20%28dentistry%29">gap</a> between his two upper front teeth.

Born in London, Terry-Thomas made his film debut, uncredited, in "<a href="The%20Private%20Life%20of%20Henry%20VIII">The Private Life of Henry VIII</a>" (1933). He spent several years appearing in smaller roles, before wartime service with <a href="Entertainments%20National%20Service%20Association">Entertainments National Service Association</a> (ENSA) and <a href="Stars%20in%20Battledress">Stars in Battledress</a>. The experience helped sharpen his cabaret and revue act, increased his public profile and proved instrumental in the development of his successful comic stage routine. Upon his <a href="demobilisation">demobilisation</a>, he starred in "Piccadilly Hayride" on the London stage and was the star of the first comedy series on British television, "<a href="How%20Do%20You%20View%3F">How Do You View?</a>" (1949). He appeared on various <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a> shows, and made a successful transition into British films. His most creative period was the 1950s when he appeared in "<a href="Private%27s%20Progress">Private's Progress</a>" (1956), "<a href="The%20Green%20Man%20%28film%29">The Green Man</a>" (1956), "<a href="Blue%20Murder%20at%20St%20Trinian%27s">Blue Murder at St Trinian's</a>" (1957), "<a href="I%27m%20All%20Right%20Jack">I'm All Right Jack</a>" (1959) and "<a href="Carlton-Browne%20of%20the%20F.O.">Carlton-Browne of the F.O.</a>" (1959).

From the early 1960s Terry-Thomas began appearing in American films, coarsening his already unsubtle screen character in films such as "<a href="Bachelor%20Flat">Bachelor Flat</a>", "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Mad%2C%20Mad%2C%20Mad%2C%20Mad%20World">It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</a>" and "<a href="How%20to%20Murder%20Your%20Wife">How to Murder Your Wife</a>". From the mid-1960s he frequently starred in European films, in roles such as Sir Reginald in the successful French film "<a href="La%20Grande%20Vadrouille">La Grande Vadrouille</a>". In 1971 Terry-Thomas was diagnosed with <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, which slowly brought his career to a conclusion: his last film role was in 1980. He spent much of his fortune on medical treatment and, shortly before his death, was living in poverty, existing on charity from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. A charity gala was held in his honour, which raised sufficient funds for him to live his remaining time in a nursing home.

Terry-Thomas was born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens at 53 Lichfield Grove, <a href="Finchley">Finchley</a>, <a href="North%20London">North London</a>. He was the fourth of five children born to Ernest Frederick Stevens, managing director of a butcher's business at <a href="Smithfield%20Market">Smithfield Market</a> and part-time amateur actor, and his wife Ellen Elizabeth Stevens (née Hoar). As a child, Terry-Thomas was often referred to as Tom, the diminutive used by his family. He led a generally happy childhood, but believed that his parents secretly desired a daughter in his place. By the time he reached adolescence, his parents' marriage had failed and both became alcoholics. In an attempt to bring them together, Terry-Thomas often entertained them by performing impromptu slapstick routines, reciting jokes and singing and dancing around the family home. The performances seldom worked, and his father became increasingly removed from his family.

In 1921, Terry-Thomas began to nurture his distinctive, well-spoken voice, reasoning that "using good speech automatically suggested that you were well-educated and made people look up to you". He used the speech of the actor <a href="Owen%20Nares">Owen Nares</a> as a basis for his own delivery. Terry-Thomas became fascinated by the stage, and regularly attended the <a href="Golders%20Green%20Hippodrome">Golders Green Hippodrome</a> to see the latest shows. It was there that he developed an interest in fashion, and adopted the debonair dress-sense of his hero <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks">Douglas Fairbanks</a>. Terry-Thomas attended Fernbank School in Hendon Lane, Finchley, which was a welcome escape from the stresses of his parents' break-up. When he was 13, he transferred to <a href="Ardingly%20College">Ardingly College</a>, a public school in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>. He excelled in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and geography, and briefly took up drama. The latter subject later led to his expulsion from the school, after his frequent and inappropriate use of <a href="Ad%20libitum">ad lib</a> during lessons. He also took up a position in the school jazz band, first playing the <a href="ukulele">ukulele</a> and then percussion and additionally he often performed comedy dancing routines to the band's music.
Terry-Thomas enjoyed his time at Ardingly, and relished his association with <a href="upper%20middle%20class">upper middle class</a> school friends. His academic abilities were modest, and he only came to the notice of staff through his frequent tomfoolery. Although he initially felt intimidated by his school surroundings, his confidence grew as he put on "a bold, undiluted and sustained show of "<a href="chutzpah">chutzpah</a>"", according to his biographer, Graham McCann. On his return home to Finchley to start a break in 1927, his more mature manner impressed the family's housekeeper Kate Dixon, who seduced the young student at the family home. He stayed at Ardingly for one more term and returned home to London, but made no plans to further his education or start long-term work. Instead, he accepted a temporary position at Smithfield Market, where he earned 15 <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shillings</a> a week as a junior transport clerk for the Union Cold Storage Company.

By his own admission, he never stopped "farting around" and often kept his colleagues entertained with impersonations of the <a href="The%20Hunchback%20of%20Notre-Dame">Hunchback of Notre-Dame</a> and <a href="Erich%20von%20Stroheim">Erich von Stroheim</a>. He also invented various characters, including Colonel Featherstonehaugh-Bumleigh and Cora Chessington-Crabbe, and frequently recited comic stories involving them to his colleagues. His characterisations soon came to the notice of the company's management who prompted him to enrol in the company's amateur drama club. He made his début with the drama company in the role of Lord Trench in "<a href="The%20Dover%20Road%20%28play%29">The Dover Road</a>" which was staged at the <a href="Fortune%20Theatre">Fortune Theatre</a>, London. The production was popular with audiences, and he subsequently became a regular performer in many amateur productions.

Terry-Thomas made his professional stage début on 11 April 1930 at a social evening organised by the Union of Electric Railwayman's Dining Club in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>. He was billed as Thos Stevens, but only appeared as a minor turn. His performance brought <a href="heckle">heckle</a>s from the drunken audience, but earned him a commission of 30 shillings. After this, he played a few minor roles in <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> productions by the Edgware Operatic Society at the <a href="Scala%20Theatre">Scala Theatre</a>. In 1933, he left Smithfield Market to work briefly with a friend at an electrical shop before he became travelling salesman of electrical equipment. He enjoyed the job and relished being able to dress up in elaborate clothing in order to make his pitch. In his spare time, he began playing the ukulele with a local jazz band called the Rhythm Maniacs. He took up dancing and formed a partnership with a sister of <a href="Jessie%20Matthews">Jessie Matthews</a>. The act starred in local exhibitions and at minor venues, and they earned well from it. News soon travelled of the couple's talent, and they were engaged as ballroom dancers at a hall in <a href="Cricklewood">Cricklewood</a>. He found the dance-style too restrictive and he left the act to try other aspects of entertainment.

By 1933 Terry-Thomas had moved out of Finchley and into a friend's flat; the friend was a film extra who introduced him to the idea of working in the industry. Terry-Thomas made his uncredited film debut in the 1933 film, "<a href="The%20Private%20Life%20of%20Henry%20VIII">The Private Life of Henry VIII</a>", which starred <a href="Charles%20Laughton">Charles Laughton</a> in <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">the title role</a>. Between 1933 and 1941 Terry-Thomas appeared in 16 films, as an uncredited extra in all but one; he later said that "this work suited me down to the ground. It wasn't really like work to me. I got an enormous kick out of it". His first speaking role came in the 1935 <a href="Buddy%20Rogers%20%28actor%29">Buddy Rogers</a> comedy "<a href="Once%20in%20a%20Million">Once in a Million</a>" where he shouted "A thousand!" during an auction. During the 1936 musical comedy "<a href="This%27ll%20Make%20You%20Whistle">This'll Make You Whistle</a>", starring <a href="Jack%20Buchanan">Jack Buchanan</a>, he permanently damaged his hearing as a result of jumping into a water tank. In between his film work, he developed his cabaret act and was employed as a dance teacher at the Aida Foster School of Dancing in <a href="Golders%20Green">Golders Green</a>.

During this period, he billed himself as Thomas (or Thos) Stevens, but reorganised the name to its backward spelling of Mot Snevets; the name did not last long and he changed it to Thomas Terry. He soon realised that people were mistaking him as a relative of <a href="Ellen%20Terry">Dame Ellen Terry</a>, so inverted the name to Terry Thomas. He did not add the hyphen until 1947, and later explained that it was "not for snob reasons but to tie the two names together. They didn't mean much apart; together they made a trade name": the hyphen was also "to match the gap in his front teeth". By now, he was developing a unique sense of style both on and off stage. In order to avoid staining his fingers with smoke, he used a cigarette holder and later purchased "the most irresistible holder in <a href="Alfred%20Dunhill%20Ltd.">Dunhill's</a>. It was slightly <a href="wikt%3Aoutr%C3%A9">outré</a> because it was made of lacquered, black <a href="whangee">whangee</a> ... with a gold band twisting neatly round it". Adding to his look were a "monocle, raffish waistcoat and red carnation". He later wrote that "sartorially I was an eccentric. But I knew that underneath the clothes I was very much a conservative Englishman who would have loved to have been a genuine eccentric".

In 1937 Terry-Thomas met the South African dancer and choreographer Ida Florence Patlansky, who went by the stage-name Pat Patlanski, while she was auditioning in London for a partner for her <a href="flamenco">flamenco</a> dancing act. Patlanski was keen to employ Terry-Thomas as a comedian rather than a dancer, and they established a cabaret double-act billed as "Terri and Patlanski", which was immediately popular with audiences. The couple became romantically involved and married on 3 February 1938 at <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a> <a href="Register%20office%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Register Office</a>, afterwards moving to 29 Bronwen Court in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>. Despite the success of Terri and Patlanski, the act only lasted three months and they took on small engagements on the <a href="cabaret">cabaret</a> circuit. On 6 June 1938 Terry-Thomas made his first radio broadcast on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> London Regional dance programme "Friends to Tea". He later recounted that "I didn't give a very good performance ... I was a dismal failure". At the end of the summer of 1938 they were hired by the bandleader Don Rico, who incorporated them into his orchestra, with Patlanski playing the piano and Terry-Thomas acting as the <a href="Master%20of%20ceremonies">compère</a>.

The <a href="Entertainments%20National%20Service%20Association">Entertainments National Service Association</a> (ENSA) was formed in 1938 in order to provide entertainment to the <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">British Armed Forces</a>; Terry-Thomas and Patlanski signed up in 1939 and during the <a href="Phoney%20War">Phoney War</a> were posted to France, where they appeared in a variety show. From early in their marriage, Patlanski had started having affairs, a move which prompted Terry-Thomas to reciprocate; he made sure that he was sent on tour to France where a girlfriend was due to perform, although Patlanski accompanied him on the trip. During the tour, Terry-Thomas ensured Patlanski was sent back to the UK to enable him to continue his affair. On his return to Britain, he continued with his solo variety act, while also acting as the head of the cabaret section of ENSA at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a>, where he clashed regularly with his counterparts running the drama sections, <a href="Seymour%20Hicks">Sir Seymour Hicks</a> and <a href="Lilian%20Braithwaite">Lilian Braithwaite</a>. Terry-Thomas aimed to produce "good shows, sophisticated, impeccable and highly polished", which included the violinist Eugene Pini playing light classical music, and the Gainsborough Girls chorus line.

In April 1942 Terry-Thomas received his <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">call-up</a> papers; he later wrote that "it would have seemed rather rude and ungrateful to refuse"; as a result, he left ENSA and reported to the <a href="Royal%20Corps%20of%20Signals">Royal Corps of Signals</a> training depot in <a href="Ossett">Ossett</a>, <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>. Within two weeks of his arrival he hired Ossett Town Hall and staged a concert, which included a freshly written sketch about his feet, which had been suffering in his army boots. After basic training he was promoted to the rank of <a href="corporal">corporal</a> and he applied for a <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commission</a>. He was turned down because training had caused a <a href="Peptic%20ulcer">duodenal ulcer</a>, and his hearing was still problematic; as a result he was downgraded from A1 to B1 fitness at the start of 1943.

Terry-Thomas continued to appear in cabaret and variety shows while in the army, including at the Astoria Cinema in <a href="York">York</a>, where he was seen by George Black. Black established the entertainment troupe, <a href="Stars%20in%20Battledress">Stars in Battledress</a>, which was composed of entertainers who were serving in the forces, and he invited Terry-Thomas to join. In February 1943 he appeared in his first Stars in Battledress show at London's <a href="Olympia%20%28London%29">Olympia</a>, where he introduced the sketch "Technical Hitch". This involved him portraying a harassed BBC announcer introducing records that are missing. In order to cover up for the absent records he would use his vocal range of four and a half octaves to mimic the singers; he included "impersonations of Britain's clipped crooner <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>, the African-American bass-baritone <a href="Paul%20Robeson">Paul Robeson</a>, the Peruvian songbird <a href="Yma%20Sumac">Yma Sumac</a>, the Austrian tenor <a href="Richard%20Tauber">Richard Tauber</a> and ... the entire <a href="Luton%20Girls%20Choir">Luton Girls Choir</a>". The show went on a national tour, with the stand-up comedian <a href="Charlie%20Chester">Charlie Chester</a> as compere, during which Terry-Thomas refined and polished his act and finished as "one of the most prominent and influential members of Stars in Battledress".

Terry-Thomas, along with his Stars in Battledress unit, travelled through Britain and Europe on a tour that lasted several months. After the tour, and with his <a href="Demobilisation%20of%20the%20British%20Armed%20Forces%20after%20the%20Second%20World%20War">demobilisation</a> approaching, he took <a href="Leave%20of%20absence">compassionate leave</a> in order to have free time while still receiving army pay. During his absence he went on a tour of the UK organised by George Black, accompanied on the piano by a former colonel, Harry Sutcliffe. Terry-Thomas finished the war as a <a href="sergeant">sergeant</a>, and was finally demobbed on 1 April 1946.

The ENSA and Stars in Battledress tours of Britain and Europe had raised Terry-Thomas's profile and, by October 1946, he was appearing alongside <a href="Sid%20Field">Sid Field</a> in "Piccadilly Hayride" at the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Theatre">Prince of Wales Theatre</a>, London. The show was described by Graham McCann as "the West End's biggest money-spinner for years". Terry-Thomas compered the show as well as appearing in some of the sketches, including his own "Technical Hitch" routine. In 1959 he described the effect of "Piccadilly Hayride" on his career, saying "This show made me overnight. I'd arrived". <a href="Ivor%20Brown">Ivor Brown</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", remarked on the "glorious rag of BBC modes, moods and intonations by Mr. Terry Thomas, a grand discovery". Within three weeks of starting his run, Terry-Thomas was invited to appear at the <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">Royal Command Performance</a> on 4 November 1946 at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a>.

"Piccadilly Hayride" ran for 778 performances and ended on 17 January 1948. The show was seen by over a million people and earned £350,000 at the box office. In conjunction with "Piccadilly Hayride", Terry-Thomas undertook a number of other additional one-off appearances in cabaret and private functions. He also appeared in editions of "<a href="Variety%20Bandbox">Variety Bandbox</a>" and "<a href="Workers%27%20Playtime%20%28radio%20programme%29">Workers' Playtime</a>" on <a href="BBC%20Radio">BBC Radio</a>. His ever-evolving act consisted of imitations, including that of his friend, the musician <a href="Leslie%20Hutchinson">Leslie Hutchinson</a> (known as "Hutch"); sketches, including "Technical Hitch"; urbane monologues, and "languid <a href="Shaggy%20dog%20story">shaggy dog stories</a>".

At the end of his run with "Piccadilly Hayride", Terry-Thomas took a three-week break to recover from nervous exhaustion and a recurrence of his peptic ulcer. He went back to cabaret and acted as a compere at the London Palladium before making his radio breakthrough on 12 October 1948 with his own series on the <a href="BBC%20Home%20Service">BBC Home Service</a>. Consisting of a "mixture of sketches, solo routines, musical interludes and a range of popular and topical star guests", "<a href="To%20Town%20with%20Terry">To Town with Terry</a>" was broadcast weekly and ran for 24 episodes until 28 March 1949. He was disappointed with the series, saying "I was never totally satisfied with [it] ... The perfectionist in me always made me aware of anything that was less than first class". He also appeared in his first post-war film, "<a href="A%20Date%20with%20a%20Dream">A Date with a Dream</a>", in 1949, alongside his wife.
On 26 October 1949 Terry-Thomas wrote and starred in a new series on the <a href="BBC%20Television%20Service">BBC Television Service</a>, "<a href="How%20Do%20You%20View%3F">How Do You View?</a>", noted for being the first comedy series on British television. The programme was based around an on-screen persona of Terry-Thomas as "a glamorous, mischievous and discreetly cash-strapped man-about-town", introducing a series of sketches in which he appeared alongside <a href="Peter%20Butterworth">Peter Butterworth</a> as his chauffeur; <a href="Janet%20Brown">Janet Brown</a> (Butterworth's real-life wife); <a href="Avril%20Angers">Avril Angers</a>; H.C. Walton as the family retainer, Moulting; and <a href="Diana%20Dors">Diana Dors</a>. The programme was <a href="Live%20television">broadcast live</a> and often included Terry-Thomas walking through control rooms and corridors of the BBC's <a href="Lime%20Grove%20Studios">Lime Grove</a> and <a href="Alexandra%20Palace">Alexandra Palace</a> studios. The author and historian <a href="Mark%20Lewisohn">Mark Lewisohn</a> described the series as being "inventive ... truly televisual and not just a radio programme in costume". The series ran until 21 December 1949; a second series followed between April and May 1950, with <a href="Sid%20Colin">Sid Colin</a> taking over the scripting duties and Terry-Thomas providing additional material. By the third series, which was broadcast between November 1950 and February 1951, the audience reached four million viewers. In total there were five series of "How Do You View?"; the final episode was broadcast on 11 June 1952. Writing about Terry-Thomas on television, <a href="Wilfred%20Greatorex">Wilfred Greatorex</a> observed that "he has ... physical attributes that make him a gift to visual entertainment: a large, rather gaunt face, pre-fabricated for close-ups; the notorious space of one-third of an inch between his two most prominent top teeth; a mouth that is full of expression. Add to these pictoral advantages his eight-inch cigarette holder and <a href="Eddie%20Cantor">Eddie Cantor</a> eyes".
In between filming "How Do You View?", Terry-Thomas continued performing on radio as well as in cabaret, in Britain and increasingly the US. In October and November 1949 he appeared at the <a href="The%20Palmer%20House%20Hilton">Palmer House</a> Night Club, Chicago; in June 1951 he appeared at The Wedgwood Room, <a href="Waldorf%20Astoria%20New%20York">Waldorf Astoria Hotel</a>, New York, and between 22 December 1951 and 29 February 1952 he returned to the London Palladium for 109 performances in "Humpty Dumpty". In September 1952 he travelled to the <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Federation of Malaya</a> to entertain British troops in a series of concert parties, before returning to the UK to appear in the "<a href="Royal%20Variety%20Performance">Royal Variety Performance</a>" in November. He finished the year in <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, as Honourable Idle Jack in "<a href="Dick%20Whittington%20and%20His%20Cat">Dick Whittington</a>", which finished in January 1953; he considered the pantomime to be "so tatty and unrehearsed it was pathetic".

In June 1953 Terry-Thomas broadcast the pilot episode of the radio show, "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Town">Top of the Town</a>"; the show was successful and the BBC commissioned a series of 16 episodes, which ran between November 1953 and February 1954. In between recording sessions, he appeared at the London Palladium in the revue "Fun and the Fair", with <a href="George%20Formby">George Formby</a> and the <a href="Billy%20Cotton">Billy Cotton band</a>, from October 1953. "Fun and the Fair" was unsuccessful at the box office and closed on 19 December 1953, after 138 performances. Terry-Thomas then reprised his role of Idle Jack for a run of performances in the Granada theatres of <a href="Sutton%2C%20London">Sutton</a> and <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>, and the Finsbury Park Empire, which ran to the end of January 1954. That year, he separated from Patlanski following an increase in domestic tension and the plethora of affairs in which they had both indulged. Patlanski moved out of the shared home, and the couple lived separate lives; the press did not report the separation until 1957.

Terry-Thomas spent the 1954 summer season performing at the <a href="Winter%20Gardens%2C%20Blackpool%23Pavilion%20Theatre">Winter Gardens Pavilion</a>, <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> before starring in a second series of "Top of the Town", which ran from October 1954 to February 1955. At the end of the series he appeared as Hubert Crone in the play "Room for Two", which had a UK tour prior to a run at the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales%20Theatre">Prince of Wales Theatre</a>, London. The last stop on the UK tour was at the <a href="Brighton%20Hippodrome">Brighton Hippodrome</a>, where Terry-Thomas broke his arm on stage; he returned to the show five days later when the tour reached London. He later joked that "the audience roared with laughter when I fell and made horrible faces, so much so that I considered breaking the other arm for an encore". The London run was not a success and the show closed after 48 performances.

In February 1956 Terry-Thomas appeared on "<a href="Desert%20Island%20Discs">Desert Island Discs</a>", and chose two songs from his "Technical Hitch" routine as part of his selection. Later that year he appeared in his first major film roles: Charles Boughtflower in "<a href="The%20Green%20Man%20%28film%29">The Green Man</a>", and Major Hitchcock, "a charlatan military officer on the take", in "<a href="Private%27s%20Progress">Private's Progress</a>", directed by the <a href="Boulting%20brothers">Boulting brothers</a>. Terry-Thomas only appeared in the latter film briefly, with a total screen time of about ten minutes, but his biographer Graham McCann thought that the actor "came close to stealing the show from the central character", Windrush played by <a href="Ian%20Carmichael">Ian Carmichael</a>. Terry-Thomas's depiction of the character was not how he wished to play it: his desired choice was that of a "silly-ass" <a href="sergeant%20major">sergeant major</a>, but the role was written as a strict, alcohol and prescription drug-dependent Army officer. He was initially disappointed with the role, and turned it down but, after being persuaded to accept it by his agent, he embraced its possibilities. One of his lines, delivered in his clipped upper class voice, was "You're an absolute shower", which became a catchphrase for him. The Boulting brothers were so impressed with Terry-Thomas's performance that they signed him up to a five-film deal.

The first of the five films was "<a href="Brothers%20in%20Law%20%28film%29">Brothers in Law</a>", in which Terry-Thomas played the <a href="spiv">spiv</a> Alfred Green, a performance which was based on Sid Field's characterisation in "Piccadilly Hayride". Roy Boulting later recounted that one short scene with Terry-Thomas, <a href="Richard%20Attenborough">Richard Attenborough</a> and Ian Carmichael took 107 takes because of Terry-Thomas's unfamiliarity with filming techniques; he initially struggled to <a href="Prompter%20%28theatre%29">hit his marks</a>, or give his line and move on, while still acting. Filming the scene took two days and Boulting described it as "an unique experience for him, and had a wonderful after-effect". Following "Brothers in Law" he was cast as Romney Carlton-Ricketts in "<a href="Blue%20Murder%20at%20St%20Trinian%27s">Blue Murder at St Trinian's</a>" by producers <a href="Frank%20Launder">Frank Launder</a> and <a href="Sidney%20Gilliat">Sidney Gilliat</a>, before again appearing for the Boulting brothers in the cameo role of a local policeman in "<a href="Happy%20Is%20the%20Bride">Happy Is the Bride</a>". Terry-Thomas starred in two further films in 1957. The first was as Bertrand Welch in "<a href="Lucky%20Jim%20%281957%20film%29">Lucky Jim</a>", an adaptation of the <a href="Lucky%20Jim">novel of the same name</a> by <a href="Kingsley%20Amis">Kingsley Amis</a>. Although Amis thought that Terry-Thomas has been "totally miscast as Bertrand, the posturing painter and leading shit" of the book, the critic for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" considered Terry-Thomas as being "the nearest to a complete success" in the film, in a portrayal that "suggests possibilities for more serious roles". His final part of 1957 was Lord Henry Mayley in "<a href="The%20Naked%20Truth%20%281957%20film%29">The Naked Truth</a>"; this brought him together with <a href="Peter%20Sellers">Peter Sellers</a> for the first time, and the two of them appeared frequently together over the next few years in scenes in which, Graham McCann considered that each actor's performance "highlight[ed] what was special about the other". During one scene Terry-Thomas was dumped in a near-freezing lake, and his health was affected for some time afterwards.
In 1958 Terry-Thomas received the first of his two film award nominations, the <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">BAFTA Award</a> for the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">"Best British Actor in 1959"</a> for the part of Ivan in the <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> film "<a href="Tom%20Thumb%20%28film%29">tom thumb</a>". He later described the film as his second favourite; he appeared opposite Sellers for much of his screen time, and later said that "my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it". Terry-Thomas was still suffering with poor health following the filming of "The Naked Truth" when he suffered an attack of <a href="lumbago">lumbago</a>; filming went on for 85 days during 1957–58, and he took painkillers to enable him to continue. The role was physically demanding, and required him to ride a horse, run long distances and fight in a duel. He stated that he fought and ran "just as [he] had seen Douglas Fairbanks Snr do in "<a href="The%20Mark%20of%20Zorro%20%281920%20film%29">The Mark of Zorro</a>"". Towards the end of filming, Terry-Thomas went to a Christmas party at the <a href="London%20Trocadero">Trocadero</a>, where he drank champagne, as well as taking <a href="codeine">codeine</a> tablets, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being <a href="drunk%20and%20disorderly">drunk and disorderly</a>. He considered the arresting policemen to have been rude, and "their attitude made me extremely angry and when I get angry ... I just go completely off my nut". The case came to court on 14 March 1958 and his legal team from <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> provided a medical report which showed Terry-Thomas had been on a course of prescription painkillers due to a gruelling filming schedule; along with inconsistencies in the arresting policemen's notes, the case proved inconclusive and was dismissed. For much of the rest of 1958, Terry-Thomas appeared on stage at the London Palladium in "Large as Life", alongside <a href="Harry%20Secombe">Harry Secombe</a>, <a href="Eric%20Sykes">Eric Sykes</a> and <a href="Hattie%20Jacques">Hattie Jacques</a>. He played one of <a href="the%20Three%20Musketeers">the Three Musketeers</a> in one sketch and had another turn called "Filling the Gap"; the show ran for a total of 380 performances between May and December 1958. He also released his first record, "Strictly T-T", a collection of comic songs and sketches.

In 1959 Terry-Thomas published his first autobiography, "Filling the Gap", named after his spot in "Large as Life"; he explained that "everything that has been printed about me is lies. I'm not suggesting the writers were lying, I was". During the year he also appeared in two further instalments of the Boultings brothers' series of institutional satires, having appeared in the previous three. The first, in which he was joined again by Sellers, was "<a href="Carlton-Browne%20of%20the%20F.O.">Carlton-Browne of the F.O.</a>", in which he played Cadogan de Vere Carlton-Browne, a character he described as being "rubble from the nostrils up", "a certain type of Englishman, the Englishman who reads "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and no other newspaper. A brolly carrier. A squash player. A bowler hat wearer. White collar, stiff, of course". Film writer Andrew Spicer thought that Terry-Thomas's role "was the quintessential upper-class 'silly-ass', a sad relic of a vanished world". The film was initially chosen as Britain's entry for the 1959 <a href="Moscow%20International%20Film%20Festival">Moscow International Film Festival</a> until the Foreign Office petitioned the British Film Producers' Association for it to be withdrawn on the basis that the Russians might consider the film to accurately portray British diplomatic behaviour.
Terry-Thomas's final film with the Boulting brothers was "<a href="I%27m%20All%20Right%20Jack">I'm All Right Jack</a>", a post-war follow-up to "Private's Progress" with Terry-Thomas reprising the role of Major Hitchcock to an industrial setting, as the "tetchily incompetent" personnel manager. Many of the other cast from "Private's Progress" also returned, including Attenborough, Carmichael and <a href="Dennis%20Price">Dennis Price</a>; they were joined by Peter Sellers, who took most of the plaudits from the critics, although Stanley Kauffman, writing in "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>" also delighted in Terry-Thomas's "finesse" and "extraordinary skill". The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" retrospectively considered "I'm All Right Jack" and "Carlton-Browne of the F.O." to have been Terry-Thomas's best works. His final film of 1959 was as William Delany Gordon in "<a href="Too%20Many%20Crooks">Too Many Crooks</a>". <a href="Bosley%20Crowther">Bosley Crowther</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" thought that Terry-Thomas provided "some of the fieriest conniptions to be seen on the contemporary screen", going on to say that the actor's "skill is exercised in demonstrating how magnificently and completely a mad-cap comedian can completely blow his top. His eyes flash, his lips curl, his sibilants whistle and he glares like a maniac". Filming took place during the daytime; in the evenings he appeared at the London Palladium, something he found trying on his nervous system.

In 1960 Terry-Thomas appeared as Raymond Delauney in "<a href="School%20for%20Scoundrels%20%281960%20film%29">School for Scoundrels</a>", a film his biographer, Robert Ross, called "the definitive screen presentation of his frightfully well-mannered, well-read and well-educated lounge lizard: T-T the man as T-T the film star". He again appeared opposite Ian Carmichael, and they were joined by <a href="Alastair%20Sim">Alastair Sim</a> and <a href="Janette%20Scott">Janette Scott</a>. Michael Brooke, writing for the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>, thought Terry-Thomas was "outstanding as a classic British bounder". Later the same year he appeared in "<a href="Make%20Mine%20Mink">Make Mine Mink</a>" as Major Albert Rayne, a veteran of the Second World War who forms a gang of <a href="mink%20coat">mink coat</a> thieves with his female co-lodgers. When he made an appearance at a screening of the film in <a href="Dalston">Dalston</a>, north-east London, he was presented with a white mink waistcoat by a local furrier.

In 1961 Terry-Thomas played Archibald Bannister in "<a href="A%20Matter%20of%20WHO">A Matter of WHO</a>", which he described as "my first (fairly) serious role". He was joined in the film by his second cousin <a href="Richard%20Briers">Richard Briers</a>, with Terry-Thomas noting that he provided "no nepotic help" in getting Briers the part. The film was not well received by the critics; an internal BBC memo described that in the UK the film was "murdered by the critics", although it was "something of a success" in America. By this time Terry-Thomas had decided to stop being a stand-up comedian and compere and instead concentrate solely on making films. He stopped appearing on television and radio shows of his own, declaring "it was the cinema for me and me for the cinema!" Having accumulated considerable experience by appearing in British films, he decided to try Hollywood, and moved to America.

Terry-Thomas spent part of 1961 in America, filming the role of Professor Bruce Patterson in "<a href="Bachelor%20Flat">Bachelor Flat</a>"—his first Hollywood role—before flying to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> to film "<a href="Operation%20Snatch">Operation Snatch</a>", in which he teamed up with <a href="Lionel%20Jeffries">Lionel Jeffries</a>. By the end of 1961 Terry-Thomas was appearing on radio, such as the December broadcast of "<a href="The%20Bing%20Crosby%20%E2%80%93%20Rosemary%20Clooney%20Show">The Bing Crosby Show</a>" and in guest spots on American television shows; he was frequently the subject of US newspaper interviews. In 1962 "Bachelor Flat" and "Operation Snatch" were both released, and were followed by two more films: a large-budget biopic from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer called "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20World%20of%20the%20Brothers%20Grimm">The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm</a>", in which Terry-Thomas shared his scenes with the American comedian <a href="Buddy%20Hackett">Buddy Hackett</a>, and "<a href="Kill%20or%20Cure%20%281962%20film%29">Kill or Cure</a>", in which he appeared with Sykes, a friend since they worked together in "Large as Life".

On 1 February 1962 Terry-Thomas and Pat Patlanski divorced, having spent the previous eight years estranged. He had by then split from his mistress of the previous few years, <a href="Lorrae%20Desmond">Lorrae Desmond</a>, who returned to Australia shortly afterwards and married a surgeon; Terry-Thomas resumed his bachelor life-style. The break-up with Desmond caused him great upset, and he sought solace with Belinda Cunningham, a 21-year-old whom he had met on holiday in <a href="Majorca">Majorca</a> two years previously. The couple began a romance, and married in August 1963 at <a href="Halstead">Halstead</a> Registry Office near <a href="Colchester">Colchester</a>, <a href="Essex">Essex</a>. The following year she gave birth to their first son—Timothy Hoar—at the Princess Beatrice Hospital in London.
In 1962 Terry-Thomas was offered the role of Lt-Colonel J. Algernon Hawthorne in "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Mad%2C%20Mad%2C%20Mad%2C%20Mad%20World">It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</a>", and turned down the opportunity before leaving for the UK. By the time his flight arrived in London he had changed his mind, so he telephoned producer <a href="Stanley%20Kramer">Stanley Kramer</a> from the airport to signal his acceptance, and "popped back on a plane to be fitted for the part" the same day. He was not comfortable with many of the other actors on set, later commenting that "I was the only non-American, and I found it exhausting and embarrassing because they never relaxed. They were always 'on'." One of the American stars was <a href="Spencer%20Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>, whom Terry-Thomas considered "an extra-special man"; Tracy and <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a>—who also appeared in the film—were described by Terry-Thomas as "the only two people who ever produced in me this awe of greatness".

Later in 1963 he picked up his second film nomination, the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Golden Globe for Best Comedy Actor</a> for his portrayal of Spender in "<a href="The%20Mouse%20on%20the%20Moon">The Mouse on the Moon</a>". He also tried his hand at production, with three 15-minute travelogues: "Terry-Thomas in Tuscany", "Terry-Thomas in the South of France" and "Terry-Thomas in Northern Ireland". He did not enjoy the producer's role, complaining that "for some extraordinary reason that I could never understand, everybody was always out to do the producer of any film whoever he was. I had to be on the watch the whole time". He worked consistently during 1963, appearing in television programmes on both sides of the Atlantic; these included "Terry-Thomas", a one-off variety show on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC Television</a> in July that included <a href="Donald%20Sutherland">Donald Sutherland</a>.

In 1964 Terry-Thomas started filming the role of Charles Furbank in "<a href="How%20to%20Murder%20Your%20Wife">How to Murder Your Wife</a>", a part which brought him £100,000, his largest fee up to that point. He said that it was his favourite to make, "because I felt that I did a very good job". He enjoyed working with <a href="Jack%20Lemmon">Jack Lemmon</a>, the film's star, partly because Lemmon would play jazz and sing while the scenes were being lit: the two became friends and Terry-Thomas was invited to Lemmon's wedding. Throughout the rest of the year Terry-Thomas continued to appear on US television, again in "Burke's Law", but also on "<a href="What%27s%20My%20Line%3F">What's My Line?</a>" and "An Hour with Robert Goulet", both on <a href="CBS">CBS</a>; he also released another record, "Terry-Thomas Discovers America", a collection of songs and sketches, described by "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" as "a "funny", "funny" comedy masterpiece". His earlier record "Strictly T-T" was also released in the US.

Alongside "How to Murder Your Wife", there were two further releases for Terry-Thomas in 1965: "<a href="Strange%20Bedfellows%20%281965%20film%29">Strange Bedfellows</a>", in which he played the part of a mortician, and "<a href="Those%20Magnificent%20Men%20in%20their%20Flying%20Machines">Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines</a>". In the latter, he played Sir Percy Ware-Armitage, a character the film historian Andrew Spicer calls "a cartoon version" of his usual persona in a "bloated mid-Atlantic comed[y]". In the film, Terry-Thomas appeared again with Sykes, an experience Sykes later described as magical. The roles of Ware-Armitage and his sidekick were written especially for Terry-Thomas and Sykes at the behest of the director <a href="Ken%20Annakin">Ken Annakin</a>..

By the mid-1960s Terry-Thomas was tiring of the Hollywood lifestyle, and, during the latter half of the 1960s, he worked with European filmmakers, returning occasionally to the US when he was filming there. In one of his French-produced films, "<a href="La%20Grande%20Vadrouille">La Grande Vadrouille</a>", he played Sir Reginald, a stranded <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> pilot travelling through <a href="Military%20Administration%20in%20France%20%28Nazi%20Germany%29">occupied France</a> with characters played by <a href="Bourvil">Bourvil</a> and <a href="Louis%20de%20Fun%C3%A8s">Louis de Funès</a>. The film, released in 1966, held the record for highest box-office takings in France until 2004, and it remains "one of the most popular films with television audiences in France". Terry-Thomas undertook a number of roles with the <a href="Cinema%20of%20Italy">Italian cinema industry</a>. For one of the Italian-produced films, the 1967 <a href="farce">farce</a> "<a href="Arabella%20%281967%20film%29">Arabella</a>", he played four parts and used "the help of wigs, moustaches and lashings of Max Factor" to help achieve the different characterisations, which were all with the Italian actress <a href="Virna%20Lisi">Virna Lisi</a>.

Although the European films allowed him to travel and gave him a constant source of income, he received bigger fees from his less-frequent engagements in US films, which he continued to appear in, joking that he "knew the fat cheques in the pipe-line were endless". One of the bigger fees came with <a href="Gene%20Kelly">Gene Kelly</a>'s 1967 film "<a href="A%20Guide%20for%20the%20Married%20Man">A Guide for the Married Man</a>"; he was disappointed by Kelly's direction, later saying "I found him a very prudish director, not as imaginative or experimental as I would have liked". Terry-Thomas had more time for the actress with whom he shared his short scene, <a href="Jayne%20Mansfield">Jayne Mansfield</a>, commenting that "I found her rather intelligent to talk to and felt quite shattered when I read about the gruesome car accident that killed her". An actress he had difficulties in working with was <a href="Doris%20Day">Doris Day</a>: in the 1968 film "<a href="Where%20Were%20You%20When%20the%20Lights%20Went%20Out%3F">Where Were You When the Lights Went Out?</a>", which was produced by her husband <a href="Martin%20Melcher">Martin Melcher</a>. Day would instruct Terry-Thomas how he should act in a scene (he would "listen ... politely, then do it my own way, as if the conversation had never taken place"). She would also launch into improvisations while filming; director <a href="Hy%20Averback">Hy Averback</a> would mimic a scissor action behind her back to signal to Terry-Thomas that the material would be duly cut from the final print. The result was a film that Geoff Mayer called "limp", and Christopher Young described as "such an uneven movie that misses so many opportunities for real comedy".
In 1967 Terry-Thomas met his long-time friend <a href="Denholm%20Elliott">Denholm Elliott</a> in Bel Air and the pair talked about Elliott's new villa in <a href="Santa%20Eul%C3%A0ria%20des%20Riu">Santa Eulària des Riu</a> on the Spanish island of <a href="Ibiza">Ibiza</a>. Terry-Thomas was intrigued by the possibility of a Mediterranean retreat and visited the island on the way to film "" with <a href="Grace%20Kelly">Princess Grace of Monaco</a> who was playing herself. Although he initially struggled to find the right plot of ground for the right price, he eventually settled on an appropriate location; declaring he was "allergic to architects", he designed the house himself. His former wife Pat moved to the nearby island of <a href="Majorca">Majorca</a>, and Terry-Thomas's relationship with her became warm and friendly; Patlanski also had a firm friendship with Terry-Thomas's wife.

In between films Terry-Thomas appeared on television on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US in March–April 1967 he was in "The Five Daughters Affair", a two-part story in the TV series "<a href="The%20Man%20from%20U.N.C.L.E.">The Man from U.N.C.L.E.</a>", and on 22 May he appeared on "<a href="The%20Red%20Skelton%20Hour">The Red Skelton Hour</a>". On British television, in an episode of the "<a href="Comedy%20Playhouse">Comedy Playhouse</a>" called "The Old Campaigner", he played James Franklin-Jones, a salesman for a plastics company who was continually searching for love affairs while travelling on business. This character was "yet another variation on his rakish cad persona", according to Mark Lewisohn. The episode was well-received, and a six-part series was commissioned that ran over December 1968 and January 1969. Although the series performed well in the ratings, a second series was not commissioned. In between the pilot and the series of "The Old Campaigner", in April 1968, Terry-Thomas appeared on the British <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> network in a one-off variety special, "The Big Show", which combined musical numbers and his urbane monologues. Robert Ross commented that Terry-Thomas "seemed to delight in resurrecting his vintage sophisticated patter after years in movies ... the top raconteur was back where he belonged". In 1969 he again teamed up with Eric Sykes and director <a href="Ken%20Annakin">Ken Annakin</a> for a joint Italian, French and British production "<a href="Monte%20Carlo%20or%20Bust%21">Monte Carlo or Bust!</a>". The film was "the only copper-bottomed sequel to ... "Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines"", according to Richard Ross. Terry-Thomas played Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage, the "thoroughly bad egg son of flying ace Sir Percy Ware-Armitage", his role in "Those Magnificent Men". Terry-Thomas secured four other roles in minor films that year, including "<a href="Arthur%3F%20Arthur%21">Arthur? Arthur!</a>" (which he joked had "never been shown anywhere—as far as I know!"), as well as on television in the UK, US and Australia.

The 1970s began well for Terry-Thomas; television appearances in the UK and US were augmented by filming for "<a href="The%20Abominable%20Dr.%20Phibes">The Abominable Dr. Phibes</a>", which became what author Bruce Hallenbeck called a "camp classic", despite being described by "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>" critic <a href="David%20Pirie">David Pirie</a>, as "the worst horror film made in England since 1945"; the film was released in 1971. On 1 August 1970 Terry-Thomas made his second appearance on "Desert Island Discs"; his luxury item was a case of brandy, chosen because it lasted longer than champagne.

While appearing in "Don't Just Lie There, Say Something!" at the <a href="The%20Metro%20Theatre">Metro Theatre</a>, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> in 1971, Terry-Thomas felt unwell and visited a doctor, who noticed his patient's left hand was shaking slightly; the doctor suggested a visit, upon his return to the UK, to a specialist, who diagnosed the actor with <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>. Fearing the condition would affect offers of work, he did not make the news public, but as the symptoms began to manifest themselves in tremors, a shuffling gait, stooped posture and affected speech, he made the news known—partly to stop rumours of on-set drunkenness.

He continued to work as much as possible, although—as the film historian Geoff Mayer pointed out—the situation "reduced his film career to supporting roles and cameos". The lucrative voice-over role of Sir Hiss in the 1973 <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Animation%20Studios">Walt Disney</a> film "<a href="Robin%20Hood%20%281973%20film%29">Robin Hood</a>" was one notable part, while others were less well-known, such as "<a href="The%20Vault%20of%20Horror%20%28film%29">The Vault of Horror</a>", a film described by Richard Ross as a "cornball terror", in which he starred with <a href="Curd%20J%C3%BCrgens">Curd Jürgens</a>, <a href="Tom%20Baker">Tom Baker</a> and Denholm Elliott. He also continued to appear on television shows in both the US and UK, as well as advertisements, including appearing with <a href="June%20Whitfield">June Whitfield</a> for <a href="Birds%20Eye">Birds Eye</a> <a href="fish%20finger">fish finger</a>s, a series of <a href="vermouth">vermouth</a> advertisements filmed in Italy, and an award-winning series for <a href="Benson%20%26amp%3B%20Hedges">Benson & Hedges</a> along with Eric Sykes.

During the 1970s he starred in a series of low-budget British films, including two in 1975, "<a href="Spanish%20Fly%20%281975%20film%29">Spanish Fly</a>"—called a "gruesome smutfest" by the writer <a href="Christopher%20Fowler">Christopher Fowler</a>—and "<a href="The%20Bawdy%20Adventures%20of%20Tom%20Jones">The Bawdy Adventures of Tom Jones</a>", described by the "Film Review Digest" as a "cheap, crude, sexed-up rehash" of the other film adaptations of <a href="Henry%20Fielding">Henry Fielding</a>'s <a href="The%20History%20of%20Tom%20Jones%2C%20a%20Foundling">source novel</a>.
In 1977 he starred in "<a href="The%20Last%20Remake%20of%20Beau%20Geste">The Last Remake of Beau Geste</a>" and "<a href="The%20Hound%20of%20the%20Baskervilles%20%281978%20film%29">The Hound of the Baskervilles</a>", the latter starring <a href="Peter%20Cook">Peter Cook</a> and <a href="Dudley%20Moore">Dudley Moore</a> as <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Holmes</a> and <a href="Dr.%20Watson">Watson</a>; Terry-Thomas thought that "it was the most outrageous film I ever appeared in ... there was no magic ... it was bad!" By then he had exhibited <a href="hypokinesia">a decrease in bodily movement</a>, a sign of how serious his condition had become. His distinctive voice had developed a softer tone and his posture was contorted. Between 1978 and 1980, he spent much time with medical consultants. Despite this he was offered a few engagements and had been voted the most recognisable Englishman among Americans in a poll which also featured <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>, <a href="Robert%20Morley">Robert Morley</a> and <a href="Wilfrid%20Hyde-White">Wilfrid Hyde-White</a>. As a result, he secured a lucrative advertising contract with the <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a>. <a href="Derek%20Jarman">Derek Jarman</a> offered Terry-Thomas a role in his 1979 film "<a href="The%20Tempest%20%281979%20film%29">The Tempest</a>," but the actor was forced to pull out because of his deteriorating health.

Terry-Thomas undertook his final film role in 1980 in "Febbre a 40!", a German–Italian co-production that was "nondescript and barely screened", according to Robert Ross, and did not even have a theatrical release in its two domestic markets. He continued his involvement in the film industry, where he funded three films during the early 1980s (noted by Ross to be "destined from the outset for B-picture status or straight-to-video exposure"); he commented that "I have made a loss of one hundred per cent". In 1982, with his condition worsening, Terry-Thomas featured in two episodes of the BBC series "The Human Brain", which examined his condition; his frank interview brought much public awareness of the disease and raised £32,000 for the <a href="Parkinson%27s%20Disease%20Society">Parkinson's Disease Society</a>. Privately, he was becoming more depressed; his London flat had been sold to provide badly needed funds, and his work offers were decreasing.

By 1983, with his medical bills at £40,000 a year, Terry-Thomas's financial resources were dwindling. He and his wife sold their dream house and moved into the small cottage once owned by his former wife Pat Patlanski, which she left to him in her will on her death in June that year. Shortly afterwards he worked with <a href="ghostwriter">ghostwriter</a> Terry Daum on an autobiography, "Terry-Thomas Tells Tales". Although the first draft was completed by late summer 1984, Terry-Thomas refused to release the manuscript and continued to make alterations, but never completed his copyediting: the book was finally published after his death.

By 1984 Terry-Thomas was increasingly depressed by his condition and when he was interviewed that year, he admitted that "one doctor said I've got about four more years to live. God forbid! I shall probably blow my brains out first". In 1987 the couple could no longer afford to live in Spain, so they moved back to London. They lived in a series of rented properties before ending up in a three-room, unfurnished charity flat, where they lived with financial assistance from the Actors' Benevolent Fund. Richard Briers was one of his first visitors at the flat, and was shocked by the change he saw: "[S]itting there, motionless, he was just a mere shadow. A crippled, crushed, shadow. It was really bloody awful."

On 9 April 1989 the actor <a href="Jack%20Douglas%20%28actor%29">Jack Douglas</a> and Richard Hope-Hawkins organised a benefit concert for Terry-Thomas, after discovering he was living in virtual obscurity, poverty and ill health. The gala, held at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, ran for five hours, and featured 120 artists with <a href="Phil%20Collins">Phil Collins</a> topping the bill and <a href="Michael%20Caine">Michael Caine</a> as the gala chairman. The show raised over £75,000 for Terry-Thomas and <a href="Parkinson%27s%20UK">Parkinson's UK</a>. The funds from the charity concert allowed Terry-Thomas to move out of his charity flat and into Busbridge Hall nursing home in <a href="Godalming">Godalming</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. He died there on 8 January 1990, at the age of 78. The funeral service was held at <a href="Busbridge%20Church">St. John the Baptist Church</a>, <a href="Busbridge">Busbridge</a>, where the theme from "Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines" was played; he was cremated at <a href="Guildford">Guildford Crematorium</a>.

Although there were exceptions, Terry-Thomas's screen characters were generally similar; Geoff Mayer wrote that "although there would be variations, he would remain the 'rotter', a pretentious, elitist, seedy, sometimes lecherous cad with an eye for quick money and the easy life". Eric Sykes, with whom Terry-Thomas shared a number of screen moments, stated that it was "always the same character and always funny". Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute, called him "the definitive postwar cad or rotter". Terry-Thomas himself agreed with the view he presented, writing in the 1980s that "T-T with his permanent air of caddish disdain ... bounder ... aristocratic rogue ... upper-class English twit ... genuine English eccentric ... one of the last real gentlemen ... wet, genteel Englishman ... high-bred idiot ... cheeky blighter ... camel-haired cad ... amiable buffoon ... pompous Englishman ... twentieth-century dandy ... stinker ... king of the cads ... All those descriptions added up to my image as Terry-Thomas".
Terry-Thomas identified himself as a comedy actor, but regarded himself "first and foremost, as a comedian with a built-in ability to inject humour into situations". He worked hard at the humour element, especially during his days in cabaret and revue; he wrote that he "spent an enormous amount of time studying how to write humour and reading books on the philosophical approach to it, but it didn't get me very far. I decided that humour was like a good watch. It would go well if left to do its job but the moment one started poking around, it went wonky". While working on his television series "How do you View?", he would change lines around to ensure the scene worked well, even if he gave the best lines to others; it was a quality which was appreciated by a number of others, including Jack Lemmon, who appeared with Terry-Thomas in "How to Murder Your Wife". Lemmon commented that "like most really good professionals he was generous to fellow actors. He worked with you, not at you".

Before starting filming or making an entrance on stage, Terry-Thomas had a routine he would undertake: "my own technique to get myself going was ... to jump in the air and execute a few dance steps". His approach for much of his film work was to underplay many of his reactions. Filming a scene in a cinema in "Private's Progress", a close-up was needed showing his character "registering shock, fury, indignation and anything else I could stuff in"; he "just looked into the camera and kept my mind blank. It's a trick I've used often since. In this way, the audience does the work". Terry-Thomas said "I like to do my own stunts", which he did for films such as "A Matter of WHO" and "Bachelor Flat". This included some dangerous work; for example, during "Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines", he ran along the roof of a moving train.

Following Terry-Thomas's death, Lionel Jeffries called him "the last of the great gentlemen of the cinema", while the director <a href="Michael%20Winner">Michael Winner</a> commented that "no matter what your position was in relation to his, as the star he was always terribly nice. He was the kindest man and he enjoyed life so much". Reviewing his career in "The Guardian", Adrian Turner considered that "we took him for granted and he was ideal for his time. Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the 'never had it so good' ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand in America, who saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain"; he also said that Terry-Thomas was "a national treasure". Gilbert Adair, writing in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", considered that "for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder"; Adair wrote that "the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness". Terry-Thomas's friend Jack Lemmon called him "a consummate professional ... he was a gentleman, a delight to be with personally, let alone professionally, and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so much—he made it look simple".

Terry-Thomas's image of an English cad was used by others. The personification started in the 1960s when the voice actor <a href="Ivan%20Owen">Ivan Owen</a>, who had worked alongside Terry-Thomas in "Stars in Battledress", based the voice for <a href="Basil%20Brush">Basil Brush</a> on that of Terry-Thomas, in a characterisation which also copied Terry-Thomas's "penchant for bad, self-satisfied, golf-club-bore jokes". The 1960s also witnessed the fictional cartoon character <a href="Dick%20Dastardly">Dick Dastardly</a> in two <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> cartoon series ("<a href="Wacky%20Races%20%281968%20TV%20series%29">Wacky Races</a>" and "<a href="Dastardly%20and%20Muttley%20in%20Their%20Flying%20Machines">Dastardly and Muttley in Their Flying Machines</a>"), who was inspired by Terry-Thomas.

Other actors have also used Terry-Thomas's persona as an inspiration for their characters: <a href="Dustin%20Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a> acknowledged that he based his interpretation of the character <a href="Captain%20Hook">Captain Hook</a> in "<a href="Hook%20%28film%29">Hook</a>" on Terry-Thomas; <a href="Rupert%20Everett">Rupert Everett</a> disclosed that when he provided the voice for <a href="List%20of%20Shrek%20characters%23Prince%20Charming">Prince Charming</a> in "<a href="Shrek%202">Shrek 2</a>" Terry-Thomas "was vocally my role model while I was doing it"; and <a href="Paul%20Whitehouse">Paul Whitehouse</a>'s character, the 13th Duke of Wybourne, from "<a href="The%20Fast%20Show">The Fast Show</a>" was also modelled on Terry-Thomas's on-screen persona.

Terry-Thomas's popularity continued after his death. In February 1999 the <a href="National%20Film%20Theatre">National Film Theatre</a> ran a season of Terry-Thomas films; an NFT spokesman described how attendees to the films turned up "in evening dress, with false moustaches and carrying cigarettes in long holders ... everyone has been trying to steal the cardboard cutouts of Terry ... We've never had a response like it. To be honest, we are rather unprepared. Nobody expected Terry-Thomas Fever".

Some of the innovations Terry-Thomas brought into his earlier television programmes were later copied by others; "How Do You View?" later provided the "prologue" format of "<a href="Up%20Pompeii%21">Up Pompeii!</a>", and was the first to use regular BBC announcers as foils in comic sketches—a practice continued later, particularly with the shows of <a href="Morecambe%20and%20Wise">Morecambe and Wise</a>. Terry-Thomas's anecdotes, stringing several stories together, later inspired <a href="Ronnie%20Corbett">Ronnie Corbett</a> in his monologue spot in his series "<a href="The%20Two%20Ronnies">The Two Ronnies</a>". In 2014, BBC Radio 4 broadcast "Memories of a Cad", a comedy drama by <a href="Roy%20Smiles">Roy Smiles</a> about the relationship between Terry-Thomas and Richard Briers, played by <a href="Martin%20Jarvis%20%28actor%29">Martin Jarvis</a> and <a href="Alistair%20McGowan">Alistair McGowan</a> respectively.

The Diary of a Nobody

The Diary of a Nobody is an English comic novel written by the brothers <a href="George%20Grossmith">George</a> and <a href="Weedon%20Grossmith">Weedon Grossmith</a>, with illustrations by the latter. It originated as an intermittent serial in "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" magazine in 1888–89 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The "Diary" records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, <a href="Charles%20Pooter">Charles Pooter</a>, his wife Carrie, his son William Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months.

Before their collaboration on the "Diary", the brothers each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated nine of the principal comedian roles in the <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano <a href="sketch%20comedy">sketch</a> entertainer and wrote a large number of songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The "Diary" was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the "Diary" were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.

Although its initial public reception was muted, the "Diary" came to be recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and it has never been out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or lower-middle class aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The "Diary" has been the subject of several stage and screen adaptations, including <a href="Ken%20Russell">Ken Russell</a>'s "silent film" treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by <a href="Andrew%20Davies%20%28writer%29">Andrew Davies</a> in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts.

"The Diary of a Nobody" was the work of <a href="George%20Grossmith">George Grossmith</a> and his brother <a href="Weedon%20Grossmith">Weedon Grossmith</a>, the sons of a court reporter and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the West London School of Art and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor. The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents' garden at <a href="Haverstock">Haverstock Hill</a>. This included a 20-minute <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">burlesque</a> version of "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>", in which George played the title role; Weedon was <a href="Ophelia">Ophelia</a>.

By 1877 the younger George Grossmith had established himself as a comic piano <a href="sketch%20comedy">sketch</a> entertainer in provincial institutes and literary societies. In that year he was seen by <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> and, separately, by <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>, in performances of their one-act comic opera "<a href="Trial%20by%20Jury">Trial by Jury</a>". Impressed, they engaged him to play the comic lead in their new, full-length work, "<a href="The%20Sorcerer">The Sorcerer</a>". Thereafter, Grossmith created the leading comic role in each of <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>'s long-running comic operas until "<a href="The%20Yeomen%20of%20the%20Guard">The Yeomen of the Guard</a>", which closed in 1889. While appearing in the operas, Grossmith continued his piano entertainment career at private parties and matinees, writing and composing his own material. He became the most successful comic entertainer of his day, writing numerous operettas, around 100 piano sketches, some 600 songs and short piano pieces, and three books. For "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" magazine in 1884 he provided a series of short sketches based on his experiences as a court reporter at <a href="Bow%20Street%20Magistrates%27%20Court">Bow Street Magistrates' Court</a>. In 1889, Grossmith ended his connection with Gilbert and Sullivan to pursue his piano sketch career full-time and continued to perform until 1908. He died in 1912.

As an artist Weedon Grossmith exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a> and at the <a href="Grosvenor%20Gallery">Grosvenor Gallery</a>. He also contributed illustrations to "Punch" and the prestigious "<a href="The%20Art%20Journal">Art Journal</a>". He was nevertheless dissatisfied with his financial prospects as an artist, and by 1885 was pursuing an alternative career as an actor. He continued his career on the stage with considerable success until 1918, making his name playing roles he described as "cowards, cads and snobs", and as browbeaten small men under the thumb of authority. He wrote several plays, of which "The Night of the Party" (1901) was his most successful, and from 1894 was engaged in the management of two <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End theatre</a>s. He died in 1919. The literary scholar Peter Morton, who published an annotated edition of the "Diary" in 2009, suggests that many of the events depicted in it were drawn from the brothers' own home experiences, and that Weedon, "something of a scapegrace compared with his perfectionist brother", was the model for Lupin.

The diary begins on 3 April of an unstated year, and runs for approximately 15 months. In a short prologue, readers are informed that <a href="Charles%20Pooter">Charles Pooter</a> and his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at "The Laurels", Brickfield Terrace, <a href="Holloway%2C%20London">Holloway</a>. Mr Pooter is a <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> clerk with Perkupps, possibly an <a href="Accountant">accountancy</a> or private banking firm (though their business is not explicitly stated). The couple's 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk in <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>. The first entries describe the Pooters' daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses from <a href="Sutton%2C%20London">Sutton</a>. From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters' daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter's unconscious self-importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations.

The rare formal social events in the Pooters' lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a> to attend a ball at the <a href="Mansion%20House%2C%20London">Mansion House</a> for "Representatives of Trade and Commerce". After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished. Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.

In the summer their son arrives from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, "Lupin." He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupps. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week in <a href="Broadstairs">Broadstairs</a>, but relationships are strained by Lupin's "fast" habits. On their return, Pooter's efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the "Holloway Comedians". With the help of Pooter's employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement.

Lupin's fiancée, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, "the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met". Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: "She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking". Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.

In the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to "The Laurels". These occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if of right. Lupin opts out of the family's Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone's astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy.

In the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp's, and his salary raised by £100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin's announcement that he has just profited by £200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin's, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin's stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin's only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest £600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter's eyes the situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.

April begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests—among them Mr Padge—with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.

Lupin is sacked from Perkupps for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillion, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with £25 commission and a job at £200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh. Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray's sister, known as "Lillie Girl", a woman of around 30. Pooter learns that Murray Posh has settled £10,000 on both Daisy and "Lillie Girl".

Pooter is summoned to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupps a new client to replace Mr Crowbillion. Perkupp is so grateful to Pooter for this introduction that he buys up the freehold of "The Laurels" and presents the <a href="deed">deed</a>s to Pooter. As the couple celebrate, a letter arrives from Lupin announcing his engagement to "Lillie Girl": "We shall be married in August, and among our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing and Cummings".

The "Diary" made its initial appearance as an intermittent serial in the satirical weekly magazine "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>". The first of the 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: "As everybody who is anybody is publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to 'A Nobody' for permitting us to add to the historic collection". The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear in "Punch".
The "Punch" serialisation ended in May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their friends celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin's appointment as a clerk at Perkupps. That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months' entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.

In June 1892 <a href="J.W.%20Arrowsmith%20Ltd">J.W. Arrowsmith Ltd</a> published the "Diary" in book form, although its critical and popular success was not evident until the third edition appeared in October 1910. After the First World War the book's popularity continued to grow; regular reprintings and new editions ensured that thereafter the book was never out of print. Audiobook versions have been available since 1982. The writer <a href="Robert%20McCrum">Robert McCrum</a>, in a personal list of "The 100 greatest novels of all time" published in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" newspaper, listed the "Diary" at number 35.

The "Punch" serialisation attracted little critical comment; "<a href="Athenaeum%20%28British%20magazine%29">The Athenaeum</a>"s literary critic thought the series "may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes". When the "Diary" was published as a book, "Punch" heralded it in its issue of 23 July 1892 as "very funny", adding: "not without a touch of pathos". However, apart from a warmly approving report in "<a href="Saturday%20Review%20%28London%29">The Saturday Review</a>", the book's initial critical reception was lukewarm. The "Review"s critic thought the book "admirable, and in some of its touches [it] goes close to genius", with a natural and irresistible appeal: "The "Diary" has amused us from cover to cover". This contrasted with the negative judgement of "The Athenaeum", which opined that "the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing". It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: "Besides, it is all so dull". "The Speaker"s critic thought the book "a study in vulgarity", while "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: "There is that kind of quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water ... Our way of manufacturing fun is different". Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.

By 1910 the "Diary" was beginning to achieve a reputation in London's literary and political circles. In his essay "On People in Books", published earlier that year, the writer and humourist <a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a> hailed the "Diary" as "one of the half-dozen immortal achievements of our time ... a glory for us all". Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work were <a href="Archibald%20Primrose%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Lord Rosebery</a>, the former prime minister, who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had "purchased and given away more copies than any living man ... I regard any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it". Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute was <a href="Augustine%20Birrell">Augustine Birrell</a>, who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post of <a href="Chief%20Secretary%20for%20Ireland">Chief Secretary for Ireland</a>. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongside <a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a> as a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book—"an illiterate charwoman, it is true"—carried his name. Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings. In its review of this edition "<a href="The%20Bookman%20%28London%29">The Bookman</a>" s critic wrote of Charles Pooter: "You laugh at him—at his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and even your admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human".

In its review of the book's fourth edition, published in 1919, "The Bookman" observed that the book was now a firm favourite with the public. "It has had many imitators ... but not one of them has rivalled the original, and they have all faded away". The reviewer recommended the book's "quaint drollery, its whimsical satire and delightfully quiet irony". In Canada, "<a href="Queen%27s%20Quarterly">Queen's Quarterly</a>" magazine's sympathetic reception of the book contrasted with that of the "New York Times" nearly 30 years previously. It praises the understated but lovable self-portrait of Pooter, and adds that "It is not till the second or third reading—and you are bound to reread it—that the really consummate art of this artless book becomes apparent". The literary critic <a href="D.%20B.%20Wyndham%20Lewis">D. B. Wyndham Lewis</a> summarised the Pooters as "warm, living, breathing, futile, half-baked, incredibly alive and endearing boneheads".

The novelist <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> had been familiar with the "Diary" since his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents—<a href="Arthur%20Waugh">Arthur Waugh</a> used to read passages aloud to his family, and Evelyn's biographer Selena Hastings has drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household. Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, to the extent of writing in his 1930 essay "One Way to Immortality" that it was "the funniest book in the world". He added: "Nobody wants to read other people's reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years". Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh's early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of a changing world. In his 1945 novel "<a href="Brideshead%20Revisited">Brideshead Revisited</a>", Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from the "Diary" "with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression". Morton suggests that one of the work's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, and the way in which the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage.

At about the time that Waugh was discovering his affection for the "Diary" another writer, <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a>, was extolling it as an exemplar of <a href="English%20humour">English humour</a>; <a href="Jerome%20K.%20Jerome">Jerome K. Jerome</a>, Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: "[P]oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart". In a 1943 essay, <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a> considered the book an accurate account of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who "constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly". In the years after the Second World War the book's stock remained high; <a href="Osbert%20Lancaster">Osbert Lancaster</a> deemed it "a great work of art", and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians. <a href="Gillian%20Tindall">Gillian Tindall</a>, writing in 1970, thought the "Diary" "the best comic novel in the language", and lauded Pooter as "the presiding shade" of his era. This accolade was echoed a further generation on by <a href="A.%20N.%20Wilson">A. N. Wilson</a>, who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: "Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [1890s] than the lower-middle class Charles and Carrie Pooter?" Wilson also observed the extent to which the Pooters had become recognised as "arbiters of the greatest good taste", as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted "period" homes. A "Spectator" article of 2008 remarks on how such houses as "The Laurels", the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable £1 million-plus homes in what it terms "banker land".

Peter Bailey, in his study "White Collars, Gray Lives" (1999), traces the beginnings of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the "disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers" that faced Victorian writers in the last quarter of the 19th century. The Grossmiths' "Diary" was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the "Diary" "a sharp analysis of social insecurity". Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: "putting the boot in on the lower middle classes", says Bailey, "has long been the intellectual's blood sport". However, the quarter-century following the publication of "The Diary of a Nobody" saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as <a href="George%20Gissing">George Gissing</a>, <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Bennett">Arnold Bennett</a> and <a href="E.%20M.%20Forster">E. M. Forster</a>, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as "<a href="The%20Card">Denry Machin</a>", "<a href="The%20History%20of%20Mr%20Polly">Mr Polly</a>" or "<a href="Love%20and%20Mr%20Lewisham">Mr Lewisham</a>", while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. In cases such as these, writes Bailey, "disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man ... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis."

During the past century, the fictitious diary has developed as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, "been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds". An early example is <a href="Anita%20Loos">Anita Loos</a>'s novel of 1925: "<a href="Gentlemen%20Prefer%20Blondes%20%28novel%29">Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady</a>" in which the protagonist, <a href="Lorelei%20Lee">Lorelei Lee</a>, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that "follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech" and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, "burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class". The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978–81 <a href="Christopher%20Matthew">Christopher Matthew</a> produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of "Simon Crisp", a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era. The title of the first, "The Diary of a Somebody", is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>", <a href="Benny%20Green%20%28saxophonist%29">Benny Green</a> points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew's book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths' book is superior; it is "affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not". In 1982 came the first appearance of <a href="Sue%20Townsend">Sue Townsend</a>'s teenage creation, <a href="Adrian%20Mole">Adrian Mole</a>, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.

<a href="Keith%20Waterhouse">Keith Waterhouse</a>'s "Mrs Pooter's Diary" of 1983 is an adaptation of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 <a href="Helen%20Fielding">Helen Fielding</a> used the imaginary diary format for "<a href="Bridget%20Jones%27s%20Diary">Bridget Jones's Diary</a>", which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman's life. The "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" critic wrote that it "captures neatly the way modern women teeter between 'I am woman' independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be all things to all men." This diary began as a weekly column in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", and was later published in books which sold more than 15 million copies in 40 countries. In the 1990s the satirical magazine "<a href="Private%20Eye">Private Eye</a>" lampooned <a href="John%20Major">John Major</a>, British prime minister 1990–97, in "The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47", a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with "The Diary of a Nobody", which made much fun of Major's lower-middle class origins.

The social historian James Hammerton defines "Pooterism" as "the dependent weakness and inflated social pretension of white-collar workers, constructed in the workplace but expressed just as powerfully at home". Jon Wilde of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" observes this characteristic in a number of British TV comedy creations of the late 20th and early 21st centuries: <a href="Captain%20Mainwaring">Captain Mainwaring</a>, <a href="Victor%20Meldrew">Victor Meldrew</a>, and "<a href="Peep%20Show%20%28TV%20series%29">Peep Show</a>"s <a href="Mark%20Corrigan%20%28Peep%20Show%29">Mark Corrigan</a> are all examples of characters "whose blinkered view of themselves is forever in sharp contrast to how they are perceived by the world". Charles Pooter, says Hammerton, was a metaphor for lower middle-class pretension, pomposity and self-importance, set up for mockery by the "elites". However, by the mid-20th century changes in the perception of masculine roles in lower middle-class society had stifled the mockery, as men increasingly embraced domesticity. Hammerton remarks that the Grossmiths "would surely appreciate the irony in seeing features of the lower middle-class existence they mocked so mercilessly becoming the more universal model for 20th century family life". Bailey remarks on how the poet <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> presented the Pooters "not as objects of ridicule but of envy, snug and secure in their suburban retreat".

In September 1954 a stage version of the "Diary", by <a href="Basil%20Dean">Basil Dean</a> and Richard Blake, was presented at London's <a href="Arts%20Theatre">Arts Theatre</a> with a cast that included <a href="George%20Benson%20%28actor%29">George Benson</a> and <a href="Dulcie%20Gray">Dulcie Gray</a> as the Pooters and <a href="Leslie%20Phillips">Leslie Phillips</a> as Lupin. Anthony Hartley, writing in "The Spectator", classed this production as "fair-to-middling", with sympathetic performances from the principals: "[I]t is a precondition of this kind of play that everybody concerned should have a heart of gold: only in the case of Mr. Pooter's employer, Mr. Perkupp, do we actually hear the metal chinking." 

In 1986 Waterhouse presented an adaptation of his "Mrs Pooter" text at the <a href="Garrick%20Theatre">Garrick Theatre</a>, with <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a> and <a href="Michael%20Williams%20%28actor%29">Michael Williams</a>. This version was revived in 1993 at the <a href="Greenwich%20Theatre">Greenwich Theatre</a> in a production by <a href="Matthew%20Francis%20%28producer%29">Matthew Francis</a>. <a href="Clive%20Swift">Clive Swift</a> and <a href="Patricia%20Routledge">Patricia Routledge</a> played Charles and Carrie, in what Paul Taylor in "The Independent" described as "essentially a two-hander ... in which all the other folk (including Lupin Pooter, the uppish, worrying son) are either imagined characters or, at times, impersonated by the Pooters". 

In March 2011 the "Diary" was the subject of an even less orthodox production at the <a href="Royal%20%26amp%3B%20Derngate%20Theatre">Royal & Derngate Theatre</a>, Northampton. Adapted by <a href="Hugh%20Osborne">Hugh Osborne</a>, with an all-male cast led by <a href="Robert%20Daws">Robert Daws</a>, this supposes that Pooter has arranged for his diaries to be performed by amateur actors. <a href="Quentin%20Letts">Quentin Letts</a> of the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" found this "an evening of some of the cleverest, fastest entertainment I have seen for months". Lyn Gardner in "The Guardian" found it "a show of some charm – though one that, like Pooter himself, does not quite have the credentials to be quite so pleased with itself". 
In 2014 a production of the "Diary" was staged in London by Rough Haired Pointer at the <a href="White%20Bear%20Theatre">White Bear Theatre</a> and later transferred to the <a href="King%27s%20Head%20Theatre">King's Head Theatre</a>. This production was revived at the King's |head in 2017; Time Out said of it: "It captures the original’s sharp subtext, frivolous wit and heavy irony, while also being very, very silly". 

The first adaptation for screen was <a href="Ken%20Russell">Ken Russell</a>'s short (40 minutes) film for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> film unit in 1964. Russell shot this in the style of the silent films of <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>, with the text narrated in a voice-over. The BBC screened two subsequent adaptations: in 1979 a version dramatised by <a href="Basil%20Boothroyd">Basil Boothroyd</a>, and in 2007 a four-part dramatisation <a href="Andrew%20Davies%20%28writer%29">Andrew Davies</a>, directed by <a href="Susanna%20White">Susanna White</a> and first shown on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> as part of the channel's Edwardian season. "The Guardian"s critic wrote of the latter that <a href="Hugh%20Bonneville">Hugh Bonneville</a> was "immaculate as the ignored kerfuffler [Pooter]."

<a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> (sound radio) has broadcast several dramatisations of the "Diary". These include <a href="Stephen%20Tompkinson">Stephen Tompkinson</a> and <a href="Annette%20Badland">Annette Badland</a> in a 2004 adaptation by Kelvin Segger, and <a href="Johnny%20Vegas">Johnny Vegas</a> and <a href="Katherine%20Parkinson">Katherine Parkinson</a> in Andrew Lynch's 2012 adaptation. In March 2015, <a href="BBC%20Radio%204%20Extra">BBC Radio 4 Extra</a> broadcast an audio version of the 1986 Keith Waterhouse adaptation, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams.

Arthur Gould (rugby union)

Arthur Joseph "Monkey" Gould (10 October 1864 – 2 January 1919) was a Welsh international <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> <a href="Centre%20%28rugby%20union%29">centre</a> and <a href="Fullback%20%28rugby%20union%29">fullback</a> who was most associated as a club player with <a href="Newport%20RFC">Newport Rugby Football Club</a>. He won 27 <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a> for <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a>, 18 as captain, and critics consider him the first superstar of Welsh rugby. A talented all-round player and champion sprinter, Gould could side-step and kick expertly with either foot. He never ceased practising to develop his fitness and skills, and on his death was described as "the most accomplished player of his generation".

Following the withdrawal of their regular fullback, Newport RFC first selected Gould in 1882, when he was 18. He was never dropped from the side thereafter and played regularly until he retired in 1898. Gould played for Newport during their "invincible" season of 1891–92, when they did not lose a match, and scored a record 37 <a href="try">tries</a> in Newport's 24-game 1893–94 season, a club record that still stands. Gould frequently travelled due to his job as a public contractor, and consequently turned out for a number of other sides during his career, including the clubs <a href="Richmond%20F.C.">Richmond</a> and <a href="London%20Welsh%20RFC">London Welsh</a>, and the county side <a href="Middlesex%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Middlesex</a>.

Gould was first selected for Wales in 1885 when he played at fullback against <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a>. He was awarded the captaincy in 1889, by which time he was playing at centre, and led Wales to their first <a href="Six%20Nations%20Championship">Home Nations Championship</a> and <a href="Triple%20Crown%20%28rugby%20union%29">Triple Crown</a> titles in 1893; that tournament's match against England established Gould as a great player and captain. By the time Gould retired he was the most capped Welsh centre, a record he held until 1980, with 25 caps in the position. He ended his international career against England on 9 January 1897. The game, played in front of 17,000 supporters at <a href="Rodney%20Parade">Rodney Parade</a>, was Gould's 18th as Wales captain – a record eventually broken by <a href="Ieuan%20Evans">Ieuan Evans</a> in 1994.

Towards the end of his career, Gould was at the centre of a controversy known as the "Gould affair" that saw Wales withdraw from international rugby for a year. The controversy centred on the support of the <a href="Welsh%20Rugby%20Union">Welsh Football Union</a> (WFU) for a <a href="testimonial">testimonial</a> for Gould on his retirement. The English <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a> and <a href="International%20Rugby%20Board">International Rugby Football Board</a> (IRFB) argued that the testimonial constituted professionalism – which they claimed breached the sport's by-laws. The WFU withdrew from the IRFB in protest, rejoining a year later under the IRFB-imposed condition that Gould would not represent Wales again. He worked as a brewery representative after retiring from rugby, and died of an internal haemorrhage in 1919 at the age of 54.

Arthur Joseph Gould was born into a sporting family in <a href="Newport%2C%20Wales">Newport</a>, <a href="Monmouthshire%20%28historic%29">Monmouthshire</a>, on 10 October 1864 to Joseph and Elizabeth. His father, from <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, England, moved to Newport to find work, setting up his own brass foundry business. Joseph was also an ardent sportsman, playing for the local cricket team.

Gould's five brothers were all notable rugby players and athletes. His brother <a href="Bob%20Gould%20%28rugby%20player%29">Bob</a> was a <a href="Forwards%20%28rugby%20union%29">forward</a> who played 136 times for <a href="Newport%20RFC">Newport Rugby Football Club</a>, whom he captained in the 1886–87 season. Bob was also capped 11 times for Wales between 1882 and 1887, and captained his country once, versus <a href="Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Scotland</a> in 1887. A younger brother, <a href="Bert%20Gould">Bert</a>, was a centre who played three times for Wales – he appeared with Gould in the Welsh team that won the <a href="Triple%20Crown%20%28rugby%20union%29">Triple Crown</a> for the first time in 1893. His other brothers – Harry, Gus and <a href="Wyatt%20Gould">Wyatt</a> – all played rugby for Newport. Wyatt captained Newport in 1905–06, and Harry played for them in their inaugural season of 1875–76. For the first 29 seasons of its existence, Newport RFC always had at least one of the Gould brothers in the team. Wyatt played for the club until 1907; he also ran the 400 m <a href="Hurdling">hurdles</a> for Great Britain in the <a href="1908%20Summer%20Olympics">1908 Summer Olympics</a>.

The young Gould often climbed trees, and thus acquired the childhood nickname "Monkey", which was soon contracted by most to "Monk". Like his brother Wyatt, he was a keen athlete and made £1,000 during his years as a rugby player by entering track and field meets. A county champion sprinter and hurdler, Gould finished third in the <a href="Amateur%20Athletic%20Association">Amateur Athletic Association</a> 120-yard hurdles in 1887 and 1893.

At the age of 14 Gould captained the Newport Junior team, and later played a few games for the Third XV. Gould was drafted into the First XV – the senior team – as a <a href="Fullback%20%28rugby%20union%29">fullback</a> at the age of 18. On 18 November 1882 Newport had a home fixture against Weston-super-Mare at <a href="Rodney%20Parade">Rodney Parade</a>. The Newport groundsman, John Butcher, had been sent by the club to collect the regular fullback who had not appeared for the game. Gould, who was returning from a youth match, saw Butcher outside the missing fullback's home and approached the groundsman to discover that the player was at a funeral. Butcher offered Gould the position instead, and then the groundsman successfully persuaded the club captain to play him. Gould ran in two of his team's three <a href="try">tries</a> after disregarding the instructions of his captain, <a href="Charlie%20Newman">Charlie Newman</a>, who kept shouting for Gould to "Kick, kick!" After this, he was not dropped by Newport until his retirement in 1898.

As rugby was then an exclusively amateur sport, Gould and his brother Bob travelled Britain working as public works contractors. During this time he entered open athletic meets and played for various English rugby teams including the <a href="Trojans%20Rugby%20Club">Southampton Trojans</a>, and from 1887 was a regular member of the London side <a href="Richmond%20F.C.">Richmond</a>. In 1885 Gould was invited to play for the newly formed Welsh exiles team <a href="London%20Welsh%20RFC">London Welsh</a>. <a href="London%20Scottish%20F.C.">London Scottish F.C.</a> had been founded for Scottish players working or studying in the city, but until this time a London club for Welsh players had not existed. The side's first game, a trial match, was played on 21 October 1885 at Putney, and three days later the first team played London Scottish at the <a href="Saracens%20F.C.">Saracens</a>' Palmerston Road ground in Walthamstow. Gould played at half-back, and was joined in the team by <a href="Martyn%20Jordan">Martyn Jordan</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Judson">Thomas Judson</a>, <a href="Rowley%20Thomas">Rowley Thomas</a>, <a href="Charles%20Taylor%20%28rugby%20player%29">Charles Taylor</a> and <a href="T.%20Williams">T. Williams</a> – all past or future Welsh internationals. During the 1885–86 season London Welsh were invited to form a combined "exiles" team with London Scottish, to face a London XV in a charity match at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. Gould was one of six Welsh players selected to play in front of a crowd of 8,000 that included the <a href="Edward%20VII">Prince of Wales</a>.

In the 1885–86 season he was moved up to play as a <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%23Three-quarters">threequarter</a> for Newport. As he was frequently travelling and playing in England between 1885 and 1890, Gould was not a regular member of the team. After playing just a handful games during the three seasons preceding it, in the 1889–90 season he managed 15 games for the club – scoring ten tries and five <a href="Drop%20goal">dropped goals</a>.

In June 1890 Gould left Britain to complete a works contract in the West Indies, but returned to Newport in time for the 1891–92 season. Newport were unbeaten throughout that campaign, which was later dubbed their "invincible" season. Gould captained Newport between 1893–94, when the team lost only three games, and in the 1894–95 season, in which the club lost only to <a href="Llanelli%20RFC">Llanelli</a>. During his first period as captain, 1893–94, Gould scored 37 tries in 24 games, a club record that still stands as of 2013. Although records before 1886 are incomplete, Newport RFC acknowledge Gould's scoring record at the club between the 1882–83 and 1898–99 seasons as 159 tries, 66 conversions, 61 dropped goals and a single penalty, over 231 appearances.

Gould also turned out for the <a href="Middlesex%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Middlesex county</a> side, and was a mainstay during their "invincible" season of 1887–88. He also played for them against the <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20New%20Zealand%20Native%20football%20team">New Zealand Native team</a> in 1888. The match, hosted by the <a href="Henry%20Holroyd%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Sheffield">Earl of Sheffield</a>, was an invitation only event. The Middlesex side won 9–0, and scored three tries in the match, the second one resulting from a smart pass by Gould. In addition to Gould, the Middlesex backline of the time regularly fielded a number of English and Scottish internationals – this earned the side the sarcastic nickname "the Imperial team".

Gould was first capped for Wales against <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a> in the opening game of the <a href="1885%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1885 Home Nations Championship</a>. He joined his brother Bob in the side, and played at fullback, his preferred position at the time. Played under the captaincy of Newport teammate Charlie Newman, this was Wales' eighth-ever international and fourth encounter with England. The Welsh lost by a goal and a try to a goal and four tries. Wing Martyn Jordan of London Welsh scored both Welsh tries, with one successfully <a href="Try%23Conversion">converted</a> into a goal. Some accounts award the conversion to Charles Taylor, though it is now generally credited to Gould. Gould was selected for the second game of the tournament, an away draw to Scotland, in which both teams played a pair of brothers; George and Richard Maitland for Scotland, and Arthur and Bob Gould for Wales.
By 1886 the four threequarter system had spread throughout Wales. First instituted by <a href="Cardiff%20RFC">Cardiff RFC</a> in 1884, the system was designed to allow Cardiff centres <a href="Frank%20Hancock">Frank Hancock</a> and <a href="Tom%20Williams%20%28rugby%20player%2C%20born%201860%29">Tom Williams</a> to play at the same time, and involved dropping the ninth forward to include a second centre. Newport were reluctant to adopt this style of play, mainly due to Gould's excellent kicking and covering abilities, which allowed the club to continue with the advantage of the extra forward.

For the 1885–86 season Gould switched from fullback at Newport to the centre position; this tactic was adopted by Wales and Gould replaced Cardiff's Hancock at centre for their first match of the <a href="1886%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1886 Home Nations Championship</a> against England. The match resulted in a Welsh loss. In Wales' next game, against Scotland, Wales became the first country to trial the four threequarter system. They did this by bringing back Hancock as captain and having him play at centre alongside Gould. The experiment was a tactical disaster – the eight Welsh forwards struggled against the nine Scottish forwards. Hancock duly regrouped the team at half-time and readopted the standard formation, bringing <a href="Harry%20Bowen%20%28rugby%29">Harry Bowen</a> from fullback into the pack, and pushing Gould from centre into Bowen's vacant position. Wales lost by two goals to nil, the system was deemed a failure and Hancock never represented Wales again. The whole affair had a negative effect on Gould, who initially disliked the strategy, stating that he was "prejudiced against the four three-quarters." Gould even went as far as persuading the Welsh selectors to revert to the old formation. The next time Wales trialled the system was in the 1888 encounter with the touring New Zealand Natives, a match in which Gould was unavailable to play.

In the next season, Wales completed their first full Home Nations Championship; Gould played as the lone centre in all three games. It was a fairly successful Championship for the Welsh, with a draw, a win and a loss, leaving them second in the table. Of note during the series was Bob Gould's captaincy in the second match, against Scotland, and Gould's first ever international dropped goal – which gave Wales a win over Ireland and made up for him missing a dropped goal by just a yard in their draw against England. Due to work commitments, Gould only played one of the two Wales games of the <a href="1888%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1888 Home Nations Championship</a>, in the country's first victory over Scotland, thanks to a single try from <a href="Thomas%20Pryce-Jenkins">Thomas Pryce-Jenkins</a>. In the second game, played away to Ireland, <a href="George%20Bowen%20%28rugby%20player%29">George Bowen</a> was given the centre position in the last match Wales would play with a three threequarter system. Gould then missed the first Welsh international against an overseas touring side, when the New Zealand Natives were beaten at <a href="St.%20Helen%27s%20Rugby%20and%20Cricket%20Ground">St. Helen's</a> in Swansea, and was still absent two months later for the opening game of the <a href="1889%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1889 Championship</a>. Gould returned in time for the clash with Ireland where he was given the captaincy and played alongside Llanelli centre <a href="Tom%20Morgan%20%28rugby%20player%29">Tom Morgan</a>. Gould lost his first match as captain, losing by two tries to nil at home – this was the first of 18 caps he earned leading his country.

Gould appeared in Wales' three matches of the <a href="1890%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1890 Home Nations Championship</a> where he partnered <a href="Dickie%20Garrett">Dickie Garrett</a>, a coal tipper who played for <a href="Penarth%20RFC">Penarth</a>, at centre. Gould lost the team captaincy for the first match to <a href="Frank%20Hill%20%28rugby%20player%29">Frank Hill</a>, a game which Wales lost to Scotland 5–1, though Gould did score his first international try. The game is also notable for featuring the first appearance of <a href="Billy%20Bancroft">Billy Bancroft</a>, the Swansea all-round sportsman who would take over the captaincy from Gould on his retirement. Bancroft was fullback in Gould's next 18 international games. Gould regained the captaincy for the next game, an encounter with England at <a href="Crown%20Flatt">Crown Flatt</a> in Dewsbury, and from that point held the captaincy whenever he represented Wales. The encounter was an historic day for Wales, with the country's first win over England, a single try from <a href="William%20Stadden">Buller Stadden</a> giving Wales the victory. The campaign ended in a disappointing away draw with Ireland, which saw the introduction of <a href="Tom%20Graham%20%28rugby%20union%29">Tom Graham</a>, a Newport forward who would become Gould's club captain during the 1891–92 "invincible" season.

Gould missed the entire <a href="1891%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1891 campaign</a> as he and his brother Bob had travelled to the West Indies to conduct civil engineering work. Gould regained his international place and the captaincy on his return for the <a href="1892%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1892 Home Nations Championship</a>. The tournament was a failure for Wales; the team lost all three of their matches. There was little consistency for Gould at centre, with three different centre-pairings in each of the matches; Garrett against England, <a href="Conway%20Rees">Conway Rees</a> at home to Scotland and in the Irish encounter, Gould's younger brother Bert. The 1892 Championship was soured by the aftermath of the Wales–Scotland encounter, which was played in <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a> at St. Helen's. After Wales lost the game 7–2, members of the crowd, angered by Jack Hodgson's refereeing of the game, attacked him. The assailants by-passed the police and the referee had to be rescued by members of the Welsh team. In the struggle, Gould was struck on the chin, and it was reported that Hodgson only reached the Mackworth Hotel because Gould accompanied him on the coach.

The Welsh performance during the <a href="1893%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1893 Home Nations Championship</a> was in stark contrast to the previous year. Under the captaincy of Gould, Wales not only won the Championship for the first time, but also the Triple Crown. The first match of the campaign was against England, and played at the <a href="Cardiff%20Arms%20Park">Cardiff Arms Park</a>. The pitch had been kept from freezing over the night before by 500 <a href="brazier">brazier</a>s dispersed across the playing field. This led to a slippery ground, with play further hampered by a strong wind.

The English played the first half with the wind behind them and their nine-man scrum dominated the smaller Welsh pack. At half time Wales were 7–0 down following tries from <a href="Frederick%20Lohden">Frederick Lohden</a> and <a href="Howard%20Marshall%20%28rugby%20player%29">Howard Marshall</a> and a conversion from England captain <a href="Andrew%20Stoddart">Andrew Stoddart</a>. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in the first half of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward <a href="Charles%20Nicholl">Charles Nicholl</a> broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the halfway line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing <a href="Edwin%20Field">Edwin Field</a> to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing <a href="Norman%20Biggs">Norman Biggs</a> who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed.

The Welsh backs repeatedly exposed the three threequarter system used by the English, as once the Welsh backs broke through the pack there was little defensive-cover to prevent run away scores. With the score at 9–7 to England, Marshall extended the lead with his third try of the match. This gave England an 11–7 lead with only ten minutes remaining. The game swung again when <a href="Percy%20Phillips%20%28rugby%20player%29">Percy Phillips</a> received ball quickly before passing to Gould. Gould broke through the English defence and scored, though again Bancroft missed the conversion. With further Welsh pressure, a <a href="penalty%20%28rugby%29">penalty</a> was awarded to Wales on the English 25-yard line, but at a wide angle. Accounts differ as to what happened; some say that Gould tried to place the ball for Bancroft, but failed on the frozen ground, another states that Bancroft defied his captain to take the penalty as a drop kick, while other accounts mention Bancroft and Gould arguing on the pitch before Bancroft's attempt. Regardless, Bancroft kicked the penalty, the first penalty to be scored in an international match. It was the final score of the game and Wales were victorious, 12–11.

At the final whistle the pitch was invaded by Welsh fans and Gould was carried shoulder-high back to the <a href="Angel%20Hotel%2C%20Cardiff">Angel Hotel</a>, cheered all the way. It was a defining moment for the Welsh style of play. England adopted the four threequarter system the following year.

Gould continued to captain the Wales team through victory over Scotland, with tries coming from Bert Gould, Biggs and <a href="William%20McCutcheon">William McCutcheon</a>; all the result of precision handling from the backs. This left the final encounter with Ireland, played at <a href="Stradey%20Park">Stradey Park</a> in <a href="Llanelli">Llanelli</a>, as the deciding match for a Welsh Triple Crown. Despite an unconvincing Welsh display, an enthusiastic crowd of 20,000 watched their country win the game and with it the title, decided by a single try from Bert Gould.

The <a href="1894%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1894 Championship</a> began with a loss for the defending champions against England, during a game in which Welsh in-fighting affected the result. Before the game, Gould instructed his forwards to heel the ball from the scrums swiftly, so it would get to the backs quickly and allow them to run at the English. Frank Hill decided that this was the wrong option and put all his might into wheeling the scrums instead, which worked against the efforts of <a href="Jim%20Hannan">Jim Hannan</a>, who was trying to follow his captain's wishes. In the next match Gould was partnered by <a href="Dai%20Fitzgerald">Dai Fitzgerald</a> in a win over Scotland, but was unavailable for the encounter with Ireland and was replaced by <a href="Jack%20Elliott%20%28rugby%20player%29">Jack Elliott</a> from Cardiff RFC.

By 1895 the only backs remaining from the 1893 Championship-winning team were Bancroft and Gould. Gould was now partnered with <a href="Owen%20Badger">Owen Badger</a>, who kept his place for the whole campaign. As the other teams adopted the Welsh style of play, Wales lost their advantage; the livelier English forwards outplayed their Welsh counterparts to give England victory in the opening game of the <a href="1895%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1895 Championship</a>. This was followed by a close loss to Scotland at Raeburn Place and then a narrow win over Ireland at the Cardiff Arms Park.

<a href="1896%20Home%20Nations%20Championship">1896</a> was Gould's last full international tournament. The Championship started badly for Wales with a heavy defeat by England, during which Wales were reduced to 14 men after Badger broke his collar-bone in the first 15 minutes. In the second game Wales beat Scotland 6–0, with a try each for Gould and <a href="Cliff%20Bowen">Cliff Bowen</a>. The final game of the Championship was an away loss to Ireland, in which Gould scored his last international points with a dropped goal. At the end of 1896 Gould decided to retire from rugby.

In 1897, Gould was enticed out of retirement for one last Championship. By now Gould was a household name throughout Britain, as much due to his personality and good looks as his brilliant centre play; a testimonial fund had been started with contributions being made by the public. This caused a stir among the other Home Unions, who viewed this as an effort to pay Gould for playing, which would constitute professionalism. As the arguments continued, Gould played his final international game, a solid 11–0 win over England in early January. Wales played no further matches that season after the events behind Gould's testimonial fund caused Wales to leave the <a href="International%20Rugby%20Board">International Rugby Football Board</a> (IRFB), in a situation now referred to as the "Gould affair".

By 1896 Gould had played more first class matches, scored more tries and dropped more goals than any other player on record. This led to "<a href="South%20Wales%20Argus">South Wales Argus</a>" journalist W. J. Townsend Collins, to write in the paper: "... as Arthur Gould is as pre-eminent in football as <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a> is in cricket, the footballing enthusiasts of Wales might recognise his services to the game ... by some national testimonial."

A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, organised a collection fund on the floor of the Cardiff <a href="Coal%20Exchange">Coal Exchange</a> and floated a public <a href="testimonial">testimonial</a> of one <a href="shilling">shilling</a>. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the <a href="Welsh%20Rugby%20Union">Welsh Football Union</a> (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.

By April 1896 the Welsh Football Union had sanctioned a subscription of 1,000 shillings to be contributed to the Gould testimonial. The <a href="Rugby%20Football%20Union">Rugby Football Union</a> (RFU) complained and the IRFB reacted by informing the WFU that only a plate up to the value of a hundred pounds sterling could be given to Gould, and that the remaining funds should be donated to charity; otherwise Wales would lose their international fixtures. The WFU stood down and withdrew their subscription. The reaction in Wales was one of anger, with the people feeling that the WFU had bowed to English pressure, and had been bullied into a decision against the people's wishes.

In a move that was described as an act of hurt pride by social historian David Smith, but also as a manoeuvre to appease the Welsh supporters, in February 1897 the WFU wrote to the IRFB and withdrew their membership. The WFU claimed that they alone had authority over the matter because the IRFB did not have any rules regarding amateurism. The WFU then reinstated their subscription to Gould, and on <a href="Easter%20Monday">Easter Monday</a> 1897 a banquet was arranged at Drill Hall in Newport in Gould's honour. Many civic and sporting worthies were in attendance to witness the WFU president <a href="John%20Talbot%20Dillwyn%20Llewellyn">Sir John Llewellyn</a> present Gould with the title deeds of a gift house. The 250 guests, including <a href="David%20Alfred%20Thomas%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Rhondda">David A. Thomas</a>, were joined by a reed and string orchestra, the band of the Fourth Battalion of the <a href="South%20Wales%20Borderers">South Wales Borderers</a>, and galleries packed by members of the public.

Wales did not field an international team until the IRFB, supported by the RFU, recommended that the WFU be readmitted into the organisation in February 1898. The WFU agreed that they would in future abide by all IRFB by-laws, and that Gould not be allowed to play in any future internationals. Gould accepted the ruling but returned to rugby as a referee and Welsh international selector. The compromise prevented a long term split in the sport, and by 1901 the IRFB added laws to the game banning professionalism to clarify their authority on the issue.

After retiring from rugby, Gould became a brewery representative around Newport. He was still a very popular figure and was followed during his work by fans; his image was still worth money, appearing on merchandise such as cigarette cards and matchboxes.

Gould died in 1919, at the age of 54. Falling ill at work on 2 January, he was rushed home where he died later that day of an internal <a href="Bleeding">haemorrhage</a>. His funeral was reported as the biggest ever seen in Wales up to that time; it was surpassed three decades later by that of the former British Prime Minister <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>. Gould was buried at <a href="St%20Woolos%20Cemetery">St Woolos Cemetery</a>, Newport. In reporting his death, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" stated:
In 1923 a memorial fund was raised in Gould's name, the donations of which were given to the <a href="Royal%20Gwent%20Hospital">Royal Gwent Hospital</a> in Newport. The hospital recognised the gift with the Arthur Gould Memorial Bed, inscribed: "To the memory of Arthur Gould – Greatest of Rugby Football Players". The bed was lost, however, when a portion of the hospital was demolished. Donations for the memorial, which totalled £1,525, were received from all over the world, and several matches were staged to raise funds, including a fixture between Newport and Cardiff.

Gould has been described as the first superstar of his sport by rugby historian Terry Godwin while David Smith in the "Official History of the Welsh Rugby Union" described him as the first player to surpass national recognition, becoming in both meanings of the word "an international". The Welsh Academy's Encyclopedia of Wales, published over 90 years after his death, records Gould as "Welsh rugby's first superstar", while a 1919 obituary described him as "the most accomplished player of his generation". He set several long-standing records for his country, including captaining Wales 18 times, a number eventually surpassed by <a href="Ieuan%20Evans">Ieuan Evans</a> in 1994. Gould played 25 matches at centre for Wales, a record that stood until beaten by Steve Fenwick in 1980. He was also the most capped Welsh player, with 27, at the time of his retirement.

Gould was inducted into the <a href="Welsh%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Welsh Sports Hall of Fame</a> in June 2007; members of Gould's family were in attendance including his granddaughter Mary Hales. When Newport RFC set up their own hall of fame in 2012 the first person inaugurated was Gould. Gould was inducted into the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Rugby Hall of Fame</a> in November 2016.

Albert Pierrepoint

Albert Pierrepoint (; 30 March 1905 – 10 July 1992) was an English <a href="Executioner">hangman</a> who executed between 435 and 600 people in a 25-year career that ended in 1956. His father, <a href="Henry%20Pierrepoint">Henry</a>, and uncle <a href="Thomas%20Pierrepoint">Thomas</a> were official hangmen before him.

Pierrepoint was born in <a href="Clayton%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Clayton</a> in the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>. His family struggled financially because of his father's intermittent employment and heavy drinking. Pierrepoint knew from an early age that he wanted to become a hangman, and was taken on as an assistant executioner in September 1932, aged 27. His first execution was in December that year, alongside his uncle Tom. In October 1941 he undertook his first hanging as lead executioner.

During his tenure he hanged 200 people who had been convicted of <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s in Germany and Austria, as well as several high-profile murderers—including <a href="Gordon%20Cummins">Gordon Cummins</a> (the Blackout Ripper), <a href="John%20Haigh">John Haigh</a> (the Acid Bath Murderer) and <a href="John%20Christie%20%28murderer%29">John Christie</a> (the Rillington Place Strangler). He undertook several contentious executions, including <a href="Timothy%20Evans">Timothy Evans</a>, <a href="Derek%20Bentley">Derek Bentley</a> and <a href="Ruth%20Ellis">Ruth Ellis</a> and executions for <a href="High%20treason%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">high treason</a>—<a href="William%20Joyce">William Joyce</a> (also known as <a href="Lord%20Haw-Haw">Lord Haw-Haw</a>) and <a href="John%20Amery">John Amery</a>—and <a href="Treachery%20Act%201940">treachery</a>, with the hanging of <a href="Theodore%20Schurch">Theodore Schurch</a>.

In 1956 Pierrepoint was involved in a dispute with a <a href="Undersheriff">sheriff</a> over payment, leading to his retirement from hanging. He ran a <a href="pub">pub</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> from the mid-1940s, which he continued to do until the 1960s. He wrote his memoirs in 1974 in which he concluded that <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a> was not a deterrent, although he may have changed his position after that. He approached his task with gravity and said that the execution was "sacred to me". His life has been included in several works of fiction, such as the 2005 film "<a href="Pierrepoint%20%28film%29">Pierrepoint</a>", in which he was portrayed by <a href="Timothy%20Spall">Timothy Spall</a>.

Albert Pierrepoint was born on 30 March 1905 in <a href="Clayton%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Clayton</a> in the <a href="West%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">West Riding of Yorkshire</a>. He was the third of five children and eldest son of <a href="Henry%20Pierrepoint">Henry Pierrepoint</a> and his wife Mary ("" Buxton). Henry had a series of jobs, including butcher's apprentice, clog maker and a carrier in a local mill, but employment was mostly short-term. With intermittent employment, the family often had financial problems, worsened by Henry's heavy drinking. From 1901 Henry had been on the list of official executioners. The role was part-time, with payment made only for individual hangings, rather than an annual stipend or salary, and there was no pension included with the position.

Henry was removed from the list of executioners in July 1910 after arriving drunk at a prison the day before an execution and excessively berating his assistant. Henry's brother <a href="Thomas%20Pierrepoint">Thomas</a> became an official executioner in 1906. Pierrepoint did not find out about his father's former job until 1916, when Henry's memoirs were published in a newspaper. Influenced by his father and uncle, when asked at school to write about what job he would like when older, Pierrepoint said that "When I leave school I should like to be public executioner like my dad is, because it needs a steady man with good hands like my dad and my Uncle Tom and I shall be the same."

In 1917 the Pierrepoint family left <a href="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>, West Riding of Yorkshire, and moved to <a href="Failsworth">Failsworth</a>, near <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. Henry's health declined and he was unable to undertake physical work; as a result, Pierrepoint left school and began work at the local Marlborough Mills. Henry died in 1922 and Pierrepoint received two blue exercise books—in which his father had written his story as a hangman—and Henry's execution diary, which listed details of each hanging in which he had participated. In the 1920s Pierrepoint left the mill and became a <a href="drayman">drayman</a> for a wholesale grocer, delivering goods ordered through a travelling salesman. By 1930 he had learned to drive a car and a lorry to make his deliveries; he later became manager of the business.

On 19 April 1931 Pierrepoint wrote to the <a href="Prison%20Commission%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Prison Commissioners</a> and applied to be an assistant executioner. He was turned down as there were no vacancies, but received an invitation for interview six months later. He was accepted and spent four days training at <a href="HM%20Prison%20Pentonville">Pentonville Prison</a>, London, where a dummy was used for practice. He received his formal acceptance letter as an assistant executioner at the end of September 1932. At that time, the assistant's fee was £1-11-6d per execution, with another £1-11-6d paid two weeks later if his conduct and behaviour were satisfactory. The executioner was chosen by the county <a href="high%20sheriff">high sheriff</a>—or more commonly delegated to the <a href="undersheriff">undersheriff</a>, who selected both the hangman and the assistant. Executioners and their assistants were required to be discreet and the rules for those roles included the clause:

He should clearly understand that his conduct and general behaviour should be respectable, not only at the place and time of the execution, but before and subsequently, that he should avoid attracting public attention in going to or from the prison, and he is prohibited from giving to any person particulars on the subject of his duty for publication.
In late December 1932 Pierrepoint undertook his first execution. His uncle Tom had been contracted by the government of the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> for the hanging of Patrick McDermott, a young Irish farmer who had murdered his brother; Tom was free to select his own assistant as it was outside Britain, and took Pierrepoint with him. They travelled to the <a href="Mountjoy%20Prison">Mountjoy Prison</a>, Dublin for the hanging. It was scheduled for 8:00 am, and took less than a minute to perform. Pierrepoint's job as assistant was to follow the prisoner onto the <a href="Gallows">scaffold</a>, bind the prisoner's legs together, then step back off the trapdoor before the lead executioner sprung the mechanism.

For the remainder of the 1930s Pierrepoint worked in the grocery business and as an assistant executioner. Most of his commissions were with his uncle Tom, from whom Pierrepoint learned much. He was particularly impressed with his uncle's approach and demeanour, which were dignified and discreet; he also followed Tom's advice "if you can't do it without whisky, don't do it at all."

In July 1940 Pierrepoint was the assistant at the execution of <a href="Udham%20Singh">Udham Singh</a>, a <a href="Punjabis">Punjabi</a> refugee who had been convicted of shooting the colonial administrator <a href="Michael%20O%27Dwyer">Sir Michael O'Dwyer</a>. The day before the execution, <a href="Stanley%20Cross%20%28executioner%29">Stanley Cross</a>, the newly promoted lead executioner, became confused with his calculations of the drop length, and Pierrepoint stepped in to advise on the correct measurements; Pierrepoint was added to the list of head executioners soon after.

In October 1941 Pierrepoint undertook his first execution as lead executioner when he hanged the gangland killer Antonio "Babe" Mancini. He followed the routine as established by <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> guidelines, and as followed by his predecessors. He and his assistant arrived the day before the execution, where he was told the height and weight of the prisoner; he viewed the condemned man through the "Judas hole" in the door to judge his build. Pierrepoint then went to the execution room—normally next to the condemned cell—where he tested the equipment using a sack that weighed about the same as the prisoner; he calculated the length of the drop using the Home Office Table of Drops, making allowances for the man's physique, if necessary. He left the weighted sack hanging on the rope to ensure the rope was stretched and it would be re-adjusted in the morning if necessary.
On the day of the execution, the practice was for Pierrepoint, his assistant and two prison officers to enter the condemned man's cell at 8:00 am. Pierrepoint secured the man's arms behind his back with a leather strap, and all five walked through a second door, which led to the execution chamber. The prisoner was walked to a marked spot on the trapdoor whereupon Pierrepoint placed a white hood over the prisoner's head and a noose around his neck. The metal eye through which the rope was looped was placed under the left jawbone which, when the prisoner dropped, forced the head back and broke the spine. Pierrepoint pulled a large lever, releasing the trapdoor. From entering the condemned man's cell to opening the trapdoor took him a maximum of 12 seconds. The neck was broken in almost exactly the same position in each hanging—the <a href="Hangman%27s%20fracture">Hangman's fracture</a>.

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> Pierrepoint hanged 15 German spies, as well as US servicemen found guilty by <a href="courts%20martial">courts martial</a> of committing crimes in England. In December 1941, he executed the German spy <a href="Karel%20Richard%20Richter">Karel Richter</a> at <a href="HM%20Prison%20Wandsworth">Wandsworth prison</a>. When Pierrepoint entered the condemned man's cell for the hanging, Richter stood up, threw aside one of the guards and charged headfirst at the stone wall. Stunned momentarily, he rose and shook his head. After Richter struggled with the guards, Pierrepoint managed to get the leather strap around Richter's wrists. He burst the leather strap from eye-hole to eye-hole and was free again. After another struggle, the strap was wrapped tightly around his wrists. He was brought to the scaffold where a strap was wrapped around his ankles, followed by a cap and noose. Just as Pierrepoint pushed the lever, Richter jumped up with bound feet. As Richter plummeted through the trapdoor, Pierrepoint could see that the noose had slipped, but it became stuck under Richter's nose. Despite the unusual position of the noose, the prison medical officer determined that it was an instantaneous, clean death. Writing about the execution in his memoirs, Pierrepoint called it "my toughest session on the scaffold during all my career as an executioner". The broken strap was given to Pierrepoint as a souvenir; he used it occasionally for what he thought were meaningful executions.

In August 1943 Pierrepoint married Anne Fletcher after a courtship of five years. He did not tell her about his role of executioner until a few weeks after the nuptials, when he was flown to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> to hang two saboteurs; on his return he explained the reason for his absence and she accepted it, saying that she had known about his second job all along, after hearing gossip locally.
In late 1945, following the liberation of the <a href="Bergen-Belsen%20concentration%20camp">Bergen-Belsen concentration camp</a> and <a href="Belsen%20trial">the subsequent trial</a> of the camp's officials and functionaries, Pierrepoint was sent to <a href="Hamelin">Hamelin</a>, Germany to carry out the executions of eleven of those sentenced to death, plus two other German <a href="war%20criminals">war criminals</a> convicted of murdering an <a href="RAF">RAF</a> pilot in the Netherlands in March 1945. He disliked any publicity connected to his role and was unhappy that his name had been announced to the press by General <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Sir Bernard Montgomery</a>. When he flew to Germany, he was followed across the airfield by the press, which he described as being "as unwelcome as a lynch mob". He was given the honorary military rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">lieutenant colonel</a> and, on 13 December, he first executed the women individually, then the men two at a time. Pierrepoint travelled several times to Hamelin, and between December 1948 and October 1949 he executed 226 people, often over 10 a day, and on several occasions groups of up to 17 over 2 days.
Six days after the Belsen hangings in December 1945, Pierrepoint hanged <a href="John%20Amery">John Amery</a> at Wandsworth prison. Amery, the eldest son of the cabinet minister <a href="Leo%20Amery">Leo Amery</a>, was a Nazi sympathiser who had visited <a href="prisoner-of-war%20camp">prisoner-of-war camp</a>s in Germany to recruit allied prisoners for the <a href="British%20Free%20Corps">British Free Corps</a>; he had also broadcast to Britain to encourage men to join the Nazis. He was found guilty of treason. On 3 January 1946 Pierrepoint hanged <a href="William%20Joyce">William Joyce</a>, also known as <a href="Lord%20Haw-Haw">Lord Haw-Haw</a>, who had been given the death sentence for <a href="High%20treason%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">high treason</a>, although it was questionable if he were a British citizen, and therefore subject to the charge. The following day Pierrepoint hanged Theodore Schurch, a British soldier who had been found guilty under the <a href="Treachery%20Act%201940">Treachery Act 1940</a>. Joyce was the last person to be executed in Britain for treason; the death penalty for treason was abolished with the introduction of the <a href="Crime%20and%20Disorder%20Act%201998">Crime and Disorder Act 1998</a>. Schurch was the last person to be hanged in Britain for treachery, and the last to be hanged for any offence other than murder.

In September 1946 Pierrepoint travelled to <a href="Graz">Graz</a>, Austria, to train staff at <a href="Graz-Karlau%20Prison">Karlau Prison</a> in the British form of long-drop hanging. Previously, the Austrians had used a shorter drop, leaving the executed men to choke to death, rather than the faster long-drop kill. He undertook four double executions of prisoners, with his trainees acting as assistants. Despite Pierrepoint's expertise as an executioner and his experience with hanging the German war criminals at Hamelin, he was not selected as the hangman to carry out the sentences handed down at the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg trials</a>; the job went to an American, <a href="Master%20sergeant%23United%20States">Master sergeant</a> <a href="John%20C.%20Woods">John C. Woods</a>, who was relatively inexperienced. The press was invited to observe the process, and pictures were later circulated which suggested the hangings had been poorly done. <a href="Wilhelm%20Keitel">Wilhelm Keitel</a> took 20 minutes to die after the trapdoor opened; the trap was not wide enough, so that some of the men hit the edges as they fell—more than one person's nose was torn off in the process—and others were strangled, rather than having their necks broken.

After the war, Pierrepoint left the delivery business, and took over the lease of a pub, the Help the Poor Struggler on Manchester Road, in the <a href="Hollinwood%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Hollinwood</a> area of Oldham. In the 1950s he left the pub and took a lease of the larger Rose and Crown at <a href="Much%20Hoole">Much Hoole</a> near <a href="Preston%2C%20Lancashire">Preston, Lancashire</a>. He later said that he changed his main occupation because:

I wanted to run my own business so that I should be under no obligation when I took time off. ... I could take a three o'clock plane from Dublin after conducting an execution there and be opening my bar without comment at half past five.
In 1948 Parliament debated a new Criminal Justice Bill, which raised the question of whether to continue with the death penalty or not. While the debates were proceeding, no executions took place, and Pierrepoint worked solely in his pub. When the bill failed in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, hangings resumed after a nine-month gap. The following year, the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="Chuter%20Ede">Chuter Ede</a>, set up a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> to look into capital punishment in the UK. Pierrepoint gave evidence in November 1950 and included a mock hanging at Wandsworth prison for the commission members. <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Capital%20Punishment%20report%20%281953%29">The commission's report</a> was published in 1953 and resulted in the <a href="Homicide%20Act%201957">Homicide Act 1957</a> which reduced the grounds for execution by differentiating between capital and non-capital charges for homicide.

From the late 1940s and into the 1950s Pierrepoint, Britain's most experienced executioner, carried out several more hangings, including those of prisoners described by his biographer, Brian Bailey, as "the most notorious murderers of the period ... [and] three of the most controversial executions in the latter years of the death penalty." In August 1949 he hanged <a href="John%20Haigh">John Haigh</a>, nicknamed "the Acid Bath Murderer", as he had dissolved the bodies of his victims in <a href="sulphuric%20acid">sulphuric acid</a>; Haigh admitted to nine murders, and tried to avoid hanging by saying he drank the blood of his victims and <a href="Insanity%20defense">claiming insanity</a>. The following year Pierrepoint hanged <a href="James%20Corbitt">James Corbitt</a>, one of the regular customers at Pierrepoint's pub; the two had sung duets together and while Pierrepoint called Corbitt "Tish", Corbitt returned the nickname "Tosh". In his autobiography, Pierrepoint considered the matter:

As I polished the glasses, I thought if any man had a deterrent to murder poised before him, it was this troubadour whom I called Tish, coming to terms with his obsessions in the singing room of Help The Poor Struggler. He was not only aware of the rope, he had the man who handled it beside him, singing a duet. ... The deterrent did not work. He killed the thing he loved.

In March 1950 Pierrepoint hanged <a href="Timothy%20Evans">Timothy Evans</a>, a 25-year-old man who had the vocabulary of a 14-year-old and the mental age of a ten-year-old. Evans was arrested for the murder of his wife and daughter at their home, the top floor flat of 10 Rillington Place, London. His statements to the police were contradictory, telling them that he killed her, and also that he was innocent. He was tried and convicted for the murder of his daughter. Three years later Evans's landlord, <a href="John%20Christie%20%28murderer%29">John Christie</a>, was arrested for the murder of several women, whose bodies he hid in the house. He subsequently admitted to the murder of Evans's wife, but not the daughter. Pierrepoint hanged him in July 1953 in Pentonville Prison, but the case showed Evans's conviction and hanging had been a <a href="miscarriage%20of%20justice">miscarriage of justice</a>. The matter led to further questions on the use of the death penalty in Britain.

In the months before he hanged Christie, Pierrepoint undertook another controversial execution, that of <a href="Derek%20Bentley">Derek Bentley</a>, a 19-year-old man who had been an accomplice of Christopher Craig, a 16-year-old boy who shot and killed a policeman. Bentley was described in his trial as:

a youth of low intelligence, shown by testing to be just above the level of a feeble-minded person, illiterate, unable to read or write, and when tested in a way which did not involve scholastic knowledge shown to have a mental age between 11 and 12 years.
At the time the policeman was shot, Bentley had been under arrest for 15 minutes, and the words he said to Craig—"Let him have it, Chris"—could either have been taken for an incitement to shoot, or for Craig to hand his gun over (one policeman had asked him to hand the gun over just beforehand). Bentley was found guilty by the <a href="English%20law">English law</a> principle of <a href="Common%20purpose">joint enterprise</a>.

Pierrepoint hanged <a href="Ruth%20Ellis">Ruth Ellis</a> for murder in July 1955. Ellis was in an abusive relationship with David Blakely, a racing driver; she shot him four times after what her biographer, Jane Dunn, calls "three days of sleeplessness, panic, and pathological jealousy, fuelled by quantities of Pernod and a reckless consumption of tranquillizers". The case attracted great interest from the press and public. The matter was discussed in <a href="Cabinet%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Cabinet</a> and a petition of 50,000 signatures was sent to the Home Secretary, <a href="Gwilym%20Lloyd%20George">Gwilym Lloyd George</a>, to ask for a reprieve; he refused to grant one. Ellis was the last woman to be hanged in Britain. Two weeks after Ellis's execution, Pierrepoint hanged Norman Green, who had confessed to killing two boys in his home town of <a href="Wigan">Wigan</a>; it was Pierrepoint's last execution.

In early January 1956 Pierrepoint travelled to Manchester for another execution and paid for staff to cover the bar in his absence. He spent the afternoon in the prison calculating the drop and setting up the rope to the right length. That evening the prisoner was given a reprieve. Pierrepoint left the prison and, because of heavy snow, stayed overnight in a local hotel. Two weeks later he received from the instructing <a href="Undersheriff">sheriff</a> a cheque for his travelling expenses, but not his execution fee. He wrote to the Prison Commissioners to point out that he had received a full fee in other cases of reprieve, and that he had spent additional money in employing bar staff. The Commissioners advised he speak to the instructing sheriff, as it was his responsibility, not theirs; they also reminded him that his conditions of employment were that he was paid only for the execution, not in the case of a reprieve. Shortly afterwards he received a letter from the sheriff offering £4 as a compromise. On 23 February he replied to the Prison Commissioners and informed them that he was resigning with immediate effect, and requested that his name be taken from the list of executioners.

There were soon rumours in the press that his resignation was connected with the hanging of Ellis. In his autobiography he denied this was the case:

At the execution of Ruth Ellis no untoward incident happened which in any way appalled me or anyone else, and the execution had absolutely no connection with my resignation seven months later. Nor did I leave the list, as one newspaper said, by being arbitrarily taken off it, to shut my mouth, because I was about to reveal the last words of Ruth Ellis. She never spoke.

Pierrepoint's autobiography does not give any reasons for his resignation—he states that the Prison Commissioners asked him to keep the details private. The Home Office contacted the Sheriff of Lancashire, who paid Pierrepoint the full fee of £15 for his services, but he was adamant that he was still retiring. He had received an offer for £30,000 to £40,000 from the "<a href="Empire%20News">Empire News and Sunday Chronicle</a>" to publish weekly stories about his experiences. The Home Office considered prosecuting him under the <a href="Official%20Secrets%20Act%201939">Official Secrets Act 1939</a>, but when two of the stories appeared that contained information that contradicted the recollections of other witnesses, they did not do so. Instead pressure was put on the publishers, who stopped the stories.
Pierrepoint and his wife ran their pub until they retired to the seaside town of <a href="Southport">Southport</a> in the 1960s. In 1974 he published his autobiography, "Executioner: Pierrepoint". He died on 10 July 1992, aged 87, in the nursing home where he had lived for the last four years of his life.

In his 1974 autobiography, Pierrepoint changed his view on <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a>, and wrote that hanging:

... is said to be a deterrent. I cannot agree. There have been murders since the beginning of time, and we shall go on looking for deterrents until the end of time. If death were a deterrent, I might be expected to know. It is I who have faced them last, young lads and girls, working men, grandmothers. I have been amazed to see the courage with which they take that walk into the unknown. It did not deter them then, and it had not deterred them when they committed what they were convicted for. All the men and women whom I have faced at that final moment convince me that in what I have done I have not prevented a single murder.

In a 1976 interview with <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Merseyside">BBC Radio Merseyside</a>, Pierrepoint expressed his uncertainty towards the sentiments, and said that when the autobiography was originally written, "there was not a lot of crime. Not like there is today. I am now honestly on a balance and I don’t know which way to think because it changes every day." Pierrepoint's position as an opponent of capital punishment was questioned by his long-time former assistant, <a href="Syd%20Dernley">Syd Dernley</a>, in his 1989 autobiography, "The Hangman's Tale":

Even the great Pierrepoint developed some strange ideas in the end. I do not think I will ever get over the shock of reading in his autobiography, many years ago, that like the Victorian executioner <a href="James%20Berry%20%28executioner%29">James Berry</a> before him, he had turned against capital punishment and now believed that none of the executions he had carried out had achieved anything! This from the man who proudly told me that he had done more jobs than any other executioner in English history. I just could not believe it. When you have hanged more than 680 people, it's a hell of a time to find out you do not believe capital punishment achieves anything!

Pierrepoint described his approach to hanging in his autobiography. He did so in what Lizzie Seal, a <a href="Reader%20%28academic%20rank%29">reader</a> in <a href="Criminology">Criminology</a>, calls "quasi-religious language", including the phrase that a "higher power" selected him as an executioner. When asked by the Royal Commission about his role, he replied that "It is sacred to me". In his autobiography, Pierrepoint describes his ethos thus:

I have gone on record ... as saying that my job is sacred to me. That sanctity must be most apparent at the hour of death. A condemned prisoner is entrusted to me, after decisions have been made which I cannot alter. He is a man, she is a woman, who, the church says, still merits some mercy. The supreme mercy I can extend to them is to give them and sustain in them their dignity in dying and death. The gentleness must remain.

Brian Bailey highlights Pierrepoint's phrasing relating to hangings; the autobiography reads "I had to hang Derek Bentley", "I had to execute John Christie" and "I had to execute Mrs Louisa Merrifield". Bailey comments that Pierrepoint "never had to hang anybody".

The exact number of people executed by Pierrepoint has never been established. Bailey, in the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", and Leonora Klein, one of his biographers, state it was over 400; Steven Fielding, another biographer, puts the figure at 435—based on the Prison Execution Books held at <a href="The%20National%20Archives%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The National Archives</a>; the obituarists of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" put the figure at 17 women and 433 men. "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>" puts the figure at 530 people, "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" considers the figure to be 530 men and 20 women, while the BBC states it is "up to 600" people.

In addition to his 1974 autobiography, Pierrepoint has been the subject of several biographies, either focusing on him, or alongside other executioners. These include "Pierrepoint: A Family of Executioners" by Fielding, published in 2006, and Leonora Klein's 2006 book "A Very English Hangman: The Life and Times of Albert Pierrepoint". There have been several television and radio documentaries about or including Pierrepoint, and he has been portrayed on stage and screen, and in literature.

On Pierrepoint's resignation, two assistant executioners were promoted to lead executioner: <a href="Robert%20Leslie%20Stewart">Jock Stewart</a> and <a href="Harry%20Allen%20%28executioner%29">Harry Allen</a>. Over the next seven years they carried out the remaining thirty-four executions in the UK. On 13 August 1964 Allen hanged Gwynne Evans at <a href="HM%20Prison%20Manchester">Strangeways Prison</a> in Manchester for the <a href="murder%20of%20John%20Alan%20West">murder of John Alan West</a>; at the same time, Stewart hanged Evans's accomplice, Peter Allen, at <a href="HM%20Prison%20Liverpool">Walton Gaol</a> in Liverpool. They were the last hangings in English legal history. The following year the <a href="Murder%20%28Abolition%20of%20Death%20Penalty%29%20Act%201965">Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965</a> was passed, which imposed a five-year moratorium on executions. The temporary ban was made permanent on 18 December 1969.

Jarrow March

The Jarrow March of 5 – 31 October 1936, also known as the Jarrow Crusade, was an organised protest against the unemployment and poverty suffered in the English <a href="Tyneside">Tyneside</a> town of <a href="Jarrow">Jarrow</a> during the 1930s. Around 200 men (or "Crusaders" as they preferred to be referred to) marched from Jarrow to London, carrying a petition to the British government requesting the re-establishment of industry in the town following the closure in 1934 of its main employer, <a href="Palmers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Iron%20Company">Palmer's shipyard</a>. The petition was received by the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> but not debated, and the march produced few immediate results. The Jarrovians went home believing that they had failed.

Jarrow had been a settlement since at least the 8th century. In the early 19th century, a coal industry developed before the establishment of the shipyard in 1851. Over the following 80 years more than 1,000 ships were launched in Jarrow. In the 1920s, a combination of mismanagement and changed world trade conditions following the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> brought a decline which led eventually to the yard's closure. Plans for its replacement by a modern steelworks plant were frustrated by opposition from the <a href="British%20Iron%20and%20Steel%20Federation">British Iron and Steel Federation</a>, an employers' organisation with its own plans for the industry. The failure of the steelworks plan, and the lack of any prospect of large-scale employment in the town, were the final factors that led to the decision to march.

Marches of the unemployed to London, termed "<a href="hunger%20marches">hunger marches</a>", had taken place since the early 1920s, mainly organised by the <a href="National%20Unemployed%20Workers%27%20Movement">National Unemployed Workers' Movement</a> (NUWM), a <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">communist</a>-led body. For fear of being associated with communist agitation, the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> and <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">Trades Union Congress</a> (TUC) leaderships stood aloof from these marches. They exercised the same policy of detachment towards the Jarrow March, which was organised by the borough council with the support of all sections of the town but without any connection with the NUWM. During their journey the Jarrow marchers received sustenance and hospitality from local branches of all the main political parties, and were given a broad public welcome on their arrival in London.

Despite the initial sense of failure among the marchers, in subsequent years, the Jarrow March became recognised by historians as a defining event of the 1930s. It helped to foster the change in attitudes which prepared the way to social reform measures after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, which their proponents thought would improve working conditions. The town holds numerous memorials to the march. Re-enactments celebrated the 50th and 75th anniversaries, in both cases invoking the "spirit of Jarrow" in their campaigns against unemployment. In contrast to the Labour Party's coldness in 1936, the post-war party leadership adopted the march as a metaphor for governmental callousness and working-class fortitude.

In the period immediately after the end of the First World War, Britain's economy enjoyed a brief boom. Businesses rushed to replenish stocks and re-establish peacetime conditions of trade, and while prices rose rapidly, wages rose faster and unemployment was negligible. By April 1920 this boom had given way to Britain's first post-war slump, which ushered in an era of high unemployment. Britain's adoption of generally deflationary economic policies, including a return to the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> in 1925, helped to ensure that the percentage of the workforce without jobs remained at around 10% for the rest of the 1920s and beyond, well above the normal pre-war levels. During the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">world recession</a> that began in 1929 and lasted until 1932, the percentage of unemployed peaked at 22%, representing more than 3 million workers.

Unemployment was particularly heavy in Britain's traditional staple export industries—coal mining, shipbuilding, iron and steel and textiles—all of which were in a slow decline from their Victorian heyday. Because of the concentration of these industries in the north of England, in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> and in <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, the percentage of unemployed persons in these regions was significantly higher, sometimes more than double, than in the south throughout the interwar period. The decline of these industries helped to create pockets of long-term unemployment outside the normal <a href="Boom%20and%20bust">cyclical variations</a>; some workers had no work for years.

In 1921, in reaction to the rising levels of unemployment, the newly formed <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">British Communist Party</a> set up the <a href="National%20Unemployed%20Workers%27%20Movement">National Unemployed Workers' Movement</a> (NUWM). From 1922 until the late 1930s, under its charismatic leader <a href="Wal%20Hannington">Wal Hannington</a>, the NUWM organised regular marches in which unemployed workers converged on London to confront Parliament, in the belief that this would improve conditions. These became known as "<a href="hunger%20marches">hunger marches</a>", reviving a name coined by the press in 1908, when a group of London's unemployed marched to <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>.

The 1922 marchers sought a meeting with the new prime minister, <a href="Bonar%20Law">Bonar Law</a>, who refused to see them because of their undemocratic leadership. The march leaders were denounced in "The Times" as "avowed Communists ... who have been identified with disturbances in their own localities". The <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> and the <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">TUC</a> kept aloof, fearful of being tainted by association with the communist organisers. The same pattern was followed with subsequent NUWM marches; successive prime ministers—<a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a> in 1929, <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald">Ramsay MacDonald</a> in 1930 and 1934—declined to meet the marchers' representatives, and the Labour Party and the TUC continued to keep their distance. In 1931 MacDonald became head of a <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a>-dominated <a href="First%20National%20ministry">National Government</a> that imposed a <a href="means%20test">means test</a> on unemployment benefits. Anger at the means test was the rationale for the <a href="National%20Hunger%20March%2C%201932">1932 hunger march</a>, in which a series of rallies and demonstrations across London broke out into considerable violence; the leaders provoked clashes with opponents and police in Hyde Park, <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> and <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> which led to the arrest and imprisonment of the march's leaders. Although women were not allowed to march on the Jarrow march, women's contingents were present at other hunger marches across the 1930s. These women, who were often the wives of unemployed men, were often faced with restrictions, such as being forced to stay in <a href="workhouse">workhouses</a> if the local Labour Party would not accommodate them. 

Two additional national marches were held in 1934 and 1936. By this time the country had made a substantial recovery from the worst depression years of 1929–32. Unemployment was significantly down, annual growth was averaging 4%, and many parts of the country were enjoying a substantial boom in housing and consumer goods. The increasing prosperity was not, however, uniformly spread, and there were sharp contrasts between economic conditions in the south and those in the north-east, South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere, where the rate of recovery was much slower. At the same time, the national mood was changing; external factors such as the rise of <a href="fascism">fascism</a> in Europe helped to unify the British left, and there were more supportive voices in parliament on behalf of the unemployed. The idea of marching as a means of expressing political or social grievances had by now become an accepted and well-established tactic, and there was a growing awareness of the problems complained of, which counterbalanced their exploitation by the Communists. The historian <a href="A.%20J.%20P.%20Taylor">A. J. P. Taylor</a> considered that the hunger marchers had "displayed the failure of capitalism in a way that mere figures or literary description could not. Middle-class people felt the call of conscience".

<a href="Jarrow">Jarrow</a>, situated on the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a> in <a href="County%20Durham">County Durham</a>, northern England, entered British history in the 8th century, as the home of <a href="Bede">Bede</a>, the early Christian monk and scholar. After Bede, little changed in the remote rural community for a thousand years, although his monastery was <a href="Dissolution%20of%20the%20monasteries">dissolved</a> under <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a> in the 16th century. The discovery of coal in the 17th century led to major changes. Mining on an industrial scale began in the early 1800s, resulting in the population of Jarrow more than doubling between 1801 and 1821 to around 3,500, largely from the influx of mineworkers.

The town's years as a coalfield were unhappy. Living conditions in many of the hastily erected cottages were insanitary, lacking water and drainage. There was a serious outbreak of <a href="cholera">cholera</a> in Jarrow and northeast England in the winter of 1831–32, as part of an epidemic that spread from Europe and resulted in more than 200 deaths in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a> alone. Relations in Jarrow between employer and employee were poor; workers were held by the "bond" system whereby they were tied to a particular employer for a year, whether or not that employer could provide work. Working conditions in the mines were dangerous: there were explosions in 1826, 1828 and 1845, each with large loss of life. Attempts by workers to organise into a trade union were fiercely opposed by the employers. Nevertheless, miners conducted lengthy strikes in 1832 and 1844, each ending when hunger forced them back to work. After the easier seams of coal were exhausted, the Jarrow pits became less profitable, and in 1851 the owners abandoned them altogether.

Jarrow began its development as a shipbuilding town with the establishment in 1851 of <a href="Palmers%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Iron%20Company">Palmer's shipyard</a> on the banks of the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a>. The first ship from the yard was launched in 1852, an iron-built and steam-powered <a href="Collier%20%28ship%29">collier</a>; many more such carriers followed. In 1856 the yard began building warships, and was soon supplying many of the world's navies. With its associated iron and steel works, it became the largest shipbuilding centre in the country, employing thousands of men. Jarrow's population, at around 3,800 in 1850, had increased nearly tenfold to 35,000 by 1891. Palmer's was central to Jarrow's economy, both for the numbers employed there and for the ancillary businesses that served the needs of both the yard and town.

The shipyard generated high employment to Jarrow, but the industrial works created a harsh environment. <a href="Ellen%20Wilkinson">Ellen Wilkinson</a>, the town's historian and member of parliament from 1935 to 1947, quotes a newspaper source from 1858: "There is a prevailing blackness about the neighbourhood. The houses are black, the ships are black, the sky is black, and if you go there for an hour or two, reader, you will be black". According to Wilkinson, the yard's founder, <a href="Sir%20Charles%20Palmer%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Charles Palmer</a>, "regarded it as no part of his duty to see that the conditions under which his workers had to live were either sanitary or tolerable".

In the 1890s, Britain held a near monopoly of the world's shipbuilding, with a share of around 80%. This proportion fell during the early years of the 20th century to about 60%, as other countries increased their production. Palmer's remained busy, and during the years of the First World War built many of Britain's warships: the battleship , the light cruiser , and numerous smaller vessels were all built in Jarrow. During the brief postwar boom of 1919–20, orders remained plentiful and Palmer's prospered. However, the firm's management had not anticipated the conditions that developed in the 1920s when, as Wilkinson says, "every industrial country that had bought ships from Britain was now building for itself". The firm made over-optimistic assessments of future demand, and invested accordingly. The anticipated demand did not materialise; by the mid-1920s, Palmer's was incurring heavy losses, and was close to bankruptcy. It was temporarily reprieved by a short-lived boom in 1929, when orders rose and the town briefly enjoyed the prospect of an economic recovery.

On 24 July 1930 Palmer's launched its thousandth ship, the tanker "Peter Hurll", but by this time the brief shipbuilding boom had been ended by the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Great Depression</a>, and there were no new orders on the firm's books. Rumours of impending reorganisation and rationalisation in the industry gave the workforce cause for anxiety, which deepened with the formation in 1930 of National Shipbuilders Security Ltd (NSS). This was a company created by the government to assist shipbuilders by acquiring failing yards and dismantling them, so that production was concentrated within a smaller number of profitable yards. To ensure this rationalisation was sustained, the closed yards were banned from any shipbuilding activity for at least 40 years.

During 1931, NSS was busy closing shipyards elsewhere in the country, while an order from the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> for two destroyers kept Palmer's working until mid-1932. The second of these ships, , was the last ship launched from the yard, on 19 July 1932. By this time, Palmer's was insolvent, but retained a faint hope of further naval contracts. These failed to materialise, and in June 1933 the firm's creditors appointed a receiver. By December 1933 rumours of NSS interest in the yard were appearing in the press, and in the House of Commons <a href="Walter%20Runciman%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Runciman%20of%20Doxford">Walter Runciman</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Board%20of%20Trade">President of the Board of Trade</a>, told members: "There is nothing to be gained by giving Jarrow the impression that Palmer's can be revived". He continued: "Would it not be very much better to make a clean sweep of that as a shipyard, and throw open to the world for sale what is one of the finest and most convenient sites anywhere in Europe?" Despite efforts by management and workers to find an alternative solution, in the early summer of 1934 NSS acquired the yard, closed it, and began to dismantle its plant. Blythe wrote: "The only sound to compete with the unfamiliar noise of the marsh birds ... was the ring of the breakers' hammers."

Following the Palmer's closure, a small hope of relief and some industrial resurrection was offered by the industrialist <a href="Sir%20John%20Jarvis%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Jarvis</a>, who held the ceremonial office of <a href="High%20Sheriff%20of%20Surrey">High Sheriff of Surrey</a>. He was the prospective Conservative candidate for <a href="Guildford%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Guildford</a>. On 4 October 1934, Jarvis announced the "adoption" of Jarrow by the county of Surrey, and promised to bring new industries to the town; he mentioned ship-breaking, bottle manufacture and furniture-making. While acknowledging the generous principle behind Jarvis's scheme, Betty Vernon (biographer of Jarrow politician Ellen Wilkinson) described it as ultimately superficial, offering little more than patchwork assistance. Blythe observes: "This excellent man failed, as anyone must fail who tries to play the good squire to a town of nearly forty thousand people".

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201931">1931 general election</a>, in the nationwide rout of Labour, the <a href="Jarrow%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Jarrow constituency</a> was won by the National Government's candidate, <a href="William%20George%20Pearson">William Pearson</a>, a Conservative borough councillor and former mayor. In 1932, when the mood in Jarrow was desperate—"a workhouse without walls" according to one commentator—the local Labour Party selected <a href="Ellen%20Wilkinson">Ellen Wilkinson</a> as its parliamentary candidate for the next general election. Wilkinson had helped to found the British Communist Party in 1920, and had a firebrand reputation. She had been associated with Hannington and the NUWM in the early 1920s, but had left the Communist Party in 1923 and had served as Labour MP for <a href="Middlesbrough%20East%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Middlesbrough East</a> between 1924 and 1931.

Wilkinson felt a deep bond of sympathy with the people of Jarrow and the loss of the shipyard which was the life-source of the town. Early in 1934 she led a deputation of Jarrow's unemployed to meet the prime minister, MacDonald, in his nearby <a href="Seaham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Seaham</a> constituency. She records that at the end of the meeting MacDonald said to her: "Ellen, why don't you go out and preach socialism, which is the only remedy for all this?" This "priceless remark", she says, brought home the "reality and sham ... of that warm but so easy sympathy". She became Jarrow's MP in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201935">general election of November 1935</a>, when she won the seat with a majority of 2,360. In the opening debate of the new parliamentary session, on 9 December 1935, she pleaded on behalf of her new constituents: "These are skilled fitters, men who have built destroyers and battleships and the finest passenger ships ... The years go on and nothing is done ... this is a desperately urgent matter and something should be done to get work to these areas which, Heaven knows, want work."

While Jarvis's palliative measures were being developed, a more substantial project to bring industry back to Jarrow was under consideration. An American entrepreneur, T. Vosper Salt, became aware of the impending sale and break-up of Palmer's yard. He was convinced that the world demand for steel was about to rise, and thought that the site, with its ready-made docking and rail facilities, would be ideal for a new, modern steelworks. In January 1934, when an initial feasibility study report had proved favourable, Salt began discussions with the <a href="British%20Iron%20and%20Steel%20Federation">British Iron and Steel Federation</a> (BISF), a steel producers' organisation formed that year as part of the National Government's rationalisation of the iron and steel industry.

The British steel industry was protected from more efficient foreign competition by the government's high tariff wall. The BISF, through its control of pricing, could also present a united front against new competition at home. When the feasibility report was received by the BISF in March 1935 the Federation's chairman, Sir Andrew Duncan, at first reacted positively; his members from the north-east were rather less enthusiastic. Only one of the large steel firms in the region, the <a href="Consett%20Iron%20Company">Consett Iron Company</a>, offered support for a Jarrow steelworks, while other BISF members put pressure on London's financial institutions to withhold capital from the new scheme. Reports of such tactics caused great anxiety in the Jarrow area, where the people were desperate for the new works to come about. In a reassuring speech shortly before the November 1935 general election, Baldwin, now leading the National Government, informed his listeners in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>: "There is no truth in any of the reports that either the banks or any other authorities ... are making a dead set to prevent anything of the kind being done in the area".
After the election and the return of the National Government, little happened to support Baldwin's optimistic words. In the House of Commons on 2 March 1936, Wilkinson spoke of the "atmosphere of mystery" that surrounded the Jarrow scheme: "Publicly one sees tremendous optimism ... but when you see people privately there is a great deal of humming and ha'ing, and they are not quite sure". Meanwhile, the BISF argued that increased steel production should be achieved by expanding capacity in existing facilities, rather than by building new plant. Duncan, in a reversal of his earlier attitude, now opposed the provision of finance for Jarrow which, he felt, might create a precedent that other distressed areas could exploit. The BISF finally succeeded in watering down the scheme to the extent that it became unviable; Salt and his syndicate withdrew, and the scheme was dead, "strangled at birth" according to Wilkinson.

In a series of exchanges in the Commons with Runciman on 30 June, Wilkinson requested in vain that the matter be reconsidered by an independent body, rather than being decided by the BISF. One of the government's own negotiators, who had been involved in the project since its early stages, wrote in "The Times": "A system which permits the adjudication on a proposal of national importance ... to be left in the hands of parties whose financial interests may run counter to that project, is not conducive to the enterprising development of the steel industry".

When, later in the summer, Runciman met workers from Jarrow the deputation encountered, in Wilkinson's words, "a figure of ice. Icily correct, icily polite, apparently completely indifferent to the woes of others." His insistence that "Jarrow must work out its own salvation", was described by Blythe as "the last straw in official cruelty"; to Wilkinson, the phrase "kindled the town", and inspired it to action.

After the loss of the steelworks, David Riley, the chairman of Jarrow Borough Council, told a rally of the town's unemployed in July 1936: "If I had my way I would organise the unemployed of the whole country ... and march them on London so they would all arrive at the same time. The government would then be forced to listen, or turn the military on us". The idea of a march was taken up with enthusiasm by the mayor Billy Thompson, by Wilkinson, and by political, commercial and religious groups. It was decided that the march would be a local affair, representing the town, with no political connotations. It would be limited to 200 fit men who would arrive in London at the start of the new parliamentary session on 3 November 1936, when a petition from the town would be presented to the House of Commons.

Riley was appointed chief marshal, with four subcommittees to deal with organisational detail. All the local political parties—Labour, Conservative and Liberal—gave their support, as did the town's churches and the business community. Relays of medical students from the Inter-Hospital Socialist Society agreed to accompany the march as medical attendants. A fund was begun, with an initial target of £800, to meet the costs of the march; ultimately, nearly double that amount was raised, locally and on the route. Public meetings were planned for the overnight stops, to publicise the plight of Jarrow and of other areas like it. One marcher explained: "We were more or less missionaries of the distressed areas, [not just] Jarrow".

On Monday 5 October the marchers, selected from over 1,200 volunteers, attended an ecumenical dedication service in Christ Church, Jarrow, where the blessing was given by <a href="James%20Gordon%20%28bishop%20of%20Jarrow%29">James Gordon</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Jarrow">Bishop of Jarrow</a>. This apparent endorsement by a senior cleric gained considerable press attention, but earned a sharp response from <a href="Hensley%20Henson">Hensley Henson</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>. Henson, a severe critic of socialism and trade unionism, described the march as "revolutionary mob pressure", and regretted his colleague's association with "these fatuous demonstrations, which are mainly designed in the interest, not of the Unemployed, but of the Labour party".

As Jarrow's representatives prepared to leave, six regional contingents of the sixth National Hunger March were taking the road to London, where they were due to arrive a week after the Jarrow marchers. A group of blind veterans, organised by the <a href="National%20League%20of%20the%20Blind%20and%20Disabled">National League of the Blind and Disabled</a>, was also on the march, demanding better allowances for the country's 67,000 blind persons.

After the service of dedication, the marchers left Jarrow, cheered on by most of the town and bearing banners announcing themselves as the "Jarrow Crusade". By the following weekend they had travelled to the cathedral city of <a href="Ripon">Ripon</a>, where they were welcomed by the <a href="Geoffrey%20Lunt">Bishop of Ripon</a> and a delegation representing local churches. Receptions at the intervening stops had been mixed: lukewarm at <a href="Chester-le-Street">Chester-le-Street</a>, warm and friendly from the people in <a href="Ferryhill">Ferryhill</a> and also from the Conservative-controlled council in <a href="Darlington">Darlington</a>.

Wilkinson had left the march at Chester-le-Street to attend the Labour Party's annual conference, taking place in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>. The conference was not supportive of the march—one delegate criticised Wilkinson for "sending hungry and ill-clad men on a march to London". The Labour conference's negative stance brought angry responses from the marchers; Riley considered that they had been "stabbed in the back". The marchers were further dismayed to learn that the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Labour%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Labour</a>'s Unemployment Assistance Board had ruled that their benefits would be reduced, since they were unavailable for work should jobs arise.

After a weekend's rest, the marchers proceeded to <a href="Harrogate">Harrogate</a>. In this solidly Conservative, prosperous town the marchers were greeted warmly by the civic authorities and were fed by the <a href="Rotary%20International">Rotary Club</a>. They were given sleeping quarters by the <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a>, a change from the school and church halls, and occasional workhouse accommodation, that was provided at most overnight stops. It was becoming evident that local Conservatives were often as likely to provide practical assistance as Labour, whose local parties were constrained by the attitude of the party's national leadership. The marchers' claim that theirs was a unique situation, arising from specific actions (the closing of the shipyard and the blocking of the proposed steelworks) that could be remedied by immediate government action, may also have alienated local working-class communities. Cross-party support was important in maintaining the march's non-partisan ethos, a factor that led Riley to refuse a donation of £20 from a communist group, stating: "We are determined at all costs to preserve the non-political character of this Crusade".

At Harrogate Wilkinson rejoined the march, as it proceeded through southern <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> towards <a href="Chesterfield">Chesterfield</a> in <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>. The march was attracting wide publicity; in London the government worried that <a href="Edward%20VIII">King Edward</a> might exceed his constitutional limits and receive the marchers. The cabinet issued a statement that emphasised the constitutional means for expressing grievances, and condemned marches for causing "unnecessary hardship for those taking part in them"—"crocodile tears", according to Wilkinson. In reaching <a href="Chesterfield">Chesterfield</a> on 17 October, the marchers had travelled during the week, and were at the approximate half-way point in their journey. That day, the Bishop of Durham was gratified and the marchers correspondingly disappointed, when in a letter to "The Times" the Bishop of Jarrow denied that his blessing on the march had indicated his support for the venture. The blessing was, he said an act of Christian duty; in general he believed that such marches should be discouraged. Wilkinson was forgiving of the bishop's volte-face, knowing, she later said, "the difficulties he had to face".

The third week of the march covered the greatest distance of the four weeks—. At <a href="Mansfield">Mansfield</a>, the Labour-controlled council defied the national leadership to give the marchers a warm welcome. This was matched by the reception from <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>'s Conservative mayor and councillors, and supplemented by gifts of clothing and underwear from the city's manufacturers. At <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, the <a href="Retailers%27%20cooperative">Co-operative Society</a>'s bootmakers worked through the night without pay, repairing the marchers' boots. According to some accounts, the marchers presented the vicar of the <a href="St%20Mark%27s%20Church%2C%20Leicester">Church of St Mark, Leicester</a>, with a wooden cross, although Matt Perry, in his history of the Jarrow March, indicates that this cross was donated in 1934 by the national hunger march.

From Leicester the march moved to <a href="Market%20Harborough">Market Harborough</a>. This was one of the least welcoming of all the overnight stops. No member of the local council greeted or visited the marchers, and they were forced to spend the night on the stone floor of an unfinished building (the local press later denied that this was so). On Saturday 24 October the marchers reached <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a>, arriving at the same time as the blind group. Wilkinson left to supervise arrangements in London, and would thereafter only participate intermittently until the final day, a week hence.

The leg on Monday 26 October, from Northampton to <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a>, was the longest daily march—. Of the original contingent, 185 were still on the road, together with 10 replacements. To maintain the timetable for arrival at <a href="Marble%20Arch">Marble Arch</a>, the marchers took an extra rest day on Tuesday before marching, in teeming rain, the to <a href="Luton">Luton</a>.

On 29 October, as the marchers walked from Luton to <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>, the plight of Jarrow was the subject of exchanges in the House of Commons between Wilkinson and Baldwin. The prime minister drew attention to the recent decrease in Jarrow's unemployed, and said: "There is every reason to hope that the revival of industry now in progress in the Tyneside area will result in further opportunities for employment for those still unemployed at Jarrow." Wilkinson replied that the apparent decrease in Jarrow's unemployment figures arose from the amalgamation of the figures of Jarrow with those of a neighbouring town, and did not represent an increase in employment. She asked Baldwin whether he would break with tradition and meet a deputation of the marchers; the prime minister declined.

On the penultimate stage, from St Albans to <a href="Edgware">Edgware</a>, as the march neared its end, marchers began to contemplate the return home, and the prospect of "looking out of the window ... knowing that there's nothing, nothing at all to do". On the final day, for the short stretch, large crowds watched the column proceed through the London suburbs towards Marble Arch, marching to the accompaniment of their own mouth-organ band despite relentless rain. On arrival, as their leaders talked to the press, the marchers retired to their overnight accommodation in London's <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End</a>.

On Sunday 1 November the marchers proceeded to Hyde Park for a hastily organised public meeting. The Communist Party was holding a general rally in the park against unemployment; Wilkinson records that they "generously gave way for an hour and asked their great audience to swell our Crusade meeting". The police made a low estimate of 3,000 for the crowd, but the journalist <a href="Peter%20Ritchie%20Calder">Ritchie Calder</a>, who was present, put the figure at 50,000.

After a day's rest, the marchers' main event on Tuesday was a public meeting in the Memorial Hall, Farringdon Street. Among the guest speakers was <a href="Dick%20Sheppard%20%28priest%29">the Rev. Canon Dick Sheppard</a>, founder of the <a href="Peace%20Pledge%20Union">Peace Pledge Union</a>. He told the marchers: "You have so aroused the conscience of the country that things are bound to happen". Sir John Jarvis, without prior warning, then revealed plans for a steel tubes mill on the Palmers site. The impression that Jarrow's problems could be solved thus, without government action, disconcerted the listening marchers. Wilkinson commented that such plans were in the future, and were no substitute for the town's requirement for immediate government intervention.

On Wednesday 4 November Wilkinson presented the Jarrow petition to the House of Commons. With over 11,000 signatures, it asked that "His Majesty's Government and this honourable House should realise the urgent need that work should be provided for the town without further delay." In the brief discussion that followed, Runciman said that "the unemployment position at Jarrow, while still far from satisfactory, has improved during recent months", to which <a href="James%20Chuter%20Ede">James Chuter Ede</a>, the Labour backbencher representing <a href="South%20Shields%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">South Shields</a>, the neighbouring constituency to Wilkinson's, replied that "the Government's complacency is regarded throughout the country as an affront to the national conscience".

Blythe summarises the marchers' anger and disillusionment: "And that was that. The result of three months' excited preparation and one month's march has led to a few minutes of flaccid argument during which the Government speakers had hardly mustered enough energy to roll to their feet". A "stay-in" strike was briefly proposed, before Wilkinson arranged a meeting with a cross-party group of MPs. The marchers' case was heard sympathetically; the meeting was warned that, given international uncertainties, they might come to regret the dismantling of an important shipbuilding facility for reasons of private profit. Such statements, according to Wilkinson, made members "distinctly uncomfortable". The next day the marchers returned by train to Jarrow, where they received an ecstatic welcome from the town.

Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners <a href="RMS%20Olympic">"Olympic"</a> and <a href="SS%20Imperator">"Berengaria"</a>, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was "a waste of time", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that "[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" columnist <a href="Kevin%20Maguire%20%28journalist%29">Kevin Maguire</a> calls the march "a heroic failure", while Matt Dobson, in "<a href="The%20Socialist%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">The Socialist</a>", writes that "out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March "helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s", and thus paved the way to social reform.

Perry observes that "the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as "a badge of credibility". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—<a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a>, <a href="Neil%20Kinnock">Neil Kinnock</a>, <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group from Jarrow and other towns along the way retraced the route to London. At that time of industrial recession, Jarrow once again had the highest level of unemployment in the country. The 75th anniversary in 2011 was marked by a "March for Jobs", that drew the ire of a Conservative MP, <a href="Robert%20Goodwill">Robert Goodwill</a>, who noted the high level of withdrawals in its early stages and dismissed it as "an insult to the memory of the Jarrow marchers ... They are not fit to walk in [their] footsteps".
Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and <a href="Joseph%20Symonds">Joseph Symonds</a>—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for <a href="Whitehaven%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Whitehaven</a> from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, "The Town that Was Murdered". A reviewer for "The Economic Journal" found the book "not quite as polemical as one might have expected", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in <a href="Churchill%20war%20ministry">Churchill's wartime coalition government</a>. In the <a href="Attlee%20ministry">1945 Labour government</a> she was appointed <a href="Department%20for%20Education">Minister of Education</a>, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947.
In 1974 the rock singer <a href="Alan%20Price">Alan Price</a> released the "Jarrow Song", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, "Whistling at the Milestones" (1977) by <a href="Alex%20Glasgow">Alex Glasgow</a>, and an opera, "Burning Road" (1996), by <a href="Will%20Todd">Will Todd</a> and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a> in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the <a href="Tyne%20Bridge">Tyne Bridge</a> was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by <a href="Newcastle%20University">Newcastle University</a> re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history. The final event, revolved around the March, the re-enactment was described as a memorable closing to the finale. The town of Jarrow contains several commemorations, including a steel relief sculpture by Vince Rea at the new railway station, a tile mural designed by local schoolchildren, and a bronze sculpture—"The Spirit of the Crusade" by <a href="Graham%20Ibbeson">Graham Ibbeson</a>—in the town centre. Buildings and street names bear the names of Wilkinson and Riley. Perry writes that "In Jarrow, landscape and memory have fused together, just as the red hot rivets once fastened great sheets of steel in Palmer's Yard."

Moore first received critical attention with <a href="Robert%20Altman">Robert Altman</a>'s "<a href="Short%20Cuts">Short Cuts</a>" (1993), and successive performances in "<a href="Vanya%20on%2042nd%20Street">Vanya on 42nd Street</a>" (1994) and "<a href="Safe%20%281995%20film%29">Safe</a>" (1995) continued this acclaim. Starring roles in the blockbusters "<a href="Nine%20Months">Nine Months</a>" (1995) and "" (1997) established her as a <a href="leading%20lady">leading lady</a> in Hollywood.

Moore received considerable recognition in the late 1990s and early 2000s, earning Oscar nominations for "<a href="Boogie%20Nights">Boogie Nights</a>" (1997), "<a href="The%20End%20of%20the%20Affair%20%281999%20film%29">The End of the Affair</a>" (1999), "<a href="Far%20from%20Heaven">Far from Heaven</a>" (2002) and "<a href="The%20Hours%20%28film%29">The Hours</a>" (2002). In the first of these, she played a 1970s pornographic actress, while the other three featured her as an unhappy, mid-20th century housewife. She also had success with the films "<a href="The%20Big%20Lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a>" (1998), "<a href="Magnolia%20%28film%29">Magnolia</a>" (1999), "<a href="Hannibal%20%28film%29">Hannibal</a>" (2001), "<a href="Children%20of%20Men">Children of Men</a>" (2006), "<a href="A%20Single%20Man">A Single Man</a>" (2009), "<a href="The%20Kids%20Are%20All%20Right%20%28film%29">The Kids Are All Right</a>" (2010), and "<a href="Crazy%2C%20Stupid%2C%20Love">Crazy, Stupid, Love</a>" (2011), and won several awards for her portrayal of <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a> in the television film "<a href="Game%20Change%20%28film%29">Game Change</a>" (2012). Moore went on to give an Academy Award-winning performance as an <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's</a> patient in "<a href="Still%20Alice">Still Alice</a>" (2014) and was named <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> for "<a href="Maps%20to%20the%20Stars">Maps to the Stars</a>" (2014). She also appeared in the final two films of "<a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20%28film%20series%29">The Hunger Games</a>" series and starred in the spy film "" (2017).

In addition to acting, Moore has written a series of children's books about a character named "Freckleface Strawberry". She is married to director <a href="Bart%20Freundlich">Bart Freundlich</a>, with whom she has two children.

Moore was born Julie Anne Smith on December 3, 1960, at the <a href="Fort%20Bragg">Fort Bragg</a> army installation in North Carolina, the oldest of 3 siblings. Her father, Peter Moore Smith, a <a href="paratrooper">paratrooper</a> in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, attained the rank of <a href="colonel">colonel</a> and became a <a href="Judge%20Advocate%20General%27s%20Corps">military judge</a>. Her Scottish mother, Anne (née Love; 1940–2009), was a <a href="psychologist">psychologist</a> and <a href="social%20work">social work</a>er from <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a>, Scotland, who emigrated to the United States in 1951 with her family. Moore has a younger sister, Valerie Smith, and a younger brother, the novelist <a href="Peter%20Moore%20Smith">Peter Moore Smith</a>. As Moore is half-<a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a>, she claimed British citizenship in 2011 to honor her deceased mother.
Moore frequently moved around the United States as a child, due to her father's occupation. She was close to her family as a result, but has said she never had the feeling of coming from one particular place. The family lived in multiple locations, including <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="Panama">Panama</a>, <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and Moore attended nine different schools. The constant relocating made her an insecure child, and she struggled to establish friendships. Despite these difficulties, Moore later remarked that an itinerant lifestyle was beneficial to her future career: "When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was ... It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change."

When Moore was 16, the family moved from Falls Church, Virginia, where Moore had been attending <a href="J.E.B.%20Stuart%20High%20School">J.E.B. Stuart High School</a>, to <a href="Frankfurt">Frankfurt</a>, Germany, where she attended <a href="Frankfurt%20American%20High%20School">Frankfurt American High School</a>. She was clever and studious, a self-proclaimed "good girl", and she planned to become a doctor. She had never considered performing, or even attended the theatre, but she was an avid reader and it was this hobby that led her to begin acting at the school. She appeared in several plays, including "<a href="Tartuffe">Tartuffe</a>" and "<a href="Medea%20%28play%29">Medea</a>", and with the encouragement of her English teacher, she chose to pursue a theatrical career. Moore's parents supported her decision, but asked that she train at university to provide the added security of a college degree. She was accepted to <a href="Boston%20University">Boston University</a> and graduated with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Fine%20Arts">BFA</a> in Theatre in 1983.

Moore moved to New York City after graduating, and worked as a waitress. After registering her stage name with <a href="Actors%27%20Equity">Actors' Equity</a>, she began her career in 1985 with <a href="off-Broadway">off-Broadway</a> theatre. Her first screen role came in 1985, in an episode of the soap opera "<a href="The%20Edge%20of%20Night">The Edge of Night</a>". Her break came the following year, when she joined the cast of "<a href="As%20the%20World%20Turns">As the World Turns</a>". Playing the dual roles of half-sisters <a href="Frannie%20Hughes">Frannie</a> and <a href="Sabrina%20Hughes">Sabrina Hughes</a>, she found this intensive work to be an important learning experience, and she said of it fondly: "I gained confidence and learned to take responsibility." Moore performed on the show until 1988, when she won a <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award">Daytime Emmy Award</a> for <a href="Daytime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Younger%20Actress%20in%20a%20Drama%20Series">Outstanding Ingenue in a Drama Series</a>. Before leaving "As the World Turns", she had a role in the 1987 <a href="CBS">CBS</a> miniseries "<a href="I%27ll%20Take%20Manhattan%20%28TV%20miniseries%29">I'll Take Manhattan</a>". Once she had finished the soap opera, she turned to the stage to play <a href="Ophelia">Ophelia</a> in a <a href="Guthrie%20Theater">Guthrie Theater</a> production of "<a href="Hamlet">Hamlet</a>" opposite <a href="%C5%BDeljko%20Ivanek">Željko Ivanek</a>. The actress returned intermittently to television over the next three years, appearing in the TV movies "Money, Power, Murder" (1989), "The Last to Go" (1991), and "<a href="Cast%20a%20Deadly%20Spell">Cast a Deadly Spell</a>" (1991).

In 1990, Moore began working with stage director <a href="Andre%20Gregory">Andre Gregory</a> on a workshop theatre production of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Chekhov</a>'s "<a href="Uncle%20Vanya">Uncle Vanya</a>". Described by Moore as "one of the most fundamentally important acting experiences I ever had", the group spent four years exploring the text and giving intimate performances to friends. Also in 1990, Moore made her cinematic debut as a mummy's victim in "", a low-budget horror that she later described as "terrible". Her next film role, in 1992, introduced her to a wide audience. The thriller "<a href="The%20Hand%20That%20Rocks%20the%20Cradle%20%28film%29">The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</a>" – in which she played the main character's ill-fated friend – was number one at the US box office, and Moore caught the attention of several critics with her performance. She followed it the same year with the crime comedy "<a href="The%20Gun%20in%20Betty%20Lou%27s%20Handbag">The Gun in Betty Lou's Handbag</a>", appearing as the protagonist's kooky sister. Moore continued to play supporting roles throughout 1993, first featuring in the erotic thriller "<a href="Body%20of%20Evidence%20%281993%20film%29">Body of Evidence</a>" as <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>'s love rival. The film was a failure and widely mocked, and she later regretted her involvement. She had greater success in a 1993 romantic comedy with <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a>. In "<a href="Benny%20%26amp%3B%20Joon">Benny & Joon</a>", she played a gentle waitress who falls for <a href="Aidan%20Quinn">Aidan Quinn</a>'s character, Benny. Moore also appeared briefly as a doctor in one of the year's biggest hits, the <a href="Harrison%20Ford">Harrison Ford</a> thriller "<a href="The%20Fugitive%20%281993%20film%29">The Fugitive</a>".

The filmmaker <a href="Robert%20Altman">Robert Altman</a> saw Moore in the "Uncle Vanya" production, and was sufficiently impressed to cast her in his next project: the ensemble drama "<a href="Short%20Cuts">Short Cuts</a>" (1993), based on short stories by <a href="Raymond%20Carver">Raymond Carver</a>. Moore was pleased to work with him, as his film "<a href="3%20Women">3 Women</a>" (1977) gave her a strong appreciation for cinema when she saw it in college. Playing artist Marian Wyman was an experience she found difficult, as she was a "total unknown" surrounded by established actors, but this proved to be Moore's breakout role. "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" magazine described her as "arresting" and noted that her monologue, delivered naked from the waist down, would "no doubt be the most discussed scene" of the film. "Short Cuts" was critically acclaimed, and received awards for Best Ensemble Cast at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a> and the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Awards">Golden Globe Awards</a>. Moore received an individual nomination for <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Female">Best Supporting Female</a> at the <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Awards">Independent Spirit Awards</a>, and the monologue scene earned her a degree of notoriety.

"Short Cuts" was one of a trio of successive film appearances that boosted Moore's reputation. It was followed in 1994 with "<a href="Vanya%20on%2042nd%20Street">Vanya on 42nd Street</a>", a filmed version of her ongoing "Uncle Vanya" workshop production, directed by <a href="Louis%20Malle">Louis Malle</a>. Moore's performance of Yelena was described as "simply outstanding" by "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>", and she won the <a href="Boston%20Society%20of%20Film%20Critics">Boston Society of Film Critics</a> award for <a href="Boston%20Society%20of%20Film%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a>. Following this, Moore was given her first leading role, playing an unhappy suburban housewife who develops <a href="multiple%20chemical%20sensitivity">multiple chemical sensitivity</a> in <a href="Todd%20Haynes">Todd Haynes</a>' low-budget film "<a href="Safe%20%281995%20film%29">Safe</a>" (1995). She had to lose a substantial amount of weight for the role, which made her ill, and she vowed never to change her body for a film again. In their review, "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine writes that "Safe" "first established [Moore's] credentials as perhaps the finest actress of her generation". The film historian <a href="David%20Thomson%20%28film%20critic%29">David Thomson</a> later described it as "one of the most arresting, original and accomplished films of the 1990s", and the performance earned Moore an Independent Spirit Award nomination for <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Lead">Best Actress</a>. Reflecting on these three roles, Moore has said, "They all came out at once, and I suddenly had this profile. It was amazing."

Moore's next appearance was a supporting role in the comedy-drama "<a href="Roommates%20%281995%20film%29">Roommates</a>" (1995), playing the daughter-in-law of <a href="Peter%20Falk">Peter Falk</a>. Her following film, "<a href="Nine%20Months">Nine Months</a>" (1995), was crucial in establishing her as a leading lady in Hollywood. The romantic comedy, directed by <a href="Chris%20Columbus%20%28filmmaker%29">Chris Columbus</a> and co-starring <a href="Hugh%20Grant">Hugh Grant</a>, was poorly reviewed, but a box office success; it remains one of her highest-grossing films. Her next release was also a Hollywood production, as Moore appeared alongside <a href="Sylvester%20Stallone">Sylvester Stallone</a> and <a href="Antonio%20Banderas">Antonio Banderas</a> in the thriller "<a href="Assassins%20%28film%29">Assassins</a>" (1995). Despite negativity from critics, the film earned $83.5 million worldwide. Moore's only appearance of 1996 came in the <a href="Merchant%20Ivory%20Productions">Merchant Ivory</a> film "<a href="Surviving%20Picasso">Surviving Picasso</a>", where she played the artist <a href="Dora%20Maar">Dora Maar</a> opposite <a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a>. The period drama met with poor reviews.

A key point in Moore's career came when she was cast by <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> to star as paleontologist Dr. Sarah Harding in "" – the sequel to his 1993 <a href="blockbuster%20%28entertainment%29">blockbuster</a> "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28film%29">Jurassic Park</a>". Filming the big-budget production was a new experience for Moore, and she has said she enjoyed herself "tremendously". It was a physically demanding role, with the actress commenting, "There was so much hanging everywhere. We hung off everything available, plus we climbed, ran, jumped off things ... it was just non-stop." "The Lost World" (1997) finished as one of the ten highest-grossing films in history to that point, and was pivotal in making Moore a sought-after actress: "Suddenly I had a commercial film career", she said. "<a href="The%20Myth%20of%20Fingerprints">The Myth of Fingerprints</a>" was her second film released in 1997. During its production she met her future husband in director <a href="Bart%20Freundlich">Bart Freundlich</a>. Later that year, Moore made a <a href="Cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> appearance in the dark comedy "<a href="Chicago%20Cab">Chicago Cab</a>".

The late 1990s and early 2000s saw Moore achieve significant industry recognition. Her first <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a> nomination came for the critically acclaimed "<a href="Boogie%20Nights">Boogie Nights</a>" (1997), which centers on a group of individuals working in the 1970s pornography industry. Director <a href="Paul%20Thomas%20Anderson">Paul Thomas Anderson</a> was not a well-known figure before its production, with only one feature credit to his name, but Moore agreed to the film after being impressed with his "exhilarating" script. The ensemble piece featured Moore as Amber Waves, a leading porn actress and mother-figure who longs to be re-united with her real son. Martyn Glanville of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> commented that the role required a mixture of confidence and vulnerability, and was impressed with Moore's effort. "Time Out" called the performance "superb", while <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" found it "wonderful". Alongside her Oscar nomination for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>, Moore was nominated at the Golden Globe and <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Awards">Screen Actors Guild</a> awards, and several critics groups named her a winner.

Moore followed her success in "Boogie Nights" with a role in the <a href="Coen%20brothers">Coen brothers</a>' dark comedy "<a href="The%20Big%20Lebowski">The Big Lebowski</a>" (1998). The film was not a hit at the time of release, but subsequently became a <a href="cult%20classic">cult classic</a>. Her role was Maude Lebowski, a feminist artist and daughter of the eponymous character who becomes involved with "The Dude" (<a href="Jeff%20Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a>, the film's star). At the end of 1998, Moore had a flop with <a href="Gus%20Van%20Sant">Gus Van Sant</a>'s "<a href="Psycho%20%281998%20film%29">Psycho</a>", a remake of the classic <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a> <a href="Psycho%20%281960%20film%29">film of the same name</a>. She played <a href="Lila%20Crane">Lila Crane</a> in the film, which received poor reviews and is described by "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" as one of her "pointless" outings. The review in "<a href="Boxoffice%20%28magazine%29">Boxoffice</a>" magazine regretted that "a group of enormously talented people wasted several months of their lives" on the film.

After re-uniting with Robert Altman for the dark comedy "<a href="Cookie%27s%20Fortune">Cookie's Fortune</a>" (1999), Moore starred in "<a href="An%20Ideal%20Husband%20%281999%20film%29">An Ideal Husband</a>" – <a href="Oliver%20Parker">Oliver Parker</a>'s adaptation of the <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> <a href="An%20Ideal%20Husband">play</a>. Set in London at the end of the 19th century, her performance of Mrs. Laura Cheverly earned a Golden Globe nomination for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy</a>. She was also nominated in the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Drama">Drama category</a> that year for her work in "<a href="The%20End%20of%20the%20Affair%20%281999%20film%29">The End of the Affair</a>" (1999). Based on <a href="The%20End%20of%20the%20Affair">the novel</a> by <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a>, Moore played opposite <a href="Ralph%20Fiennes">Ralph Fiennes</a> as an adulterous wife in 1940s Britain. The critic <a href="Michael%20Sragow">Michael Sragow</a> was full of praise for her work, writing that her performance was "the critical element that makes [the film] necessary viewing". Moore received her second Academy Award nomination for the role – her first for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> – as well as nominations at the <a href="BAFTA%20Awards">British Academy</a> (BAFTA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards.

In between her two Golden Globe-nominated performances, Moore was seen in "<a href="A%20Map%20of%20the%20World%20%28film%29">A Map of the World</a>", supporting <a href="Sigourney%20Weaver">Sigourney Weaver</a>, as a bereaved mother. Her fifth and final film of 1999 was the acclaimed drama "<a href="Magnolia%20%28film%29">Magnolia</a>", a "giant mosaic" chronicling the lives of multiple characters over one day in Los Angeles. Paul Thomas Anderson, in his follow-up to "Boogie Nights", wrote a role specifically for Moore. His primary objective was to "see her explode", and he cast her as a <a href="morphine">morphine</a>-addicted wife. Moore has said it was a particularly difficult role, but she was rewarded with a SAG nomination. She was subsequently named Best Supporting Actress of 1999 by the <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review">National Board of Review</a>, in recognition of her three performances in "Magnolia", "An Ideal Husband", and "A Map of the World".

Apart from a cameo role in the comedy "<a href="The%20Ladies%20Man%20%282000%20film%29">The Ladies Man</a>", Moore's only other appearance in 2000 was in a short-film adaptation of <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>'s play "<a href="Not%20I">Not I</a>". In early 2001, she appeared as FBI Agent <a href="Clarice%20Starling">Clarice Starling</a> in "<a href="Hannibal%20%28film%29">Hannibal</a>", a sequel to the Oscar winning film "<a href="The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Lambs%20%28film%29">The Silence of the Lambs</a>". <a href="Jodie%20Foster">Jodie Foster</a> had declined to reprise the role, and director <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a> eventually cast Moore, over <a href="Angelina%20Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, <a href="Cate%20Blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a>, <a href="Gillian%20Anderson">Gillian Anderson</a>, and <a href="Helen%20Hunt">Helen Hunt</a>. The change in actress received considerable attention from the press, but Moore claimed she was not interested in upstaging Foster. Despite mixed reviews, "Hannibal" earned $58 million in its opening weekend and finished as the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. Moore starred in three more 2001 releases: with <a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a> in the science-fiction-comedy "<a href="Evolution%20%282001%20film%29">Evolution</a>", in her husband's dramatic film "<a href="World%20Traveler">World Traveler</a>", and with <a href="Kevin%20Spacey">Kevin Spacey</a>, <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a>, and Cate Blanchett in "<a href="The%20Shipping%20News%20%28film%29">The Shipping News</a>". All three films were poorly received.

The year 2002 marked a high point in Moore's career, as she became the ninth performer to be <a href="List%20of%20actors%20nominated%20for%20two%20Academy%20Awards%20in%20the%20same%20year">nominated for two Academy Awards in the same year</a>. She received a Best Actress nomination for the melodrama "<a href="Far%20from%20Heaven">Far from Heaven</a>", in which she played a 1950s housewife whose world is shaken when her husband reveals he is gay. The role was written specifically for her by Todd Haynes, the first time the pair had worked together since "Safe", and Moore described it as "a very, very personal project ... such an incredible honor to do". David Rooney of "Variety" praised her "beautifully gauged performance" of a desperate woman "buckling under social pressures and putting on a brave face". <a href="Manohla%20Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" wrote, "what Moore does with her role is so beyond the parameters of what we call great acting that it nearly defies categorization". The role won Moore the Best Actress award from 19 different organizations, including the <a href="Volpi%20Cup">Venice Film Festival</a> and the <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">National Board of Review</a>.

Moore's second Oscar nomination that year came for "<a href="The%20Hours%20%28film%29">The Hours</a>", which she co-starred in with <a href="Nicole%20Kidman">Nicole Kidman</a> and <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a>. She again played a troubled 1950s housewife, prompting <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> to write that she was "essentially reprising her "Far from Heaven" role". Moore said it was an "unfortunate coincidence" that the similar roles came at the same time, and claimed that the characters had differing personalities. <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" called the performance "wrenching", while <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> of "The Guardian" praised a "superbly controlled, humane performance". "The Hours" was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>. Moore also received BAFTA and SAG Award nominations for Best Supporting Actress, and was jointly awarded the <a href="Silver%20Bear%20for%20Best%20Actress">Silver Bear for Best Actress</a> with Kidman and Streep at the <a href="Berlin%20Film%20Festival">Berlin Film Festival</a>.

Moore did not make any screen appearances in 2003, but returned in 2004 with three films. There was no success in her first two ventures of the year: "<a href="Marie%20and%20Bruce">Marie and Bruce</a>", a dark comedy co-starring <a href="Matthew%20Broderick">Matthew Broderick</a>, did not get a cinematic release; "<a href="Laws%20of%20Attraction">Laws of Attraction</a>" followed, where she played opposite <a href="Pierce%20Brosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a> in a courtroom-based romantic comedy, but the film was panned by critics. Commercial success returned to Moore with "<a href="The%20Forgotten%20%282004%20film%29">The Forgotten</a>", a <a href="psychological%20thriller">psychological thriller</a> in which she played a mother who is told her dead son never existed. Although the film was unpopular with critics, it opened as the US box office number one.

In 2005, Moore worked with her husband for the third time in the comedy "<a href="Trust%20the%20Man">Trust the Man</a>", and starred in the true story of a 1950s housewife, "<a href="The%20Prize%20Winner%20of%20Defiance%2C%20Ohio">The Prize Winner of Defiance, Ohio</a>". Her first release of 2006 was "<a href="Freedomland%20%28film%29">Freedomland</a>", a mystery co-starring <a href="Samuel%20L.%20Jackson">Samuel L. Jackson</a>. The response was overwhelmingly negative, but her follow-up, <a href="Alfonso%20Cuar%C3%B3n">Alfonso Cuarón</a>'s "<a href="Children%20of%20Men">Children of Men</a>" (2006), was highly acclaimed. Moore had a supporting role in the <a href="dystopian">dystopian</a> drama, playing the leader of an activist group. It is listed on <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> as one of the best reviewed films of her career, and was named by Peter Travers as the second best film of the decade.

Moore made her <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> debut in the world premiere of <a href="David%20Hare%20%28playwright%29">David Hare's</a> play "<a href="The%20Vertical%20Hour">The Vertical Hour</a>". The production, directed by <a href="Sam%20Mendes">Sam Mendes</a> and co-starring <a href="Bill%20Nighy">Bill Nighy</a>, opened in November 2006. Moore played the role of Nadia, a former war correspondent who finds her views on the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> challenged. <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> of "The New York Times" was unenthusiastic about the production, and described Moore as miscast: in his opinion, she failed to bring the "tough, assertive" quality that Nadia required. David Rooney of "Variety" criticized her "lack of stage technique", adding that she appeared "stiffly self-conscious". Moore later confessed that she found performing on Broadway difficult and had not connected with the medium, but was glad to have experimented with it. The play closed in March 2007 after 117 performances.

Moore played an FBI agent for the second time in "<a href="Next%20%282007%20film%29">Next</a>" (2007), a science fiction action film co-starring <a href="Nicolas%20Cage">Nicolas Cage</a> and <a href="Jessica%20Biel">Jessica Biel</a>. Based on a short story by <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>, the response from critics was highly negative. Manhola Dargis wrote, "Ms. Moore seems terribly unhappy to be here, and it's no wonder." The actress has since described it as her worst film. "Next" was followed by "<a href="Savage%20Grace">Savage Grace</a>" (2007), the true story of <a href="Barbara%20Daly%20Baekeland">Barbara Daly Baekeland</a> – a high-society mother whose <a href="Oedipus%20complex">Oedipal relationship</a> with her son ended in murder. Moore was fascinated by the role. "Savage Grace" had a limited release, and received predominantly negative reviews. Peter Bradshaw, however, called it a "coldly brilliant and tremendously acted movie".

"<a href="I%27m%20Not%20There">I'm Not There</a>" (2007) saw Moore work with Todd Haynes for the third time. The film explored the life of <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, with Moore playing a character based on <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a>. In 2008, she starred with <a href="Mark%20Ruffalo">Mark Ruffalo</a> in "<a href="Blindness%20%282008%20film%29">Blindness</a>", a dystopian thriller from the director <a href="Fernando%20Meirelles">Fernando Meirelles</a>. The film was not widely seen, and critics were generally unenthusiastic. Moore was not seen on screen again until late 2009, with three new releases. She had a supporting role in "<a href="The%20Private%20Lives%20of%20Pippa%20Lee">The Private Lives of Pippa Lee</a>", and then starred in the erotic thriller "<a href="Chloe%20%28film%29">Chloe</a>" with <a href="Liam%20Neeson">Liam Neeson</a> and <a href="Amanda%20Seyfried">Amanda Seyfried</a>. Shortly afterwards, she appeared in the well-received drama "<a href="A%20Single%20Man">A Single Man</a>". Set in 1960s Los Angeles, the film starred <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a> as a homosexual professor who wishes to end his life. Moore played his best friend, "a fellow English expat and semi-alcoholic divorcee", a character that <a href="Tom%20Ford">Tom Ford</a>, the film's writer-director, created with her in mind. Leslie Felperin of "Variety" commented that it was Moore's best role in "some time", and was impressed by the "extraordinary emotional nuance" of her performance. "A Single Man" was selected as one of the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute%20Awards%202009%23Top%2010%20Films">top 10 films of 2009</a> by the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>, and Moore received a fifth Golden Globe nomination for her performance in the film.

Moore returned to television for the first time in 18 years when she played a guest role in the <a href="30%20Rock%20%28season%204%29">fourth season</a> of "<a href="30%20Rock">30 Rock</a>". She appeared in five episodes of the Emmy-winning comedy, playing <a href="List%20of%2030%20Rock%20characters%23Nancy%20Donovan">Nancy Donovan</a>, a love interest for <a href="Alec%20Baldwin">Alec Baldwin</a>'s character <a href="Jack%20Donaghy">Jack Donaghy</a>. She later appeared in the series finale in January 2013. She also returned to "As the World Turns", making a cameo appearance as Frannie Hughes at the end of the show's run in 2010. Her first big-screen appearance of the new decade was "<a href="Shelter%20%282010%20film%29">Shelter</a>" (2010), a film described as "heinous" by Tim Robey of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Telegraph</a>". The psychological thriller received negative reviews and did not have a US release until 2013 (retitled "6 Souls").

Moore next starred with <a href="Annette%20Bening">Annette Bening</a> in the <a href="independent%20film">independent film</a> "<a href="The%20Kids%20Are%20All%20Right%20%28film%29">The Kids Are All Right</a>" (2010), a comedy-drama about a lesbian couple whose teenage children locate their sperm donor. The role of Jules Allgood was written for her by writer-director <a href="Lisa%20Cholodenko">Lisa Cholodenko</a>, who felt that Moore was the right age, adept at both drama and comedy, and confident with the film's sexual content. The actress was drawn to the film's "universal" depiction of married life, and committed to the project in 2005. "The Kids Are All Right" was widely acclaimed, eventually garnering an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The critic Betsy Sharkey praised Moore's performance of Jules, who she called an "existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty", writing, "There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera – sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally ... and Moore plays every note perfectly." "The Kids Are All Right" earned Moore a sixth Golden Globe Award nomination and a second BAFTA nomination for Best Actress.

For her next project, Moore actively looked for another comedy. She had a supporting role in "<a href="Crazy%2C%20Stupid%2C%20Love">Crazy, Stupid, Love</a>", playing the estranged wife of <a href="Steve%20Carell">Steve Carell</a>, which was favorably reviewed and earned $142.8 million worldwide. Moore was not seen on screens again until March 2012, with a performance that received considerable praise and recognition. She starred in the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> television film "<a href="Game%20Change%20%28film%29">Game Change</a>", a dramatization of <a href="Sarah%20Palin">Sarah Palin</a>'s <a href="Sarah%20Palin%232008%20vice-presidential%20campaign">2008 campaign to become Vice President</a>. Portraying a well-known figure was something she found challenging; in preparation, she conducted extensive research and worked with a dialect coach for two months. Although the response to the film was mixed, critics were highly appreciative of Moore's performance. For the first time in her career, she received a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Miniseries%20or%20Television%20Film">Golden Globe</a>, a <a href="Primetime%20Emmy%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Lead%20Actress%20in%20a%20Miniseries%20or%20a%20Movie">Primetime Emmy</a>, and a <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Miniseries%20or%20Television%20Movie">SAG Award</a>.

Moore made two film appearances in 2012. The drama "<a href="Being%20Flynn">Being Flynn</a>", in which she supported <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a>, had a limited release. Greater success came for "<a href="What%20Maisie%20Knew%20%28film%29">What Maisie Knew</a>", the story of a young girl caught in the middle of her parents' divorce. Adapted from <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>'s <a href="What%20Maisie%20Knew">novel</a> and updated to the 21st century, the drama earned near-universal critical praise. The role of Susanna, Maisie's rock-star mother, required Moore to sing on camera, which was a challenge she embraced despite finding it embarrassing. She called Susanna a terrible parent, but said the role did not make her uncomfortable, as she fully compartmentalized the character: "I know that that's not me".

Following her well-received performance in "What Maisie Knew", Moore began 2013 with a supporting role in <a href="Joseph%20Gordon-Levitt">Joseph Gordon-Levitt</a>'s comedy "<a href="Don%20Jon">Don Jon</a>", playing an older woman who helps the title character to appreciate his relationships. Reviews for the film were favorable, and Mary Pols of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine wrote that Moore was a key factor in its success. Her next appearance was a starring role in the comedy "<a href="The%20English%20Teacher%20%28film%29">The English Teacher</a>" (2013), but this outing was poorly received and earned little at the box office. In October 2013, she played the demented mother <a href="Margaret%20White%20%28Stephen%20King%29">Margaret White</a> in "<a href="Carrie%20%282013%20film%29">Carrie</a>", an adaptation of <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>'s <a href="Carrie%20%28novel%29">horror novel</a>. Coming 37 years after <a href="Brian%20De%20Palma">Brian De Palma</a>'s well-known take on the book, Moore stated that she wanted to make the role her own. By drawing on King's writing rather than <a href="Carrie%20%281976%20film%29">the 1976 film</a>, <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" wrote that she managed to "[suggest] a history – one never told, just hinted at – of serious damage in [Margaret's] past". Although the film was a box office success, it was generally considered an unsuccessful and unnecessary adaptation.

At age 53, Moore enjoyed a considerable degree of critical and commercial success in 2014. Her first release of the year came alongside Liam Neeson in the action-thriller "<a href="Non-Stop%20%28film%29">Non-Stop</a>", set aboard an airplane. The response to the film was mixed, but it earned $223 million worldwide. She followed this by winning the <a href="Best%20Actress%20Award%20%28Cannes%20Film%20Festival%29">Best Actress</a> award at the <a href="2014%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a> for her performance as Havana Segrand, an aging actress receiving psychotherapy in <a href="David%20Cronenberg">David Cronenberg</a>'s black comedy "<a href="Maps%20to%20the%20Stars">Maps to the Stars</a>". Described by "The Guardian" as a "grotesque, gaudy, and ruthless" character, Moore based her role on "an amalgam of Hollywood casualties she ha[d] encountered", and drew upon her early experiences in the industry. Peter Debruge of "Variety" criticized the film, but found Moore to be "incredible" and "fearless" in it. Moore's success at Cannes made her the second actress in history, after <a href="Juliette%20Binoche">Juliette Binoche</a>, to win Best Actress awards at the "Big Three" film festivals (Berlin, Cannes, and Venice). She also received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance.

Moore played the supporting role of <a href="Alma%20Coin">President Alma Coin</a>, the leader of a rebellion against <a href="The%20Capitol%20%28Hunger%20Games%29">The Capitol</a>, in the third installment of the lucrative <a href="The%20Hunger%20Games%20%28film%20series%29">"The Hunger Games" film series</a>, "". The film ranks as her highest-grossing to date. Her final appearance of 2014 was one of the most acclaimed of her career. In the drama "<a href="Still%20Alice">Still Alice</a>", Moore played the leading role of a linguistics professor diagnosed with early onset <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>. She spent four months training for the film, by watching documentaries on the disease and interacting with patients at the <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20Association">Alzheimer's Association</a>. Critic <a href="David%20Thomson%20%28film%20critic%29">David Thomson</a> wrote that Moore was "extraordinary at revealing the gradual loss of memory and confidence", while according to <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a>, she was "especially good at the wordless elements of this transformation, allowing us to see through the changing contours of her face what it is like when your mind empties out". Several critics commented that it was her finest performance to date, and Moore was awarded with the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Oscar</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture%20%E2%80%93%20Drama">Golden Globe</a>, <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">SAG</a>, and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA</a> for Best Actress.

Moore began 2015 by appearing as an evil queen in "<a href="Seventh%20Son%20%28film%29">Seventh Son</a>", a poorly received fantasy-adventure film co-starring Jeff Bridges. She also appeared opposite <a href="Ellen%20Page">Ellen Page</a> in "<a href="Freeheld%20%282015%20film%29">Freeheld</a>", a drama based on a true story about a detective and her same-sex partner, and in the romantic comedy "<a href="Maggie%27s%20Plan">Maggie's Plan</a>", with <a href="Greta%20Gerwig">Greta Gerwig</a> and <a href="Ethan%20Hawke">Ethan Hawke</a>. Both films were presented at the <a href="2015%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2015 Toronto International Film Festival</a> in September 2015. In "Maggie's Plan", Moore played a pretentious Danish professor, a comic role which critic Richard Lawson of "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>" deemed as the film's "chief pleasure". Later that year, she reprised her role as Alma Coin in "", the final film of the series.

After a one-year absence from the screen, Moore had three film releases in 2017. She appeared in a dual role in "<a href="Wonderstruck%20%28film%29">Wonderstruck</a>", a film adaptation of <a href="Brian%20Selznick">Brian Selznick</a>'s historical children's <a href="Wonderstruck%20%28book%29">novel of the same name</a>, which reteamed her with Todd Haynes. Her parts were of a silent movie star in the 1920s and a deaf librarian in the 1970s; in preparation, she studied sign language and watched the films of <a href="Lillian%20Gish">Lillian Gish</a>. Richard Lawson considered her to be "eminently watchable" despite her limited screen time. Moore portrayed a dual role for the second time that year in "<a href="Suburbicon">Suburbicon</a>", a satirical thriller written by the Coen brothers and directed by <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>. She was cast opposite <a href="Matt%20Damon">Matt Damon</a> as twin sisters in 1950s America, named Rose and Margaret, who become embroiled in a local crime. The film received negative reviews, with critics saying it failed to effectively portray American racism, but Geoffrey Macnab of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" praised Moore for giving "a perfectly judged comic performance as a <a href="Barbara%20Stanwyck">Barbara Stanwyck</a>-like femme fatale".

Moore's final release of the year was the sequel to the 2015 spy film "", subtitled "", co-starring <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a>, <a href="Taron%20Egerton">Taron Egerton</a>, <a href="Channing%20Tatum">Channing Tatum</a>, and <a href="Halle%20Berry">Halle Berry</a>. She played the part of the villainous entrepreneur Poppy Adams, who runs a drug cartel. Despite her character's actions, Moore played the part to make Poppy seem "strange, but reasonable". Peter Debruge described the film as "outlandish", and wrote that Moore had played her part "as <a href="Martha%20Stewart">Martha Stewart</a> crossed with a demonic 1950s housewife". The film earned over $410 million worldwide.

Moore had two film releases in 2018. She was drawn to <a href="Sebasti%C3%A1n%20Lelio">Sebastián Lelio</a>'s "<a href="Gloria%20Bell">Gloria Bell</a>", an English-language remake of Lelio's own Chilean film "<a href="Gloria%20%282013%20film%29">Gloria</a>", for its rare depiction of a middle-age woman's quest for meaning in life. Stephen Dalton of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" believed that she had delivered "an utterly natural and quietly spellbinding star performance". Her second release that year was "<a href="Bel%20Canto%20%28film%29">Bel Canto</a>", a thriller based on <a href="Ann%20Patchett">Ann Patchett</a>'s <a href="Bel%20Canto%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a> about the <a href="Japanese%20embassy%20hostage%20crisis">Japanese embassy hostage crisis</a>. For her performance as an opera singer, she learnt to mimic the body language of professionals for scenes in which <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Fleming">Renée Fleming</a> performed the vocals. Guy Lodge of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" deemed the film an unsuccessful adaptation of the novel and considered Moore's work to be "edgeless fare by her standards". The following year, she teamed with her husband once again in "<a href="After%20the%20Wedding%20%282019%20film%29">After the Wedding</a>", a remake of <a href="Susanne%20Bier">Susanne Bier</a>'s Danish <a href="After%20the%20Wedding">film of the same name</a>. It featured her and <a href="Michelle%20Williams%20%28actress%29">Michelle Williams</a> in roles played by men in the original film.

Moore will next portray the feminist icon <a href="Gloria%20Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a> in the biopic "", sharing the part with the actresses <a href="Alicia%20Vikander">Alicia Vikander</a> and <a href="Lulu%20Wilson">Lulu Wilson</a>. She will then feature in <a href="Joe%20Wright">Joe Wright</a>'s thriller "<a href="The%20Woman%20in%20the%20Window%20%282019%20film%29">The Woman in the Window</a>", based on the novel of the same name, co-starring <a href="Amy%20Adams">Amy Adams</a> and <a href="Gary%20Oldman">Gary Oldman</a>.

Moore has been described in the media as one of the most talented and accomplished actresses of her generation. As a woman in her 50s, she is unusual in being an older actress who continues to work regularly and in prominent roles. She enjoys the variety of appearing in both low-budget independent films and large-scale Hollywood productions. In 2004, an <a href="IGN">IGN</a> journalist wrote of this "rare ability to bounce between commercially viable projects like "Nine Months" to <a href="art%20house">art house</a> masterpieces like "Safe" unscathed", adding, "She is respected in art houses and <a href="Multiplex%20%28movie%20theater%29">multiplexes</a> alike." She is noted for playing in a range of material, and the director Ridley Scott, who worked with Moore on "Hannibal", has praised her versatility. In October 2013, Moore was honored with a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>. She has been included in "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine's <a href="People%20%28magazine%29%23100%20Most%20Beautiful%20People">annual beauty lists</a> on four occasions (1995, 2003, 2008, 2013). In 2015, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine named Moore one of the 100 most influential people in the world on the annual "<a href="Time%20100">Time 100</a>" list.

Moore is particularly known for playing troubled women, and specializes in "ordinary women who suppress powerful emotions". <a href="Oliver%20Burkeman">Oliver Burkeman</a> of "The Guardian" writes that her characters are typically "struggling to maintain a purchase on normality in the face of some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure". Suzie Mackenzie, also of "The Guardian", has identified a theme of "characters in a state of alienation ... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question." Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until there comes a point when the character breaks. The journalist <a href="Kira%20Cochrane">Kira Cochrane</a> has identified this as a "trademark moment" in many of her best films, while it has led Burkeman to call her the "queen of the big-screen breakdown". "When she does finally crack", writes journalist <a href="Simon%20Hattenstone">Simon Hattenstone</a>, "it's a sight to behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore." Ben Brantley of "The New York Times" has praised Moore's ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is "peerless" in her "portraits of troubled womanhood". When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is "a bit of a bore". "Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore's specialty", he says, "and it's here that you sense the magic she is capable of."

An interest in portraying "actual human drama" has led Moore to these roles. She is particularly moved by the concept of an individual repressing their troubles and striving to maintain dignity. Parts where the character achieves an amazing feat are of little interest to her, because "we're just not very often in that position in our lives". Early in her career, Moore established a reputation for pushing boundaries, and she continues to be praised for her "fearless" performances and for taking on difficult roles. When asked if there are any roles she has avoided, she replied, "Nothing within the realm of human behaviour." She is known for her willingness to perform nude and appear in sex scenes, although she has said she will only do so if she feels it fits the role.

Regarding her approach to acting, Moore said in a 2002 interview that she leaves 95 percent of the performance to be discovered on set: "I want to have a sense of who a character is, and then I want to get there and have it happen to me on camera." The aim, she said, is to "try to get yourself in a position to let the emotion [happen] to you, that you don't bring the emotion to it ... and when it happens, there's nothing better or more exciting or more rewarding."

Alongside her acting work, Moore has established a career as a <a href="Children%27s%20literature">children's author</a>. Her first book, "Freckleface Strawberry", was published in October 2007 and became a <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"New York Times" Best Seller</a>. Described by "Time Out" as a "simple, sweet and semi-autobiographical narrative", it tells the story of a girl who wishes to be rid of her freckles, but eventually accepts them. Moore decided to write the book when her young son began disliking aspects of his appearance; she was reminded of her own childhood, when she was teased for having freckles and called "Freckleface Strawberry" by other children.

The book has turned into a series with six follow-ups : "Freckleface Strawberry and the Dodgeball Bully" was published in 2009, and "Freckleface Strawberry: Best Friends Forever" in 2011. Both carry the message that children can overcome their own problems. "Freckleface Strawberry: Backpacks!", "Freckleface Strawberry: Lunch, or What's That?" and "Feckleface Strawberry: Loose Tooth!" were released as part of <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> publishers' "Step Into Reading" program. These were followed by "Freckleface Strawberry and the Really Big Voice" in summer 2016.

"Freckleface Strawberry" has been adapted into a musical, written by Rose Caiola and Gary Kupper, which premiered at the <a href="New%20World%20Stages">New World Stages</a>, New York, in October 2010. Moore had an input in the production, particularly through requesting that it retain the book's young target audience. The show has since been licensed and performed at several venues, which she calls "extremely gratifying and extremely flattering".

Moore has written one children's book separate from the "Freckleface Strawberry" series. Released in 2013, "My Mom is a Foreigner, But Not to Me" is based on her experiences of growing up with a mother from another country. The book had a negative reception from "<a href="Publishers%20Weekly">Publishers Weekly</a>" and "<a href="Kirkus%20Reviews">Kirkus Reviews</a>"; while recognizing it as well-intentioned, Moore's use of <a href="verse%20%28poetry%29">verse</a> and rhyme was criticized.

Actor and stage director John Gould Rubin was Moore's first husband, whom she met in 1984 and married two years later. They separated in 1993, and their divorce was finalized in August 1995. "I got married too early and I really didn't want to be there", she has since explained. Moore began a relationship with <a href="Bart%20Freundlich">Bart Freundlich</a>, her director on "The Myth of Fingerprints", in 1996. The couple have a son, Caleb Freundlich (born December 1997) and a daughter, Liv Freundlich (born April 2002). They wed in August 2003 and live in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Moore has commented, "We have a very solid family life, and it is the most satisfying thing I have ever done." She tries to keep her family close when working and picks material that is practical for her as a parent.

Moore is <a href="social%20liberalism">politically liberal</a> and supported <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> at the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202008">2008</a> and <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">2012 presidential elections</a>. She is a <a href="pro-choice">pro-choice</a> activist and sits on the board of advocates for <a href="Planned%20Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a>. She is also a campaigner for <a href="gay%20rights">gay rights</a> and <a href="gun%20control">gun control</a>, and since 2008, she has been an Artist Ambassador for <a href="Save%20the%20Children">Save the Children</a>. Moore is a supporter of the <a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas%20High%20School">Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School</a> students in Parkland, Florida, who organized the <a href="March%20For%20Our%20Lives">March For Our Lives</a>. She also helped release a music video for the group. Moore is an <a href="atheist">atheist</a>; when asked on "<a href="Inside%20the%20Actors%20Studio">Inside the Actors Studio</a>" what God might say to her upon arrival at heaven, she gave God's response as, "Well, I guess you were wrong, I do exist."

Moore's most acclaimed films, according to review-aggregate site <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, include:

Her films that have earned the most at the box office are:

Moore has received five Academy Award nominations, nine Golden Globe nominations, seven SAG nominations, and four BAFTA nominations.

Barn owl

ex

The barn owl ("Tyto alba") is the most <a href="Cosmopolitan%20distribution">widely distributed</a> species of <a href="owl">owl</a> and one of the most widespread of all birds. It is also referred to as the common barn owl, to distinguish it from other species in its <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, <a href="Tytonidae">Tytonidae</a>, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the <a href="typical%20owl">typical owl</a>s (Strigidae). The barn owl is found almost everywhere in the world except <a href="Polar%20region">polar</a> and <a href="desert">desert</a> regions, in Asia north of the <a href="Alpide%20belt">Himalayas</a>, most of <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>, and some <a href="Pacific%20island">Pacific island</a>s.

<a href="Phylogenetics">Phylogenetic</a> evidence shows that there are at least three major lineages of barn owl, one in Europe, western Asia and Africa, one in southeast Asia and Australasia, and one in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>, and some highly divergent <a href="taxon">taxa</a> on islands. Accordingly, some authorities split the group into the <a href="western%20barn%20owl">western barn owl</a> for the group in Europe, western Asia and Africa, the <a href="American%20barn%20owl">American barn owl</a> for the group in the Americas, and the <a href="eastern%20barn%20owl">eastern barn owl</a> for the group in southeast Asia and Australasia. Some taxonomic authorities further split the group, recognising up to five species, and further research needs to be done to clarify the position. There is a considerable variation between the sizes and colour of the approximately 28 subspecies but most are between in length with wingspans ranging from . The plumage on head and back is a mottled shade of grey or brown, the underparts vary from white to brown and are sometimes speckled with dark markings. The face is characteristically heart-shaped and is white in most subspecies. This owl does not hoot, but utters an eerie, drawn-out shriek.

The barn owl is nocturnal over most of its range, but in Britain and some Pacific islands, it also hunts by day. Barn owls specialise in hunting animals on the ground and nearly all of their food consists of small mammals which they locate by sound, their hearing being very acute. They usually mate for life unless one of the pair is killed, when a new pair bond may be formed. Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality, with a clutch, averaging about four eggs, being laid in a nest in a hollow tree, old building or fissure in a cliff. The female does all the incubation, and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food. When large numbers of small prey are readily available, barn owl populations can expand rapidly, and globally the bird is considered to be of <a href="Least%20concern">least conservation concern</a>. Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened.

The barn owl was one of several <a href="species">species</a> of bird first <a href="species%20description">described</a> in 1769 by the <a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrolean</a> physician and naturalist <a href="Giovanni%20Antonio%20Scopoli">Giovanni Antonio Scopoli</a> in his " Anni Historico-Naturales". He gave it the scientific name "Strix alba". As more species of owl were described, the genus name "<a href="Strix%20%28genus%29">Strix</a>" came to be used solely for the wood owls in the typical owl family <a href="Strigidae">Strigidae</a>, and the barn owl became "Tyto alba" in the barn owl family <a href="Tytonidae">Tytonidae</a>. The name literally means "white owl", from the <a href="onomatopoeic">onomatopoeic</a> <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "tyto" (τυτώ) for an owl – compare English "hooter" – and <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "alba", "white". The bird is known by many common names which refer to its appearance, <a href="Bird%20vocalization">call</a>, <a href="habitat">habitat</a>, or its eerie, silent flight: white owl, silver owl, demon owl, ghost owl, death owl, night owl, rat owl, church owl, cave owl, stone owl, monkey-faced owl, hissing owl, hobgoblin or hobby owl, dobby owl, white-breasted owl, golden owl, scritch owl, screech owl, straw owl, barnyard owl, and delicate owl. "Golden owl" might also refer to the related <a href="golden%20masked%20owl">golden masked owl</a> ("T. aurantia"). "Hissing owl" and, particularly in the UK and in India, "screech owl", refers to the piercing calls of these birds. The latter name is also applied to a different group of birds, the <a href="screech-owl">screech-owl</a>s in the genus "<a href="Megascops">Megascops</a>".

The <a href="ashy-faced%20owl">ashy-faced owl</a> ("T. glaucops") was for some time included in "T. alba", and by some authors its populations from the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> still are. Based on <a href="Molecular%20genetics">DNA evidence</a>, König, Weick & Becking (2009) recognised the American Barn Owl ("<a href="Tyto%20furcata">T. furcata</a>") and the Curaçao Barn Owl ("<a href="Tyto%20bargei">T. bargei</a>") as separate species. They also proposed that "T. a. delicatula" should be split off as a separate species, to be known as the eastern barn owl, which would include the subspecies "T. d. sumbaensis", "T. d. meeki", "T. d. crassirostris" and "T. d. interposita". However, the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a> has doubts about this and states that the split of "Tyto delicatula" from "T. alba" "may need to be revisited". Some island subspecies are occasionally treated as distinct species, a move which should await further research into barn owl <a href="phylogeography">phylogeography</a>. According to Bruce in the "Handbook of Birds of the World, Volume 5: Barn-owls to Hummingbirds", "a review of the whole group [is] long overdue". Molecular analysis of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> shows a separation of the species into two <a href="clade">clade</a>s, an Old World "alba" and a New World "furcata", but this study did not include "T. a. delicatula" which the authors seem to have accepted as a separate species. A high amount of genetic variation was also found between the Indonesian "T. a. stertens" and other members of the "alba" clade, leading to the separation of "stertens" into "Tyto javanica".

The barn owl has a wider distribution than any other species of owl. Many subspecies have been proposed over the years but several are generally considered to be <a href="intergrade">intergrade</a>s between more distinct populations. Twenty to thirty are usually recognised, varying mainly in body proportions, size and colour. Island forms are mostly smaller than mainland ones, and those inhabiting forests have darker plumage and shorter wings than those occurring in open grasslands. Barn owls range in colour from the almost beige-and-white <a href="nominate%20subspecies">nominate subspecies</a>, "erlangeri" and "niveicauda", to the nearly black-and-brown "contempta".

In the "Handbook of Birds of the World, Volume 5: Barn-owls to Hummingbirds", the following subspecies are listed:

The barn owl is a medium-sized, pale-coloured owl with long wings and a short, squarish tail. There is considerable size variation across the <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> with a typical specimen measuring about in overall length, with a full range of across the species. Barn owls have a typical wingspan of some , with a full range of . Adult body mass is also variable with male owls from the Galapagos ("T. a. punctatissima") weighing approximately on average while male eastern barn owls ("<a href="Eastern%20barn%20owl">T. javanica</a>") average . The full known weight range for the barn owl species can range from . In general, owls living on small islands are smaller and lighter, perhaps because they have a higher dependence on insect prey and need to be more manoeuvrable. However, the largest bodied race of barn owl, "T. a. furcata" from <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, is also an island race, albeit being found on more sizeable islands with larger prey and few larger owls competing for dietary resources. The shape of the tail is a means of distinguishing the barn owl from <a href="true%20owl">typical owls</a> when seen in the air. Other distinguishing features are the undulating flight pattern and the dangling, feathered legs. The pale face with its heart shape and black eyes give the flying bird a distinctive appearance, like a flat mask with oversized, oblique black eye-slits, the ridge of feathers above the beak somewhat resembling a nose.
The bird's head and upper body typically vary between pale brown and some shade of grey (especially on the forehead and back) in most subspecies. Some are purer, richer brown instead, and all have fine black-and-white speckles except on the <a href="remiges">remiges</a> and <a href="rectrices">rectrices</a> (main wing and tail feathers), which are light brown with darker bands. The heart-shaped face is usually bright white, but in some subspecies it is brown. The left ear is slightly above the eyes on the vertical plane, whereas the right ear is slightly below the eyes. The orientation of the ear coverts in relation to the face also differs between the ears, with a difference of about 15°. The underparts, including the <a href="Tarsometatarsus">tarsometatarsal</a> (lower leg) feathers, vary from white to reddish buff among the subspecies, and are either mostly unpatterned or bear a varying number of tiny blackish-brown speckles. It has been found that at least in the continental European populations, females with more spotting are healthier than plainer birds. This does not hold true for European males by contrast, where the spotting varies according to subspecies. The beak varies from pale horn to dark buff, corresponding to the general plumage hue, and the <a href="iris%20%28eye%29">iris</a> is blackish brown. The feet, like the beak, vary in colour, ranging from pink to dark pinkish-grey and the talons are black.

On average within any one population, males tend to have fewer spots on the underside and are paler in colour than females. The latter are also larger with a strong female "T. alba" of a large subspecies weighing over 550 g (19.4 oz), while males are typically about 10% lighter. <a href="Nestling">Nestling</a>s are covered in white <a href="down%20feather">down</a>, but the heart-shaped facial disk becomes visible soon after hatching.

Contrary to popular belief, the barn owl does not hoot (such calls are made by <a href="typical%20owl">typical owl</a>s, like the <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny owl</a> or other members of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Strix%20%28genus%29">Strix</a>"). It instead produces the characteristic "shree" scream, painful to human hearing at close range, in an eerie, long-drawn-out shriek. Males in courtship give a shrill twitter. Both young and old animals produce a snake-like hiss defense when disturbed. Other sounds produced include a purring chirrup denoting pleasure, and a "kee-yak", which resembles one of the vocalisations of the tawny owl. When captured or cornered, the barn owl throws itself on its back and flails with sharp-taloned feet, making for an effective defence. In such situations it may emit rasping sounds or clicking snaps, produced probably by the beak but possibly by the tongue.

The barn owl is the most widespread landbird species in the world, occurring in every continent except Antarctica. Its range includes all of Europe (except Fennoscandia and Malta), most of Africa apart from the Sahara, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Australia, many Pacific Islands, and North, Central and South America. In general it is considered to be <a href="Sedentism">sedentary</a>, and indeed many individuals, having taken up residence in a particular location, remain there even when better foraging areas nearby become vacant. In the British Isles, the young seem largely to disperse along river corridors and the distance travelled from their natal site averages about .

In continental Europe the distance travelled is greater, commonly somewhere between but exceptionally , with ringed birds from the Netherlands ending up in Spain and in Ukraine. In the United States, dispersal is typically over distances of , with the most travelled individuals ending up some from the point of origin. Movements in the African continent include from Senegambia to Sierra Leone and up to within South Africa. In Australia there is some migration as the birds move towards the northern coast in the dry season and southward in the wet, and also nomadic movements in association with rodent plagues. Occasionally, some of these birds turn up on <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk Island</a>, <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe Island</a> or <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, showing that crossing the ocean is not beyond their capabilities. In 2008, barn owls were recorded for the first time breeding in New Zealand. The barn owl has been successfully introduced into the Hawaiian island of <a href="Kauai">Kauai</a> in an attempt to control rodents, however it has been found to also feed on native birds.

Like most owls, the barn owl is <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>, relying on its acute sense of hearing when hunting in complete darkness. It often becomes active shortly before dusk and can sometimes be seen during the day when relocating from one roosting site to another. In Britain, on various Pacific Islands and perhaps elsewhere, it sometimes hunts by day. This practice may depend on whether the owl is <a href="Mobbing%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mobbed</a> by other birds if it emerges in daylight. However, in Britain, some birds continue to hunt by day even when mobbed by such birds as <a href="Eurasian%20magpie">magpies</a>, <a href="Rook%20%28bird%29">rooks</a> and <a href="black-headed%20gull">black-headed gull</a>s, such diurnal activity possibly occurring when the previous night has been wet making hunting difficult. By contrast, in southern Europe and the tropics, the birds seem to be almost exclusively nocturnal, with the few birds that hunt by day being severely mobbed.

Barn owls are not particularly <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> but have a home range inside which they forage. For males in Scotland this has a radius of about from the nest site and an average size of about 300 hectares. Female home ranges largely coincide with that of their mates. Outside the breeding season, males and females usually roost separately, each one having about three favoured sites in which to conceal themselves by day, and which are also visited for short periods during the night. Roosting sites include holes in trees, fissures in cliffs, disused buildings, chimneys and haysheds and are often small in comparison to nesting sites. As the breeding season approaches, the birds move back to the vicinity of the chosen nest to roost.
The barn owl is a bird of open country such as <a href="arable%20land">farmland</a> or <a href="grassland">grassland</a> with some interspersed woodland, usually at altitudes below but occasionally as high as in the <a href="tropics">tropics</a>. This owl prefers to hunt along the edges of woods or in rough grass strips adjoining pasture. It has an effortless wavering flight as it quarters the ground, alert to the sounds made by potential prey. Like most owls, the barn owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s and a hairlike fringe to the trailing edges help to break up the flow of air over the wings, thereby reducing <a href="turbulence">turbulence</a> and the noise that accompanies it. Hairlike extensions to the <a href="barbule">barbule</a>s of its feathers, which give the plumage a soft feel, also minimise noise produced during wingbeats. The behaviour and ecological preferences may differ slightly even among neighbouring subspecies, as shown in the case of the European "T. a. guttata" and "T. a. alba" that probably evolved, respectively, in <a href="allopatric">allopatric</a> <a href="glacial%20refugia">glacial refugia</a> in southeastern Europe, and in <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberia</a> or southern France.

The diet of the barn owl has been much studied; the items consumed can be ascertained from identifying the prey fragments in the pellets of indigestible matter that the bird regurgitates. Studies of diet have been made in most parts of the bird's range, and in moist temperate areas over 90% of the prey tends to be small mammals, whereas in hot, dry, unproductive areas, the proportion is lower, and a great variety of other creatures are eaten depending on local abundance. Most prey is terrestrial but <a href="bat">bat</a>s and birds are also taken, as well as <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s, <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s and <a href="insect">insect</a>s. Even when they are plentiful and other prey scarce, <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s do not seem to be consumed.

In North America and most of Europe, <a href="vole">vole</a>s predominate in the diet and <a href="shrew">shrew</a>s are the second most common food choice. Mice and rats form the main foodstuffs in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as <a href="plover">plover</a>s, <a href="godwit">godwit</a>s, <a href="turnstone">turnstone</a>s, <a href="Ploceidae">weavers</a> and <a href="pratincole">pratincole</a>s, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of <a href="Leach%27s%20storm%20petrel">Leach's storm petrel</a> ("Oceanodroma leucorhoa"). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the <a href="bank%20vole">bank vole</a> in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.

The barn owl hunts by flying slowly, quartering the ground and hovering over spots that may conceal prey. It may also use branches, fence posts or other lookouts to scan its surroundings, and this is the main means of prey location in the <a href="Elaeis%20guineensis">oil palm</a> plantations of Malaysia. The bird has long, broad wings, enabling it to manoeuvre and turn abruptly. Its legs and toes are long and slender which improves its ability to forage among dense foliage or beneath the snow and gives it a wide spread of talons when attacking prey. Studies have shown that an individual barn owl may eat one or more voles (or their equivalent) per night, equivalent to about twenty-three percent of the bird's bodyweight. Excess food is often <a href="Hoarding%20%28animal%20behavior%29">cached</a> at roosting sites and can be used when food is scarce.

Small prey is usually torn into chunks and eaten completely including bones and fur, while prey larger than about 100 g (4 oz), such as baby <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s, "<a href="Cryptomys">Cryptomys</a>" <a href="blesmol">blesmol</a>s, or "<a href="Otomys">Otomys</a>" vlei rats, is usually dismembered and the inedible parts discarded. Contrary to what is sometimes assumed, the barn owl does not eat domestic animals on any sort of regular basis. Regionally, non-rodent foods are used as per availability. On bird-rich islands, a barn owl might include some fifteen to twenty percent of birds in its diet, while in grassland it will gorge itself on swarming <a href="termite">termite</a>s, or on <a href="Orthoptera">Orthoptera</a> such as <a href="Copiphorinae">Copiphorinae</a> <a href="katydid">katydid</a>s, <a href="Jerusalem%20cricket">Jerusalem cricket</a>s (Stenopelmatidae) or true <a href="cricket%20%28insect%29">cricket</a>s (Gryllidae). Bats and even <a href="frog">frog</a>s, <a href="Squamata">lizards and snakes</a> may make a minor but significant contribution to the diet; small <a href="Soricomorpha">Soricomorpha</a> like "<a href="Suncus">Suncus</a>" shrews may be a secondary prey of major importance.

The barn owl has acute hearing, with ears placed asymmetrically. This improves detection of sound position and distance and the bird does not require sight to hunt. The facial disc plays a part in this process, as is shown by the fact that with the ruff feathers removed, the bird can still locate the source in <a href="azimuth">azimuth</a> but fails to do so in <a href="elevation">elevation</a>. Hunting nocturnally or <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a>ly, this bird can target its prey and dive to the ground, penetrating its talons through snow, grass or brush to seize small creatures with deadly accuracy. Compared to other owls of similar size, the barn owl has a much higher <a href="Metabolism">metabolic rate</a>, requiring relatively more food. Weight for weight, barn owls consume more rodents—often regarded as <a href="pest%20%28organism%29">pest</a>s by humans—than possibly any other creature. This makes the barn owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals for agriculture. Farmers often find these owls more effective than poison in keeping down rodent pests, and they can encourage barn owl habitation by providing nest sites.

Barn owls living in tropical regions can breed at any time of year, but some seasonality in nesting is still evident. Where there are distinct wet and dry seasons, egg-laying usually takes place during the dry season, with increased rodent prey becoming available to the birds as the vegetation dies off. In arid regions, such as parts of Australia, breeding may be irregular and may happen in wet periods, triggered by temporary increases in the populations of small mammals. In <a href="temperate%20climate">temperate climate</a>s, nesting seasons become more distinct and there are some seasons of the year when no egg-laying takes place. In Europe and North America, most nesting takes place between March and June when temperatures are increasing. The actual dates of egg-laying vary by year and by location, being correlated with the amount of prey-rich foraging habitat around the nest site and often with the phase of the rodent abundance cycle. An increase in rodent populations will usually stimulate the local barn owls to begin nesting; thus, even in the cooler parts of its range, two broods are often raised in a good year.
Females are ready to breed at ten to eleven months of age although males sometimes wait till the following year. Barn owls are usually <a href="Monogamy%20in%20animals">monogamous</a>, sticking to one partner for life unless one of the pair dies. During the non-breeding season they may roost separately, but as the breeding season approaches they return to their established nesting site, showing considerable site fidelity. In colder climates, in harsh weather and where winter food supplies may be scarce, they may roost in farm buildings and in barns between hay bales, but they then run the risk that their selected nesting hole may be taken over by some other, earlier-nesting species. Single males may establish feeding territories, patrolling the hunting areas, occasionally stopping to hover, and perching on lofty eminences where they screech to attract a mate. Where a female has lost her mate but maintained her breeding site, she usually seems to manage to attract a new spouse.

Once a pair-bond has been formed, the male will make short flights at dusk around the nesting and roosting sites and then longer circuits to establish a home range. When he is later joined by the female, there is much chasing, turning and twisting in flight, and frequent screeches, the male's being high-pitched and tremulous and the female's lower and harsher. At later stages of courtship, the male emerges at dusk, climbs high into the sky and then swoops back to the vicinity of the female at speed. He then sets off to forage. The female meanwhile sits in an eminent position and <a href="preening%20%28bird%29">preens</a>, returning to the nest a minute or two before the male arrives with food for her. Such feeding behaviour of the female by the male is common, helps build the pair-bond and increases the female's fitness before egg-laying commences.

Barn owls are cavity nesters. They choose holes in trees, fissures in cliff faces, the large nests of other birds such as the <a href="hamerkop">hamerkop</a> ("Scopus umbretta") and, particularly in Europe and North America, old buildings such as farm sheds and church towers. Buildings are preferred to trees in wetter climates in the British Isles and provide better protection for fledglings from inclement weather. Trees tend to be in open habitats rather than in the middle of woodland and nest holes tend to be higher in North America than in Europe because of possible predation by <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s ("Procyon lotor"). No nesting material is used as such but, as the female sits incubating the eggs, she draws in the dry furry material of which her regurgitated <a href="Pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellets</a> are composed, so that by the time the chicks are hatched, they are surrounded by a carpet of shredded pellets. Oftentimes other birds such as <a href="jackdaw">jackdaw</a>s ("Corvus monedula") nest in the same hollow tree or building and seem to live harmoniously with the owls.

Before commencing laying, the female spends much time near the nest and is entirely provisioned by the male. Meanwhile, the male roosts nearby and may <a href="Hoarding%20%28animal%20behavior%29">cache</a> any prey that is surplus to their requirements. When the female has reached peak weight, the male provides a ritual presentation of food and copulation occurs at the nest. The female lays eggs on alternate days and the clutch size averages about five eggs (range two to nine). The eggs are chalky white, somewhat elliptical and about the size of <a href="Bantam%20%28poultry%29">bantam's</a> eggs, and incubation begins as soon as the first egg is laid. While she is sitting on the nest, the male is constantly bringing more provisions and they may pile up beside the female. The incubation period is about thirty days, hatching takes place over a prolonged period and the youngest chick may be several weeks younger than its oldest sibling. In years with plentiful supplies of food, there may be a hatching success rate of about 75%. The male continues to copulate with the female when he brings food which makes the newly hatched chicks vulnerable to injury.
The chicks are at first covered with greyish-white down and develop rapidly. Within a week they can hold their heads up and shuffle around in the nest. The female tears up the food brought by the male and distributes it to the chicks. Initially these make a "chittering" sound but this soon changes into a food-demanding "snore". By two weeks old they are already half their adult weight and look naked as the amount of down is insufficient to cover their growing bodies. By three weeks old, quills are starting to push through the skin and the chicks stand, making snoring noises with wings raised and tail stumps waggling, begging for food items which are now given whole. The male is the main provider of food until all the chicks are at least four weeks old at which time the female begins to leave the nest and starts to roost elsewhere. By the sixth week the chicks are as big as the adults but have slimmed down somewhat by the ninth week when they are fully <a href="fledge">fledge</a>d and start leaving the nest briefly themselves. They are still dependent on the parent birds until about thirteen weeks and receive training from the female in finding, and eventually catching, prey.

Feathers become abraded over time and all birds need to replace them at intervals. Barn owls are particularly dependent on their ability to fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently, and in temperate areas their prolonged moult lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts to moult while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when the male feeds her so she does not need to fly much. The first <a href="primary%20feather">primary feather</a> to be shed is the central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7 and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird's third year of adulthood. The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation is taking place. In the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being moulted the following year.

In temperate areas, the male owl moults rather later in the year than the female, at a time when there is an abundance of food, the female has recommenced hunting and the demands of the chicks are lessening. Unmated males without family responsibilities often start losing feathers earlier in the year. The moult follows a similar prolonged pattern to that of the female and the first sign that the male is moulting is often when a tail feather has been dropped at the roost. A consequence of moulting is the loss of thermal insulation. This is of little importance in the tropics and barn owls here usually moult a complete complement of flight feathers annually. The hot-climate moult may still take place over a long period but is usually concentrated at a particular time of year outside the breeding season.

<a href="Predator">Predator</a>s of the barn owl include <a href="large%20American%20opossum">large American opossum</a>s ("Didelphis"), the <a href="common%20raccoon">common raccoon</a>, and similar carnivorous <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s, as well as <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, larger <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s and other owls. Among the latter, the <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a> ("Bubo virginianus") in the Americas and the <a href="Eurasian%20eagle-owl">Eurasian eagle-owl</a> ("B. bubo") are noted predators of barn owls. Despite some sources claiming that there is little evidence of predation by great horned owls, one study from <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> found that 10.9% of the local great horned owl's diet was made up of barn owls. In Africa, the principle predators of barn owls are <a href="Verreaux%27s%20eagle-owl">Verreaux's eagle-owl</a>s and <a href="cape%20eagle-owl">cape eagle-owl</a>s. In Europe, although less dangerous than the eagle owl, the chief diurnal predators are the <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a> ("Accipiter gentilis") and the <a href="common%20buzzard">common buzzard</a> ("Buteo buteo"). About a dozen other large diurnal raptors and owls have also been reported as predators of barn owls, ranging from the similar-sized <a href="Cooper%27s%20hawk">Cooper's hawk</a> and scarcely larger <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny owl</a> to huge <a href="bald%20eagle">bald</a> and <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s. The goshawk and the eagle owl are on the increase because of the greater protection these birds now receive. 

When disturbed at its roosting site, an angry barn owl lowers its head and sways it from side to side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with its beak. A defensive attitude involves lying flat on the ground or crouching with wings spread out.

Barn owls are hosts to a wide range of parasites. Fleas are present at nesting sites and externally the birds are attacked by <a href="Bird%20louse">feather lice</a> and <a href="feather%20mite">feather mite</a>s which chew the barbules of the feathers and which are transferred from bird to bird by direct contact. Blood-sucking flies such as "Ornithomyia avicularia" are often present, moving about among the plumage. Internal parasites include the <a href="Trematoda">fluke</a> "Strigea strigis", the <a href="tape%20worm">tape worm</a> "Paruternia candelabraria", several species of parasitic <a href="Nematode">round worm</a> and <a href="Acanthocephala">spiny-headed worms</a> in the genus "<a href="Centrorhynchidae">Centrorhynchus</a>". These gut parasites are acquired when the birds feed on infected prey which provide intermediate hosts for the parasites. There is some indication that female birds with more and larger spots have a greater resistance to external parasites. This is correlated with smaller <a href="Bursa%20of%20Fabricius">bursae of Fabricius</a>, glands associated with antibody production, and a lower fecundity of the blood-sucking fly "<a href="Carnus%20hemapterus">Carnus hemapterus</a>" that attacks nestlings.

Unusually for such a medium-sized <a href="carnivorous">carnivorous</a> animal, the barn owl exhibits <a href="r-selection">"r"-selection</a>, producing large number of offspring with a high growth rate, many of which have a relatively low probability of surviving to adulthood. While wild barn owls are thus decidedly short-lived, the actual <a href="longevity">longevity</a> of the species is much higher – captive individuals may reach twenty years of age or more. But occasionally, a wild bird reaches an advanced age. The American record age for a wild barn owl is eleven and a half years, while a Dutch bird was noted to have reached an age of seventeen years, ten months. Another captive barn owl, in England, lived to be over twenty-five years old. Taking into account such extremely long-lived individuals, the average lifespan of the barn owl is about four years, and statistically two-thirds to three-quarters of all adults survive from one year to the next. However, the <a href="wikt%3Amortality">mortality</a> is not evenly distributed throughout the bird's life, and only one young in three manages to live to its first breeding attempt.

The most significant cause of death in temperate areas is likely to be starvation, particularly over the autumn and winter period when first year birds are still perfecting their hunting skills. In northern and upland areas, there is some correlation between mortality in older birds and adverse weather, deep-lying snow and prolonged low temperatures. Collision with road vehicles is another cause of mortality, and may result when birds forage on mown <a href="Road%20verge">verges</a>. Some of these birds are in poor condition and may have been less able to evade oncoming vehicles than fit individuals would have been. Historically, many deaths were caused by the use of <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, and this may still be the case in some parts of the world. Collisions with power-lines kill some birds and shooting accounts for others, especially in Mediterranean regions.

Barn owls are relatively common throughout most of their range and not considered globally threatened. However, locally severe declines from <a href="organochlorine">organochlorine</a> (e.g., <a href="DDT">DDT</a>) poisoning in the mid-20th century and <a href="rodenticide">rodenticide</a>s in the late 20th century have affected some populations, particularly in Europe and North America. Intensification of agricultural practices often means that the rough grassland that provides the best foraging habitat is lost. While barn owls are prolific breeders and able to recover from short-term population decreases, they are not as common in some areas as they used to be. A 1995–1997 survey put their British population at between 3,000 and 5,000 breeding pairs, out of an average of about 150,000 pairs in the whole of <a href="Europe">Europe</a>. In the US, barn owls are listed as <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> in seven <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern states</a>, and in the <a href="European%20Community">European Community</a> they are considered a Species of European Concern. 

In <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, they are no longer common, most likely to be found in coastal <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> south of Vancouver, having become extremely rare in a previous habitat, southern <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. In spite of a Recovery Strategy particularly in 2007-2010 in Ontario, only a handful of wild, breeding barn owls existed in the province in 2018. This is primarily because of disappearing grasslands where bird hunted in the past, but according to a study, also because of "harsh winters, predation, road mortality and use of
rodenticides". The species is listed as endangered overall in Canada due to loss of habitat and a lack of nesting sites.

On <a href="Lanzarote">Lanzarote</a> a somewhat larger number of these birds still seem to exist, but altogether this particular subspecies is precariously rare: Probably less than three hundred and perhaps fewer than two hundred individuals still remain. Similarly, the birds on the western <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> which are usually assigned to the nominate subspecies have declined much, and here wanton destruction seems still to be significant. On <a href="Tenerife">Tenerife</a> they seem relatively numerous but on the other islands, the situation looks about as bleak as on Fuerteventura. Due to their assignment to the nominate subspecies, which is common in mainland <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, the western <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> population is not classified as threatened.
The Canary barn owl is particularly at risk, and as late as 1975, hunting by fearful locals was limiting the population on <a href="Fuerteventura">Fuerteventura</a> where only a few dozen pairs remain.

In some areas, it may be an insufficiency of suitable nesting sites that is the factor limiting barn owl numbers. Nest boxes are popular among conservationists who motivate farmers and land owners to install them for use as natural rodent control.

Common names such as "demon owl", "death owl", "ghost owl" or "lich owl" (from "lich", an old term for a corpse) show that traditionally, rural populations in many places considered barn owls to be birds of evil <a href="omen">omen</a>. For example, the <a href="Tzeltal%20people">Tzeltal people</a> in Mexico regard them as "disease givers". These owls don't "hoot" but emit raspy screeches and hissing noises or that their white face and underbelly feathers that are visible as they fly overhead make them look "ghostly". Consequently, they were often persecuted by farmers who were unaware of the benefits these birds bring. Negative emotions can also be attributed to the false belief that they could eat large animals such as chickens and cats.

The provision of <a href="nest%20box">nest box</a>es under the eaves of buildings and in other locations can be very successful in increasing the local population. The upper bound to the number of barn owl pairs is set by food or nesting sites.

Nest boxes are used primarily when populations suffer declines although these have many causes. Among them are the availability of natural sites. Early successes among conservationists have led to the widespread application of this method which has become the most used form of <a href="Population%20control">population management</a>. The barn owl accepts the provided nest boxes and sometimes prefers them to natural sites, when these are available.

A nest box can also be regarded as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals can lead to the discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.

In Switzerland, a research group aims to install <a href="Radio-frequency%20identification">RFID</a> tag readers on the entrance of the nest boxes, thus allowing tracking of barn owl movements from nest box to nest box. Information about the behavior of the owls prior to breeding could be obtained using surveillance.

In the United Kingdom, the "Barn Owl Nest Box Scheme" is promoted by the World Owl Trust and has many participants in local areas such as <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, where a <a href="webcam">webcam</a> has been set up inside a nest box in which seven young were reared in 2014. Another <a href="The%20Owl%20Box">barn owl nest box</a> live-streaming <a href="webcam">webcam</a> located in California, United States has proved popular online. In May 2012, it was revealed that farmers in <a href="Israel">Israel</a> and <a href="Jordan">Jordan</a> had, over a period of ten years, replaced pesticides with barn owls in a joint conservation venture called "Project Barn Owl".

Other research tools include using <a href="GPS%20tracking%20unit">GPS trackers</a> fitted onto the barn owl allowing precise location tracking of the owl.

In some projects, use of <a href="rodenticide">rodenticide</a>s for biological pest control was replaced by the installation of nest boxes. It has been shown that the use of nest boxes is less costly than traditional control with rodenticides.

In Israel, a first use for pest control was in 1983 at the Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu, where pesticides were becoming a health hazard to local residents. A local farmer sought after an alternative which he found in installing nest boxes.

In Malaysia, large areas of rainforest were felled to make way for oil palm plantations and with few tree cavities for breeding, the barn owl population, with its ability to control rodent pests, diminished. The provision of two hundred nest boxes in a trial saw almost one hundred percent occupancy and as the programme expanded, the plantations supported one of the densest barn owl populations in the world. Similarly, providing nesting boxes has increased the number of barn owls in rice-growing areas of Malaysia where the rodents do much damage to the crop. However, although barn owl numbers have increased in both these instances, it is unclear as to how effective this biological control of the rats is as compared to the trapping and baiting that occurred previously.

Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham

Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, 6th Earl of Stafford, (1402 –10 July 1460) was an English nobleman and a military commander in both the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a> and the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a>. Through his mother he had <a href="royal%20blood">royal blood</a> as a great-grandson of <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">King Edward III</a>, and from his father, he inherited the <a href="Earl%20of%20Stafford">earldom of Stafford</a> at an early age. By his marriage to a daughter of <a href="Ralph%20Neville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Westmorland">Ralph, Earl of Westmorland</a>, Humphrey was not only related to the powerful <a href="House%20of%20Neville">Neville family</a> but to many of the leading aristocratic houses of the time. He joined the English campaign in France with <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">King Henry V</a> in 1420, and following Henry V's death two years later he became a councillor for the new King, the nine-month-old <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">Henry VI</a>. Stafford acted as a peacemaker during the partisan, factional politics of the 1430s, when <a href="Humphrey%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester</a> vied with <a href="Henry%20Beaufort">Cardinal Beaufort</a> for political supremacy. Stafford also took part in the eventual arrest of Gloucester in 1447.

Stafford returned to the French campaign during the 1430s and, as a result of his loyalty and years of service, he was elevated from Earl of Stafford to <a href="Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Duke of Buckingham</a>. Around the same time, his mother died. As much of his estate—as her <a href="dower">dower</a>—had previously been in her hands, Humphrey went from having a reduced income in his early years to being one of the wealthiest and most powerful landowners in England. His lands stretched across much of the country, ranging from East Anglia to the Welsh border. Being such an important figure in the localities was not without its dangers, and for some time he feuded violently with <a href="Thomas%20Malory">Sir Thomas Malory</a> in <a href="the%20Midlands">the Midlands</a>.

After returning from France, Stafford remained in England for the rest of his life, serving King Henry. He acted as the King's bodyguard and chief negotiator during <a href="Jack%20Cade%27s%20rebellion">Jack Cade's rebellion</a> of 1450, helping to suppress it. Similarly, when the King's cousin, <a href="Richard%20of%20York%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20York">Richard, Duke of York</a>, rebelled two years later, Stafford investigated York's followers. In 1453, the King became ill and sank into a catatonic state; law and order broke down further, and the country slid towards civil war. When armed conflict broke out in 1455 Stafford fought for the King in the first battle of the Wars of the Roses, at <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20St%20Albans">St Albans</a>, where they were both captured by the <a href="House%20of%20York">Yorkists</a>. Stafford spent most of his final years attempting to mediate between the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions, the latter by now headed by Henry's Queen, <a href="Margaret%20of%20Anjou">Margaret of Anjou</a>. Partly due to a personal feud with a leading Yorkist—<a href="Richard%20Neville%2C%2016th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick</a>—Stafford eventually declared for King Henry. The weight Stafford could throw behind the royal campaign was responsible for Richard, Duke of York's defeat in 1459, driving York into exile. When the rebels returned the following year they attacked the royal army at <a href="Battle%20of%20Northampton%20%281460%29">Northampton</a>. Acting as the King's personal guard in the ensuing struggle, Stafford was killed and the King was again taken prisoner. Stafford's eldest son had died of <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a> two years earlier, so the Buckingham dukedom descended to Stafford's five-year-old grandson, <a href="Henry%20Stafford%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Henry</a>, a <a href="Ward%20%28law%29">ward</a> of the King until he <a href="Coming%20of%20age">came of age</a> in 1473.

Humphrey Stafford was born in <a href="Stafford">Stafford</a> sometime in December 1402. He was the only son of <a href="Edmund%20Stafford%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Stafford">Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford</a>, and <a href="Anne%20of%20Gloucester">Anne of Gloucester</a>, who was the daughter of Edward III's youngest son <a href="Thomas%20of%20Woodstock%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Thomas of Woodstock</a>. This gave Humphrey royal blood, and made him a second cousin to the then King, <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV</a>.

On 21 July 1403, when Humphrey was less than a year old, his father was killed fighting for King Henry against the rebel <a href="Henry%20Hotspur">Henry Hotspur</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shrewsbury">Battle of Shrewsbury</a>. Humphrey became 6th <a href="Earl%20of%20Stafford">Earl of Stafford</a>. With the earldom came a large estate with lands in more than a dozen counties. Before his mother Anne had married Edmund she had previously been married to Edmund's older brother, Thomas. As a result, she had accumulated two dowries, each comprising a third of the Stafford estates. She occupied these lands for the next twenty years, and Humphrey received a reduced income of less than £1,260 a year until he came of age. As his mother could not, by law, be his <a href="Legal%20guardian">guardian</a>, Humphrey became a royal ward and was put under the guardianship of Henry IV's queen, <a href="Joan%20of%20Navarre%2C%20Queen%20of%20England">Joan of Navarre</a>. His <a href="minor%20%28law%29">minor</a>ity was to be a long one, lasting the next twenty years.

Although Stafford received a reduced inheritance, as the historian Carol Rawcliffe has put it, "fortunes were still to be made in the French wars". Stafford assumed the profession of arms. He fought with <a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">Henry V</a> during the 1420 campaign in France and was <a href="knight">knight</a>ed on 22 April the following year. On 31 August 1422, while campaigning, Henry V contracted <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a> and died. Stafford was present at his death and joined the entourage that returned to England with the royal corpse. When Stafford was later asked by the <a href="royal%20council">royal council</a> if the King had left any <a href="last%20words">final instructions</a> regarding the governance of <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a>, he claimed that he had been too upset at the time to be able to remember. Stafford was still a minor, but parliament soon granted him <a href="Livery%23Sue%20one%27s%20livery">livery</a> of his father's <a href="estate%20%28law%29">estate</a>, allowing him full possession. The grant was based on Stafford's claim that the King had orally promised him this before dying. The grant did not require him to pay a <a href="fee">fee</a> into the <a href="Exchequer%20of%20Pleas">Exchequer</a>, as was normal.

The new King, Henry VI, was still only a baby, so the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">lords</a> decided that the dead King's brothers—<a href="John%20of%20Lancaster%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">John, Duke of Bedford</a> and <a href="Humphrey%20of%20Lancaster%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester</a>—would have to be prominent in this minority government. Bedford, it was decided, would rule as regent in France, while Gloucester would be chief councillor (although not <a href="Protector%20%28title%29">protector</a>) in England. Stafford became a member of the new <a href="Royal%20Council">royal council</a> on its formation. It first met in November 1422 and Stafford was to be an assiduous attender for the next three years. Gloucester repeatedly claimed the title of Protector based on his relationship to the dead King. By 1424, the rivalry between him and his uncle <a href="Henry%20Beaufort">Henry Beaufort</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>—as "de facto" head of council—had become outright conflict. Although Stafford seems to have personally favoured the interests of Gloucester in the latter's struggle for supremacy over Beaufort, Stafford attempted to be a moderating influence. For example, in October 1425, the <a href="Henry%20Chichele">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, the Portuguese <a href="Peter%2C%20Duke%20of%20Coimbra">Duke of Coimbra</a> and Stafford helped to negotiate an end to a burst of violence that had erupted in London between followers of the two rivals. In 1428, when Gloucester again demanded an increase in his power, Stafford was one of the councillors who personally signed a strong statement to the effect that Gloucester's position had been formulated six years earlier, would not change now, and that in any case the King would attain his majority within a few years. Stafford was also chosen by the council to inform Beaufort—now a <a href="Cardinal%20%28Church%20of%20England%29">Cardinal</a>—that he was to absent himself from Windsor until it was decided if he could carry out his traditional duty of Prelate to the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a> now that the <a href="Pope%20Martin%20V">Pope</a> had promoted him.

Stafford was made a knight of the Order of the Garter in April 1429. The following year, he travelled to France with the King for Henry's French coronation, escorting him through the war-torn countryside. The Earl was appointed Lieutenant-General of Normandy, Governor of Paris, and <a href="Constable%20of%20France">Constable of France</a> over the course of his next two years of service there. Apart from one occasion in November 1430 when he and <a href="Thomas%20Beaufort%2C%20Duke%20of%20Exeter">Thomas Beaufort, Duke of Exeter</a> took the English army to support <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip, Duke of Burgundy</a>, Stafford's primary military role at this time was defending Paris and its environs. He also attended the interrogation of <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a> in <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a> in 1431; at some point during these proceedings, a contemporary alleged, Stafford attempted to stab her and had to be physically restrained.

On 11 October 1431 the King created Stafford <a href="Count%20of%20Perche">Count of Perche</a>, which was a province in English-occupied Normandy; he was to hold the title until the English finally withdrew from Normandy in 1450. The <a href="Count%23Definition">county</a> was valued at 800 <a href="Mark%20%28currency%29">marks</a> per annum, although the historian <a href="Michael%20Jones%20%28historian%29">Michael Jones</a> has suggested that due to the war, in real terms "the amount of revenue that could be extracted ... must have been considerably lower". Since Perche was a frontier region, in a state of almost constant conflict, whatever income the estate generated was immediately re-invested in its defence.

In England, the King's minority ended in 1436. In preparation for his personal rule, the council reorganised Henry's <a href="Duchy%20of%20Lancaster">Lancastrian estates</a> to be under the control of local <a href="magnate">magnate</a>s. This gave Stafford responsibility for much of the <a href="north%20Midlands">north Midlands</a>, which was the largest single area of the duchy to be delegated among the nobility. This put the royal <a href="Affinity%20%28medieval%29">affinity</a>—those men retained directly by the Crown to provide a direct link between the King and the localities—at his command.

The centrepiece of Stafford's estates, and his own <a href="Caput%20baroniae">caput</a>, was Stafford Castle. Here he maintained a permanent staff of at least forty people, as well as a large <a href="stable">stable</a>, and it was especially well-placed for recruiting retainers in the <a href="Welsh%20Marches">Welsh Marches</a>, Staffordshire, and <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>. He also had manor houses at <a href="Writtle">Writtle</a> and <a href="Maxstoke">Maxstoke</a>, which he had purchased as part of most of the estates of <a href="John%20Clinton%2C%206th%20Lord%20Clinton">John, Lord Clinton</a>. Writtle was particularly favoured by the Earl, and they were both useful when the royal court was in <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a>. Likewise, he made his base at <a href="Tonbridge%20Castle">Tonbridge Castle</a> when he was acting as Warden of the Cinque Ports or on commission in Kent. His <a href="Marcher%20Lord">Marcher castles</a>—<a href="Caus%20Castle">Caus</a>, <a href="Hay%20Castle">Hay</a>, <a href="Huntingdon%20Castle">Huntingdon</a>, and <a href="Bronllys%20Castle">Bronllys</a>—had, by the 1450s, generally fallen into disrepair, and his other border castles, such as <a href="Brecon%20Castle">Brecon</a> and <a href="Newport%20Castle">Newport</a>, he rarely used. Stafford's <a href="Thornbury%20Castle">Thornbury</a> manor was convenient for <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> and was a stopping point to and from London.

Stafford's mother's death in 1438 transformed his fiscal position. He now received the remainder of his father's estates—worth about £1,500—and his mother's half of the <a href="Bohun%20family">de Bohun</a> inheritance, which was worth another £1,200. The latter also included the <a href="Earl%20of%20Buckingham">earldom of Buckingham</a>, worth £1,000 on its own; Stafford had become one of the greatest landowners in England overnight. "His landed resources matched his titles", explained Albert Compton-Reves, scattered as they were throughout England, Wales and Ireland, with only the King and the <a href="Richard%20of%20York%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20York">Richard, Duke of York</a> wealthier. One assessment of his estates suggests that, by the late 1440s, his income was over £5,000 per annum, and <a href="K.%20B.%20McFarlane">K. B. McFarlane</a> estimated Stafford's total potential income from land to have been £6,300 gross annually, at its peak between 1447 and 1448. On the other hand, the actual yield may have been lower; around £3,700: <a href="renting">rents</a>, for example, were often difficult to collect. Even a lord of the status of <a href="Richard%20Neville%2C%2016th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick</a>, owed Stafford over £100 in unpaid rent for the manor of <a href="Drayton%20Bassett">Drayton Bassett</a> in 1458. In the 1440s and 1450s, Stafford's Welsh estates were particularly notable for both their rent arrears and public disorder. Further—and like most nobles of the period—he substantially overspent, possibly, says Harriss, by as much as £300 a year. His treasurer, <a href="William%20Wistowe">William Wistowe</a>, when rendering his accounts for the years 1452–1453, noted that Stafford was owed £730 by his reckoning, some debts being 20 years old. Despite this, says Woolgar, "there [is] no suggestion that [Stafford] found it difficult to obtain cash or goods".

In <a href="Bastard%20feudalism">the late medieval period</a>, all great lords created an affinity between themselves and groups of supporters, who often lived and travelled with them for purposes of mutual benefit and defence, and Humphrey Stafford was no exception. These men were generally his estate tenants, who could be called upon when necessary for soldiering, as well as other duties, and were often <a href="retainer%20%28medieval%29">retained</a> by <a href="Indentured%20servant">indenture</a>. In the late 1440s his immediate affinity was at least ten knights and twenty-seven <a href="esquire">esquire</a>s, mainly drawn from Cheshire. By the 1450s—a period beginning with political tension and ending with civil war—Stafford retained men specifically "to sojourn and ride" with him. His affinity was probably composed along the lines laid out by royal ordinance at the time which dictated the nobility should be accompanied by no more than 240 men, including "forty gentlemen, eighty yeomen and a variety of lesser individuals", suggested <a href="T.%20B.%20Pugh">T. B. Pugh</a>, although in peacetime Stafford would have required far fewer. It was directly due to the political climate that this increased, especially after 1457. Stafford's <a href="household">household</a> more generally has been estimated at around 150 people by about 1450, and it has been estimated that maintaining both his affinity and household cost him over £900 a year.Along with <a href="Richard%20Beauchamp%2C%2013th%20Earl%20of%20Warwick">Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick</a>, Stafford was the major magnatial influence in <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, so when Warwick left for a lengthy <a href="tour%20of%20duty">tour of duty</a> in France, in 1437, Stafford became the centre of regional power stretching from Warwickshire to Derbyshire. He was sufficiently involved in the royal court and government that he was often unable to attend to the needs of his region. This caused him local difficulties; on 5May 1430 a Leicestershire manor of Stafford's was attacked and he faced problems in Derbyshire in the 1440s, although there, <a href="Helen%20Castor">Helen Castor</a> has said, Stafford "made no attempt to restore peace, nor made any attempt to intervene at all". Stafford also had major estates on the Welsh Marches. This area was prone to regular lawlessness and particularly occupied his time as a royal justice. 

One of the best-known disputes Stafford had with his local gentry was in his Midlands heartlands. This was with <a href="Thomas%20Malory%23Thomas%20Malory%20of%20Newbold%20Revel">Sir Thomas Malory</a>. On 4 January 1450, Malory, with twenty-six other armed men, waited for Stafford near <a href="Coombe%20Abbey">Coombe Abbey</a> woods—near the Stafford's <a href="Newbold%2C%20North%20West%20Leicestershire">Newbold</a> estate—intending to ambush him. Stafford fought back, repelling Malory's small force with sixty <a href="Yeoman">yeomenry</a>. In another episode, Malory stole deer from the earl's park at <a href="Caludon%20Castle">Caludon</a>. Stafford personally arrested Malory on 25 July 1451. The Earl also ended up in a dispute with <a href="William%20Ferrers%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Ferrers%20of%20Groby">William Ferrers</a> of Staffordshire, even though the region was the centre of Stafford's authority and where he may have expected to be strongest. Ferrers had recently been appointed to the county <a href="King%27s%20Bench%20Division">King's Bench</a> and attempted to assert political control over the county as a result. Following Cade's rebellion in 1450, Stafford's park at <a href="Penshurst%20Place">Penshurst</a> was attacked by local men whom the historian <a href="Ralph%20A.%20Griffiths">Ralph Griffiths</a> describes as "concealing their faces with long beards and <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>-blackened faces, calling themselves servants of the queen of the fairies". Towards the end of the decade, not only was he unable to prevent feuding amongst the local gentry, but his own affinity was in discord. This may in part be due to the fact that at this time he was not spending much of his time in the Midlands, preferring to stay close to London and the King, dwelling either at his manors of <a href="Tonbridge">Tonbridge</a> or Writtle.

In July 1436, Stafford, accompanied by Gloucester, the <a href="John%20de%20Mowbray%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a>, and the Earls of <a href="John%20Holland%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Exeter">Huntingdon</a>, Warwick, <a href="Thomas%20de%20Courtenay%2C%205th/13th%20Earl%20of%20Devon">Devon</a>, and <a href="James%20Butler%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Ormond">Ormond</a>, returned to France again with an army of nearly 8,000 men. Although the expedition's purpose was to end the <a href="Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281436%29">siege of Calais</a> by Philip, Duke of Burgundy, the Burgundians had withdrawn before they arrived, leaving behind a quantity of cannon for the English to seize. Subsequent peace talks in France occupied Stafford throughout 1439, and in 1442 he was appointed <a href="List%20of%20Captains%2C%20Lieutenants%20and%20Lords%20Deputies%20of%20English%20Calais">Captain of Calais</a> and the <a href="Fort%20Risban">Risbanke</a> fort, and was indented to serve for the next decade. Before his departure for Calais in September 1442, the garrison had revolted and seized the <a href="Merchants%20of%20the%20Staple">Staple</a>'s wool in lieu of unpaid wages. Stafford received a pledge from the council that if such a situation arose again during his tenure, he would not be held responsible. In light of the secrecy that cloaked Stafford's appointment in 1442, suggests <a href="David%20Grummitt">David Grummitt</a>, it is possible that the revolt had actually been staged by his servants to ensure that Stafford "had entry [to Calais] on favourable terms". Stafford himself emphasised the need to restore order there in his original application for the office. He also received another important allowance, being granted permission to export gold and jewels (up to the value of £5,000 per trip) for his use in France, even though the export of bullion was illegal at the time. He served the full term of his appointment as Calais captain, leaving office in 1451.

Around 1435, Stafford was granted the <a href="Honour%20%28feudal%20barony%29">Honour</a> of <a href="Tutbury">Tutbury</a>, which he held until 1443. Then, says Griffiths, Buckingham proceeded to transfer it one of his councillor's sons. Other offices he held around this time included <a href="Seneschal">Seneschal</a> of <a href="Halton%20%28barony%29">Halton</a> from 1439, and Lieutenant of the Marches from 1442 to 1451. Stafford became less active on the council around the same time. He became <a href="Lord%20Warden%20of%20the%20Cinque%20Ports">Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports</a>, Constable of <a href="Dover%20Castle">Dover Castle</a> and Constable of <a href="Queenborough">Queenborough</a>, on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Sheppey">Isle of Sheppey</a>, in 1450. He again represented the Crown during further peace talks with the French in 1445 and 1446.

In the event, Stafford rarely visited Calais. Factional strife had continued intermittently between Beaufort and Gloucester, and Stafford—who had also been appointed <a href="Constable%20of%20England">Constable of England</a>—was by now firmly in the Beaufort camp. In 1442, he had been on the committee that investigated and convicted Gloucester's wife, <a href="Eleanor%20Cobham">Eleanor Cobham</a>, of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>, and five years later he arrested the Duke at <a href="Bury%20St%20Edmunds">Bury St Edmunds</a> on 18 February 1447 for <a href="treason">treason</a>. Like many others, Stafford profited substantially from Gloucester's fall: when the latter's estates were divided up, the "major prizes" went to the court nobility.

In September 1444, as reward for his loyal and continuous service to the Crown, he was created <a href="Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Duke of Buckingham</a>. By then he was already describing himself as "the Right Mighty Prince Humphrey Earl of Buckingham, Hereford, Stafford, Northampton and Perche, Lord of Brecknock and Holdernesse". Three years later he was granted <a href="Precedence%20of%20peers">precedence</a> over all English dukes not of royal blood. Despite his income and titles he was consistently heavily out of pocket. Although rarely in Calais, he was responsible for ensuring the garrison was paid, and it has been estimated that when he resigned and returned from the post in 1450, he was owed over £19,000 in back wages. This was such a large amount that he was granted the <a href="wool%20trade">wool trade</a> tax from the port of <a href="Sandwich%2C%20Kent">Sandwich, Kent</a> until it was paid off. His other public offices also forced him to spend over his annual income, and he had household costs of over £2,000. He was also a substantial creditor to the government, which was perennially short of cash.

With the outbreak of <a href="Jack%20Cade">Jack Cade</a>'s rebellion, Buckingham summoned about seventy of his tenants from Staffordshire to accompany him while he was in London in May 1450. He was one of the lords commissioned to arrest the rebels as part of a forceful government response on 6 June 1450, and he acted as a negotiator with the insurgents at <a href="Blackheath%2C%20London">Blackheath</a> ten days later. The promises that Buckingham made on behalf of the government were not kept, and Cade's army invaded London. After the eventual defeat of the rebellion, Buckingham headed an investigatory commission designed to pacify rebellious Kent, and in November that year he rode noisily through London—with a retinue of around 1,500 armed men—with the King and other peers, in a demonstration of royal authority intended to deter potential troublemakers in the future. Following the rebellion, Buckingham and his retinue often acted as a <a href="bodyguard">bodyguard</a> to the King.

In 1451, the King's <a href="Royal%20favourite">favourite</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Beaufort%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset</a>, replaced Suffolk as the King's chief councillor, and Buckingham supported Somerset's government. At the same time, he tried to maintain peace between Somerset and York, who by now was Somerset's bitter enemy. When York rebelled in 1452 and confronted the King with a large army at <a href="Dartford">Dartford</a>, Buckingham was again a voice of compromise, and, since he had contributed heavily towards the size of the King's army, his voice was heeded. Buckingham took part in a <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20peace">peace commission</a> on 14 February that month in <a href="Devon">Devon</a>, which prevented <a href="Thomas%20Courtenay%2C%206th/14th%20Earl%20of%20Devon">Thomas Courtenay, Earl of Devon</a> from joining York at Dartford. A year later, in August 1453, King Henry became ill, and slipped into a <a href="Catatonia">catatonic state</a>; government slowly broke down. At Christmas, Buckingham personally presented the King's son—the newly-born <a href="Edward%20of%20Lancaster">Edward, Prince of Wales</a>—to the King. But Henry remained unable to respond. Buckingham took part in the council meeting which resulted in the arrest and subsequent year-long imprisonment of the Duke of Somerset. In the February 1454 parliament Buckingham was appointed <a href="Steward%20of%20England">Steward of England</a>, although Griffiths called this position "largely honorific". This parliament also appointed York as <a href="Lord%20Protector%23Feudal%20Royal%20Regent">Protector</a> of the Realm from 27 March 1454. Buckingham supported York's protectorate, attending York's councils more frequently than most of his fellow councillors. The King recovered his health in January 1455, and, soon after, Somerset was released—or may have escaped—from the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower</a>. A contemporary commented how Buckingham "straungely conveied" Somerset from prison, but it is uncertain whether this was as a result of the King ordering his release or whether Somerset escaped with Buckingham's connivance. Buckingham may well by now have been expecting war to break out, because the same year he ordered the purchase of 2,000 <a href="Heraldic%20badge">cognizances</a>—his personal badge of the '<a href="Stafford%20knot">Stafford knot</a>'—even though strictly the distribution of <a href="livery">livery</a> was illegal.

Following the King's recovery, York was either dismissed from or resigned his protectorship, and together with his <a href="House%20of%20Neville">Neville allies</a>, withdrew from London to their northern estates. Somerset—in charge of government once again—summoned a <a href="Magnum%20Concilium">Great Council</a> to meet in Leicester on 22 May 1455. The Yorkists believed they would be arrested or <a href="Attainder">attainted</a> at this meeting. As a result, they gathered a small force and marched south. The King, with a smaller force that nonetheless included important nobles such as Somerset, Northumberland, Clifford and Buckingham and his son <a href="Humphrey%20Stafford%2C%20Earl%20of%20Stafford">Humphrey, Earl of Stafford</a>, was likewise marching from Westminster to Leicester, and in the early morning of 22 May, royal scouts reported the Yorkists as being only a few hours away. Buckingham urged that they push on to <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>—so that the King might dine—which was not particularly easy to defend. Buckingham also assumed that York would want to <a href="parley">parley</a> before launching an assault on the King, as he had in 1452. The decision to head for the town and not make a stand straight away may have been a tactical error; the contemporary "<a href="A%20Short%20English%20Chronicle">Short English Chronicle</a>" describes how the Lancastrians "strongly barred and arrayed for defence" immediately they arrived.
The King was lodged in the town and York, with the <a href="Richard%20Neville%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Salisbury">Earls of Salisbury</a> and Warwick, encamped to the south. Negotiations commenced immediately. York demanded that Somerset be released into his custody, and the King replaced Somerset as <a href="Lord%20High%20Constable%20of%20England">Lord High Constable</a> with Buckingham, making Somerset subordinate. In that capacity, Buckingham became the King's personal negotiator—Armstrong suggests because he was well known to be able to "concede but not capitulate"—and received and responded to the Yorkists' messengers. His strategy was to play for time, both to prepare the town's defences and to await the arrival of loyalist bishops, who could be counted on to bring the moral authority of the church to bear on the Yorkists. Buckingham received at least three Yorkist embassies, but the King—or Buckingham—refused to give in to the main Yorkist demand, that Somerset be surrendered to them. Buckingham may have hoped that repeated negotiations would deplete the Yorkists' zest for battle, and delay long enough for reinforcements to arrive. Buckingham made what <a href="John%20Gillingham">John Gillingham</a> described as an "insidiously tempting suggestion" that the Yorkists mull over the King's responses in <a href="Hatfield%2C%20Hertfordshire">Hatfield</a> or <a href="Friern%20Barnet">Barnet</a> overnight. Bukingham's confidence in how reasonable the Yorkists would be was misplaced.

The Yorkists realised what Buckingham—"prevaricating with courtesy", says Armstrong—was trying to do and battle commenced while negotiations were still taking place: Richard, Earl of Warwick launched a surprise attack at around ten o'clock in the morning. Buckingham commanded the King's army of 2,500 men, although his coordination of the town's defence was problematic, giving the initiative to the Yorkists. Although the defences that Buckingham had organised successfully checked the Yorkists' initial advance, Warwick took his force through gardens and houses to attack the Lancastrians in the rear. The battle was soon over, and had lasted between half an hour to an hour with only about 50 casualties. They included senior Lancastrian captains: Somerset, the <a href="Henry%20Percy%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Earl of Northumberland</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Clifford%2C%208th%20Baron%20de%20Clifford">Lord Clifford</a> had all been killed. Buckingham himself was wounded three times in the face by arrow fire—and sought <a href="sanctuary">sanctuary</a> in the <a href="St%20Albans%20Cathedral">abbey</a>. His son appears to have been badly wounded. A chronicler reported that some Yorkist soldiers, intent on looting, entered the abbey to kill Buckingham, but that the Duke was saved by York's personal intervention. In any case, says Harriss, Buckingham was probably captured with the King, although he was still able to reward ninety of his retainers from <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> and <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. It is not known for certain whether these men had actually fought with him at St Albans; as <a href="K.%20B.%20McFarlane">K. B. McFarlane</a> points out, many retinues did not arrive in time to fight.

York now had the political upper hand, made himself Constable of England and kept the King as a prisoner, returning to the role of Protector when Henry became ill again. Buckingham swore to "draw the lyne" with York, and supported his second protectorate, although losing <a href="Margaret%20of%20Anjou">Queen Margaret's</a> favour as a result. A contemporary wrote that in April 1456 the Duke returned to his Writtle manor, not looking "well plesid". Buckingham played an important role at the October 1456 Great Council in Leicester. Here, with other lords, he tried to persuade the King to impose a settlement, and at the same time declared that anyone who resorted to violence would receive "ther deserte"—which included any who attacked York.

In 1459, with other lords, he renewed his oath of loyalty to the King and Prince of Wales. Until this point he had been a voice of restraint within the King's faction. But he had been restored to her favour that year and—as she was the "de facto" leader of the party—his realignment was decisive enough that it ultimately hastened the outbreak of hostilities again. Buckingham may also have been partially motivated by financial needs, and encouraged to do so by those retainers reliant on him. He had a bigger retinue than almost any other noble in England and was still the only one who could match York in power and income. This was demonstrated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ludford%20Bridge">Battle of Ludford Bridge</a> in October 1459, where his army played a decisive part in the defeat of the Yorkist forces. Following their defeat, York and the Neville earls fled <a href="Ludlow">Ludlow</a> and went into exile; York to Ireland, the earls to Calais. They were attainted at the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Devils">Coventry parliament</a> later that year, and their estates distributed amongst the Crown's supporters. Buckingham was rewarded by the King with extensive grants from the estates of <a href="Sir%20William%20Oldhall">Sir William Oldhall</a>, worth about £800 per annum. With York in <a href="exile">exile</a>, Buckingham was granted custody of York's wife, <a href="Cecily%20Neville%2C%20Duchess%20of%20York">Cecily, Duchess of York</a>, whom, a chronicler reports, he treated harshly in her captivity.

From the moment the Duke of York and the Neville earls left England it was obvious to the government that they would return; the only question was when. After a series of false alarms in early 1460, they eventually did so in June, landing at Sandwich, Kent. They immediately marched on, and entered, London; the King, with Buckingham and other lords, was in Coventry, and on hearing of the earls' arrival, moved the court to <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a>. The Yorkists left London and marched to the King; they were accompanied by the <a href="Papal%20legate">Papal legate</a> <a href="Francesco%20Coppini">Francesco Coppini</a>. In the lead up to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Northampton%20%281460%29">Battle of Northampton</a>, the Earls of Warwick and <a href="Edward%20IV%20of%20England">March</a> sent envoys to negotiate, but Buckingham—once again the King's chief negotiator, and backed by his son-in-law, the <a href="John%20Talbot%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">Earl of Shrewsbury</a> and Lords <a href="John%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Beaumont">Beaumont</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Percy%2C%201st%20Baron%20Egremont">Egremont</a>—was no longer conciliatory. Buckingham denied the Yorkists' envoys' repeated requests for an <a href="Audience%20%28meeting%29">audience</a> with Henry, denouncing the earls: "the Earl of Warwick shall not come to the King's presence and if he comes he shall die". Buckingham condemned the bishops who had accompanied the Yorkist army as well, telling them that they were not men of peace, but men of war, and there could now be no peace with Warwick. Personal animosity as much as political judgment was responsible for Buckingham's attitude, possibly, suggests Rawcliffe, the result of Warwick's earlier rent evasion. Buckingham's influential voice was chief among those demanding a military response to Warwick and March; the Duke may also have misinterpreted the Yorkists' requests to negotiate as a sign of weakness, seeing the coming battle as an opportunity to settle scores with Warwick. But Buckingham misjudged both the size of the Yorkist army—which outnumbered that of the King—and the loyalty of the Lancastrian army. Whatever plans Buckingham had, says <a href="Carol%20Rawcliffe">Carol Rawcliffe</a>, they "ended abruptly" on the battlefield.

Buckingham's men dug in outside Northampton's southern walls, and fortified behind a tributary of the <a href="River%20Nene">River Nene</a>, close to <a href="Delapr%C3%A9%20Abbey">Delapré Abbey</a>. Battle was joined early on 10 July 1460. Although it was expected to be a drawn-out affair—due to the near-impregnability of the royal position— it was shortened considerably when <a href="Edmund%20Grey%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Kent">Lord Grey of Ruthin</a> turned traitor to the King. Grey "welcomed the Yorkists over the barricades" on the Lancastrian wing and ordered his men to lay down arms, allowing the Yorkists access to the King's camp. Within half an hour, the battle was over. By 2:00pm, Buckingham, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Lord Egremont and Viscount Beaumont, had all been killed by a force of Kentishmen. The Duke was buried shortly after at <a href="Grey%20Friars%20Abbey%2C%20Northampton">Grey Friars Abbey</a> in Northampton.

Buckingham had named his wife Anne sole <a href="executrix">executrix</a> of his <a href="will%20and%20testament">will</a>. She was instructed to provide 200 marks to any clergy who attended his funeral, the remainder being distributed as <a href="poor%20relief">poor relief</a>. She was also to organise the establishment of two <a href="Chantry">chantries</a> in his memory, and, says Barbara Harriss, he left "exceedingly elaborate" instructions for the augmentation of Pleshy <a href="college">college</a>.

Michael Hicks has noted that Buckingham was one of the few Lancastrian loyalists who was never accused by the Yorkists of being an "evil councillor", even though he was—in Hicks's words—"the substance and perhaps the steel within the ruling regime". Although Buckingham was not attainted when the Duke of York's son, the Earl of March, took the throne as King Edward IV in 1461, Buckingham's grandson <a href="Henry%20Stafford%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham">Henry</a> became a royal <a href="ward%20%28law%29">ward</a>, which gave the King control of the Stafford estates during the young duke's minority. Henry Stafford entered into his estates in 1473 but was executed by Edward's brother <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard</a>—by then King, and against whom <a href="Buckingham%27s%20rebellion">Henry had rebelled</a>—in November 1483.

Humphrey Stafford has been described as something of a <a href="wikt%3Ahothead">hothead</a> in his youth, and later in life he was a staunch anti-<a href="Lollardy">Lollard</a>. Lustig suggests that it was probably in connection to this that Sir Thomas Malory attempted his <a href="assassination">assassination</a> around 1450—if indeed he did, as the charge was never proved. Buckingham did not lack the traits traditionally expected of the nobility in this period of the time, particularly, in dispute resolution, that of resorting to violence as a first rather than last resort. For instance, in September 1429, following an altercation with his brother-in-law the Earl of Huntingdon, he arrived at parliament fully armed. On the other hand, he was also a <a href="patron%20of%20the%20arts">literary patron</a>: Lord Scrope presented him with a copy of <a href="Christine%20de%20Pizan">Christine de Pizan</a>'s "<a href="Epistle%20of%20Othea">Epistle of Othea</a>", demonstrating his position as a "powerful and potentially powerful patron", and its dedicatory verse to Buckingham is particularly laudatory. On Buckingham's estates—especially on the Welsh marches—he has been described as a "harsh and exacting landlord" in the lengths he went to in maximising his income. He was also competent in his land deals, and seems never—unlike some contemporaries—to have had to sell land to stay <a href="Solvency">solvent</a>.

G. L. Harriss noted that, although he died a staunch Lancastrian, he never showed any personal dislike of York in the 1450s, and that his personal motivation throughout the decade was loyalty to the Crown and keeping the peace between his peers. Rawcliffe has suggested that although he was inevitably going to be involved in the <a href="high%20politics">high politics</a> of the day, Buckingham "lacked the necessary qualities ever to become a great statesman or leader ... [he] was in many ways an unimaginative and unlikeable man". On the latter quality, Rawcliffe points to his reputation as a harsh taskmaster on his estates and his "offensive behaviour" towards Joan of Arc. Further, she says, his political judgement could be clouded by his attitude. His temper, she says, was "ungovernable".

Humphrey Stafford married <a href="Anne%20Stafford%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Buckingham">Lady Anne Neville</a>, daughter of <a href="Ralph%20de%20Neville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Westmorland">Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland</a> and <a href="Joan%20Beaufort%2C%20Countess%20of%20Westmorland">Lady Joan Beaufort</a> (Westmorland's second wife), at some point before 18 October 1424. Anne Neville was a literary patron in her own right, also receiving a dedication in a copy of Scrope's translated "Othea". On her death in 1480, she left many books in her will. Scholars generally agree that Buckingham and Anne had twelve children, consisting of seven sons and five daughters. Sources conflict over the precise details of the Staffords' progeny. The <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a>, I. W. Dunham, writing in 1907, listed them as Humphrey, Henry, John, Anne (married Aubrey de Vere), Joana (married Viscount Beaumont before 1461), Elizabeth, Margaret (born about 1435, married <a href="Robert%20Dinham">Robert Dinham</a>), and Katherine (married John Talbot before 1467). <a href="James%20Tait%20%28historian%29">James Tait</a> lists the daughters as Anne, Joanna, Elizabeth, Margaret and Catherine and suggests that Elizabeth and Margret never married. Rawcliffe gives the following as dates of birth and death for three of the daughters: Anne (1446–1472), Joan (1442–1484) and Katherine (1437–1476). Edward and the twins, George and William, died young. The seventh son has gone unremarked in the sources.The marriages Buckingham <a href="arranged%20marriage">arranged</a> for his children were structured around strengthening his ties to the Lancastrian royal family. Of particular importance were the marriages of two of his sons, Humphry and Henry. They married into the <a href="House%20of%20Beaufort">Beaufort</a> family, which was descended from the illegitimate children of <a href="John%20of%20Gaunt">John of Gaunt</a> and thus of royal blood. There was also, about 1450, discussion regarding a proposal for one of Buckingham's daughters to marry the <a href="Dauphin%20of%20France">Dauphin of France</a> (subsequently <a href="Louis%20XI%20of%20France">Louis XI</a>). Had it proceeded, it would have again linked the French Crown with the Lancastrian regime.

Buckingham's eldest son, Humphrey, married <a href="Margaret%20Beaufort%2C%20Countess%20of%20Stafford">Margaret Beaufort.</a> She was the daughter of Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and <a href="Eleanor%20Beauchamp%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Somerset">Eleanor Beauchamp</a>. Margaret and Humphrey's son was Buckingham's eventual heir. A second link to the Beaufort family was between Buckingham's second son, <a href="Sir%20Henry%20Stafford">Sir Henry Stafford</a> (c. 1425–1471), who became the third husband of <a href="Lady%20Margaret%20Beaufort">Lady Margaret Beaufort</a>, daughter of <a href="John%20Beaufort%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">John Beaufort, Duke of Somerset</a>, and Margaret Beauchamp. Margaret Beaufort had previously been married to <a href="Edmund%20Tudor%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Richmond">Edmund Tudor</a>, the eldest half-brother of Henry VI, and had given birth to the future King <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a> two months after Edmund's death. She and Henry were childless. Buckingham's third surviving son, <a href="John%20Stafford%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Wiltshire">John</a> (died 8 May 1473) married Constance Green of <a href="Drayton%2C%20Leicestershire">Drayton</a>, who had previously been the duke's ward. Humphrey Stafford assigned them the <a href="manor">manor</a> of <a href="Newton%20Blossomville">Newton Blossomville</a> at the time of their marriage. John was created <a href="Earl%20of%20Wiltshire">Earl of Wiltshire</a> in 1470.

Buckingham arranged good but costly marriages for three of his daughters. Anne married Aubrey de Vere, son of <a href="John%20de%20Vere%2C%2012th%20Earl%20of%20Oxford">John de Vere</a>, Earl of Oxford. Their 1452 marriage cost Buckingham 2,300 marks; he was slow to pay, and still owed Oxford over £440 seven years later. In 1452, Joan married William Beaumont, heir of <a href="William%20Beaumont%2C%202nd%20Viscount%20Beaumont">Viscount Beaumont</a>. Katherine married <a href="John%20Talbot%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">John Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury</a> six years later. Buckingham had apparently promised to give them £1,000 but died before acting on the promise.

<a href="T.%20L.%20Lustig">T. L.

Mayfly

Mayflies (also known as Canadian soldiers in the United States, and as shadflies or fishflies in Canada and the upper Midwestern U.S.; also up-winged flies in the United Kingdom) are <a href="aquatic%20insect">aquatic insect</a>s belonging to the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> Ephemeroptera. This order is part of an ancient group of insects termed the <a href="Palaeoptera">Palaeoptera</a>, which also contains <a href="dragonfly">dragonflies</a> and <a href="damselfly">damselflies</a>. Over 3,000 <a href="species">species</a> of mayfly are known worldwide, grouped into over 400 <a href="genus">genera</a> in 42 <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>.

Mayflies exhibit a number of ancestral traits that were probably present in the first flying insects, such as long tails and wings that do not fold flat over the <a href="insect%20morphology%23Abdomen">abdomen</a>. Their immature stages are aquatic <a href="fresh%20water">fresh water</a> forms (called "naiads" or "<a href="nymph%20%28biology%29">nymphs</a>"), whose presence indicates a clean, unpolluted environment. They are unique among insect orders in having a fully winged terrestrial adult stage, the subimago, which <a href="moulting">moults</a> into a sexually mature adult, the <a href="imago">imago</a>.

Mayflies "hatch" (emerge as adults) from spring to autumn, not necessarily in May, in enormous numbers. Some hatches attract tourists. <a href="Fly%20fishing">Fly fishermen</a> make use of mayfly hatches by choosing <a href="artificial%20fly">artificial fishing flies</a> that resemble the species in question. One of the most famous English mayflies is "<a href="Rhithrogena%20germanica">Rhithrogena germanica</a>", the fisherman's "March brown mayfly".

The brief lives of mayfly adults have been noted by naturalists and encyclopaedists since <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> in classical times. The German engraver <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> included a mayfly in his 1495 engraving "<a href="The%20Holy%20Family%20with%20the%20Mayfly">The Holy Family with the Mayfly</a>" to suggest a link between heaven and earth. The English poet <a href="George%20Crabbe">George Crabbe</a> compared the brief life of a daily newspaper with that of a mayfly in the satirical poem "The Newspaper" (1785), both being known as "ephemera".

Immature mayflies are <a href="aquatic%20insect">aquatic</a> and are referred to as nymphs or naiads. In contrast to their short lives as adults, they may live for several years in the water. They have an elongated, cylindrical or somewhat flattened body that passes through a number of <a href="instar">instar</a>s (stages), molting and increasing in size each time. When ready to emerge from the water, nymphs vary in length, depending on species, from . The <a href="insect%20morphology%23Head">head</a> has a tough outer covering of <a href="sclerotin">sclerotin</a>, often with various hard ridges and projections; it points either forwards or downwards, with the mouth at the front. There are two large <a href="arthropod%20eye">compound eyes</a>, three <a href="ocelli">ocelli</a> (simple eyes) and a pair of <a href="antenna%20%28biology%29">antennae</a> of variable lengths, set between or in front of the eyes. The mouthparts are designed for chewing and consist of a flap-like <a href="labrum%20%28arthropod%20mouthpart%29">labrum</a>, a pair of strong <a href="mandible%20%28insect%20mouthpart%29">mandibles</a>, a pair of <a href="maxilla%20%28arthropod%20mouthpart%29">maxillae</a>, a membranous <a href="Insect%20mouthparts%23Hypopharynx">hypopharynx</a> and a <a href="labium%20%28insect%29">labium</a>.
The <a href="Insect%20morphology%23Thorax">thorax</a> consists of three segments – the hindmost two, the <a href="mesothorax">mesothorax</a> and <a href="metathorax">metathorax</a>, being fused. Each segment bears a pair of legs which usually terminate in a single claw. The legs are robust and often clad in bristles, hairs or spines. Wing pads develop on the mesothorax, and in some species, hindwing pads develop on the metathorax.

The <a href="Insect%20morphology%23Abdomen">abdomen</a> consists of ten segments, some of which may be obscured by a large pair of <a href="operculum%20%28animal%29">operculate</a> gills, a thoracic shield (expanded part of the <a href="prothorax">prothorax</a>) or the developing wing pads. In most <a href="taxon">taxa</a> up to seven pairs of <a href="gill">gill</a>s arise from the top or sides of the abdomen, but in some species they are under the abdomen, and in a very few species the gills are instead located on the <a href="arthropod%20leg">coxae</a> of the legs, or the bases of the maxillae. The abdomen terminates in a pair of, or three, slender thread-like projections.

The final moult of the nymph is not to the full adult form, but to a winged stage called a subimago that physically resembles the adult, but which is usually sexually immature and duller in colour. The subimago often has partially cloudy wings fringed with minute hairs; its eyes, legs and <a href="Insect%20reproductive%20system">genitalia</a> are not fully developed. Subimagos are generally poor fliers, and typically lack the colour patterns used to attract mates. After a period, usually lasting one or two days but in some species only a few minutes, the subimago moults to the full adult form, making mayflies the only insects where a winged form undergoes a further moult.

Adult mayflies, or <a href="imago">imago</a>s, are relatively primitive in structure, exhibiting traits that were probably present in the first flying insects. These include long tails and wings that do not fold flat over the abdomen. Mayflies are delicate-looking insects with one or two pairs of membranous, triangular wings, which are extensively covered with <a href="Insect%20wing%23Venation">veins</a>. At rest, the wings are held upright, like those of a <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a>. The hind wings are much smaller than the forewings and may be vestigial or absent. The second segment of the <a href="thorax%20%28insect%20anatomy%29">thorax</a>, which bears the forewings, is enlarged to hold the main flight muscles. Adults have short, flexible antennae, large compound eyes, three ocelli and non-functional mouthparts. In most species, the males' eyes are large and the front legs unusually long, for use in locating and grasping females during the mid-air mating. In the males of some families, there are two large cylindrical "turban" eyes that face upwards in addition to the lateral eyes. They are capable of detecting ultraviolet light and are thought to be used during courtship to detect females flying above them. In some species, all the legs are functionless, apart from the front pair in males. The abdomen is long and roughly cylindrical, with ten segments and two or three long <a href="Cercus">cerci</a> (tail-like appendages) at the tip. Uniquely among insects, mayflies possess paired genitalia, with the male having two <a href="aedeagus">aedeagi</a> (penis-like organs) and the female two <a href="gonopore">gonopore</a>s (sexual openings).

Mayflies are <a href="hemimetabolism">hemimetabolous</a> (they have "incomplete <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a>"). They are unique among insects in that they moult one more time after acquiring functional wings; this last-but-one winged (<a href="alate">alate</a>) instar usually lives a very short time and is known as a subimago, or to fly fishermen as a dun. Mayflies at the subimago stage are a favourite food of many fish, and many <a href="artificial%20fly">fishing flies</a> are modelled to resemble them. The subimago stage does not survive for long, rarely for more than 24 hours. In some species, it may last for just a few minutes, while the mayflies in the family <a href="Palingeniidae">Palingeniidae</a> have sexually mature subimagos and no true adult form at all.
Often, all the mayflies in a population mature at once (a hatch), and for a day or two in the spring or autumn, mayflies are everywhere, dancing around each other in large groups, or resting on every available surface. In many species the emergence is synchronised with dawn or dusk, and light intensity seems to be an important cue for emergence, but other factors may also be involved. "<a href="Baetis%20intercalaris">Baetis intercalaris</a>", for example, usually emerges just after sunset in July and August, but in one year, a large hatch was observed at midday in June. The soft-bodied subimagos are very attractive to predators. Synchronous emergence is probably an <a href="antipredator%20adaptation">adaptive strategy</a> that reduces the individual's <a href="Predator%20satiation">risk of being eaten</a>. The lifespan of an adult mayfly is very short, varying with the species. The primary function of the adult is reproduction; adults do not feed, and have only <a href="vestigiality">vestigial</a> (unusable) <a href="Insect%20mouthparts">mouthparts</a>, while their digestive systems are filled with air. "<a href="Dolania%20americana">Dolania americana</a>" has the shortest adult lifespan of any mayfly: the adult females of the species live for less than five minutes.

Male adults may patrol individually, but most congregate in swarms a few metres above water with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial (courtship) dance. Each insect has a characteristic up-and-down pattern of movement; strong wingbeats propel it upwards and forwards with the tail sloping down; when it stops moving its wings, it falls passively with the abdomen tilted upwards. Females fly into these swarms, and mating takes place in the air. A rising male clasps the thorax of a female from below using his front legs bent upwards, and inseminates her. Copulation may last just a few seconds, but occasionally a pair remains in tandem and flutters to the ground. Males may spend the night in vegetation and return to the nuptial dance the following day. Although they do not feed, some briefly touch the surface to drink a little water before flying off.

Females typically lay between four hundred and three thousand eggs. The eggs are often dropped onto the surface of the water; sometimes the female deposits them by dipping the tip of her abdomen into the water during flight, releasing a small batch of eggs each time, or deposits them in bulk while standing next to the water. In a few species, the female submerges and places the eggs among plants or in crevices underwater, but in general, they sink to the bottom. The incubation time is variable, depending at least in part on temperature, and may be anything from a few days to nearly a year. Eggs can go into a quiet dormant phase or <a href="diapause">diapause</a>. The <a href="larva">larva</a>l growth rate is also temperature-dependent, as is the number of <a href="ecdysis">moults</a>. At anywhere between ten and fifty, these post-embryonic moults are more numerous in mayflies than in most other insect orders. The nymphal stage of mayflies may last from several months to several years, depending on species and environmental conditions.

Many species breed in moving water, where there is a tendency for the eggs and nymphs to get washed downstream. To counteract this, females may fly upriver before depositing their eggs. For example, the female <a href="Palingenia%20longicauda">Tisza mayfly</a>, the largest European species with a length of , flies up to upstream before depositing eggs on the water surface. These sink to the bottom and hatch after 45 days, the nymphs burrowing their way into the sediment where they spend two or three years before hatching into subimagos.

When ready to emerge, several different strategies are used. In some species, the transformation of the nymph occurs underwater and the subimago swims to the surface and launches itself into the air. In other species, the nymph rises to the surface, bursts out of its skin, remains quiescent for a minute or two resting on the <a href="exuvia">exuvia</a>e (cast skin) and then flies upwards, and in some, the nymph climbs out of the water before transforming.

Nymphs live primarily in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation, or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, but they are among the most prolific. For example, the emergence of one species of "Hexagenia" was recorded on <a href="Weather%20radar">Doppler weather radar</a> by the shoreline of <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a> in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud at the bottom of ponds in which "<a href="Ephemera%20vulgata">Ephemera vulgata</a>" burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.

In most species, the nymphs are <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s or <a href="detritivore">detritivore</a>s, feeding on <a href="algae">algae</a>, <a href="diatom">diatom</a>s or <a href="detritus">detritus</a>, but in a few species, they are <a href="Predation">predators</a> of <a href="Chironomidae">chironomid</a> and other small insect larvae and nymphs. Nymphs of "Povilla" burrow into submerged wood and can be a problem for boat owners in Asia. Some are able to shift from one feeding group to another as they grow, thus enabling them to utilise a variety of food resources. They process a great quantity of organic matter as nymphs and transfer a lot of phosphates and nitrates to terrestrial environments when they emerge from the water, thus helping to remove pollutants from aqueous systems. Along with <a href="caddisfly">caddisfly</a> larvae and <a href="gastropoda">gastropod molluscs</a>, the grazing of mayfly nymphs has a significant impact on the <a href="primary%20producers">primary producers</a>, the plants and algae, on the bed of streams and rivers.

The nymphs are eaten by a wide range of predators and form an important part of the aquatic <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>. Fish are among the main predators, picking nymphs off the bottom or ingesting them in the water column, and feeding on emerging nymphs and adults on the water surface. Carnivorous <a href="Plecoptera">stonefly</a>, <a href="caddisfly">caddisfly</a>, <a href="alderfly">alderfly</a> and <a href="dragonfly">dragonfly</a> larvae feed on bottom-dwelling mayfly nymphs, as do aquatic beetles, leeches, crayfish and <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s. Besides the direct mortality caused by these predators, the behaviour of their potential prey is also affected, with the nymphs' growth rate being slowed by the need to hide rather than feed. The nymphs are highly susceptible to <a href="Water%20pollution">pollution</a> and can be useful in the <a href="biomonitoring">biomonitoring</a> of water bodies. Once they have emerged, large numbers are preyed on by birds, bats and by other insects.

Mayfly nymphs may serve as <a href="Host%20%28biology%29">hosts</a> for <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s such as <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s and <a href="Trematoda">trematodes</a>. Some of these affect the nymphs' behaviour in such a way that they become more likely to be predated. Other nematodes turn adult male mayflies into quasi-females which haunt the edges of streams, enabling the parasites to break their way out into the aqueous environment they need to complete their life cycles. The nymphs can also serve as <a href="intermediate%20hosts">intermediate hosts</a> for the horsehair worm "<a href="Paragordius%20varius">Paragordius varius</a>", which causes its <a href="definitive%20host">definitive host</a>, a <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>, to jump into water and drown.

Mayflies are involved in both <a href="primary%20production">primary production</a> and <a href="bioturbation">bioturbation</a>. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the mayfly genus "<a href="Centroptilum">Centroptilum</a>" increased the export of <a href="periphyton">periphyton</a>, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats through the process of <a href="bioturbation">bioturbation</a>. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing to the bottom of the lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus "Isonychia". The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form that goes on to benefit consumers later in the food chain.

Mayflies are distributed all over the world in clean freshwater habitats, though absent from Antarctica. They tend to be absent from oceanic islands or represented by one or two species that have dispersed from nearby mainland. Female mayflies may be dispersed by wind, and eggs may be transferred by adhesion to the legs of waterbirds. The greatest generic diversity is found in the <a href="Neotropic%20ecozone">Neotropic ecozone</a>, while the <a href="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> has a smaller number of genera but a high degree of speciation. Some thirteen families are restricted to a single <a href="bioregion">bioregion</a>. The main families have some general habitat preferences: the Baetidae favour warm water; the Heptageniidae live under stones and prefer fast-flowing water; and the relatively large Ephemeridae make burrows in sandy lake or river beds.

The nymph is the dominant life history stage of the mayfly. Different insect species vary in their tolerance to water pollution, but in general, the larval stages of mayflies, stoneflies (Plecoptera) and caddis flies (Trichoptera) are susceptible to a number of pollutants including <a href="sewage">sewage</a>, <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s and <a href="Industrial%20wastewater%20treatment">industrial effluent</a>. In general, mayflies are particularly sensitive to <a href="Freshwater%20acidification">acidification</a>, but tolerances vary, and certain species are exceptionally tolerant to <a href="Toxic%20heavy%20metal">heavy metal</a> contamination and to low <a href="pH">pH</a> levels. <a href="Ephemerellidae">Ephemerellidae</a> are among the most tolerant groups and <a href="Siphlonuridae">Siphlonuridae</a> and <a href="Caenidae">Caenidae</a> the least. The adverse effects on the insects of pollution may be either lethal or sub-lethal, in the latter case resulting in altered enzyme function, poor growth, changed behaviour or lack of reproductive success. As important parts of the food chain, pollution can cause knock-on effects to other organisms; a dearth of herbivorous nymphs can cause overgrowth of algae, and a scarcity of predacious nymphs can result in an over-abundance of their prey species. Fish that feed on mayfly nymphs that have <a href="Bioaccumulation">bioaccumulated</a> heavy metals are themselves at risk. Adult female mayflies find water by detecting the <a href="polarization%20%28waves%29">polarization</a> of reflected light. They are easily fooled by other polished surfaces which can act as traps for swarming mayflies.

The threat to mayflies applies also to their eggs. "Modest levels" of pollution in rivers in England are sufficient to kill 80% of mayfly eggs, which are as vulnerable to pollutants as other life-cycle stages; numbers of the <a href="blue-winged%20olive%20mayfly">blue-winged olive mayfly</a> ("Baetis") have fallen dramatically, almost to none in some rivers. The major pollutants thought to be responsible are fine sediment and phosphate from agriculture and sewage.

The status of many species of mayflies is unknown because they are known from only the original collection data. Four North American species are believed to be extinct. Among these, "<a href="Pentagenia%20robusta">Pentagenia robusta</a>" was originally collected from the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> near <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, but this species has not been seen since its original collection in the 1800s. "<a href="Ephemera%20compar">Ephemera compar</a>" is known from a single specimen, collected from the "foothills of Colorado" in 1873, but despite intensive surveys of the Colorado mayflies reported in 1984, it has not been rediscovered.

The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">red list</a> of threatened species includes one mayfly: "<a href="Tasmanophlebi%20lacuscoerulei">Tasmanophlebi lacuscoerulei</a>", the large blue lake mayfly, which is a native of <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and is listed as <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> because its alpine habitat is vulnerable to climate change.

Over 3,000 species of mayfly in 42 families and over 400 genera are known worldwide, including about 630 species in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. Mayflies are an ancient group of winged (pterygote) insects. Putative fossil <a href="stem%20group">stem group</a> representatives (e.g. Syntonopteroidea-like "Lithoneura lameerrei") are already known from the late <a href="Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a>. The largest mayfly of all times may have been "Bojophlebia prokopi" from the Upper Carboniferous of <a href="Moravia">Moravia</a> with a wingspan of . The name Ephemeroptera is from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> ἐφήμερος, ' "short-lived" (literally "lasting a day", cf. English "<a href="ephemeral">ephemeral</a>"), and πτερόν, ', "<a href="insect%20wing">wing</a>", referring to the brief lifespan of adults. The English common name is for the insect's emergence in or around the month of May in the UK. The name shadfly is from the Atlantic fish the <a href="shad">shad</a>, which runs up American East Coast rivers at the same time as many mayflies emerge.

From the <a href="Permian">Permian</a>, numerous stem group representatives of mayflies are known, which are often lumped into a separate taxon <a href="Permoplectoptera">Permoplectoptera</a> (e.g. including "Protereisma permianum" in the <a href="Protereismatidae">Protereismatidae</a>, and <a href="Misthodotidae">Misthodotidae</a>). The larvae of Permoplectoptera still had 9 pairs of abdominal gills, and the adults still had long hindwings. Maybe the fossil family <a href="Cretereismatidae">Cretereismatidae</a> from the <a href="Lower%20Cretaceous">Lower Cretaceous</a> <a href="Crato%20Formation">Crato Formation</a> of Brazil also belongs as the last offshoot to Permoplectoptera. The Crato outcrops otherwise yielded fossil specimens of modern mayfly families or the extinct (but modern) family Hexagenitidae. However, from the same locality the strange larvae and adults of the extinct family <a href="Mickoleitiidae">Mickoleitiidae</a> (order <a href="Coxoplectoptera">Coxoplectoptera</a>) have been described, which represents the fossil sister group of modern mayflies, even though they had very peculiar adaptations such as <a href="Raptor%20%28bird%29">raptorial</a> forelegs.

The oldest mayfly inclusion in <a href="amber">amber</a> is "Cretoneta zherichini" (Leptophlebiidae) from the Lower Cretaceous of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. In the much younger <a href="Baltic%20amber">Baltic amber</a> numerous inclusions of several modern families of mayflies have been found (Ephemeridae, Potamanthidae, Leptophlebiidae, Ametropodidae, Siphlonuridae, Isonychiidae, Heptageniidae, and Ephemerellidae). The modern genus "<a href="Neoephemera">Neoephemera</a>" is represented in the fossil record by the <a href="Ypresian">Ypresian</a> species "<a href="Neoephemera%20antiqua">N. antiqua</a>" from <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington State</a>.

Grimaldi and Engel, reviewing the <a href="Evolution%20of%20insects">phylogeny</a> in 2005, commented that many <a href="Cladistics">cladistic</a> studies had been made with no stability in Ephemeroptera suborders and infraorders; the traditional division into Schistonota and Pannota was wrong because Pannota is derived from the Schistonota.
The phylogeny of the Ephemeroptera was first studied using molecular analysis by Ogden and Whiting in 2005. They recovered the <a href="Baetidae">Baetidae</a> as sister to the other clades.
Mayfly phylogeny was further studied using morphological and molecular analyses by Ogden and others in 2009. They found that the Asian genus "Siphluriscus" was sister to all other mayflies. Some existing lineages such as <a href="Ephemeroidea">Ephemeroidea</a>, and families such as Ameletopsidae, were found not to be <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic</a>, through convergence among nymphal features.

The following traditional classification is based on Peters and Campbell (1991), in "Insects of Australia".
Suborder <a href="Pannota">Pannota</a>

The <a href="Ancient%20Greek%20philosophy">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="Aristotle%27s%20biology">biologist</a> and philosopher <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> wrote in his "<a href="History%20of%20Animals">History of Animals</a>" that

The <a href="Ancient%20Roman">Ancient Roman</a> encyclopaedist <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> described the mayfly as the "hemerobius" in his "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>":

The <a href="Dutch%20Golden%20Age">Dutch Golden Age</a> author Augerius Clutius () illustrated some mayflies in his 1634 "De Hemerobio" ("On the Mayfly"), the earliest book written on the group. <a href="Maerten%20de%20Vos">Maerten de Vos</a> similarly illustrated a mayfly in his 1587 depiction of the fifth day of creation, amongst an assortment of fish and water birds.
In 1495 <a href="Albrecht%20D%C3%BCrer">Albrecht Dürer</a> included a mayfly in his engraving "<a href="The%20Holy%20Family%20with%20the%20Dragonfly">The Holy Family with the Mayfly</a>". The critics <a href="Larry%20Silver">Larry Silver</a> and <a href="Pamela%20H.%20Smith">Pamela H. Smith</a> argue that the image provides "an explicit link between heaven and earth .. to suggest a cosmic resonance between sacred and profane, celestial and terrestrial, macrocosm and microcosm."
In his 1789 book "<a href="The%20Natural%20History%20and%20Antiquities%20of%20Selborne">The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</a>", <a href="Gilbert%20White">Gilbert White</a> described in the entry for "June 10th, 1771" how
The mayfly has come to symbolise the transitoriness and brevity of life. The English poet <a href="George%20Crabbe">George Crabbe</a>, known to have been interested in insects, compared the brief life of a <a href="newspaper">newspaper</a> with that of mayflies, both being known as "Ephemera", things that live for a day:

The theme of brief life is echoed in the artist Douglas Florian's 1998 poem, "The Mayfly". The <a href="Poet%20Laureate%20Consultant%20in%20Poetry%20to%20the%20Library%20of%20Congress">American Poet Laureate</a> <a href="Richard%20Wilbur">Richard Wilbur</a>'s 2005 poem "Mayflies" includes the lines "I saw from unseen pools a mist of flies, In their quadrillions rise, And animate a ragged patch of glow, With sudden glittering".

Another literary reference to mayflies is seen in "<a href="Epic%20of%20Gilgamesh">The Epic of Gilgamesh</a>", one of the earliest surviving great works of literature. The briefness of Gilgamesh's life is compared to that of the adult mayfly.

In <a href="Szeged">Szeged</a>, Hungary, mayflies are celebrated in a monument near the Belvárosi bridge, the work of local sculptor Pal Farkas, depicting the courtship dance of mayflies.

The American playwright <a href="David%20Ives">David Ives</a> wrote a short comedic play, "Time Flies", in 2001, as to what two mayflies might discuss during their one day of existence.

Mayflies are the primary source of models for artificial flies, hooks tied with coloured materials such as threads and feathers, used in <a href="fly%20fishing">fly fishing</a>. These are based on different life-cycle stages of mayflies. For example, the flies known as "emergers" in North America are designed by fly fishermen to resemble subimago mayflies, and are intended to lure freshwater <a href="trout">trout</a>. In 1983, Patrick McCafferty recorded that artificial flies had been based on 36 genera of North American mayfly, from a total of 63 western species and 103 eastern/central species. A large number of these species have common names among fly fishermen, who need to develop a substantial knowledge of mayfly "habitat, distribution, seasonality, morphology and behavior" in order to match precisely the look and movements of the insects that the local trout are expecting.

<a href="Izaak%20Walton">Izaak Walton</a> describes the use of mayflies for catching trout in his 1653 book "<a href="The%20Compleat%20Angler">The Compleat Angler</a>"; for example, he names the "Green-drake" for use as a natural fly, and "duns" (mayfly subimagos) as artificial flies. These include for example the "Great Dun" and the "Great Blue Dun" in February; the "Whitish Dun" in March; the "Whirling Dun" and the "Yellow Dun" in April; the "Green-drake", the "Little Yellow May-Fly" and the "Grey-Drake" in May; and the "Black-Blue Dun" in July. Nymph or "wet fly" fishing was restored to popularity on the <a href="chalk%20stream">chalk stream</a>s of England by <a href="G.%20E.%20M.%20Skues">G. E. M. Skues</a> with his 1910 book "<a href="Minor%20Tactics%20of%20the%20Chalk%20Stream">Minor Tactics of the Chalk Stream</a>". In the book, Skues discusses the use of duns to catch trout. The March brown is "probably the most famous of all British mayflies", having been copied by <a href="angling">angler</a>s to catch trout for over 500 years.

Some English <a href="public%20house">public house</a>s beside trout streams such as the <a href="River%20Test">River Test</a> in <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> are named "The Mayfly".

The hatch of the giant mayfly "Palingenia longicauda" on the <a href="Tisza">Tisza</a> and <a href="Maros%20River">Maros River</a>s in <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> and <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>, known as "Tisza blooming", is a tourist attraction. The 2014 hatch of the large black-brown mayfly "<a href="Hexagenia%20bilineata">Hexagenia bilineata</a>" on the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> in the US was imaged on weather radar; the swarm flew up to 760 m (2500 feet) above the ground near <a href="La%20Crosse%2C%20Wisconsin">La Crosse, Wisconsin</a>, creating a radar signature that resembled a "significant rain storm", and the mass of dead insects covering roads, cars and buildings caused a "slimy mess".

During the weekend of June 13–14, 2015, a large swarm of mayflies caused several vehicular accidents on the <a href="Columbia%E2%80%93Wrightsville%20Bridge">Columbia–Wrightsville Bridge</a>, carrying <a href="Pennsylvania%20Route%20462">Pennsylvania Route 462</a> across the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna River</a> between <a href="Columbia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Columbia</a> and <a href="Wrightsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wrightsville, Pennsylvania</a>. The bridge had to be closed to traffic twice during that period due to impaired visibility and obstructions posed by piles of dead insects.

Mayflies are consumed in several cultures and are estimated to contain the most raw protein content of any edible insect by dry weight. In <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a>, kungu, a paste of mayflies ("Caenis kungu") and mosquitoes is made into a cake for eating. Adult mayflies are collected and eaten in many parts of China and Japan. Near <a href="Lake%20Victoria">Lake Victoria</a>, "Povilla" mayflies are collected, dried and preserved for use in food preparations. 

"Mayfly" was the crew's nickname for <a href="HMA%20No.%201">His Majesty's Airship No. 1</a>, an aerial scout airship built by <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> but wrecked by strong winds in 1911 before her trial flights.

Two vessels of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> were named <a href="HMS%20Mayfly">HMS "Mayfly"</a>: a torpedo boat launched in January 1907, and a <a href="Fly%20class%20gunboat">"Fly"-class river gunboat</a> constructed in sections at Yarrow in 1915.

The <a href="Seddon%20Mayfly">Seddon Mayfly</a>, which was constructed in 1908, was an aircraft that was unsuccessful in early flight. The first aircraft designed by a woman, <a href="Lilian%20Bland">Lillian Bland</a>, was titled the <a href="Bland%20Mayfly">Bland Mayfly</a>.

In pre-1950s France, "chute de manne" was obtained by pressing mayflies into cakes and using them as bird food and fishbait. From an economic standpoint, mayflies also provide fisheries with an excellent diet for fish. Mayflies could find uses in the biomedical, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Their exoskeleton contains chitin, which has applications in these industries.

Mayfly larvae do not survive in polluted aquatic habitats and, thus, have been chosen as bioindicators, markers of water quality in <a href="ecology">ecological</a> assessments.

In marketing, <a href="Nike%2C%20Inc.">Nike</a> produced a line of running shoes in 2003 titled "Mayfly". The shoes were designed with a wing venation pattern like the mayfly and were also said to have a finite lifetime. The telecommunication company <a href="Vodafone">Vodafone</a> featured mayflies in a 2006 branding campaign, telling consumers to "make the most of now".

Red Skelton

Richard "Red" Skelton (July 18, 1913September 17, 1997) was an American <a href="comedian">comedy entertainer</a>. He was best known for his national <a href="old-time%20radio">radio</a> and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program "<a href="The%20Red%20Skelton%20Show">The Red Skelton Show</a>". He has stars on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a>, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist.

Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling <a href="medicine%20show">medicine show</a>. He then spent time on a <a href="showboat">showboat</a>, worked the <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> circuit, and then entered into vaudeville in 1934. The "Doughnut Dunkers" <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> sketch, which he wrote together with his wife, launched a career for him in vaudeville, radio, and films. His radio career began in 1937 with a guest appearance on "<a href="The%20Fleischmann%27s%20Yeast%20Hour">The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour</a>", which led to his becoming the host of "<a href="Avalon%20Time">Avalon Time</a>" in 1938. He became the host of "<a href="The%20Raleigh%20Cigarette%20Program">The Raleigh Cigarette Program</a>" in 1941, on which many of his comedy characters were created, and he had a regularly scheduled radio program until 1957. Skelton made his film debut in 1938 alongside <a href="Ginger%20Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a> and <a href="Douglas%20Fairbanks%20Jr.">Douglas Fairbanks Jr.</a> in <a href="Alfred%20Santell">Alfred Santell</a>'s "<a href="Having%20Wonderful%20Time">Having Wonderful Time</a>", and he went on to appear in numerous musical and comedy films throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, with starring roles in "<a href="Ship%20Ahoy">Ship Ahoy</a>" (1941), "<a href="I%20Dood%20It">I Dood It</a>" (1943), "<a href="Ziegfeld%20Follies%20%28film%29">Ziegfeld Follies</a>" (1946), and "<a href="The%20Clown%20%281953%20film%29">The Clown</a>" (1953).

Skelton was most eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. "The Red Skelton Show" made its television premiere on September 30, 1951, on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. By 1954, Skelton's program moved to <a href="CBS">CBS</a>, where it was expanded to one hour and renamed "The Red Skelton Hour" in 1962. Despite high ratings, the show was cancelled by CBS in 1970, as the network believed that more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power. Skelton moved his program to NBC, where he completed his last year with a regularly scheduled television show in 1971. He spent his time after that making as many as 125 personal appearances a year and working on his art.

Skelton's artwork of clowns remained a hobby until 1964 when his wife Georgia persuaded him to have a showing at the <a href="Sands%20Hotel%20and%20Casino">Sands Hotel</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas">Las Vegas</a> while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful, and he also sold prints and lithographs of them, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work.

Skelton believed that his life's work was to make people laugh; he wanted to be known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans. His widow donated many of his personal and professional effects to <a href="Vincennes%20University">Vincennes University</a>, including prints of his artwork. They are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy at Vincennes.

According to some sources, Skelton was born Richard Bernard Eheart on July 18, 1913, in <a href="Vincennes%2C%20Indiana">Vincennes, Indiana</a>, although his actual middle name is a subject of debate. In a 1983 appearance on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20Starring%20Johnny%20Carson">The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</a>", Skelton said his middle name was really "Red" and he had made up the middle name Bernard, from the name of a local store, Bernard Clothiers, to satisfy a schoolteacher who would not believe his middle name was really "Red", although this story he presented in the comedy interview appearance does not match the reported content of his birth certificate.

Skelton was the fourth and youngest son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton (who at times used his stepfather's surname, Eheart). Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; he had once been a <a href="clown">clown</a> with the <a href="Hagenbeck-Wallace%20Circus">Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus</a>. His birth certificate surname was that of his father's stepfather. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.

Because of the loss of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling newspapers and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the <a href="Newspaper%20delivery">newsboy's</a> patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian <a href="Ed%20Wynn">Ed Wynn</a>, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger turned out to be one of the show's stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.

Skelton discovered at an early age that he could make people laugh. Skelton dropped out of school around 1926 or 1927, when he was 13 or 14 years old, but he already had some experience performing in <a href="Minstrel%20shows">minstrel</a> shows in Vincennes, and on a <a href="showboat">showboat</a>, "The Cotton Blossom", that plied the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio</a> and <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri</a> rivers. He enjoyed his work on the riverboat, moving on only after he realized that showboat entertainment was coming to an end. Skelton, who was interested in all forms of acting, took a dramatic role with the John Lawrence <a href="Summer%20stock%20theatre">stock theater</a> company, but was unable to deliver his lines in a serious manner; the audience laughed instead. In another incident, while performing in "<a href="Tom%20Shows">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>", Skelton was on an unseen treadmill; when it malfunctioned and began working in reverse, the frightened young actor called out, "Help! I'm backing into heaven!" He was fired before completing a week's work in the role. At the age of 15, Skelton did some early work on the <a href="American%20burlesque">burlesque</a> circuit, and reportedly spent four months with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus in 1929, when he was 16 years old.

Ida Skelton, who held multiple jobs to support her family after the death of her husband, did not suggest that her youngest son had run away from home to become an entertainer, but "his destiny had caught up with him at an early age". She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, and it may have meant one less child for her to feed. Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined "Doc" R.E. Lewis's traveling <a href="medicine%20show">medicine show</a> as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there. Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When she worried that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: "We get plenty to eat, and we sleep in the wagon."

As burlesque comedy material became progressively more <a href="Ribaldry%23Blue%20comedy">ribald</a>, Skelton moved on. He insisted that he was no prude; "I just didn't think the lines were funny". He became a sought-after <a href="master%20of%20ceremonies">master of ceremonies</a> for <a href="dance%20marathon">dance marathon</a>s (known as "walkathons" at the time), a popular fad in the 1930s. The winner of one of the marathons was Edna Stillwell, an <a href="Usher%20%28occupation%29">usher</a> at the old Pantages Theater. She approached Skelton after winning the contest and told him that she did not like his jokes; he asked if she could do better. They married in 1931 in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City</a>, and Edna began writing his material. At the time of their marriage Skelton was one month away from his 18th birthday; Edna was 16. When they learned that Skelton's salary was to be cut, Edna went to see the boss; he resented the interference, until she came away with not only a raise, but additional considerations as well. Since he had left school at an early age, his wife bought <a href="textbook">textbook</a>s and taught him what he had missed. With Edna's help, Skelton received a <a href="General%20Educational%20Development">high school equivalency degree</a>.

The couple put together an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters. When an offer came for an engagement in <a href="Harwich%20Port%2C%20Massachusetts">Harwich Port, Massachusetts</a>, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City. To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna's mother, but by the time they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents. Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought he was joking, but did as he asked. He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs. By selling their products for fifty cents each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port.

Skelton and Edna worked for a year in <a href="Camden%2C%20New%20Jersey">Camden, New Jersey</a>, and were able to get an engagement at <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>'s Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's <a href="Roxy%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Roxy Theatre</a>. Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada.

Skelton's performances in Canada led to new opportunities and the inspiration for a new, innovative routine that brought him recognition in the years to come. While performing in Montreal, the Skeltons met Harry Anger, a vaudeville producer for New York City's <a href="Loew%27s%20State%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Loew's State Theatre</a>. Anger promised the pair a booking as a headlining act at Loew's, but they would need to come up with new material for the engagement. While the Skeltons were having breakfast in a Montreal diner, Edna had an idea for a new routine as she and Skelton observed the other patrons eating <a href="doughnut">doughnut</a>s and drinking coffee. They devised the "Doughnut Dunkers" routine, with Skelton's visual impressions of how different people ate <a href="doughnut">doughnut</a>s. The skit won them the Loew's State engagement and a handsome fee.

The couple viewed the Loew's State engagement in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for the engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the "Doughnut Dunkers" and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> invited Skelton to perform at a <a href="White%20House">White House</a> luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, "Careful what you drink, Mr. President. I got rolled in a place like this once." His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward.

Skelton's first contact with Hollywood came in the form of a failed 1932 screen test. In 1938 he made his film debut for <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> in the supporting role of a camp counselor in "<a href="Having%20Wonderful%20Time">Having Wonderful Time</a>". He appeared in two short subjects for <a href="Vitaphone">Vitaphone</a> in 1939: "Seeing Red" and "The Broadway Buckaroo". Actor <a href="Mickey%20Rooney">Mickey Rooney</a> contacted Skelton, urging him to try for work in films after seeing him perform his "Doughnut Dunkers" act at President Roosevelt's 1940 birthday party. For his <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> screen test, Skelton performed many of his more popular skits, such as "Guzzler's Gin", but added some impromptu pantomimes as the cameras were rolling. "Imitation of Movie Heroes Dying" were Skelton's impressions of the cinema deaths of stars like <a href="George%20Raft">George Raft</a>, <a href="Edward%20G.%20Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a> and <a href="James%20Cagney">James Cagney</a>.

Skelton appeared in numerous films for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer throughout the 1940s. In 1940 he provided <a href="comic%20relief">comic relief</a> as a lieutenant in <a href="Frank%20Borzage">Frank Borzage</a>'s war drama "<a href="Flight%20Command">Flight Command</a>", opposite <a href="Robert%20Taylor%20%28actor%29">Robert Taylor</a>, <a href="Ruth%20Hussey">Ruth Hussey</a> and <a href="Walter%20Pidgeon">Walter Pidgeon</a>. In 1941 he also provided comic relief in <a href="Harold%20S.%20Bucquet">Harold S. Bucquet</a>'s "<a href="Dr.%20Kildare">Dr. Kildare</a>" medical dramas, "<a href="Dr.%20Kildare%27s%20Wedding%20Day">Dr. Kildare's Wedding Day</a>" and "<a href="The%20People%20vs.%20Dr.%20Kildare">The People vs. Dr. Kildare</a>". Skelton was soon starring in comedy features as inept radio detective "The Fox", the first of which was "<a href="Whistling%20in%20the%20Dark%20%281941%20film%29">Whistling in the Dark</a>" (1941) in which he began working with director <a href="S.%20Sylvan%20Simon">S. Sylvan Simon</a>, who would become his favorite director. He reprised the same role opposite <a href="Ann%20Rutherford">Ann Rutherford</a> in Simon's other pictures, including "<a href="Whistling%20in%20Dixie">Whistling in Dixie</a>" (1942) and "<a href="Whistling%20in%20Brooklyn">Whistling in Brooklyn</a>" (1943). In 1941, Skelton began appearing in musical comedies, starring opposite <a href="Eleanor%20Powell">Eleanor Powell</a>, <a href="Ann%20Sothern">Ann Sothern</a> and <a href="Robert%20Young%20%28actor%29">Robert Young</a> in <a href="Norman%20Z.%20McLeod">Norman Z. McLeod</a>'s "<a href="Lady%20Be%20Good%20%281941%20film%29">Lady Be Good</a>". In 1942 Skelton again starred opposite Eleanor Powell in <a href="Edward%20Buzzell">Edward Buzzell</a>'s "<a href="Ship%20Ahoy">Ship Ahoy</a>", and alongside Ann Sothern in McLeod's "<a href="Panama%20Hattie%20%28film%29">Panama Hattie</a>".

In 1943, after a memorable role as a nightclub hatcheck attendant who becomes King <a href="Louis%20XV%20of%20France">Louis XV of France</a> in a dream opposite <a href="Lucille%20Ball">Lucille Ball</a> and <a href="Gene%20Kelly">Gene Kelly</a> in <a href="Roy%20Del%20Ruth">Roy Del Ruth</a>'s "<a href="Du%20Barry%20Was%20a%20Lady">Du Barry Was a Lady</a>", Skelton starred as Joseph Rivington Reynolds, a hotel valet besotted with Broadway starlet Constance Shaw (Powell) in <a href="Vincente%20Minnelli">Vincente Minnelli</a>'s romantic musical comedy, "<a href="I%20Dood%20It">I Dood It</a>". The film was largely a remake of <a href="Buster%20Keaton">Buster Keaton</a>'s "<a href="Spite%20Marriage">Spite Marriage</a>"; Keaton, who had become a comedy consultant to MGM after his film career had diminished, began coaching Skelton on set during the filming. Keaton worked in this capacity on several of Skelton's films, and his 1926 film "<a href="The%20General%20%281926%20film%29">The General</a>" was also later rewritten to become Skelton's "<a href="A%20Southern%20Yankee">A Southern Yankee</a>" (1948), under directors S. Sylvan Simon and <a href="Edward%20Sedgwick">Edward Sedgwick</a>. Keaton was convinced enough of Skelton's comedic talent that he approached MGM studio head <a href="Louis%20B.%20Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a> with a request to create a small company within MGM for himself and Skelton, where the two could work on film projects. Keaton offered to forgo his salary if the films made by the company were not box office hits; Mayer chose to decline the request. In 1944, Skelton starred opposite <a href="Esther%20Williams">Esther Williams</a> in <a href="George%20Sidney">George Sidney</a>'s musical comedy "<a href="Bathing%20Beauty">Bathing Beauty</a>", playing a songwriter with romantic difficulties. He next had a relatively minor role as a "TV announcer who, in the course of demonstrating a brand of gin, progresses from mild inebriation through messy drunkenness to full-blown stupor" in the "When Television Comes" segment of "<a href="Ziegfeld%20Follies%20%28film%29">Ziegfeld Follies</a>", which featured <a href="William%20Powell">William Powell</a> and <a href="Judy%20Garland">Judy Garland</a> in the main roles. In 1946, Skelton played boastful clerk J. Aubrey Piper opposite <a href="Marilyn%20Maxwell">Marilyn Maxwell</a> and <a href="Marjorie%20Main">Marjorie Main</a> in <a href="Harry%20Beaumont">Harry Beaumont</a>'s comedy picture "<a href="The%20Show-Off%20%281946%20film%29">The Show-Off</a>".

Skelton's contract called for MGM's approval prior to his radio shows and other appearances. When he renegotiated his long-term contract with MGM, he wanted a clause that permitted him to remain working in radio and to be able to work on television, which was then largely experimental. At the time, the major work in the medium was centered in New York; Skelton had worked there for some time and was able to determine that he would find success with his physical comedy through the medium. By 1947, Skelton's work interests were focused not on films, but on radio and television. His MGM contract was rigid enough to require the studio's written consent for his weekly radio shows, as well as any benefit or similar appearances he made; radio offered fewer restrictions, more creative control and a higher salary. Skelton asked for a release from MGM after learning he could not raise the $750,000 needed to buy out the remainder of his contract. He also voiced frustration with the film scripts he was offered while on the set of "<a href="The%20Fuller%20Brush%20Man">The Fuller Brush Man</a>", saying, "Movies are not my field. Radio and television are." He did not receive the desired television clause nor a release from his MGM contract. In 1948, columnist <a href="Sheilah%20Graham%20Westbrook">Sheilah Graham</a> printed that Skelton's wishes were to make only one film a year, spending the rest of the time traveling the U.S. with his radio show.

Skelton's ability to successfully ad-lib often meant that the way the script was written was not always the way it was recorded on film. Some directors were delighted with the creativity, but others were often frustrated by it. S. Sylvan Simon, who became a close friend, allowed Skelton free rein when directing him. MGM became annoyed with Simon during the filming of "The Fuller Brush Man", as the studio contended that Skelton should have been playing romantic leads instead of performing slapstick. Simon and MGM parted company when he was not asked to direct retakes of Skelton's "A Southern Yankee"; Simon asked that his name be removed from the film's credits.

Skelton was willing to negotiate with MGM to extend the agreement provided he would receive the right to pursue television. This time the studio was willing to grant it, making Skelton the only major MGM personality with the privilege. The 1950 negotiations allowed him to begin working in television beginning September 30, 1951. During the last portion of his contract with the studio, Skelton was working in radio and on television in addition to films. He would go on to appear in films such as <a href="Jack%20Donohue%20%28director%29">Jack Donohue</a>'s "<a href="The%20Yellow%20Cab%20Man">The Yellow Cab Man</a>" (1950), <a href="Roy%20Rowland%20%28film%20director%29">Roy Rowland</a> and Buster Keaton's "<a href="Excuse%20My%20Dust%20%281951%20film%29">Excuse My Dust</a>" (1951), <a href="Charles%20Walters">Charles Walters</a>' "<a href="Texas%20Carnival">Texas Carnival</a>" (1951), <a href="Mervyn%20LeRoy">Mervyn LeRoy</a>'s "<a href="Lovely%20to%20Look%20At">Lovely to Look At</a>" (1952), <a href="Robert%20Z.%20Leonard">Robert Z. Leonard</a>'s "<a href="The%20Clown%20%281953%20film%29">The Clown</a>" (1953) and "<a href="The%20Great%20Diamond%20Robbery">The Great Diamond Robbery</a>" (1954), and Norman Z. McLeod's poorly received "<a href="Public%20Pigeon%20No.%201">Public Pigeon No. 1</a>" (1957), his last major film role, which originated incidentally from an episode of the television anthology series "<a href="Climax%21">Climax!</a>". In a 1956 interview, he said he would never work simultaneously in all three media again. As a result, Skelton would make only a couple of minor appearances in films after this, including playing a saloon drunk in "<a href="Around%20the%20World%20in%20Eighty%20Days%20%281956%20film%29">Around the World in Eighty Days</a>" (1956), a gambler in "<a href="Ocean%27s%2011">Ocean's 11</a>" (1960), and a Neanderthal man in "<a href="Those%20Magnificent%20Men%20in%20Their%20Flying%20Machines">Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines</a>" (1965).

Performing the "Doughnut Dunkers" routine led to Skelton's first appearance on <a href="Rudy%20Vall%C3%A9e">Rudy Vallée</a>'s "<a href="The%20Fleischmann%27s%20Yeast%20Hour">The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour</a>" on August 12, 1937. Vallée's program had a talent show segment and those who were searching for stardom were eager to be heard on it. Vallée also booked veteran comic and fellow Indiana native <a href="Joe%20Cook%20%28actor%29">Joe Cook</a> to appear as a guest with Skelton. The two <a href="Hoosier">Hoosier</a>s proceeded to trade jokes about their home towns, with Skelton contending to Cook, an <a href="Evansville%2C%20Indiana">Evansville</a> native, that the city was a suburb of Vincennes. The show received enough fan mail after the performance to invite both comedians back two weeks after Skelton's initial appearance and again in November of that year.

On October 1, 1938, Skelton replaced <a href="Red%20Foley">Red Foley</a> as the host of "<a href="Avalon%20Time">Avalon Time</a>" on NBC; Edna also joined the show's cast, under her maiden name. She developed a system for working with the show's writers: selecting material from them, adding her own and filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on "Avalon Time" until late 1939. Skelton's work in films led to a new regular radio show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest at one of his banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients.

Skelton went on the air with his own radio show, "<a href="The%20Raleigh%20Cigarette%20Program">The Raleigh Cigarette Program</a>", on October 7, 1941. The bandleader for the show was <a href="Ozzie%20Nelson">Ozzie Nelson</a>; his wife, <a href="Harriet%20Nelson">Harriet</a>, who worked under her maiden name of Hilliard, was the show's vocalist and also worked with Skelton in skits.

Skelton introduced the first two of his many characters during "The Raleigh Cigarette Program's" first season. The character of Clem Kadiddlehopper was based on a Vincennes neighbor named Carl Hopper, who was hard of hearing. Skelton's voice pattern for Clem was similar to the later cartoon character, <a href="Bullwinkle%20J.%20Moose">Bullwinkle</a>; there was enough similarity to cause Skelton to contemplate filing a lawsuit against Bill Scott, who voiced the cartoon moose. The second character, The Mean Widdle Kid, or "Junior", was a young boy full of mischief, who typically did things he was told not to do. "Junior" would say things like, "If I dood it, I gets a whipping.", followed moments later by the statement, "I dood it!" Skelton performed the character at home with Edna, giving him the nickname "Junior" long before it was heard by a radio audience. While the phrase was Skelton's, the idea of using the character on the radio show was Edna's. Skelton starred in <a href="I%20Dood%20It">a 1943 movie of the same name</a>, but did not play "Junior" in the film.

The phrase was such a part of national culture at the time that, when <a href="Jimmy%20Doolittle">General Doolittle</a> conducted the <a href="Doolittle%20Raid">bombing of Tokyo</a> in 1942, many newspapers used the phrase "Doolittle Dood It" as a headline. After a talk with President Roosevelt in 1943, Skelton used his radio show to collect funds for a <a href="Douglas%20A-20%20Havoc">Douglas A-20 Havoc</a> to be given to the <a href="Soviet%20Army">Soviet Army</a> to help fight World War II. Asking children to send in their spare change, he raised enough money for the aircraft in two weeks; he named the bomber "We Dood It!" In 1986 the Soviet newspaper "<a href="Pravda">Pravda</a>" offered praise to Skelton for his 1943 gift, and in 1993, the pilot of the plane was able to meet Skelton and thank him for the bomber.

Skelton also added a routine he had been performing since 1928. Originally called "Mellow Cigars", the skit entailed an announcer who became ill as he smoked his sponsor's product. Brown and Williamson, the makers of cigarettes, asked Skelton to change some aspects of the skit; he renamed the routine "Guzzler's Gin", where the announcer became inebriated while sampling and touting the imaginary sponsor's wares. While the traditional radio program called for its cast to do an audience <a href="Warm-up%20comedian">warm-up</a> in preparation for the broadcast, Skelton did just the opposite. After the regular radio program had ended, the show's guests were treated to a post-program performance. He would then perform his "Guzzler's Gin" or any of more than 350 routines for those who had come to the radio show. He updated and revised his post-show routines as diligently as those for his radio program. As a result, studio audience tickets for Skelton's radio show were in high demand; there were times where up to 300 people needed to be turned away for lack of seats.

In 1942, Edna announced that she was leaving Skelton but would continue to manage his career and write material for him. He did not realize she was serious until Edna issued a statement about the impending divorce through NBC. They were divorced in 1943, leaving the courtroom arm in arm. The couple did not discuss the reasons for their divorce and Edna initially prepared to work as a script writer for other radio programs. When the divorce was finalized, she went to New York, leaving her former husband three fully prepared show scripts. Skelton and those associated with him sent telegrams and called her, asking her to come back to him in a professional capacity. Edna remained the manager of the couple's funds because Skelton spent money too easily. An attempt at managing his own checking account that began with a $5,000 balance, ended five days later after a call to Edna saying the account was overdrawn. Skelton had a weekly allowance of $75, with Edna making investments for him, choosing real estate and other relatively stable assets. She remained an advisor on his career until 1952, receiving a generous weekly salary for life for her efforts.

The divorce meant that Skelton had lost his married man's <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">deferment</a>; he was once again classified as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the <a href="United%20States%20Army">army</a> in early 1944; both MGM and his radio <a href="Sponsor%20%28commercial%29">sponsor</a> tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail. His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, the day before he was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to <a href="Special%20Services%20%28entertainment%29">Special Services</a> at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented itself for the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Ozzie%20and%20Harriet">The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet</a>".

By 1944, Skelton was engaged to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had obtained a marriage license and told the press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry him, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied that the reason for the breakup was Edna's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting in the middle of the relationship or reconciling with her former husband.
He was on army <a href="furlough">furlough</a> for throat discomfort when he married actress Georgia Maureen Davis in <a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California">Beverly Hills, California</a>, on March 9, 1945; the couple met on the MGM lot. Skelton traveled to Los Angeles from the eastern army base where he was assigned for the wedding. He knew he would possibly be assigned overseas soon and wanted the marriage to take place first. After the wedding, he entered the hospital to have his <a href="Tonsillectomy">tonsils removed</a>. The couple had two children; Valentina, a daughter, was born May 5, 1947, and a son, Richard, was born May 20, 1948.

Skelton served in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. After being assigned to the Special Services, Skelton performed as many as ten to twelve shows per day before troops in both the United States and in Europe. The pressure of his workload caused him to suffer <a href="Fatigue%20%28medical%29">exhaustion</a> and a <a href="Mental%20breakdown">nervous breakdown</a>. His nervous collapse while in the army left him with a serious <a href="stuttering">stuttering</a> problem. While recovering at an army hospital at <a href="Fort%20Pickett">Camp Pickett</a>, Virginia, he met a soldier who had been severely wounded and was not expected to survive. Skelton devoted a lot of time and effort to trying to make the man laugh. As a result of this effort, his stuttering problem was cured; his army friend's condition also improved and he was no longer on the critical list. He was <a href="Military%20discharge">released</a> from his army duties in September 1945. "I've been told I'm the only celebrity who entered the Army as a private and came out a private," he told reporters. His sponsor was eager to have him back on the air, and Skelton's program began anew on NBC on December 4, 1945.

Upon returning to radio, Skelton brought with him many new characters that were added to his repertoire: Bolivar Shagnasty, described as a "loudmouthed braggart"; Cauliflower McPugg, a boxer; Deadeye, a cowboy; Willie Lump-Lump, a fellow who drank too much; and San Fernando Red, a conman with political aspirations. By 1947, Skelton's musical conductor was <a href="David%20Rose%20%28songwriter%29">David Rose</a>, who would go on to television with him; he had worked with Rose during his time in the army and wanted Rose to join him on the radio show when it went back on the air.

On April 22, 1947, Skelton was <a href="Censorship">censored</a> by NBC two minutes into his radio show. When he and his announcer <a href="Rod%20O%27Connor%20%28announcer%29">Rod O'Connor</a> began talking about <a href="Fred%20Allen">Fred Allen</a> being censored the previous week, they were silenced for 15 seconds; comedian <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> was given the same treatment once he began referring to the censoring of Allen. Skelton forged on with his lines for his studio audience's benefit; the material he insisted on using had been edited from the script by the network before the broadcast. He had been briefly censored the previous month for the use of the word "diaper". After the April incidents, NBC indicated it would no longer pull the plug for similar reasons.

Skelton changed sponsors in 1948; <a href="Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Williamson">Brown & Williamson</a>, owners of Raleigh cigarettes, withdrew due to program production costs. His new sponsor was <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a>'s <a href="Tide%20%28brand%29">Tide</a> laundry detergent. The next year he changed networks, going from NBC to CBS, where his radio show aired until May 1953. After his network radio contract was over, he signed a three-year contract with <a href="Ziv%20Television%20Programs">Ziv Radio</a> for a <a href="Broadcast%20syndication">syndicated</a> radio program in 1954. His syndicated radio program was offered as a daily show; it included segments of his older network radio programs as well as new material done for the syndication. He was able to use portions of his older radio shows because he owned the rights for rebroadcasting them.

Skelton was unable to work in television until the end of his 1951 MGM movie contract; a renegotiation to extend the pact provided permission after that point. He signed a contract for television on NBC with Procter and Gamble as his sponsor on May 4, 1951, and said he would be performing the same characters on television as he had been doing on radio. The MGM agreement with Skelton for television performances did not allow him to go on the air before September 30, 1951. His television debut, "<a href="The%20Red%20Skelton%20Show">The Red Skelton Show</a>", premiered on that date: at the end of his opening <a href="monologue">monologue</a>, two men backstage grabbed his ankles from behind the set curtain, hauling him offstage face down. A 1943 <a href="instrumental">instrumental</a> hit by David Rose, called "<a href="Holiday%20for%20Strings%20%28song%29">Holiday for Strings</a>", became Skelton's TV theme song. The move to television allowed him to create two non-human characters, seagulls Gertrude and Heathcliffe, which he performed while the pair were flying by tucking his thumbs under his arms to represent wings and shaping his hat to look like a bird's bill. He patterned his meek, henpecked television character of George Appleby after his radio character, J. Newton Numbskull, who had similar characteristics. His "Freddie the Freeloader" clown was introduced on the program in 1952, with Skelton copying his father's makeup for the character. He learned how to duplicate his father's makeup and perform his routines through his mother's recollections. A ritual became established at the end of every program, with Skelton's shy boyish wave and words of, "Good night and may God bless."
During the 1951–1952 season, the program was broadcast from a converted NBC radio studio. The first year of the television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.

Skelton was delivering an intense performance live each week, and the strain showed in physical illness. In 1952, he was drinking heavily from the constant pain of a <a href="Thoracic%20diaphragm">diaphragmatic</a> <a href="hernia">hernia</a> and marital problems; he thought about divorcing Georgia. NBC agreed to film his shows in the 1952–1953 season at <a href="Eagle-Lion%20Films">Eagle Lion Studios</a>, next to the Sam Goldwyn Studio, on <a href="Santa%20Monica%20Boulevard">Santa Monica Boulevard</a> in Hollywood. Later the show was moved to the new NBC television studios in <a href="The%20Burbank%20Studios">Burbank</a>. Procter & Gamble was unhappy with the filming of the television show, and insisted that Skelton return to live broadcasts. The situation caused him to think about leaving television at that point. Declining ratings prompted sponsor Procter & Gamble to cancel his show in the spring of 1953, with Skelton announcing that any future television shows of his would be variety shows, where he would not have the almost constant burden of performing. Beginning with the 1953–1954 season, he switched to CBS, where he remained until 1970. For the initial move to CBS, he had no sponsor. The network gambled by covering all expenses for the program on a <a href="Sustaining%20program">sustaining</a> basis; his first CBS sponsor was <a href="Geritol">Geritol</a>. He curtailed his drinking and his ratings at CBS began to improve, especially after he began appearing on Tuesday nights for co-sponsors <a href="S.%20C.%20Johnson%20%26amp%3B%20Son">Johnson's Wax</a> and <a href="Pet%2C%20Inc.">Pet Milk Company</a>.

By 1955, Skelton was broadcasting some of his weekly programs in color, which was the case approximately 100 times
between 1955 and 1960. He tried to encourage CBS to do other shows in color at the facility, but CBS mostly avoided color broadcasting after the network's television set manufacturing division was discontinued in 1951. By 1959, Skelton was the only comedian with a weekly variety television show; others who remained on the air, such as <a href="Danny%20Thomas">Danny Thomas</a>, were performing their routines as part of <a href="The%20Danny%20Thomas%20Show">situation comedy</a> programs. He performed a preview show for a studio audience on Mondays, using their reactions to determine which skits needed to be edited for the Tuesday program. For the Tuesday afternoon run-through prior to the actual show, he ignored the script for the most part, ad-libbing through it at will. The run-through was well attended by <a href="CBS%20Television%20City">CBS Television City</a> employees Sometimes during sketches, both live telecasts and taped programs, Skelton would break up or cause his guest stars to laugh.

At the height of Skelton's popularity, his nine-year-old son Richard was diagnosed with <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> and was given a year to live. While the network told him to take as much time off as necessary, Skelton felt that until he went back to his television show, he would be unable to be at ease and make his son's life a happy one. He returned to his television show on January 15, 1957, with guest star Mickey Rooney helping to lift his spirits. In happier times, he frequently mentioned his children on his program, but found it extremely difficult to do so after Richard became ill. Skelton resumed this practice only after his son had asked him to do so. After his son's diagnosis, Skelton took his family on an extended trip, so Richard could see as much of the world as possible. When they arrived in London, there were press accusations that the trip was more about publicity than his seriously ill son. There were also newspaper reports about Richard's illness being fatal, which were seen by the boy. The family returned to the United States after the British press stories.

The Skelton family received support from CBS management and from the public following the announcement of Richard's illness. Skelton himself was beset by a serious illness and by a household accident which kept him off the air. He suffered a life-threatening <a href="asthma">asthma</a> attack on December 30, 1957, and was taken to <a href="Saint%20John%27s%20Health%20Center">St. John's Hospital</a> in <a href="Santa%20Monica%2C%20California">Santa Monica</a>, where his doctors said that "if there were ten steps to death, Red Skelton had taken nine of them by the time he had arrived". Initially hospitalized for an indeterminate length of time, Skelton later said he was working on some notes for television and the next thing he remembered, he was in a hospital bed; he did not know how serious his illness was until he read about it himself in the newspapers. His illness and recovery kept him off the air for a full month; Skelton returned to his television show on January 28, 1958.

Richard died on May 10, 1958; it was ten days before the child's tenth birthday. Skelton was scheduled to do his weekly television show on the day his son was buried. Though there were recordings of some older programs available which the network could have run, he asked that guest performers be used instead. Calling themselves The Friends of Red Skelton, his friends in the television, film and music industries organized "The Friends Of Red Skelton Variety Show", which they performed to replace "The Red Skelton Show" for that week; by May 27, 1958, Skelton had returned to his program. The death of Richard profoundly affected the family; by 1961 Richard's model trains had been moved to a storeroom in the <a href="Bel%20Air%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Bel Air</a> mansion, but Skelton refused to have them dismantled. In 1962, the Skelton family moved to <a href="Palm%20Springs%2C%20California">Palm Springs</a>, and Skelton used the Bel Air home only on the two days a week when he was in Los Angeles for his television show taping.

In early 1960, Skelton purchased the old <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin%20Studios">Charlie Chaplin Studios</a> and updated it for videotape recording. With a recently purchased three-truck mobile color television unit, he recorded a number of his series episodes and specials in color. Even with his color facilities, CBS discontinued color broadcasts on a regular basis and Skelton shortly thereafter sold the studio to CBS and the mobile unit to local station, <a href="KTLA">KTLA</a>. Prior to this, he had been filming at <a href="Desilu%20Productions">Desilu Productions</a>. Skelton then moved back to the network's Television City facilities, where he resumed taping his programs until he left the network. In the fall of 1962, CBS expanded his program to a full hour, retitling it "The Red Skelton Hour". While a staple of his radio programs, he did not perform his "Junior" character on television until 1962, after extending the length of his program.
Skelton frequently employed the art of pantomime for his characters: a segment of his weekly program was called the "Silent Spot" and the sketch was performed in pantomime. He attributed his use of pantomime and few props to his early days when he did not want to have a lot of luggage, so he crafted routines that used few of them. He explained that the right hat was the key to his being able to get into character.

Skelton's season premiere for the 1960–1961 television season was a tribute to the United Nations. Six hundred people from the organization, including diplomats, were invited to be part of the audience for the show. The program was entirely done in pantomime, as UN representatives from 39 nations were in the studio audience. One of the sketches he performed for the UN was that of the old man watching the parade. The sketch had its origins in a question Skelton's son, Richard, asked his father about what happens when people die. He told his son, "They join a parade and start marching." In 1965, Skelton did another show in complete pantomime. This time he was joined by <a href="Marcel%20Marceau">Marcel Marceau</a>; the two artists alternated performances for the hour-long program, sharing the stage to perform <a href="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>. The only person who spoke during the hour was <a href="Maurice%20Chevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a>, who served as the show's narrator.

In 1969, Skelton performed a self-written monologue about the <a href="Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%20%28United%20States%29">Pledge of Allegiance</a>. In the speech, he commented on the meaning of each phrase of the pledge. He credited one of his Vincennes grammar school teachers, Mr. Laswell, with the original speech. The teacher had grown tired of hearing his students monotonously recite the pledge each morning; he then demonstrated to them how it should be recited, along with comments about the meaning behind each phrase. CBS received 200,000 requests for copies; the company subsequently released the monologue as a single on <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. A year later, he performed the monologue for President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> at the first "Evening at the White House", a series of entertainment events honoring the recently inaugurated president.

As the 1970s began, the networks began a <a href="Rural%20purge">major campaign</a> to discontinue long-running shows that they considered stale or lacking youth appeal. Despite Skelton's continued strong ratings, CBS saw his show as fitting into this category and cancelled the program along with other comedy and variety shows hosted by veterans such as <a href="Jackie%20Gleason">Jackie Gleason</a> and <a href="Ed%20Sullivan">Ed Sullivan</a>. Performing in Las Vegas when he got the news of his CBS cancellation, Skelton said, "My heart has been broken." His program had been one of the top ten highest rated shows for 17 of the 20 years he was on television. Skelton moved to NBC in 1970 in a half-hour Monday night version of his former show. Its cancellation after one season ended his television career, and he returned to live performances. In an effort to prove the networks wrong, he gave many of these at colleges and proved popular with the audience.
Skelton was bitter about CBS's cancellation for many years afterwards. Believing the demographic and salary issues to be irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the <a href="anti-establishment">anti-establishment</a>, <a href="anti-war">anti-war</a> faction at the height of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, saying his conservative political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> and Senate Republican Leader <a href="Everett%20Dirksen">Everett Dirksen</a>, to appear on his program.

There were personal as well as professional changes taking place in Skelton's life at this time. He divorced Georgia in 1971 and married Lothian Toland, daughter of <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a> <a href="Gregg%20Toland">Gregg Toland</a>, on October 7, 1973. While he disassociated himself from television soon after his show was cancelled, his bitterness had subsided enough for him to appear on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20Starring%20Johnny%20Carson">The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson</a>" on July 11, 1975; it was his first television appearance since he no longer had a television program. <a href="Johnny%20Carson">Johnny Carson</a>, one of his former writers, began his rise to network television prominence by substituting for Skelton after his dress rehearsal injury in 1954. Skelton was also a guest on "<a href="The%20Merv%20Griffin%20Show">The Merv Griffin Show</a>" in October of the same year. Any hopes he may have had to ease back into television through the talk show circuit came to an abrupt halt on May 10, 1976, when Georgia Skelton committed suicide by gunshot on the 18th anniversary of Richard Skelton's death. Georgia was 54 and had been in poor health for some time. He put all professional activities on hold for some months as he mourned his former wife's death.

Skelton made plans in 1977 to sell the rights to his old television programs as part of a package which would bring him back to regular television appearances. The package called for him to produce one new television show for every three older episodes; this appears to not have materialized. In 1980, he was taken to court by 13 of his former writers over a story that his will called for the destruction of recordings of all his old television shows upon his death. Skelton contended his remarks were made at a time when he was very unhappy with the television industry and were taken out of context. He said at the time, "Would you burn the only monument you've built in over 20 years?" As the owner of the television shows, Skelton initially refused to allow them to be syndicated as reruns during his lifetime. In 1983, <a href="Westinghouse%20Broadcasting">Group W</a> announced that it had come to terms with him for the rights to rebroadcast some of his original television programs from 1966 through 1970; some of his earlier shows were made available after Skelton's death.

Skelton's 70-year career as an entertainer began as a stage performer. He retained a fondness for theaters, and referred to them as "palaces"; he also likened them to his "living room", where he would privately entertain guests. At the end of a performance, he would look at the empty stage where there was now no laughter or applause and tell himself, "Tomorrow I must start again. One hour ago, I was a big man. I was important out there. Now it's empty. It's all gone."

Skelton was invited to play a four-week date at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a> in July 1951. While flying to the engagement, Skelton, Georgia and Father Edward J. Carney, were on a plane from Rome with passengers from an assortment of countries that included 11 children. The plane lost the use of two of its four engines and seemed destined to lose the rest, meaning that the plane would crash over <a href="Mont%20Blanc">Mont Blanc</a>. The priest readied himself to administer <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a>. As he did so, he told Skelton, "You take care of your department, Red, and I'll take care of mine." Skelton diverted the attention of the passengers with pantomimes while Father Carney prayed. They ultimately landed at a small airstrip in <a href="Lyon">Lyon</a>, France. He received both an enthusiastic reception and an invitation to return for the Palladium's Christmas show of that year.

Though Skelton had always done live engagements at Nevada hotels and appearances such as state fairs during his television show's hiatus, he focused his time and energy on live performances after he was no longer on the air, performing up to 125 dates a year. He often arrived days early for his engagement and would serve as his own promotion staff, making the rounds of the local shopping malls. Before the show, his audiences received a ballot listing about 100 of his many routines and were asked to tick off their favorites. The venue's ushers would collect the ballots and tally the votes. Skelton's performance on that given day was based on the skits his audience selected. After he learned that his performances were popular with the hearing-impaired because of his heavy use of pantomimes, Skelton hired a <a href="sign%20language">sign language</a> interpreter to translate the non-pantomime portions of his act for all his shows. He continued performing live until 1993, when he celebrated his 80th birthday.

In 1974, Skelton's interest in film work was rekindled with the news that <a href="Neil%20Simon">Neil Simon</a>'s comedy "<a href="The%20Sunshine%20Boys">The Sunshine Boys</a>" would become a movie; his last significant film appearance had been in "Public Pigeon No. 1" in 1956. He screen tested for the role of Willy Clark with <a href="Jack%20Benny">Jack Benny</a>, who had been cast as Al Lewis. Although Simon had planned to cast <a href="Jack%20Albertson">Jack Albertson</a>, who played Willy on Broadway, in the same role for the film, Skelton's screen test impressed him enough to change his mind. Skelton declined the part, however, reportedly due to an inadequate financial offer, and Benny's final illness forced him to withdraw as well. <a href="George%20Burns">George Burns</a> and <a href="Walter%20Matthau">Walter Matthau</a> ultimately starred in the film.

In 1981, Skelton made several specials for HBO including "<a href="Freddie%20the%20Freeloader%27s%20Christmas%20Dinner">Freddie the Freeloader's Christmas Dinner</a>" (1981) and the "Funny Faces" series of specials. He gave a <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">Royal Command Performance</a> for the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a> in 1984, which was later shown in the U.S. on <a href="HBO">HBO</a>. A portion of one of his last interviews, conducted by Steven F. Zambo, was broadcast as part of the 2005 <a href="PBS">PBS</a> special "The Pioneers of Primetime".

Skelton died on September 17, 1997, at the <a href="Eisenhower%20Medical%20Center">Eisenhower Medical Center</a> in <a href="Rancho%20Mirage%2C%20California">Rancho Mirage, California</a>, at the age of 84, after what was described as "a long, undisclosed illness". He is interred in the Skelton Family Tomb, the family's private room, alongside his son, Richard Freeman Skelton, Jr. and his second wife, Georgia Maureen Davis Skelton, in The Great Mausoleum's Sanctuary of Benediction at <a href="Forest%20Lawn%20Memorial%20Park%2C%20Glendale">Forest Lawn Memorial Park</a> in <a href="Glendale%2C%20California">Glendale, California</a>. Skelton was survived by his widow, Lothian Toland Skelton; his daughter, Valentina Marie Skelton Alonso; and granddaughter Sabrina Maureen Alonso.

Skelton began producing artwork in 1943, but kept his works private for many years. He said he was inspired to try his hand at painting after visiting a large Chicago <a href="department%20store">department store</a> that had various paintings on display. Inquiring as to the price of one which Skelton described as "a bunch of blotches", he was told, "Ten thousand wouldn't buy that one." He told the clerk he was one of the ten thousand who would not buy the painting, instead buying his own art materials. His wife Georgia, a former art student, persuaded him to have his first public showing of his work in 1964 at the <a href="Sands%20Hotel%20and%20Casino">Sands Hotel</a> in Las Vegas where he was performing at the time. Skelton believed painting was an asset to his comedy work, as it helped him to better visualize the imaginary props used in his pantomime routines.

In addition to his originals, Skelton also sold reproductions and prints through his own mail order business. He made his work available to art galleries by selling them franchises to display and sell his paintings. He once estimated the sale of his <a href="Lithography">lithographs</a> earned him $2.5 million per year. Shortly after his death, his art dealer said he believed that Skelton made more money on his paintings than from his television work. At the time of his death, Skelton had produced over 1,000 oil paintings of clowns. When asked why his artwork focused on clowns, he said at first, "I don't know why it's always clowns." He continued after thinking a moment by saying "No, that's not true—I do know why. I just don't feel like thinking about it ..." At the time of Skelton's death, his originals were priced at $80,000 and upward.

Skelton was a prolific writer of both short stories and music. After sleeping only four or five hours a night, he would wake up at 5 a.m. and begin writing stories, composing music, and painting pictures. He wrote at least one short story a week and had composed over 8,000 songs and symphonies by the time of his death. He wrote commercials for <a href="Skoal%20%28tobacco%29">Skoal tobacco</a> and sold many of his compositions to <a href="Muzak%20Holdings">Muzak</a>, a company that specialized in providing <a href="background%20music">background music</a> to stores and other businesses. Skelton was also interested in photography; when attending Hollywood parties, he would take photos and give the film to newspaper reporters waiting outside. He was never without a miniature camera and kept a photographic record of all his paintings. Skelton was also an avid gardener who created his own <a href="Japanese%20garden">Japanese</a> and <a href="Giardino%20all%27italiana">Italian gardens</a> and cultivated <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a> trees at his home in Palm Springs, California.

Skelton was a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a>, a member of Vincennes Lodge No. 1, in Indiana. He also was a member of both the <a href="Scottish%20Rite">Scottish</a> and the <a href="York%20Rite">York Rite</a>. He was a recipient of the Gold Medal of the General Grand Chapter, <a href="Royal%20Arch%20Masonry">Royal Arch Masons</a>, for Distinguished Service in the Arts and Sciences. On September 24, 1969, he received the honorary 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite and was a Gourgas Medal recipient in 1995. Skelton became interested in Masonry as a small boy selling newspapers in Vincennes, when a man bought a paper from him with a five dollar bill and told him to keep the change. The young Skelton asked his benefactor why he had given him so much money; the man explained that he was a Mason and Masons are taught to give. Skelton decided to become one also when he was grown. He was also member of the <a href="Independent%20Order%20of%20Odd%20Fellows">Independent Order of Odd Fellows</a>, as well as a <a href="Shriners">Shriner</a> in Los Angeles.

Skelton was made an honorary brother of <a href="Phi%20Sigma%20Kappa">Phi Sigma Kappa</a> at <a href="Truman%20State%20University">Truman State University</a>. In 1961 he became an honorary brother of the Phi Alpha Tau Fraternity of <a href="Emerson%20College">Emerson College</a> when he was awarded the Joseph E. Connor Award for excellence in the field of communications. He also received an honorary degree from the college at the same ceremony. Skelton received an honorary high school diploma from Vincennes High School. He was also an honorary member of <a href="Kappa%20Kappa%20Psi">Kappa Kappa Psi</a> National Honorary Band Fraternity; Skelton had composed many marches which were used by more than 10,000 high school and college bands. In 1986, Skelton received an honorary degree from <a href="Ball%20State%20University">Ball State University</a>.

The <a href="Red%20Skelton%20Memorial%20Bridge">Red Skelton Memorial Bridge</a> spans the <a href="Wabash%20River">Wabash River</a> and provides the highway link between <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> and <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> on <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050">U.S. Route 50</a>, near Skelton's home town of Vincennes. He attended the dedication ceremonies in 1963.

In 1952, Skelton received <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>s for Best Comedy Program and Best Comedian. He also received an Emmy nomination in 1957 for his non-comedic performance in "<a href="Playhouse%2090">Playhouse 90</a>'s" presentation of "The Big Slide". Skelton and his writers won another Emmy in 1961 for Outstanding Writing Achievement In Comedy. He was named an honorary faculty member of <a href="Ringling%20Bros.%20and%20Barnum%20%26amp%3B%20Bailey%20Clown%20College">Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Clown College</a> in 1968 and 1969.

Skelton's first major post-television recognition came in 1978, when the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a>s named him as the recipient for their <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Cecil%20B.%20DeMille%20Award">Cecil B. DeMille Award</a>, which is given to honor outstanding contributions in entertainment. His excitement was so great upon receiving the award and a standing ovation, that he clutched it tightly enough to break the statuette. When he was presented with the <a href="Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Television Arts & Sciences</a>' Governor's Award in 1986, Skelton received a standing ovation. "I want to thank you for sitting down", he said when the ovation subsided. "I thought you were pulling a CBS and walking out on me." The honor came 16 years after his television program left the airwaves.

Skelton received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> in 1987, and in 1988, he was inducted into the <a href="Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20%26amp%3B%20Sciences">Academy of Television Arts & Sciences</a>' <a href="Television%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Television Hall of Fame</a>. He was one of the <a href="International%20Clown%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Clown Hall of Fame</a>'s first inductees in 1989. Skelton and <a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> were honored with lifetime achievement awards by the <a href="American%20Comedy%20Awards">American Comedy Awards</a> in the same year. He was inducted into the <a href="National%20Radio%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Radio Hall of Fame</a> in 1994. Skelton also has two stars on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> for his radio and television work.
Skelton preferred to be described as a clown rather than a comic: "A comedian goes out and hits people right on. A clown uses pathos. He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like." "I just want to be known as a clown", he said, "because to me that's the height of my profession. It means you can do everything—sing, dance and above all, make people laugh." His purpose in life, he believed, was to make people laugh.

In "Groucho and Me", <a href="Groucho%20Marx">Groucho Marx</a> called Skelton "the most unacclaimed clown in show business", and "the logical successor to <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">[Charlie] Chaplin</a>", largely because of his ability to play a multitude of characters with minimal use of dialogue and props. "With one prop, a soft battered hat", Groucho wrote, describing a performance he had witnessed, "he successfully converted himself into an idiot boy, a peevish old lady, a teetering-tottering drunk, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and any other character that seemed to suit his fancy. No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red." He added that Skelton also "plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors." In late 1965 ventriloquist <a href="Edgar%20Bergen">Edgar Bergen</a>, reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. "It's all so very different today. The whole business of comedy has changed — from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from <a href="Charley%20Chase">Charley Chase</a> to Charlie Chaplin and <a href="Laurel%20and%20Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton." <a href="Harry%20Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> of <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> also praised Skelton, saying, "He's a clown in the old tradition. He doesn't need punch lines. He's got heart."

Skelton and <a href="Marcel%20Marceau">Marcel Marceau</a> shared a long friendship and admiration of each other's work. Marceau appeared on Skelton's CBS television show three times, including one turn as the host in 1961 as Skelton recovered from surgery. He was also a guest on the three "Funny Faces" specials that Skelton produced for <a href="HBO">HBO</a>. In a "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" interview after Skelton's death, Marceau said, "Red, you are eternal for me and the millions of people you made laugh and cry. May God bless you forever, my great and precious companion. I will never forget that silent world we created together." CBS issued the following statement upon his death: "Red's audience had no age limits. He was the consummate family entertainer—a winsome clown, a storyteller without peer, a superb mime, a singer and a dancer."

The Red Skelton Performing Arts Center was dedicated in February 2006 on the campus of Vincennes University, one block from the home in Vincennes where Skelton was born. The building includes an 850-seat theater, classrooms, rehearsal rooms, and dressing rooms. Its grand foyer is a gallery for Skelton's paintings, statues, and film posters. The theater hosts theatrical and musical productions by Vincennes University, as well as special events, convocations and conventions. The adjacent Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy opened on July 18, 2013, on what would have been Skelton's 100th birthday. It houses his personal and professional materials, which he had collected since the age of ten, in accordance with his wishes that they be made available in his hometown for the public's enjoyment. Skelton's widow, Lothian, noted that he expressed no interest in any sort of Hollywood memorial. The museum is funded jointly by the Red Skelton Museum Foundation and the <a href="Indiana%20Historical%20Society">Indiana Historical Society</a>. Other Foundation projects include a fund that provides new clothes to Vincennes children from low-income families. The Foundation also purchased Skelton's birthplace. On July 15, 2017, the state of Indiana unveiled a state historic marker at the home in Vincennes where Skelton was born.

The town of Vincennes has held an annual Red Skelton Festival since 2005. A "Parade of a Thousand Clowns", billed as the largest clown parade in the Midwest, is followed by family-oriented activities and live music performances.

In 2006, Travis Tarrants purchased the historic Vincennes <a href="Pantheon%20Theatre">Pantheon Theatre</a>, where Skelton performed during his youth. He established a non-profit organization with the hope of restoring the theatre to its 1921 state. Tarrants was able to raise close to $300,000 for the restoration. Two years later, donations for the project plummeted. Tarrants lost the theatre to unpaid back taxes in 2012 and the new owner was realtor Heath Klein. In late 2014, Klein sold the theatre property to a Vincennes non-profit group, INVin. The organization works to bring arts and arts-related businesses into downtown Vincennes. In March 2016, the group proposed to turn the theatre into shared workspace.

Based on rankings of the amount of money earned in box-office receipts for film showings, for a number of years Skelton was among the most popular stars in the country:

Laura Secord

Laura Secord ( Ingersoll; 13 September 1775 – 17 October 1868) was a Canadian heroine of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. She is known for having walked out of American-occupied territory in 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack. Her contribution to the war was little known during her lifetime, but since her death she has been frequently honoured in Canada. Though Laura Secord had no relation to it, most Canadians associate her with the <a href="Laura%20Secord%20Chocolates">Laura Secord Chocolates</a> company, named after her on the centennial of her walk.

Laura Secord's father, Thomas Ingersoll, lived in <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Massachusetts</a> and fought on the side of the <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriots</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a> (1775–1783). In 1795 he moved his family to the Niagara region of <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a> after he had applied for and received a land grant. Shortly after, Laura married <a href="United%20Empire%20Loyalist">Loyalist</a> James Secord, who was later seriously wounded at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Queenston%20Heights">Battle of Queenston Heights</a> early in the War of 1812. While he was still recovering in 1813, the Americans invaded the <a href="Niagara%20Peninsula">Niagara Peninsula</a>, including <a href="Queenston%2C%20Ontario">Queenston</a>. During the occupation, Secord acquired information about a planned American attack, and stole away on the morning of 22 June to inform Lieutenant <a href="James%20FitzGibbon">James FitzGibbon</a> in the territory still controlled by the British. The information helped the British and their <a href="Mohawk%20people">Mohawk</a> warrior allies repel the invading Americans at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beaver%20Dams">Battle of Beaver Dams</a>. Her effort was forgotten until 1860, when <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward, Prince of Wales</a> awarded the impoverished widow £100 for her service on his visit to Canada.

The story of Laura Secord has taken on mythic overtones in Canada. Her tale has been the subject of books, plays, and poetry, often with many embellishments. Since her death, Canada has bestowed honours on her, including schools named after her, monuments, a museum, a memorial stamp and coin, and a statue at the <a href="Valiants%20Memorial">Valiants Memorial</a> in <a href="Ottawa">the Canadian capital</a>.

<a href="Thomas%20Ingersoll">Thomas Ingersoll</a> (1749–1812) married the seventeen-year-old Elizabeth Dewey on 28 February 1775. Their first child, Laura, was born in <a href="Great%20Barrington%2C%20Massachusetts">Great Barrington</a> in the colonial <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> on 13 September 1775. Thomas's family had lived in Massachusetts for five generations. His paternal immigrant ancestor was Richard Ingersoll, who had arrived in <a href="Salem%2C%20Massachusetts">Salem, Massachusetts</a>, from <a href="Bedfordshire">Bedfordshire</a>, England, in 1629. Thomas was born in 1749 in <a href="Westfield%2C%20Massachusetts">Westfield, Massachusetts</a>. Elizabeth, daughter of Israel Dewey and his wife, was also born in Westfield, on 28 January 1758. Thomas moved to Great Barrington in 1774, where he settled into a house on a small piece of land by the <a href="Housatonic%20River">Housatonic River</a>. Over the next several years, his success as a <a href="Hatmaking">hatmaker</a> allowed him to marry, increase his landholdings, and expand his house as his family grew. He spent much time away from home, as he rose through the ranks in the military on the side of the <a href="patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">American revolutionaries</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Upon his return to Great Barrington, he was made a <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a>.

Elizabeth gave birth to three more girls: Elizabeth Franks on 17 October 1779; Mira (or Myra) in 1781; and Abigail in September 1783. They gave up Abigail for adoption in 1784 to an aunt with the surname Nash. Elizabeth Ingersoll died 20 February 1784. Thomas remarried the following year to Mercy Smith, widow of Josiah Smith, on 26 May 1785. Mercy had no children. She has been credited with teaching her stepdaughters to read and do <a href="needlework">needlework</a> before her death from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1789. By adolescence, the eldest daughter Laura was caring for her sisters and looking after the household affairs.

Thomas remarried four months after Mercy's death, on 20 September 1789, to Sarah "Sally" Backus, a widow with a daughter, Harriet. The couple had an additional four girls and three boys. The first boy, Charles Fortescue, was born on 27 September 1791. Charlotte (born 1793) and Appolonia (born 1794) were the last members of this branch of the Ingersoll family to be born in Massachusetts.

Thomas helped suppress <a href="Shays%27%20Rebellion">Shays' Rebellion</a> in 1786, which earned him the rank of <a href="major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a>. In the years following, he witnessed and was offended by the continuing <a href="Expulsion%20of%20the%20Loyalists%23Attacks%20on%20Royal%20officials%20and%20Loyalists">persecution of Loyalists</a> in Massachusetts. He realized that in the depressed economic conditions that followed the Revolutionary War, and with his own deep debts, he was unlikely to see his former prosperity again. In 1793, Thomas met in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> with <a href="Mohawk%20people">Mohawk</a> leader <a href="Joseph%20Brant">Joseph Brant</a>, who offered to show him the best land for settlement in Upper Canada, where the Crown was encouraging development. He and four associates travelled to <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a> to petition Lieutenant Governor <a href="John%20Graves%20Simcoe">John Simcoe</a> for a land grant. They received in the <a href="Thames%20Valley">Thames Valley</a>, and founded Oxford-on-the-Thames (later known as <a href="Ingersoll%2C%20Ontario">Ingersoll, Ontario</a>), on condition that they populate it with forty other families within seven years. After winding up their affairs in Great Barrington, the Ingersoll family moved to Upper Canada in 1795.

Thomas Ingersoll supported his family in their early years in Upper Canada by running a tavern in Queenston while land was being cleared and roads built in the settlement. The family stayed in Queenston until a log cabin was completed on the settlement in 1796. After Governor Simcoe returned to England in 1796, opposition grew in Upper Canada to the "Late Loyalists", such as Thomas, who had come to Canada for the land grants. The grants were greatly reduced, and Thomas's contract was cancelled for not having all of its conditions fulfilled. Feeling cheated, in 1805 he moved the family to <a href="Credit%20River">Credit River</a>, close to York (present-day <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>), where he successfully ran an inn until his 1812 death following a stroke. Sally continued to run it until her own death in 1833.

Laura Ingersoll remained in Queenston when the family moved. She married the wealthy James Secord, likely in June 1797. The Secord family originated in France, where the name was spelled "D'Secor" or "Sicar". Five Secord brothers, who were Protestant <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>s, fled from persecution in France and founded <a href="New%20Rochelle%2C%20New%20York">New Rochelle, New York</a> in 1688. At the time of the American Revolution, Loyalist members of the family <a href="Anglicisation">anglicized</a> their surname to "Secord".

The Secord couple lived in a house built in <a href="Niagara-on-the-Lake"></a>, the first floor of which was a shop. Secord gave birth to her first child, Mary, in St. in 1799. Mary was followed by Charlotte (1801), Harriet (10 February 1803), Charles Badeau (1809—the only male child) and Appolonia (1810).

James Secord served in the <a href="The%20Lincoln%20and%20Welland%20Regiment">1st Lincoln Militia</a> under <a href="Isaac%20Brock">Isaac Brock</a> when the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> broke out. He was among those who helped carry away Brock's body after Brock was killed in the first attack of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Queenston%20Heights">Battle of Queenston Heights</a> in October 1812. James himself was severely wounded in the leg and shoulder during the battle. Laura heard of his predicament and rushed to his side. Some sources suggest that she found three American soldiers preparing to beat him to death with their gunstocks. She begged them to save her husband's life, reportedly offering her own in return, when American Captain <a href="John%20E.%20Wool">John E. Wool</a> happened upon the situation and reprimanded the soldiers. This story may have been a later embellishment and may have originated with her grandson, James B. Secord. When the Secords arrived home, they found that the house had been looted in Laura's absence. Spending the winter in St. , Laura spent the next several months nursing her wounded husband back to health.

On 27 May 1813, the <a href="United%20States%20Army">American army</a> launched <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20George">an attack</a> across the Niagara River, and captured <a href="Fort%20George%2C%20Ontario">Fort George</a>. Queenston and the Niagara area fell to the Americans. Men of military age were sent as prisoners to the U.S., though the still-recuperating James Secord was not among them. That June, a number of U.S. soldiers were <a href="billet">billet</a>ed at the Secords' home.

On the evening of 21 June, Laura Secord heard of plans for a surprise American attack on Lieutenant <a href="James%20FitzGibbon">James FitzGibbon</a>'s British troops at Beaver Dams, which would have furthered American control in the <a href="Niagara%20Peninsula">Niagara Peninsula</a>. It is unclear how she became aware of these plans. According to tradition she overheard a conversation among the billeted Americans as they ate dinner.

As her husband was still recovering from his October injuries, Secord set out early the next morning to warn the Lieutenant. She reportedly walked from present-day Queenston through St. , Homer, <a href="St.%20Catharines">Shipman's Corners</a> and <a href="Pelham%2C%20Ontario">Short Hills</a> at the <a href="Niagara%20Escarpment">Niagara Escarpment</a> before she arrived at the camp of allied Mohawk warriors, who led her the rest of the way to FitzGibbon's headquarters at the <a href="DeCou%20House">DeCew House</a>. Based on her warning, a small British force and a larger contingent of Mohawk warriors were readied for the American attack. They defeated the Americans, most of whom were casualties or taken prisoner in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beaver%20Dams">Battle of Beaver Dams</a> on 24 June. No mention of Secord was made in reports that immediately followed the battle.

After the war, with the Secords' Queenston store in ruins, the family was impoverished. Only James's small war pension and the rent from 200 acres of land they had in <a href="Grantham%20Township%2C%20Ontario">Grantham Township</a> supported them.

The Secords' sixth child, Laura Anne, was born in October 1815, and their last child, Hannah, was born in 1817. The Secords' eldest daughter Mary wedded a doctor, William Trumball, on 18 April 1816. On 27 March 1817, Mary gave birth in Ireland to Elizabeth Trumball, the first of Laura and James's grandchildren. Mary had another daughter, also named Mary, in Jamaica. Following her husband's death, Mary returned to Queenston with her children in 1821.

The struggling James petitioned the government in 1827 for some sort of employment. Lieutenant-Governor <a href="Peregrine%20Maitland">Peregrine Maitland</a> did not offer him a position, but offered something to Laura. He asked her to be in charge of the yet-to-be-completed <a href="Brock%27s%20Monument">Brock's Monument</a>. At first, she turned it down, but then reluctantly accepted it. When Brock's Monument opened in 1831, Secord learned the new Lieutenant-Governor, <a href="John%20Colborne%2C%201st%20Baron%20Seaton">John Colborne</a>, intended to give the keys to the widow of a member of the monument committee who had died in an accident. On 17 July 1831, Secord petitioned Colborne to honour Maitland's promise, and included another certificate from FitzGibbon attesting her contribution to the war. She wrote that Colonel Thomas Clarke had been told by Maitland, "it was too late to think of [the committee member's widow] Mrs. Nichol as I have pledged my word to Mrs. Secord that as soon as possible she should have the key." Despite her pleas, Secord did not receive the keys to the monument.

In 1828, the Secords' daughter, Appolonia, died at 18 of <a href="typhus">typhus</a>, and James was appointed registrar of the Niagara Surrogate Court. He was promoted to judge in 1833, and his son Charles Badeau Secord took over the registrar position. Charles Badeau Secord's first son, Charles Forsyth Secord, was born 9 May 1833. His is the only line of Secords that survived into the 21st century.

James became a customs collector in 1835 at the port of Chippawa. The position came with a home in Chippawa, into which the family moved. Charles Badeau Secord took over the Queenston home. Daughter Laura Ann and her son moved into the home in 1837 following her husband's death.

James Secord died of a stroke on 22 February 1841. He was buried, according to his wishes, at Drummond Hill (now in Niagara Falls). James's death left Laura destitute. When his war pension ended, , she was unable to maintain her land as profitable and sold off much of it. Governor-General <a href="Charles%20Poulett%20Thomson%2C%201st%20Baron%20Sydenham">Sydenham</a> denied a 27 February 1841 petition which she sent, seeking to have her son to take over James's customs position. Sydenham also denied a petition she sent that May for a pension for herself, as James had received a pension for decades.

Possibly with help from better-off members of the family, Secord moved to a red brick cottage on Water Street in November 1841. Daughter Harriet and her own two daughters joined her in May 1842, after Harriet's husband died of alcohol poisoning. The three shared quarters with Secord for the rest of her life. Youngest daughter Hannah also moved in when she was widowed in 1844, and brought two daughters with her. Though she lacked training, for a short time Laura Secord ran a small school out of the home in an effort to support herself. This venture came to an end when the public <a href="common%20school">common school</a> system was introduced in the 1840s.

Over the years, the Secords unsuccessfully petitioned the government for some kind of acknowledgement. In 1860, when Secord was 85, the <a href="Edward%20VII">Prince of Wales</a> heard of her story while travelling in Canada. At Chippawa, near Niagara Falls, he learned of Laura Secord's plight as an aging widow and sent an award of £100. It was the only official recognition that she received during her lifetime.

Laura Secord died in 1868 at the age of 93. She was interred next to her husband in the Drummond Hill Cemetery in Niagara Falls. Her grave is marked by a monument with a bust on top, and is close to a monument marking the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lundy%27s%20Lane">Battle of Lundy's Lane</a>.

The inscription on her grave marker reads:

Her granddaughter described Secord as being with brown eyes and a fair complexion. James FitzGibbon wrote she was "of slight frame and delicate appearance". She was skilled at needlework, dressmaking and cooking. According to biographer Peggy Dymond Leavey, her many grandchildren enjoyed hearing their grandmother tell stories of her early life, and her Anglican faith increased with age.

In his report of the battle, FitzGibbon stated only that he "received information" about the threat; it is possible he omitted mention of Secord to protect her family during wartime. He first wrote of Secord in a certificate dated 26 February 1820, in support of a petition by her husband for a licence to operate a stone quarry in Queenston. In 1827 FitzGibbon wrote:

FitzGibbon wrote in a certificate dated 23 February 1837 that Secord did "acquaint" him with the Americans' intentions, but does not state whether he used the information. A diary entry of Mohawk chief <a href="John%20Norton%20%28Mohawk%20chief%29">John Norton</a> talks of "a loyal Inhabitant brought information that the Enemy intended to attack", but does not name the "Inhabitant". <a href="Dominique%20Ducharme">Dominique Ducharme</a>, leader of the <a href="Kahnawake">Caughnawaga Mohawk</a> in the Battle of Beaver Dams, made no mention of Secord in his reports, nor of receiving information from either Secord or FitzGibbon about the impending American attack.

Secord wrote two accounts of her walk, the first in 1853, and the second in 1861. Neither account contains details that can be corroborated with military accounts of the battle, such as specific dates or details about troops. Her account changed throughout her life. Historian <a href="Pierre%20Berton">Pierre Berton</a> noted that she never stated clearly how she learned of the impending attack. She told FitzGibbon that her husband had learned about it from an American officer, but years later told her granddaughter that she had overheard the plans directly from the American soldiers billeted in her home. Berton suggested that Secord's informant could have been an American still residing in the United States, who would have been charged with <a href="treason">treason</a> had Secord revealed her source. In the 1860s, as Secord's story gained prominence, historian William Foster Coffin added new details, which included the claim that Laura had brought a cow with her as an excuse to leave her home in case the American patrols questioned her.

A number of historians have questioned Secord's account. <a href="William%20Stewart%20Wallace">W. Stewart Wallace</a>, in his 1932 book, "The Story of Laura Secord: A Study in Historical Evidence", concluded her story was mostly myth, and that she played no significant role in the outcome of the Battle of Beaver Dams. Historian George Ingram contended in his 1965 book "The Story of Laura Secord Revisited" that Secord's debunking had been taken too far. Ruth MacKenzie also burnished Secord's reputation with "Laura Secord: The Legend and the Lady" in 1971.

The question of Secord's actual contribution to the British success has been contested. In the early 1920s, historians suggested that Native scouts had already informed FitzGibbon of the coming attack well before Secord had arrived on 23 June. Historian Ernest Cruikshank wrote in 1895 that "Scarcely had Mrs Secord concluded her narrative, when [Ducharme's] scouts came in ... they had encountered the advance guard of the enemy." Later, two testimonials were found which FitzGibbon wrote in 1820 and 1827, which supported Secord's claim. FitzGibbon asserted that Laura Secord had arrived on 22 June (not 23 June), and that "in consequence of this information", he had been able to intercept the American troops.

Historian Cecilia Morgan argues that the Secord story became famous in the 1880s when upper-class women sought to strengthen the emotional ties between Canadian women and the British Empire. She writes that they needed a female heroine to validate their claims for <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>. The first product of their campaign was <a href="Sarah%20Anne%20Curzon">Sarah Anne Curzon</a>'s verse drama "Laura Secord: The Heroine of 1812" in 1887. The play was a catalyst for "a deluge of articles and entries on Secord that filled Canadian histories and school textbooks at the turn of the 20th century". Although critics gave the play negative reviews, it was the first full work devoted to Secord's story and popularized her image.

Secord has been compared to <a href="French-Canadian">French-Canadian</a> heroine <a href="Madeleine%20de%20Verch%C3%A8res">Madeleine de Verchères</a> and to American Revolution hero <a href="Paul%20Revere">Paul Revere</a>. Her story has been retold and commemorated by generations of biographers, playwrights, poets, novelists and journalists.

After discovering a newspaper clipping of the events, early feminist <a href="Emma%20Currie">Emma Currie</a> began a lifelong interest in Secord's life. She tracked down information from Laura's relatives as far away as Great Barrington, and published a biographical account in 1900 called "The Story of Laura Secord". She later successfully petitioned to have a Secord memorial erected in Queenston Heights. The <a href="Ashlar">cut stone</a> granite monument stands and was dedicated in 1901. In 1905, Secord's portrait was hung in Parliament. Playwright <a href="Merrill%20Denison">Merrill Denison</a> wrote a <a href="Radio%20drama">radio play</a> of her story in 1931 which mixed serious history with parody.

On the centennial of Secord's walk in 1913, and to capitalize on Canadian patriotic feelings, <a href="Frank%20Patrick%20O%27Connor">Frank O'Connor</a> founded <a href="Laura%20Secord%20Chocolates">Laura Secord Chocolates</a>. The chain's first location opened on <a href="Yonge%20Street">Yonge</a> and Elm streets in Toronto. The chocolates were packaged in black boxes adorned with a <a href="cameo%20%28carving%29">cameo</a> of Secord. By the 1970s, the company had become the largest candy retailer in Canada. Among most Canadians, the name Laura Secord is more strongly associated with the chocolate company than with the historical figure.

During the War of 1812, the Secords' Queenston homestead was fired upon and <a href="Looting">looted</a>. It was restored in the late 20th century and given to the Niagara Parks Commission in 1971. It is now operated as a museum and gift shop at Partition and Queen streets in Queenston. Thomas Ingersoll's old home on Main Street in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, Laura Secord's birthplace, was used as the town's Free Library from 1896 until 1913. The Mason Library replaced it and was built on the site. The Great Barrington Historic District Commission made 18 October 1997 Laura Secord Day, and dedicated a plaque in her honour at the site of the Mason Library.

Laura Secord is the namesake of a number of schools, including Laura Secord Public School (also known as Laura Secord Memorial School, 1914–2010) in Queenston, École Laura Secord School in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a> (built 1912), Laura Secord Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario and <a href="School%20District%2039%20Vancouver">Laura Secord Elementary School</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. Beaver Dams Battlefield Park has a plaque dedicated to Secord. In 1992, Canada Post issued a Laura Secord commemorative stamp. In 2003, the <a href="Minister%20of%20Canadian%20Heritage">Minister of Canadian Heritage</a> declared Secord a "Person of National Historical Significance", and in 2006 Secord's was one of fourteen statues dedicated at the <a href="Valiants%20Memorial">Valiants Memorial</a> in Ottawa. To commemorate the 200th anniversary of her walk, Secord's image adorned a circulation <a href="Quarter%20%28Canadian%20coin%29">quarter</a> issued by the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mint">Royal Canadian Mint</a> and a postage stamp from <a href="Canada%20Post">Canada Post</a>.

Isle of Portland

The Isle of Portland is a limestone <a href="tied%20island">tied island</a>, long by wide, in the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. Portland is south of the resort of <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a>, forming the southernmost point of the county of <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, England. A <a href="barrier%20beach">barrier beach</a> called <a href="Chesil%20Beach">Chesil Beach</a> joins it to the mainland. The <a href="A354%20road">A354 road</a> passes down the Portland end of the beach and then over the <a href="Fleet%20Lagoon">Fleet Lagoon</a> by bridge to the mainland. Portland and Weymouth together form the borough of <a href="Weymouth%20and%20Portland">Weymouth and Portland</a>. The population of Portland is 12,400.

Portland is a central part of the <a href="Jurassic%20Coast">Jurassic Coast</a>, a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> on the Dorset and east <a href="Devon">Devon</a> coast, important for its geology and landforms. <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>, famous for its use in British and world architecture, including <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> and the <a href="United%20Nations%20Headquarters">United Nations Headquarters</a>, continues to be quarried.

<a href="Portland%20Harbour">Portland Harbour</a>, in between Portland and Weymouth, is one of the largest man-made harbours in the world. The harbour was made by the building of stone <a href="breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a>s between 1848 and 1905. From its inception it was a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> base, and played prominent roles during <a href="World%20War%20I">the First</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World Wars</a>; ships of the Royal Navy and <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organisation">NATO</a> countries worked up and exercised in its waters until 1995. The harbour is now a civilian port and popular recreation area, and was used for the <a href="2012%20Olympic%20Games">2012 Olympic Games</a>.

The name Portland is used for one of the <a href="British%20Sea%20Areas">British Sea Areas</a>, and has been <a href="Portland%20%28disambiguation%29">exported</a> as the name of North American and Australian towns.

Portland has been inhabited since at least the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> period (the Middle <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a>)—there is archaeological evidence of Mesolithic inhabitants at the <a href="Culverwell%20Mesolithic%20Site">Culverwell Mesolithic Site</a>, near <a href="Portland%20Bill">Portland Bill</a>, and of habitation since then. The Romans occupied Portland, reputedly calling it "Vindelis".

Although the beginning of the <a href="Viking%20Age">Viking Age</a> in England is dated to their raid in 793, when they destroyed the <a href="abbey">abbey</a> on <a href="Lindisfarne">Lindisfarne</a>, their first documented landing occurred in Portland four years earlier, in 789, as recorded in the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>". Three lost Viking ships from <a href="Hordaland">Hordaland</a> (the district around <a href="Hardanger">Hardanger</a> fjord in west <a href="Norway">Norway</a>) landed at Portland Bill. The king's <a href="Reeve%20%28England%29">reeve</a> tried to collect taxes from them, but they killed him and sailed on.

In 1539 <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a> ordered the construction of <a href="Portland%20Castle">Portland Castle</a> for defence against attacks by the French; the castle cost £4,964. It is one of the best preserved castles from this period, and is opened to the public by the custodians <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>.

In the 17th century, chief architect and Surveyor-General to James I, <a href="Inigo%20Jones">Inigo Jones</a>, surveyed the area and introduced the local <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> to London, using it in his <a href="Banqueting%20House%2C%20Whitehall">Banqueting House, Whitehall</a>, and for repairs on <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>. His successor, Sir <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a>, the architect and Member of Parliament for nearby Weymouth, used six million tons of white Portland limestone to rebuild destroyed parts of the capital after the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20London">Great Fire of London</a> of 1666. Well-known buildings in the capital, including St Paul's Cathedral and the eastern front of <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> feature the stone. After the First World War, a <a href="quarry">quarry</a> was opened by <a href="The%20Crown%20Estate">The Crown Estate</a> to provide stone for the <a href="Cenotaph">Cenotaph</a> in <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> and half a million gravestones for war cemeteries, and after the Second World War hundreds of thousands of gravestones were hewn for soldiers who had fallen on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Western Front</a>. <a href="Portland%20cement">Portland cement</a> has nothing to do with Portland; it was so named due to its similar colour to Portland stone when mixed with lime and sand.
There have been railways in Portland since the early 19th century. The <a href="Merchant%27s%20Railway">Merchant's Railway</a> was the earliest—it opened in 1826 (one year after the <a href="Stockton%20and%20Darlington%20railway">Stockton and Darlington railway</a>) and ran from the quarries at the north of <a href="Tophill">Tophill</a> to a pier at <a href="Castletown%2C%20Dorset">Castletown</a>, from where the Portland stone was shipped around the country. The <a href="Portland%20Branch%20Railway">Weymouth and Portland Railway</a> was laid in 1865, and ran from a station in <a href="Melcombe%20Regis">Melcombe Regis</a>, across the Fleet and along the low isthmus behind Chesil Beach to a station at <a href="Victoria%20Square%2C%20Portland">Victoria Square</a> in <a href="Chiswell">Chiswell</a>. At the end of the 19th century the line was extended to the top of the island as the Easton and Church Ope Railway, running through Castletown and ascending the cliffs at East Weares, to loop back north to a station in <a href="Easton%2C%20Dorset">Easton</a>. The line closed to passengers in 1952, and the final goods train (and two passenger 'specials') ran in April 1965.

The <a href="Royal%20National%20Lifeboat%20Institution">Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck</a> stationed a <a href="Lifeboat%20%28rescue%29">lifeboat</a> at Portland in 1826, which was withdrawn in 1851. Coastal flooding has affected Portland's residents and transport for centuries—the only way off the island by land is along the causeway in the lee of Chesil Beach. At times of extreme floods (about every 10 years) this road link is cut by floods. The low-lying village of <a href="Chiswell">Chiswell</a> used to flood on average every 5 years. Chesil Beach occasionally faces severe storms and massive waves, which have a <a href="fetch%20%28geography%29">fetch</a> across the Atlantic Ocean. Following two severe flood events in the 1970s, <a href="Weymouth%20and%20Portland">Weymouth and Portland</a> Borough Council and <a href="Wessex%20Water">Wessex Water</a> decided to investigate the structure of the beach, and <a href="coastal%20management">coastal management</a> schemes that could be built to protect Chiswell and the beach road. In the 1980s it was agreed that a scheme to protect against a <a href="return%20period">one-in-five-year</a> storm would be practicable; it would reduce flood depth and duration in more severe storms. <a href="Coastal%20management%23Hard%20construction%20techniques">Hard engineering</a> techniques were employed in the scheme, including a <a href="gabion">gabion</a> running to the north of Chiswell, an extended <a href="sea%20wall">sea wall</a> in <a href="Chesil%20Cove">Chesil Cove</a>, and a <a href="culvert">culvert</a> running from inside the beach, underneath the beach road and into <a href="Portland%20Harbour">Portland Harbour</a>, to divert flood water away from low-lying areas.

At the start of the First World War, <a href="HMS%20Hood%20%281891%29">HMS "Hood"</a> was sunk in the passage between the southern breakwaters to protect the harbour from torpedo and submarine attack. <a href="Portland%20Harbour">Portland Harbour</a> was formed (1848–1905) by the construction of breakwaters, but before that the natural anchorage had hosted ships of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> for more than 500 years. It was a centre for Admiralty research into <a href="asdic">asdic</a> submarine detection and underwater weapons from 1917 to 1998; the shore base <a href="HMS%20Serepta">HMS Serepta</a> was renamed <a href="RNAS%20Portland%20%28HMS%20Osprey%29">HMS Osprey</a> in 1927. During the Second World War Portland was the target of heavy bombing, although most warships had moved north as Portland was within enemy striking range across the Channel. Portland was a major embarkation point for Allied forces on <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a> in 1944. Early <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a>s were stationed at Portland in 1946–1948, and in 1959 a shallow tidal flat, The Mere, was infilled, and sports fields taken to form a heliport. The station was formally commissioned as HMS Osprey, which then became the largest and busiest military helicopter station in Europe. The base was gradually improved with additional landing areas and one of England's shortest runways, at .

The naval base closed after the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> in 1995, and the Royal Naval Air Station closed in 1999, although the runway remained in use for <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Coastguard">Her Majesty's Coastguard</a> Search and Rescue flights as MRCC Portland until 2014. MRCC Portland's area of responsibility extended midway across the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, and from <a href="Start%20Point%2C%20Devon">Start Point</a> in Devon to the Dorset/<a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> border, covering an area of around . The 12 Search and Rescue teams in the Portland area dealt with almost 1000 incidents in 2005.

There are still two prisons on Portland: <a href="The%20Verne%20%28HM%20Prison%29">HMP The Verne</a>, which until 1949 was a huge Victorian military fortress, and a Young Offenders' Institution (<a href="HMYOI">HMYOI</a>) on the Grove clifftop. This was the original prison (<a href="HM%20Prison%20Portland">HM Prison Portland</a>) built for convicts who quarried stone for the Portland Breakwaters from 1848. For a few years until 2005 Britain's only <a href="prison%20ship">prison ship</a>, <a href="Weare%20%28HM%20Prison%29">HMP "The Weare"</a>, was berthed in the harbour.

Portland is an ancient <a href="royal%20manor">royal manor</a>, and until the 19th century remained a separate <a href="Liberty%20%28division%29">liberty</a> within Dorset for administration purposes. It was an <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a> from 1894 to 1974, until the borough of <a href="Weymouth%20and%20Portland">Weymouth and Portland</a> formed on 1 April 1974 under the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a>. This merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis with Portland urban district. For <a href="UK%20local%20elections">local elections</a> the borough is divided into 15 wards, and three of them cover Portland. Elections take place in a four-year cycle; one third of the councillors in all but three wards retire or seek re-election in years one, two and three, and county council elections are held in year four.

The mayor of Weymouth and Portland is Ray Banham (<a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrat</a>), Kate Wheller (<a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a>) is deputy mayor. Weymouth, Portland and the <a href="Purbeck%20%28district%29">Purbeck</a> district are in the <a href="South%20Dorset">South Dorset</a> <a href="United%20Kingdom%20constituencies">parliamentary constituency</a>, created in 1885. The constituency elects one Member of Parliament; the current MP is <a href="Richard%20Drax">Richard Drax</a> (<a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a>). South Dorset, the rest of the <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a>, and <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> are in the <a href="South%20West%20England%20%28European%20Parliament%20constituency%29">South West England constituency</a> of the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a>.

Weymouth and Portland have been twinned with the town of <a href="Holzwickede">Holzwickede</a> in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany since 1986, and the French town of <a href="Louviers">Louviers</a>, in the <a href="departments%20of%20France">department</a> of <a href="Eure">Eure</a> in Normandy, since 1959. The borough and nearby <a href="Chickerell">Chickerell</a> have been a <a href="Fairtrade%20Zone">Fairtrade Zone</a> since 2007.

The Isle of Portland lies in the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, south of <a href="Wyke%20Regis">Wyke Regis</a>, and west-southwest of London, at (50.55, −2.44). Portland is situated approximately halfway along the <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="Jurassic%20Coast">Jurassic Coast</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>; the site includes of the Dorset and east Devon coast that is important for its geology and landforms. The <a href="South%20West%20Coast%20Path">South West Coast Path</a> runs around the coast; it is the United Kingdom's longest <a href="Long-distance%20footpaths%20in%20the%20UK">national trail</a> at . Portland is unusual as it is connected to the mainland at <a href="Abbotsbury">Abbotsbury</a> by <a href="Chesil%20Beach">Chesil Beach</a>, a <a href="tombolo">tombolo</a> which runs north-west to <a href="West%20Bay%2C%20Dorset">West Bay</a>. Portland is sometimes defined incorrectly as a tombolo—in fact Portland is a tied island, and Chesil Beach is the tombolo (a spit joined to land at both ends).

There are eight settlements on Portland, the largest being <a href="Fortuneswell">Fortuneswell</a> in Underhill and <a href="Easton%2C%20Dorset">Easton</a> on Tophill. <a href="Castletown%2C%20Dorset">Castletown</a> and <a href="Chiswell">Chiswell</a> are the other villages in Underhill, and <a href="Weston%2C%20Dorset">Weston</a>, <a href="Southwell%2C%20Dorset">Southwell</a>, <a href="Wakeham">Wakeham</a> and <a href="The%20Grove%2C%20Portland">the Grove</a> are on the Tophill plateau. Many old buildings are built out of Portland Stone; several parts have been designated Conservation Areas to preserve the unique character the older settlements which date back hundreds of years.

The Isle of Portland has been designated by <a href="Natural%20England">Natural England</a> as National Character Area 137. It is adjoined by the <a href="Weymouth%20Lowlands">Weymouth Lowlands</a> to the north.

Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas; the steeply sloping land at its north end called <a href="Underhill%2C%20Dorset">Underhill</a>, and the larger, gently sloping land to the south, called <a href="Tophill">Tophill</a>. <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a> lies under Tophill; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of near <a href="Verne%20%28HM%20Prison%29">the Verne</a> in the north, to just above sea level at <a href="Portland%20Bill">Portland Bill</a>. The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill; Underhill lies on a steep <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a> composed of Portland Sand, lying above a thicker layer of <a href="Kimmeridge%20Clay">Kimmeridge Clay</a>, which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour. This Kimmeridge Clay has resulted in a series of landslides, forming West Weares and East Weares.

<a href="Portland%20Bill">Portland Bill</a> is the southern tip of the island of Portland. The Bill has three lighthouse towers: <a href="Old%20Higher%20Lighthouse">The Higher Lighthouse</a> is now a dwelling and holiday apartments; <a href="Old%20Lower%20Lighthouse">the Lower Lighthouse</a> is now a bird observatory and field centre providing records of bird migration and accommodation for visitors, which opened in 1961. The <a href="Portland%20Bill%20Lighthouse">white and red lighthouse</a> on Bill Point replaced the Higher and Lower Lighthouses in 1906. It is a prominent and much photographed feature; an important landmark for ships passing the headland and its <a href="tidal%20race">tidal race</a>. The current lighthouse was refurbished in 1996 and became remotely controlled. It now contains a visitors' centre giving information and guided tours of the lighthouse. As of June 2009, the lighthouse uses a 1 kW metal-halide US-made lamp with an operational life of about 4000 hours, or 14 months.

Portland Ledge is an underwater extension of Portland Stone into the English Channel at a place where the depth of Channel is 20 to 40 metres (about 10 to 20 fathoms). Tidal flow is disrupted by the feature; at 10 metres (about 5 fathoms) deep and long, it causes a tidal race to the south of Portland Bill, the so-called "Portland Race". The current only stops for brief periods during the -hour tidal cycle and can reach at the spring tide of .

Due to its isolated coastal location, the Isle of Portland has an extensive range of <a href="flora">flora</a> and <a href="fauna">fauna</a>; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as <a href="Sites%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Sites of Special Scientific Interest</a>. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists from around the country. Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks. Chesil Beach is one of only two sites in Britain where the scaly cricket can be found; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop. Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.

The comparatively warm and sunny climate allows species of plants to thrive which do not on the mainland. The limestone soil has low nutrient levels; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able to grow in the absence of larger species. Portland sea lavender can be found on the higher sea cliffs; unique to Portland, it is one of the United Kingdom's rarest plants. The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland, including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe. Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom, including the limestone race of the <a href="silver-studded%20blue">silver-studded blue</a>.

The mild seas which almost surround the tied island produce a <a href="temperate">temperate</a> climate (<a href="Humid%20temperate%20climate">Köppen climate classification</a> "Cfb") with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures. The average annual mean temperature from 1981 to 2010 was . The warmest month is August, which has an average <a href="temperature">temperature range</a> of , and the coolest is February, which has a range of . Maximum and minimum temperatures throughout the year are above England's average, and Portland is in <a href="Hardiness%20zone%23Benefits%20and%20criticisms">AHS Heat zone 1</a>. Mean <a href="sea%20surface%20temperatures">sea surface temperatures</a> range from in February to in August; the annual mean is .

The mild seas that surround Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per year — this is far below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days of frost. Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six days per year; almost all winters have no more than one day with snow lying. It may snow or <a href="rain%20and%20snow%20mixed">sleet</a> in winter, yet it almost never settles on the ground—coastal areas in <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a> such as Portland generally experience the mildest winters in the UK. Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that <a href="Devon">Devon</a> and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> experience. The <a href="growing%20season">growing season</a> lasts for more than 310 days per year, and the borough is in <a href="Hardiness%20zone">Hardiness zone</a> 9.

Weymouth and Portland, and the rest of the south coast, has the sunniest climate in the United Kingdom. Portland averaged 1798.9 hours of sunshine annually between 1981 and 2010, which is 41% of the maximum possible, and 34% above the <a href="Climate%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom average</a> of 1339.7 hours. December is the cloudiest month (59.7 hours of sunshine), October and November the joint wettest ( of rain) and July is the sunniest and driest month (236.9 hours of sunshine, of rain). Sunshine totals in all months are well above the United Kingdom average, and monthly rainfall totals throughout the year are less than the UK average, particularly in summer; this summer minimum of rainfall is not experienced away from the south coast of England. The average annual rainfall of is well below the UK average of .

The mid-year population of Portland in 2010 was 12,400; this figure has remained around twelve to thirteen thousand since the 1970s. In 2010 there were 5,786 dwellings in an area of , giving an approximate population density of 1100 people per km (4.5 per acre). The population is almost entirely native to England—94.9 percent of residents are of white British ethnicity, well above the England and Wales average of 80.5 percent. The average price of a detached house on Portland in 2010 was <a href="GBP">£</a>194,200; <a href="terraced%20house">terraced house</a>s are cheaper, at £149,727, and an apartment or <a href="Maisonette%20%28apartment%29">maisonette</a> costs £110,500.

Crime rates are below average—there were 5.4 burglaries per 1000 households in 2009 and 2010; which is lower than <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a> (7.6 per 1000) and significantly lower than <a href="England%20and%20Wales">England and Wales</a> (11.6 per 1000). Unemployment levels are very low, at 1.9 percent in July 2011, compared to the United Kingdom average of 7.7 percent. The most common religious identity in Weymouth and Portland is Christianity, at 61.0 percent, which is slightly above the <a href="Religion%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Statistics">England and Wales average</a> of 59.3 percent. The next-largest sector is those with no religion, at 29.3 percent, also slightly above the average of 25.1 percent.

The <a href="A354%20road">A354 road</a> is the only land access to Portland, via Ferry Bridge, connecting to <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a> and to the wider road network at the <a href="A35%20road">A35</a> <a href="trunk%20road">trunk road</a> in <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a>.

St George's Community Primary School is located in <a href="Easton%2C%20Dorset">Easton</a>. The only other school on Portland is the <a href="Atlantic%20Academy%20Portland">Atlantic Academy</a>, an all-through school for pupils aged 3 to 19 based at two different sites. Formerly known as the Isle of Portland Aldridge Community Academy, it formed in 2012 by merging four primary schools and one secondary school.

Some students commute to <a href="Weymouth%2C%20Dorset">Weymouth</a> or <a href="Dorchester%2C%20Dorset">Dorchester</a> to study <a href="A-Level">A-Level</a>s, or to attend other secondary schools nearby. <a href="Weymouth%20College">Weymouth College</a> in <a href="Melcombe%20Regis">Melcombe Regis</a> is the nearest <a href="further%20education">further education</a> college, which has around 7,500 students from <a href="south%20west%20England">south west England</a> and overseas, about 1500 studying A-Level courses.

In 2000, the <a href="Weymouth%20and%20Portland%20National%20Sailing%20Academy">Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy</a> was built in Osprey Quay in Underhill as a centre for sailing in the United Kingdom. <a href="Weymouth%20Bay">Weymouth and Portland's waters</a> were credited by the <a href="Royal%20Yachting%20Association">Royal Yachting Association</a> as the best in Northern Europe. Weymouth and Portland regularly host local, national and international sailing events in their waters; these include the J/24 World Championships in 2005, trials for the 2004 Athens Olympics, the ISAF World Championship 2006, the BUSA Fleet Racing Championships, and the RYA Youth National Championships.

In 2005, the WPNSA was selected to host sailing events at the <a href="2012%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games">2012 Olympic Games</a>—mainly because the Academy had recently been built, so no new venue would have to be provided. However, as part of the <a href="South%20West%20of%20England%20Regional%20Development%20Agency">South West of England Regional Development Agency</a>'s plans to redevelop Osprey Quay, a new 600-berth marina and an extension with more on-site facilities were built. Construction was scheduled between October 2007 and the end of 2008, and with its completion and formal opening on 11 June 2009, the venue became the first of the 2012 Olympic Games to be completed.

Weymouth Bay and Portland Harbour are used for other water sports – the reliable wind is favourable for <a href="windsurfing">wind</a> and <a href="kitesurfing">kite-surfing</a>. Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour are used regularly for angling, scuba diving to shipwrecks, snorkelling, canoeing, and swimming. The limestone cliffs and quarries are used for <a href="rock%20climbing">rock climbing</a>; Portland has areas for <a href="bouldering">bouldering</a> and deep water soloing, however <a href="sport%20climbing">sport climbing</a> with bolt protection is the most common style.

Isle of Portland has a <a href="Non-League%20football">Non-League football</a> club <a href="Portland%20United%20F.C.">Portland United F.C.</a> who play at Grove Corner. They also have a youth set up called Portland United youth football Club.

Rabbits have long been associated with bad luck on Portland. Use of the name is still taboo—the creatures are often referred to as "underground mutton", "long-eared furry things" or just "bunnies". The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record of it before the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers. They would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and blame them for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, <a href="landslide">landslide</a>s. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured.

Today older Portland residents are 'offended' (sometimes for the benefit of tourists) by the mention of rabbits; this superstition came to national attention in October 2005 when a special batch of advertisement posters were made for the <a href="Wallace%20and%20Gromit">Wallace and Gromit</a> film, "". Out of respect for local beliefs the adverts omitted the word 'rabbit' and replaced the film's title with the phrase ""Something bunny is going on"".

<a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a> described Portland as "the peninsula carved by Time out of a single stone", and named it the "Isle of Slingers" and "Isle of the Race" in his Wessex novels; it was the main setting of "<a href="The%20Well-Beloved">The Well-Beloved</a>" (1897), and was featured in "<a href="The%20Trumpet-Major">The Trumpet-Major</a>" (1880). The cottage that now houses <a href="Portland%20Museum%2C%20Dorset">Portland Museum</a> was the inspiration for the heroine's house in "The Well-Beloved". Portlanders were expert stone-throwers in the defence of their land, and Hardy's "Isle of Slingers" is heavily based on Portland; the "Street of Wells" representing Fortuneswell and "The Beal" Portland Bill. Hardy also called Portland the "Gibraltar of the North", with reference to its similarities with <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>; its physical geography, isolation, comparatively mild climate, and <a href="Underhill%2C%20Dorset">Underhill</a>'s winding streets.

<a href="Hilaire%20Belloc">Hilaire Belloc</a>'s book "The Cruise of the ""Nona""" is about sailing near Portland, and the reflections it occasions. He describes Portland Race as "the master terror of our world", and says "... if you were to make a list of all the things which Portland Race has swallowed up, it would rival <a href="Orcus">Orcus</a>".

In "Museums Without Walls", <a href="Jonathan%20Meades">Jonathan Meades</a> declares that "Portland is a bulky chunk of geological, social, topographical and demographic weirdness. It is the obverse of a beauty spot. 'Beauty' in this construction implies the picturesque. Portland is gloriously bereft of this quality. It is awesome. There is nothing pretty about it."

In "<a href="The%20Warlord%20Chronicles">The Warlord Chronicles</a>" (1995–97), <a href="Bernard%20Cornwell">Bernard Cornwell</a> makes Portland the <a href="Isle%20of%20the%20Dead%20%28mythology%29">Isle of the Dead</a>, a place of internal exile, where the causeway was guarded to keep the 'dead' (people suffering insanity) from crossing <a href="Fleet%20Lagoon">the Fleet</a> and returning to the mainland. No historical evidence exists to support this idea.

The Portland Chronicles series of four children's books, set on and around Portland and Weymouth and written by local author Carol Hunt, draw on local history to explore a seventeenth century world of smuggling, witchcraft, piracy and local intrigue.

In the <a href="Louis%20L%27Amour">Louis L'Amour</a> novel "<a href="To%20the%20Far%20Blue%20Mountains">To the Far Blue Mountains</a>" the novel's main character, <a href="Barnabas%20Sackett">Barnabas Sackett</a>, hides in a <a href="Cave%20Hole%2C%20Portland">Cave Hole</a> at the Bill of Portland before meeting a sailing ship in an attempt to escape from England.

Common starling

The common starling ("Sturnus vulgaris"), also known as the European starling, or in the British Isles just the starling, is a medium-sized <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> in the starling family, <a href="Sturnidae">Sturnidae</a>. It is about long and has glossy black <a href="plumage">plumage</a> with a metallic sheen, which is speckled with white at some times of year. The legs are pink and the bill is black in winter and yellow in summer; young birds have browner plumage than the adults. It is a noisy bird, especially in <a href="communal%20roost">communal roost</a>s and other gregarious situations, with an unmusical but varied song. Its gift for <a href="mimicry">mimicry</a> has been noted in literature including the "<a href="Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a>" and the works of <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> and <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>.

The common starling has about a dozen <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> breeding in open <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s across its native <a href="Range%20%28biology%29">range</a> in temperate Europe and western Asia, and it has been introduced to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>, <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>, <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> and <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>. This bird is resident in southern and western Europe and southwestern Asia, while northeastern populations <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> south and west in winter within the breeding range and also further south to <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberia</a> and North Africa. The common starling builds an untidy <a href="nest">nest</a> in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy, pale blue eggs are laid. These take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks. There are normally one or two breeding attempts each year. This species is omnivorous, taking a wide range of <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, as well as seeds and fruit. It is hunted by various mammals and <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, and is host to a range of external and internal parasites.

Large flocks typical of this species can be beneficial to agriculture by controlling invertebrate pests; however, starlings can also be pests themselves when they feed on fruit and sprouting crops. Common starlings may also be a nuisance through the noise and mess caused by their large urban roosts. Introduced populations in particular have been subjected to a range of controls, including <a href="culling">culling</a>, but these have had limited success except in preventing the colonisation of Western Australia.

The species has declined in numbers in parts of northern and western Europe since the 1980s due to fewer grassland invertebrates being available as food for growing chicks. Despite this, its huge global population is not thought to be declining significantly, so the common starling is classified as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>.

The common starling was first described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1758 under its current binomial name. "Sturnus" and "vulgaris" are derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "starling" and "common" respectively. The Old English "staer", later "stare", and the Latin "sturnus" are both derived from an unknown <a href="Proto-Indo-European%20language">Indo-European</a> root dating back to the second millennium BC. "Starling" was first recorded in the 11th century, when it referred to the juvenile of the species, but by the 16th century it had already largely supplanted "stare" to refer to birds of all ages. The older name is referenced in <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">William Butler Yeats'</a> poem "The Stare's Nest by My Window". The <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Congress">International Ornithological Congress</a>' preferred English vernacular name is common starling.

The <a href="starling">starling</a> family, Sturnidae, is an entirely <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> group apart from introductions elsewhere, with the greatest numbers of species in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and <a href="sub-Saharan%20Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>. The genus "Sturnus" is <a href="Polyphyly">polyphyletic</a> and relationships between its members are not fully resolved. The closest relation of the common starling is the <a href="spotless%20starling">spotless starling</a>. The non-migratory spotless starling may be descended from a population of ancestral "S. vulgaris" that survived in an <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian</a> <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum%20refugia">refugium</a> during an <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a> retreat, and <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>l <a href="gene">gene</a> studies suggest that it could be considered as a subspecies of the common starling. There is more genetic variation between common starling populations than between the nominate common starling and the spotless starling. Although common starling remains are known from the <a href="Middle%20Pleistocene">Middle Pleistocene</a>, part of the problem in resolving relationships in the Sturnidae is the paucity of the fossil record for the family as a whole.

There are several <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the common starling, which vary <a href="cline%20%28biology%29">clinally</a> in size and the colour tone of the adult plumage. The gradual variation over geographic range and extensive <a href="intergradation">intergradation</a> means that acceptance of the various subspecies varies between authorities.

Birds from <a href="Fair%20Isle">Fair Isle</a>, <a href="St%20Kilda%2C%20Scotland">St Kilda</a> and the <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a> are intermediate in size between "S. v. zetlandicus" and the nominate form, and their subspecies placement varies according to the authority. The dark juveniles typical of these island forms are occasionally found in mainland Scotland and elsewhere, indicating some <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a> from "faroensis" or "zetlandicus", subspecies formerly considered to be isolated.

Several other subspecies have been named, but are generally no longer considered valid. Most are intergrades that occur where the ranges of various subspecies meet. These include: "S. v. ruthenus" <a href="Mikhail%20Aleksandrovich%20Menzbier">Menzbier</a>, 1891 and "S. v. jitkowi" Buturlin, 1904, which are intergrades between "vulgaris" and "poltaratskyi" from western Russia; "S. v. graecus" <a href="Viktor%20von%20Tschusi%20zu%20Schmidhoffen">Tschusi</a>, 1905 and "S. v. balcanicus" Buturlin and Harms, 1909, intergrades between "vulgaris" and "tauricus" from the southern <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> to central <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and throughout Greece to the <a href="Bosporus">Bosporus</a>; and "S. v. heinrichi" <a href="Erwin%20Stresemann">Stresemann</a>, 1928, an intergrade between "caucasicus" and "nobilior" in northern Iran. "S. v. persepolis" <a href="Claud%20Buchanan%20Ticehurst">Ticehurst</a>, 1928 from southern Iran's (<a href="Fars%20Province">Fars Province</a>) is very similar to "S. v. vulgaris", and it is not clear whether it is a distinct resident population or simply migrants from southeastern Europe.

The common starling is long, with a wingspan of and a weight of . Among standard measurements, the <a href="Wing%20chord%20%28biology%29">wing chord</a> is , the <a href="tail">tail</a> is , the <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> is and the <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> is . The <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is <a href="iridescence">iridescent</a> black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted than those of adult females at a given time of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. <a href="Moult">Moult</a>ing occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> and the central always-dark <a href="pupil">pupil</a> is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as <a href="Thrush%20%28bird%29">thrushes</a>, <a href="icterid">icterid</a>s or small <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related <a href="spotless%20starling">spotless starling</a> may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.
Like most terrestrial starlings the common starling moves by walking or running, rather than hopping. Their flight is quite strong and direct; their triangular-shaped wings beat very rapidly, and periodically the birds glide for a short way without losing much height before resuming powered flight. When in a flock, the birds take off almost simultaneously, wheel and turn in unison, form a compact mass or trail off into a wispy stream, bunch up again and land in a coordinated fashion. Common starling on migration can fly at and cover up to .

Several terrestrial starlings, including those in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Sturnus">Sturnus</a>", have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the <a href="Sturnus%20unicolor">spotless</a> and <a href="white-cheeked%20starling">white-cheeked starling</a>s), where the <a href="Muscle%20protractor%20pterygoidei%20et%20quadrati">protractor muscles</a> responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer down the length of the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.

In Iberia, the western Mediterranean and northwest Africa, the common starling may be confused with the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range it can be seen that the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.

The common starling is a noisy bird. Its <a href="Bird%20vocalisation">song</a> consists of a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song <a href="Mimicry">mimicked</a> from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own <a href="Musical%20repertoire">repertoire</a> with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.

Males sing constantly as the breeding period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In the presence of a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater <a href="reproductive%20success">reproductive success</a> than others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.

Singing also occurs outside the breeding season, taking place throughout the year apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making a great deal of noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.

The common starling is a highly gregarious species, especially in autumn and winter. Although <a href="Group%20size%20measures">flock size</a> is highly variable, huge, noisy flocks - murmurations - may form near roosts. These dense concentrations of birds are thought to be a defence against attacks by <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> such as <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s or <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>s. Flocks form a tight <a href="sphere">sphere</a>-like formation in flight, frequently expanding and contracting and changing shape, seemingly without any sort of leader. Each common starling changes its course and speed as a result of the movement of its closest neighbours.

Very large roosts, exceptionally up to 1.5 million birds, can form in city centres, woodlands or reedbeds, causing problems with their droppings. These may accumulate up to deep, killing trees by their concentration of chemicals. In smaller amounts, the droppings act as a <a href="fertiliser">fertiliser</a>, and therefore woodland managers may try to move roosts from one area of a wood to another to benefit from the soil enhancement and avoid large toxic deposits.

Huge flocks of more than a million common starlings may be observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern <a href="Jutland">Jutland</a>, Denmark over the seaward <a href="marshland">marshland</a>s of <a href="T%C3%B8nder">Tønder</a> and <a href="Esbjerg">Esbjerg</a> municipalities between Tønder and <a href="Ribe">Ribe</a>. They gather in March until northern Scandinavian birds leave for their breeding ranges by mid-April. Their <a href="swarm%20behaviour">swarm behaviour</a> creates complex shapes silhouetted against the sky, a phenomenon known locally as "<a href="Sort%20sol%20%28bird%20flock%29">sort sol</a>" ("black sun").
Flocks of anything from five to fifty thousand common starlings form in areas of the UK just before sundown during mid-winter. These flocks are commonly called murmurations.

The common starling is largely <a href="insectivorous">insectivorous</a> and feeds on both pest and other <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s. The food range includes <a href="spider">spider</a>s, <a href="Crane%20fly">crane flies</a>, <a href="moth">moth</a>s, <a href="Mayfly">mayflies</a>, <a href="Dragonfly">dragonflies</a>, <a href="Damsel%20fly">damsel flies</a>, <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, <a href="earwig">earwig</a>s, <a href="lacewing">lacewing</a>s, <a href="Caddisfly">caddisflies</a>, <a href="Fly">flies</a>, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, <a href="Sawfly">sawflies</a>, <a href="bee">bee</a>s, <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s and <a href="ant">ant</a>s. Prey are consumed in both adult and larvae stages of development, and common starlings will also feed on <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s, <a href="snail">snail</a>s, small <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s and <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s. While the consumption of <a href="invertebrates">invertebrates</a> is necessary for successful breeding, common starlings are <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a> and can also eat <a href="Cereal">grains</a>, <a href="seeds">seeds</a>, <a href="fruits">fruits</a>, <a href="nectar">nectar</a> and food waste if the opportunity arises. The Sturnidae differ from most birds in that they cannot easily metabolise foods containing high levels of <a href="sucrose">sucrose</a>, although they can cope with other fruits such as grapes and cherries. The isolated Azores subspecies of the common starling eats the eggs of the endangered <a href="roseate%20tern">roseate tern</a>. Measures are being introduced to reduce common starling populations by culling before the terns return to their breeding colonies in spring.

There are several methods by which common starlings obtain their food but for the most part, they forage close to the ground, taking insects from the surface or just underneath. Generally, common starlings prefer foraging amongst short-cropped grasses and are often found among grazing animals or perched on their backs, where they will also feed on the mammal's external parasites. Large flocks may engage in a practice known as "roller-feeding", where the birds at the back of the flock continually fly to the front where the feeding opportunities are best. The larger the flock, the nearer individuals are to one another while foraging. Flocks often feed in one place for some time, and return to previous successfully foraged sites.

There are three types of foraging behaviour observed in the common starling. "Probing" involves the bird plunging its beak into the ground randomly and repetitively until an insect has been found, and is often accompanied by bill gaping where the bird opens its beak in the soil to enlarge a hole. This behaviour, first described by <a href="Konrad%20Lorenz">Konrad Lorenz</a> and given the German term "zirkeln", is also used to create and widen holes in plastic garbage bags. It takes time for young common starlings to perfect this technique, and because of this the diet of young birds will often contain fewer insects. "<a href="Hawking%20%28birds%29">Hawking</a>" is the capture of flying insects directly from the air, and "lunging" is the less common technique of striking forward to catch a moving <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a> on the ground. Earthworms are caught by pulling from soil. Common starlings that have periods without access to food, or have a reduction in the hours of light available for feeding, compensate by increasing their body mass by the deposition of fat.

Unpaired males find a suitable cavity and begin to build nests in order to attract single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material is not important, as long as some is present, but the presence of <a href="herbs">herbs</a> in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as <a href="Achillea%20millefolium">yarrow</a> acts as an <a href="olfaction">olfactory</a> attractant to females.

The males sing throughout much of the construction and even more so when a female approaches his nest. Following <a href="animal%20sexual%20behavior">copulation</a>, the male and female continue to build the nest. Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside hollowed trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. "S. v. zetlandicus" typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation.

Common starlings are both <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a> and <a href="polygamous">polygamous</a>; although broods are generally brought up by one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs may be part of a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest than it is in the primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.

Breeding takes place during the spring and summer. Following copulation, the female lays eggs on a daily basis over a period of several days. If an egg is lost during this time, she will lay another to replace it. There are normally four or five eggs that are <a href="ovoid">ovoid</a> in shape and pale blue or occasionally white, and they commonly have a glossy appearance. The colour of the eggs seems to have evolved through the relatively good visibility of blue at low light levels. The egg size is in length and in maximum diameter.

<a href="Avian%20incubation">Incubation</a> lasts thirteen days, although the last egg laid may take 24 hours longer than the first to hatch. Both parents share the responsibility of brooding the eggs, but the female spends more time incubating them than does the male, and is the only parent to do so at night when the male returns to the communal roost. The young are born blind and naked. They develop light fluffy down within seven days of hatching and can see within nine days. Once the chicks are able to regulate their body temperature, about six days after hatching, the adults largely cease removing droppings from the nest. Prior to that, the fouling would wet both the chicks' plumage and the nest material, thereby reducing their effectiveness as insulation and increasing the risk of chilling the hatchlings. <a href="Nestlings">Nestlings</a> remain in the nest for three weeks, where they are fed continuously by both parents. <a href="Fledgling%20%28birds%29">Fledgling</a>s continue to be fed by their parents for another one or two weeks. A pair can raise up to three broods per year, frequently reusing and relining the same nest, although two broods is typical, or just one north of 48°N. Within two months, most juveniles will have moulted and gained their first basic plumage. They acquire their adult plumage the following year. As with other passerines, the nest is kept clean and the chicks' <a href="fecal%20sac">faecal sacs</a> are removed by the adults.

<a href="Intraspecific%20hybrid">Intraspecific</a> <a href="brood%20parasites">brood parasites</a> are common in common starling nests. Female "floaters" (unpaired females during the breeding season) present in colonies often lay eggs in another pair's nest. Fledglings have also been reported to invade their own or neighbouring nests and evict a new brood. Common starling nests have a 48% to 79% rate of successful fledging, although only 20% of nestlings survive to breeding age; the adult survival rate is closer to 60%. The average life span is about 2–3 years, with a longevity record of 22 yr 11 m.

A majority of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups is to take flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s such as the <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a> ("Accipiter gentilis") and <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a> ("Accipiter nisus"), and <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s including the <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a> ("Falco peregrinus"), <a href="Eurasian%20hobby">Eurasian hobby</a> ("Falco subbuteo") and <a href="common%20kestrel">common kestrel</a> ("Falco tinnunculus"). Slower raptors like <a href="Black%20kite">black</a> and <a href="red%20kite">red kite</a>s ("Milvus migrans & milvus"), <a href="eastern%20imperial%20eagle">eastern imperial eagle</a> ("Aquila heliaca"), <a href="common%20buzzard">common buzzard</a> ("Buteo buteo") and <a href="Swamp%20harrier">Australasian harrier</a> ("Circus approximans") tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While perched in groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the <a href="little%20owl">little owl</a> ("Athene noctua"), <a href="long-eared%20owl">long-eared owl</a> ("Asio otus"), <a href="short-eared%20owl">short-eared owl</a> ("Asio flammeus"), <a href="barn%20owl">barn owl</a> ("Tyto alba"), <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny owl</a> ("Strix aluco") and <a href="Eurasian%20eagle-owl">Eurasian eagle-owl</a> ("Bubo bubo").

More than twenty species of <a href="hawk">hawk</a>, <a href="owl">owl</a> and <a href="falcon">falcon</a> are known to occasionally predate feral starlings in North America, though the most regular predators of adults are likely to be urban-living <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s or <a href="merlin">merlin</a>s ("Falco columbarius"). <a href="Common%20myna">Common myna</a>s ("Acridotheres tristis") sometimes evict eggs, nestlings and adult common starlings from their nests, and the <a href="lesser%20honeyguide">lesser honeyguide</a> ("Indicator minor"), a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>, uses the common starling as a host. Starlings are more commonly the culprits rather than victims of nest eviction however, especially towards other starlings and <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s. Nests can be raided by mammals capable of climbing to them, such as <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s ("Mustela erminea"), <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s ("Procyon lotor") and <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s ("Sciurus" spp.), and cats may catch the unwary.

Common starlings are hosts to a wide range of parasites. A survey of three hundred common starlings from six US states found that all had at least one type of parasite; 99% had external fleas, mites or ticks, and 95% carried internal parasites, mostly various types of worm. <a href="Blood-sucking">Blood-sucking</a> species leave their host when it dies, but other external parasites stay on the corpse. A bird with a deformed bill was heavily infested with "<a href="Mallophaga">Mallophaga</a>" lice, presumably due to its inability to remove vermin.

The hen flea ("<a href="Ceratophyllus%20gallinae">Ceratophyllus gallinae</a>") is the most common <a href="flea">flea</a> in their nests. The small, pale house-sparrow flea "C. fringillae", is also occasionally found there and probably arises from the habit of its main host of taking over the nests of other species. This flea does not occur in the US, even on <a href="house%20sparrow">house sparrow</a>s. <a href="Louse">Lice</a> include "Menacanthus eurystemus", "Brueelia nebulosa" and "Stumidoecus sturni". Other arthropod parasites include "<a href="Ixodes">Ixodes</a>" <a href="tick">tick</a>s and <a href="mite">mite</a>s such as "Analgopsis passerinus", "Boydaia stumi", "<a href="Dermanyssus%20gallinae">Dermanyssus gallinae</a>", "<a href="Ornithonyssus%20bursa">Ornithonyssus bursa</a>", "O. sylviarum", "<a href="Proctophyllodes">Proctophyllodes</a>" species, "Pteronyssoides truncatus" and "Trouessartia rosteri". The hen mite "D. gallinae" is itself preyed upon by the predatory mite "<a href="Androlaelaps%20casalis">Androlaelaps casalis</a>". The presence of this control on numbers of the parasitic species may explain why birds are prepared to reuse old nests.

Flying insects that parasitise common starlings include the <a href="Hippoboscidae">louse-fly</a> "Omithomya nigricornis" and the <a href="Saprotrophic%20nutrition">saprophagous</a> fly "Camus hemapterus". The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and lives on the fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth "<a href="Hofmannophila%20pseudospretella">Hofmannophila pseudospretella</a>" are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as <a href="faeces">faeces</a> or dead nestlings. <a href="Protozoa">Protozoa</a>n blood parasites of the genus "<a href="Haemoproteus">Haemoproteus</a>" have been found in common starlings, but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet <a href="nematode">nematode</a> "<a href="gapeworm">Syngamus trachea</a>". This worm moves from the lungs to the <a href="Vertebrate%20trachea">trachea</a> and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, the <a href="Rook%20%28bird%29">rook</a> and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm "Prosthorhynchus transverses".

Common starlings may contract <a href="Mycobacterium%20avium%20subspecies%20paratuberculosis">avian tuberculosis</a>, <a href="avian%20malaria">avian malaria</a> and <a href="retrovirus">retrovirus</a>-induced <a href="lymphoma">lymphoma</a>s. Captive starlings often accumulate excess iron in the liver, a condition that can be prevented by adding black tea-leaves to the food.

The global population of common starlings was estimated to be 310 million individuals in 2004, occupying a total area of . Widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere, the bird is native to <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a> and is found throughout Europe, northern Africa (from <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a> to <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>), India (mainly in the north but regularly extending further south and extending into the Maldives) <a href="Nepal">Nepal</a>, the Middle East including <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Iran">Iran</a>, and <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> and north-western China.
Common starlings in the south and west of Europe and south of latitude 40°N are mainly <a href="Bird%20migration">resident</a>, although other populations migrate from regions where the winter is harsh, the ground frozen and food scarce. Large numbers of birds from northern Europe, Russia and Ukraine migrate south westwards or south eastwards. In the autumn, when immigrants are arriving from eastern Europe, many of Britain's common starlings are setting off for <a href="Iberia">Iberia</a> and North Africa. Other groups of birds are in passage across the country and the pathways of these different streams of bird may cross. Of the 15,000 birds ringed as nestlings in <a href="Merseyside">Merseyside</a>, England, individuals have been recovered at various times of year as far afield as Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Germany and the <a href="Low%20Countries">Low Countries</a>. Small numbers of common starling have sporadically been observed in Japan and Hong Kong but it is unclear from where these birds originated. In North America, northern populations have developed a migration pattern, vacating much of Canada in winter. Birds in the east of the country move southwards, and those from further west winter in the southwest of the US.

Common starlings prefer urban or suburban areas where artificial structures and trees provide adequate nesting and <a href="roosting">roosting</a> sites. Reedbeds are also favoured for roosting and the birds commonly feed in grassy areas such as farmland, grazing pastures, playing fields, golf courses and airfields where short grass makes foraging easy. They occasionally inhabit open forests and woodlands and are sometimes found in shrubby areas such as Australian <a href="heathland">heathland</a>. Common starlings rarely inhabit dense, wet forests (i.e. rainforests or wet <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forests) but are found in coastal areas, where they nest and roost on cliffs and forage amongst <a href="seaweed">seaweed</a>. Their ability to adapt to a large variety of habitats has allowed them to disperse and establish themselves in diverse locations around the world resulting in a habitat range from coastal wetlands to <a href="Alpine%20climate">alpine</a> forests, from sea cliffs to mountain ranges above sea level.

The common starling has been introduced to and has successfully established itself in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, North America, <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a> and several Caribbean islands. As a result, it has also been able to migrate to <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, Southeast Asia and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>.

Five individuals conveyed on a ship from England alighted near <a href="Lago%20de%20Maracaibo">Lago de Maracaibo</a> in Venezuela in November 1949, but subsequently vanished. In 1987, a small population of common starlings was observed nesting in gardens in the city of <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>. Since then, despite some initial attempts at eradication, the bird has been expanding its breeding range at an average rate of per year, keeping within of the Atlantic coast. In Argentina, the species makes use of a variety of natural and man-made nesting sites, particularly woodpecker holes.

The common starling was introduced to Australia to consume insect pests of farm crops. Early settlers looked forward to their arrival, believing that common starlings were also important for the pollination of <a href="flax">flax</a>, a major agricultural product. Nest-boxes for the newly released birds were placed on farms and near crops. The common starling was introduced to <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in 1857 and Sydney two decades later. By the 1880s, established populations were present in the southeast of the country thanks to the work of acclimatisation committees. By the 1920s, common starlings were widespread throughout <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, Queensland and <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, but by then they were considered to be pests. Although common starlings were first sighted in <a href="Albany%2C%20Western%20Australia">Albany, Western Australia</a> in 1917, they have been largely prevented from spreading to the state. The wide and arid <a href="Nullarbor%20Plain">Nullarbor Plain</a> provides a natural barrier and control measures have been adopted that have killed 55,000 birds over three decades. The common starling has also colonised <a href="Lord%20Howe%20Island">Lord Howe Island</a> and <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk Island</a>.

The early settlers in New Zealand cleared the bush and found their newly planted crops were invaded by hordes of caterpillars and other insects deprived of their previous food sources. Native birds were not habituated to living in close proximity to man so the common starling was introduced from Europe along with the <a href="House%20Sparrow">House Sparrow</a> to control the pests. It was first brought over in 1862 by the Nelson Acclimatisation Society and other introductions followed. The birds soon became established and are now found all over the country including the subtropical <a href="Kermadec%20Islands">Kermadec Islands</a> to the north and the equally distant <a href="Macquarie%20Island">Macquarie Island</a> far to the south.

After two failed attempts, about 60 common starlings were released in 1890 into New York's <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a> by <a href="Eugene%20Schieffelin">Eugene Schieffelin</a>. He was president of the <a href="American%20Acclimatization%20Society">American Acclimatization Society</a>, which reportedly tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> into North America, although this has been disputed. About the same date, the Portland Song Bird Club released 35 pairs of common starlings in Portland, Oregon. These birds became established but disappeared around 1902. Common starlings reappeared in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1940s and these birds were probably descendants of the 1890 Central Park introduction. The original 60 birds have since swelled in number to 150 million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada and Alaska to Central America.

The common starling appears to have arrived in Fiji in 1925 on Ono-i-lau and <a href="Vatoa">Vatoa</a> islands. It may have colonised from New Zealand via <a href="Raoul%20Island">Raoul</a> in the <a href="Kermadec%20Islands">Kermadec Islands</a> where it is abundant, that group being roughly equidistant between New Zealand and Fiji. Its spread in Fiji has been limited, and there are doubts about the population's viability. Tonga was colonised at about the same date and the birds there have been slowly spreading north through the group.

In South Africa, the common starling was introduced in 1897 by <a href="Cecil%20Rhodes">Cecil Rhodes</a>. It spread slowly, and by 1954, had reached <a href="Clanwilliam%2C%20Western%20Cape">Clanwilliam</a> and <a href="Port%20Elizabeth">Port Elizabeth</a>. It is now common in the southern Cape region, thinning out northwards to the Johannesburg area. It is present in the <a href="Western%20Cape">Western Cape</a>, the <a href="Eastern%20Cape">Eastern Cape</a> and the <a href="Free%20State%20%28province%29">Free State</a> provinces of South Africa and lowland <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>, with occasional sightings in <a href="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a>, <a href="Gauteng">Gauteng</a> and around the town of <a href="Oranjemund">Oranjemund</a> in <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>. In Southern Africa populations appear to be resident and the bird is strongly associated with man and <a href="Anthropogenic%20biome">anthropogenic habitats</a>. It favours irrigated land and is absent from regions where the ground is baked so dry that it cannot probe for insects. It may compete with native birds for crevice nesting sites but the indigenous species are probably more disadvantaged by destruction of their natural habitat than they are by inter-specific competition. It breeds from September to December and outside the breeding season may congregate in large flocks, often roosting in <a href="reedbed">reedbed</a>s. It is the most common bird species in urban and agricultural areas.

The inhabitants of <a href="Saint%20Kitts">Saint Kitts</a> petitioned the Colonial Secretary for a ″ ... government grant of starlings to exterminate ... ″ an outbreak of grasshoppers with was causing enormous damage to their crops in 1901. The common starling was introduced to Jamaica in 1903, and the Bahamas and Cuba were colonised naturally from the US. This bird is fairly common but local in Jamaica, <a href="Grand%20Bahama">Grand Bahama</a> and <a href="Bimini">Bimini</a>, and is rare in the rest of the Bahamas, eastern Cuba, the <a href="Cayman%20Islands">Cayman Islands</a>, <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">St. Croix</a>.

The global population of the common starling is estimated to be more than 310 million individuals and its numbers are not thought to be declining significantly, so the bird is classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>. It had shown a marked increase in numbers throughout Europe from the 19th century to around the 1950s and 60s. In about 1830, "S. v. vulgaris" expanded its range in the British Isles, spreading into Ireland and areas of Scotland where it had formerly been absent, although "S. v. zetlandicus" was already present in <a href="Shetland">Shetland</a> and the Outer Hebrides. The common starling has bred in northern Sweden from 1850 and in Iceland from 1935. The breeding range spread through southern France to northeastern Spain, and there were other range expansions particularly in Italy, Austria and Finland. It started breeding in Iberia in 1960, while the spotless starling's range had been expanding northward since the 1950s. The low rate of advance, about per year for both species, is due to the suboptimal mountain and woodland terrain. Expansion has since slowed even further due to direct competition between the two similar species where they overlap in southwestern France and northwestern Spain.

Major declines in populations have been observed from 1980 onward in Sweden, Finland, northern Russia (<a href="Karelia">Karelia</a>) and the <a href="Baltic%20States">Baltic States</a>, and smaller declines in much of the rest of northern and central Europe. The bird has been adversely affected in these areas by intensive agriculture, and in several countries it has been <a href="red-listed">red-listed</a> due to population declines of more than 50%. Numbers dwindled in the United Kingdom by more than 80% between 1966 and 2004; although populations in some areas such as <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> were stable or even increased, those in other areas, mainly England, declined even more sharply. The overall decline seems to be due to the low survival rate of young birds, which may be caused by changes in agricultural practices. The <a href="intensive%20farming">intensive farming</a> methods used in northern Europe mean there is less pasture and meadow habitat available, and the supply of grassland invertebrates needed for the nestlings to thrive is correspondingly reduced.

Since common starlings eat insect pests such as <a href="wireworm">wireworm</a>s, they are considered beneficial in northern Eurasia, and this was one of the reasons given for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25 million <a href="nest%20box">nest box</a>es were erected for this species in the former <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, and common starlings were found to be effective in controlling the grass grub "Costelytra zelandica" in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly <a href="Insectivore">insectivorous</a> bird to breed successfully, and even in the US, where this is a pest species, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</a> acknowledges that vast numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings.

Common starlings introduced to areas such as Australia or North America, where other members of the genus are absent, may affect native species through competition for nest holes. In North America, <a href="chickadee">chickadee</a>s, <a href="nuthatch">nuthatch</a>es, <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a>s, <a href="purple%20martin">purple martin</a>s and other <a href="swallow">swallow</a>s may be affected. In Australia, competitors for nesting sites include the <a href="crimson%20rosella">crimson</a> and <a href="eastern%20rosella">eastern rosella</a>s. For its role in the decline of local native species and the damages to agriculture, the common starling has been included in the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> <a href="List%20of%20the%20world%27s%20100%20worst%20invasive%20species">List of the world's 100 worst invasive species</a>.

Common starlings can eat and damage fruit in orchards such as <a href="grape">grape</a>s, <a href="peach">peach</a>es, <a href="olive">olive</a>s, <a href="Ribes">currant</a>s and <a href="tomato">tomato</a>es or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like <a href="Asparagus%20asparagoides">bridal creeper</a>, <a href="blackberry">blackberry</a> and <a href="Chrysanthemoides%20monilifera">boneseed</a> are thought to have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa as it is in the United States.

The large size of flocks can also cause problems. Common starlings may be sucked into aircraft jet engines, one of the worst instances of this being an incident in <a href="Boston">Boston</a> in 1960, when sixty-two people died after a <a href="turboprop">turboprop</a> <a href="Eastern%20Air%20Lines%20Flight%20375">airliner</a> flew into a flock and plummeted into the sea at <a href="Winthrop%2C%20Massachusetts">Winthrop</a> Harbor.

Starlings' droppings can contain the fungus "<a href="Histoplasma%23Histoplasma%20capsulatum">Histoplasma capsulatum</a>", the cause of <a href="histoplasmosis">histoplasmosis</a> in humans. At roosting sites this fungus can thrive in accumulated droppings. There are a number of other <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a>s that can potentially be transmitted by common starlings to humans, although the potential for the birds to spread infections may have been exaggerated.

Because of the damage they do, there have been attempts to control the numbers of both native and introduced populations of common starlings. Within the natural breeding range, this may be affected by legislation. For example, in Spain, this is a species hunted commercially as a food item, and has a closed season, whereas in France, it is classed as a pest, and the season in which it may be killed covers the greater part of the year. In Great Britain, Starlings are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which makes it "illegal to intentionally kill, injure or take a starling, or to take, damage or destroy an active nest or its contents". The Wildlife Order in Northern Ireland allows, with a general licence, "an authorised person to control starlings to prevent serious damage to agriculture or preserve public health and safety". This species is migratory, so birds involved in control measures may have come from a wide area and breeding populations may not be greatly affected. In Europe, the varying legislation and mobile populations mean that control attempts may have limited long-term results. Non-lethal techniques such as scaring with <a href="Bird%20scarer">visual or auditory devices</a> have only a temporary effect in any case.

Huge urban roosts in cities can create problems due to the noise and mess made and the smell of the droppings. In 1949, so many birds landed on the clock hands of London's <a href="Big%20Ben">Big Ben</a> that it stopped, leading to unsuccessful attempts to disrupt the roosts with netting, repellent chemical on the ledges and broadcasts of common starling alarm calls. An entire episode of "<a href="The%20Goon%20Show">The Goon Show</a>" in 1954 was a <a href="parody">parody</a> of the futile efforts to disrupt the large common starling roosts in central London.
Where it is introduced, the common starling is unprotected by legislation, and extensive control plans may be initiated. Common starlings can be prevented from using nest boxes by ensuring that the access holes are smaller than the diameter they need, and the removal of perches discourages them from visiting <a href="bird%20feeder">bird feeder</a>s.

Western Australia banned the import of common starlings in 1895. New flocks arriving from the east are routinely shot, while the less cautious juveniles are trapped and netted. New methods are being developed, such as tagging one bird and tracking it back to establish where other members of the flock roost. Another technique is to analyse the DNA of Australian common starling populations to track where the migration from eastern to western Australia is occurring so that better preventive strategies can be used. By 2009, only 300 common starlings were left in Western Australia, and the state committed a further A$400,000 in that year to continue the eradication programme.

In the United States, common starlings are exempt from the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act">Migratory Bird Treaty Act</a>, which prohibits the taking or killing of migratory birds. No permit is required to remove nests and eggs or kill juveniles or adults. Research was undertaken in 1966 to identify a suitable <a href="avicide">avicide</a> that would both kill common starlings and would readily be eaten by them. It also needed to be of low toxicity to mammals and not likely to cause the death of pets that ate dead birds. The chemical that best fitted these criteria was DRC-1339, now marketed as <a href="Starlicide">Starlicide</a>. In 2008, the United States government poisoned, shot or trapped 1.7 million birds, the largest number of any nuisance species to be destroyed. In 2005, the population in the United States was estimated at 140 million birds, around 45% of the global total of 310 million.

Common starlings may be kept as pets or as laboratory animals. Austrian <a href="ethology">ethologist</a> Konrad Lorenz wrote of them in his book "<a href="King%20Solomon%27s%20Ring%20%28nonfiction%29">King Solomon's Ring</a>" as "the poor man's dog" and "something to love", because nestlings are easily obtained from the wild and after careful hand rearing they are straightforward to look after. They adapt well to captivity, and thrive on a diet of standard bird feed and <a href="mealworm">mealworm</a>s. Several birds may be kept in the same cage, and their inquisitiveness makes them easy to train or study. The only disadvantages are their messy and indiscriminate defecation habits and the need to take precautions against diseases that may be transmitted to humans. As a laboratory bird, the common starling is second in numbers only to the <a href="domestic%20pigeon">domestic pigeon</a>.

The common starling's gift for mimicry has long been recognised. In the medieval Welsh "<a href="Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a>", <a href="Branwen">Branwen</a> tamed a common starling, "taught it words", and sent it across the Irish Sea with a message to her brothers, <a href="Bran%20the%20Blessed">Bran</a> and <a href="Manawydan">Manawydan</a>, who then sailed from Wales to Ireland to rescue her. <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> claimed that these birds could be taught to speak whole sentences in Latin and Greek, and in "<a href="Henry%20IV%2C%20Part%201">Henry IV</a>", William Shakespeare had <a href="Henry%20Percy%20%28Hotspur%29">Hotspur</a> declare "The king forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer. But I will find him when he is asleep, and in his ear I'll holler 'Mortimer!' Nay I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but Mortimer, and give it to him to keep his anger still in motion."
<a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> had a <a href="Mozart%27s%20starling">pet common starling</a> which could sing part of his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%2017%20%28Mozart%29">Piano Concerto in G Major</a> (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which had not yet been performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his "<a href="A%20Musical%20Joke">A Musical Joke</a>" (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at <a href="mimicry">mimicry</a> is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have just heard speak.

Common starlings are trapped for food in some Mediterranean countries. The meat is tough and of low quality, so it is casseroled or made into pâté. One recipe said it should be stewed "until tender, however long that may be". Even when correctly prepared, it may still be seen as an acquired taste.

The introduction of European starlings to the United States in 1890 by New York pharmaceutical manufacturer Eugene Schieffelin was featured in the plotline of the Netflix original series, <a href="Ozark%20%28TV%20series%29">Ozark</a> in season 1, episode 7, "Nest Box."

My Belarusy

My Biełarusy (; "We Belarusians") is the unofficial title of the <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a> of <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> and the first line of its <a href="lyrics">lyrics</a>. It is officially titled as the "State Anthem of the Republic of Belarus" (, "Dziaržawny himn Respubliki Biełaruś"). The anthem was originally written and adopted in 1955 for use in the <a href="Byelorussian%20SSR">Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic</a>. The music of the <a href="Anthem%20of%20Byelorussian%20SSR">Byelorussian SSR anthem</a> was composed by <a href="Niescier%20Saka%C5%82o%C5%ADski">Niescier Sakałoŭski</a> and the lyrics were written by <a href="Mikhas%20Klimkovich">Mikhas Klimkovich</a>. After the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution</a> of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, the music composed by Sakałoŭski was kept and the lyrics were discarded. New lyrics, which were written by Klimkovich and <a href="Uladzimir%20Karyzny">Uladzimir Karyzny</a>, were adopted by a presidential <a href="decree">decree</a> issued on 2 July 2002. The lyrics of the anthem now sing of a friendly Belarus, honoring past military battles and looking forward to the future. The music was kept due to the historical connections it has to Belarus.

"My Biełarusy" was originally used as the anthem of the <a href="Byelorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> starting from 24 February 1955. The original anthem was composed by Sakałoŭski and the lyrics were written by <a href="Mihas%27%20Klimovich">Maxim Klimkovich</a>. It was presented in front of a jury in 1944, but it took 11 years of modifications before it was officially adopted. Soon after Belarus became an independent country, the national anthem was modified to drop the Communist-era lyrics. An attempt was made in 1995 to adopt <a href="Natallia%20Arsiennieva">Natallia Arsiennieva</a>'s poem "<a href="O%20God%20Almighty">O God Almighty</a>" as the national anthem, but the suggestion was not acted on even though it was supported by a parliamentary committee.

The only legal mention of the national anthem before 2002 is in the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">Constitution of the Republic of Belarus</a>. Section One, Article 19 of the constitution states that "The symbols of the Republic of Belarus as a sovereign state shall be its national flag, national emblem and national anthem." While the constitution only mentioned the use of the flag, anthem and arms as national symbols, each symbol had to be defined by law. A law introducing an anthem was not enacted until Presidential Decree 350 took effect, on 18 July 2002, the day before <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28Belarus%29">Belarus's independence day</a>. The decree's main objective was to establish lyrics for the anthem and introduce musical notation along with the new lyrics. Moreover, the decree designated when, where, and how the anthem was to be performed.

According to the newspaper "<a href="Soviet%20Byelorussia">Soviet Byelorussia</a>", President Lukashenko decided on the anthem on 12 June 2002 and chose to have its first performance on 3 July—Belarusian independence day, the anniversary of the date in 1944 when the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> was driven away from Minsk by the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>. However, the first performance actually took place on 2 July at a concert organized by the government as part of the Belarusian independence festivities.

When Lukashenko issued his decree selecting a new national anthem, only slight changes were made to the Soviet-era hymn. While the references to Russia, the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> and <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> were replaced; the overall theme of "friendship of peoples" and the original music composed by Sakałoŭski were preserved. The government decided to keep Sakałoŭski's music in order to maintain historical continuity, and also on account of its popularity and musical quality. After the national anthem was adopted, the process of adopting national symbols was completed.

The organization <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a> commented on the adoption of the anthem in a report about the country, published in 2003. On page 125 of the "Country Report of Belarus", Freedom House says that President Lukashenko has "reintroduced the state symbols used by the old Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 2002, the president approved a streamlined version of the Soviet-era anthem "My Belarusy" ("We Belarusians"), as the country's new national anthem." The report also mentioned President Lukashenko's ban of the symbols that were used since Belarus's independence in 1991, such as the <a href="Pahonia">Pahonia</a> arms and the white, red, white flag, which Lukashenko claims are associated with <a href="fascism">fascism</a> (because the pro-Nazi <a href="Belarusian%20Central%20Rada">Belarusian Central Rada</a> in World War II used these symbols). In 2003, Dr. Taras Kuzio wrote in <a href="Radio%20Free%20Europe">Radio Free Europe</a> that President Lukashenko "is the quintessential Soviet Belarusian patriot who presides over a regime steeped in Soviet nostalgia." Kuzio said that the motives of Russia and Belarus in re-adopting Soviet-era symbols are part of restoring that nostalgia.

The anthem must be performed in accordance with the lyrics and sheet music established by law. Every day, state-owned Belarusian television and radio stations are required to play the national anthem upon signing on at 6 a.m. and again upon signing off (usually around midnight). The anthem can also be performed on certain occasions, such as at government meetings, before sporting events and presidential inaugurations. While the anthem is being performed, citizens are required to stand at attention and those in military or police uniform must <a href="salute">salute</a>.

"Vajacki Marš" ("March of the Warriors") was the official anthem of the <a href="Belarusian%20Democratic%20Republic">Belarusian Democratic Republic</a>, a Belarusian state that was created in 1918 but lasted only 10 months, during the <a href="Imperial%20Germany">German</a> occupation of Belarus in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

Since 1919, the song has been used as an anthem of Belarus by <a href="Belarusian%20diaspora">Belarusian emigrant</a> communities in <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a> and <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. It is still considered the official anthem used by the <a href="Rada%20BNR">government-in-exile of the Belarusian Democratic Republic</a>.

"<a href="Mahutny%20Bo%C5%BEa">Mahutny Boža</a>", a religious hymn, is also actively used by those who oppose the Lukashenko Government.

A favorite in the anthem competition was the poem called "<a href="Young%20Belarus%20%28poem%29">Young Belarus</a>" (Маладая Беларусь) by <a href="Janka%20Kupala">Janka Kupala</a>. However, the poem was never set to a musical composition so Young Belarus could not be selected as the anthem.

The regimes of Belarus and Russia have been working towards a closer relationship with each other, resulting in the proposed <a href="Union%20of%20Russia%20and%20Belarus">Union of Russia and Belarus</a>. While Belarus and Russia will be able to keep their own symbols, a song called "<a href="Sovereign%20Union%20of%20Nations">Sovereign Union of Nations</a>" has been proposed as the Union's unofficial anthem. The song, which was modified from the <a href="National%20Anthem%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">National Anthem of the Soviet Union</a>, refers to a wider union of the two nations.

Alongside Belarusian, Russian is a state official language of Belarus.

Wesley Clark

Wesley Kanne Clark, Sr. (born December 23, 1944) is a retired <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>. He graduated as <a href="valedictorian">valedictorian</a> of the class of 1966 at <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a> and was awarded a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> to the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, where he obtained a degree in <a href="Philosophy%2C%20Politics%20and%20Economics">Philosophy, Politics and Economics</a>. He later graduated from the <a href="Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College">Command and General Staff College</a> with a master's degree in <a href="military%20science">military science</a>. He spent 34 years in the U.S. Army, receiving many <a href="Awards%20and%20decorations%20of%20the%20United%20States%20military">military decorations</a>, several honorary <a href="knight">knight</a>hoods, and the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>.

Clark commanded <a href="1999%20NATO%20bombing%20of%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Operation Allied Force</a> in the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a> during his term as the <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Powers%20Europe">Supreme Allied Commander Europe</a> of <a href="NATO">NATO</a> from 1997 to 2000.

Clark joined the 2004 race for the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202004">presidential nomination</a> as a candidate in 2003, but withdrew from the primary race in 2004, after winning the <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> state primary, endorsing and campaigning for the eventual Democratic nominee, <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a>. Clark leads a <a href="political%20action%20committee">political action committee</a>, "WesPAC", which he formed after the 2004 primaries and used to support Democratic Party candidates in the <a href="United%20States%20general%20elections%2C%202006">2006 midterm elections</a>. Clark was considered a potential candidate for the <a href="Official%20and%20potential%202008%20United%20States%20presidential%20election%20Democratic%20candidates">Democratic nomination in 2008</a>, but, on September 15, 2007, endorsed Senator <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a>. After Clinton dropped out of the presidential race, Clark endorsed the then-presumptive Democratic nominee, <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>. Clark served as a co-chairman of <a href="Growth%20Energy">Growth Energy</a>, an ethanol lobbying group, and is on the board of directors of <a href="BNK%20Petroleum">BNK Petroleum</a>. Between July 2012 and November 2015, he was an honorary special advisor to <a href="Romania">Romania</a>n prime minister <a href="Victor%20Ponta">Victor Ponta</a> on economic and security matters.

Clark's father's family was <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a>; his paternal great-grandfather <a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">immigrated</a> to the United States from <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Belarus">Belarus</a> in response to the <a href="Pale%20of%20Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a> and <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Jewish</a> violence from <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian</a> <a href="pogrom">pogrom</a>s. Clark's grandfather, Jacob Kanne, graduated from the <a href="Chicago-Kent%20College%20of%20Law">Chicago-Kent College of Law</a> and served in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Reserve">U.S. Naval Reserve</a> as an <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29%23United%20States">ensign</a> during World War I, although he never participated in combat. Kanne, living in Chicago, became involved with <a href="Wards%20of%20the%20United%20States">ward politics</a> in the 1920s as a prosecutor and served in local offices. He served as a delegate to the <a href="1932%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1932 Democratic National Convention</a> that nominated <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> as the party's <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidential candidate</a> (though his name does not appear on the published roll of convention delegates). His mother was of <a href="English%20American">English</a> ancestry and was a Methodist.

Kanne came from the <a href="Kohen">Kohen</a> family line, and Clark's son has characterized Clark's parents' marriage, between his <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> mother, Veneta (née Updegraff), and his Jewish father, Benjamin Jacob Kanne, as "about as multicultural as you could've gotten in 1944".

Clark was born Wesley Kanne in Chicago on December 23, 1944. His father Benjamin died on December 6, 1948; his mother then moved the family to <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a>. This move was made for a variety of reasons, including escaping the greater cost of living in a large city such as Chicago, the support Veneta's family in Arkansas could provide, and her feeling of being an outsider to the remaining Kanne family as she did not share their religion. Once in Little Rock, Veneta married Viktor Clark, whom she met while working as a secretary at a bank. Viktor raised Wesley as his son, and officially <a href="adoption">adopted</a> him on Wesley's 16th birthday. Wesley's name was changed to Wesley Kanne Clark. Viktor Clark's name actually replaced that of Wesley's biological father on his <a href="birth%20certificate">birth certificate</a>, something Wesley would later say that he wished they had not done. Veneta raised Wesley without telling him of his Jewish ancestry to protect him from the anti-Jewish activities of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> in the southern U.S. Although his mother was Methodist, Clark chose a <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> church after moving to Little Rock and continued attending it throughout his childhood.

He graduated from <a href="Hall%20High%20School%20%28Arkansas%29">Hall High School</a> with a <a href="National%20Merit%20Scholarship%20Program">National Merit Scholarship</a>. He helped take their swim team to the state championship, filling in for a sick teammate by swimming two legs of a <a href="relay%20race">relay</a>. Clark has often repeated the <a href="anecdote">anecdote</a> that he decided he wanted to go to <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a> after meeting a <a href="Officer%20Cadet%23United%20States">cadet</a> with glasses who told Clark (who wore glasses as well) that one did not need <a href="visual%20acuity">perfect vision</a> to attend West Point as Clark had thought. Clark applied, and he was accepted on April 24, 1962.

Clark's military career began July 2, 1962, when he entered the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point, New York</a>. He later said that <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s famous "" speech was an important influence on his view of the military. The speech was given to the class of 1962 several months before Clark entered West Point, but a recording was played for his class when they first arrived.

Clark sat in the front in many of his classes, a position held by the highest performer in class. Clark participated heavily in <a href="debate">debate</a>, was consistently within the top 5% of his class as a whole (earning him a "Distinguished Cadet" patch on his uniform) and graduated as <a href="valedictorian">valedictorian</a> of West Point. The valedictorian is first to choose which career field of the Army to serve in, and Clark selected <a href="armoured%20forces">armor</a>. He met Gertrude Kingston, whom he later married, at a <a href="United%20Service%20Organizations">USO</a> dance for <a href="Midshipman%23United%20States%20Navy%20and%20Marine%20Corps">midshipmen</a> and West Point cadets.

Clark applied for a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> and learned in December of his senior year at West Point that he had been accepted. He spent his summer at the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Airborne%20School">United States Army Airborne School</a> at <a href="Fort%20Benning">Fort Benning</a>, Georgia. He completed his master's degree in <a href="Philosophy%2C%20Politics%2C%20and%20Economics">Philosophy, Politics, and Economics</a> (PPE) at <a href="Magdalen%20College%2C%20Oxford">Magdalen College</a> at the University of Oxford in August 1968. While he was at Oxford, a Jewish cousin of Clark's who lived in England telephoned him and informed him of his Jewish heritage, having received permission from Veneta Clark. Clark spent three months after graduation at <a href="Fort%20Knox">Fort Knox</a>, Kentucky, going through Armor Officer Basic Course, then went on to <a href="Ranger%20School">Ranger School</a> at Fort Benning. He was promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">captain</a> and was assigned as commander of the A <a href="company%20%28military%20unit%29">Company</a> of the 4th Battalion, 68th Armor, <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">82nd Airborne Division</a> at <a href="Fort%20Bragg">Fort Bragg</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>.

Clark was assigned a position in the <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Infantry Division</a> and flew to <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a> on May 21, 1969, during the U.S. involvement in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. He worked as a staff officer, collecting data and helping in operations planning, and was awarded the <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star</a> for his work with the staff. Clark was then given command of A Company, 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry of the 1st Infantry Division in January 1970. In February, only one month into his command, he was shot four times by a <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> soldier with an <a href="AK-47">AK-47</a>. The wounded Clark shouted orders to his men, who <a href="counterattack">counterattack</a>ed and defeated the Viet Cong force. Clark had injuries to his right shoulder, right hand, right hip, and right leg, and was sent to <a href="Valley%20Forge%20General%20Hospital">Valley Forge Army Hospital</a> in <a href="Phoenixville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Phoenixville, Pennsylvania</a>, to recuperate. He was awarded the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a> and the <a href="Combat%20Infantryman%20Badge">Combat Infantryman Badge</a> for his actions during the encounter.

Clark had converted to Catholicism, his wife Gertrude's religion, while in Vietnam. He saw his son, Wesley Clark, Jr., for the first time while at the <a href="Valley%20Forge%20Hospital">Valley Forge Hospital</a>. Clark commanded C Company, 6th Battalion, 32nd Armor, <a href="194th%20Armored%20Brigade%20%28United%20States%29">194th Armored Brigade</a>, a company composed of wounded soldiers, at Fort Knox. Clark has said this command is what made him decide to continue his military career past the five-year commitment required by West Point, which would have concluded in 1971. Clark completed his Armor Officer Advanced Course while at Fort Knox, taking additional elective courses and writing an article that won the Armor Association Writing Award. His next posting was to the office of the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Army Chief of Staff</a> in Washington, D.C., where he worked in the "<a href="Modern%20Volunteer%20Army">Modern Volunteer Army</a>" program from May to July 1971. He then served as an instructor in the Department of Social Sciences at West Point for three years from July 1971 to 1974.

Clark graduated from the <a href="Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College">Command and General Staff College</a> (CGSC), earning his military <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a> degree in <a href="military%20science">military science</a> from the CGSC with a thesis on American policies of <a href="gradualism">gradualism</a> in the Vietnam War. Clark's theory was one of applying force swiftly, which was being advocated by many soldiers at the time, a concept that would eventually become established as U.S. national security policy in the form of the <a href="Weinberger%20Doctrine">Weinberger Doctrine</a> and its successor, the <a href="Powell%20Doctrine">Powell Doctrine</a>. Clark was promoted to <a href="major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> upon his graduation from the CGSC.

In 1975, Clark was appointed a <a href="White%20House%20Fellows">White House Fellow</a> in the <a href="Office%20of%20Management%20and%20Budget">Office of Management and Budget</a> (OMB) as a special assistant to its director, <a href="James%20Thomas%20Lynn">James Thomas Lynn</a>. He was one of 14 appointed out of 2,307 applicants. Lynn also gave Clark a six-week assignment to assist <a href="John%20Otho%20Marsh%2C%20Jr.">John Marsh</a>, then a counselor to the President. Clark was approached during his fellowship to help push for a memorial to Vietnam veterans. He worked with the movement that helped lead to the creation of the <a href="Vietnam%20Veterans%20Memorial">Vietnam Veterans Memorial</a> in Washington, D.C. Clark served in two commands with the <a href="1st%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Armored Division</a> based in Germany from August 1976 to February 1978, first as S-3 of the 3rd Battalion 35th Armor and then as S-3 for 3rd Brigade. Clark's brigade commander while in the former position said Clark was "singularly outstanding, notably superb." Regarding his term as brigade commander, one of his battalion commanders called Clark the "most brilliant and gifted officer [he'd] ever known." He was awarded the <a href="Meritorious%20Service%20Medal%20%28United%20States%29">Meritorious Service Medal</a> for his work with the division.

The brigade commander had also said that "word of Major Clark's exceptional talent spread", and in one case reached the desk of then <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Commander</a> <a href="Alexander%20Haig">Alexander Haig</a>. Haig personally selected Clark to serve as a special assistant on his staff, a post he held from February 1978 to June 1979. While on staff at <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Powers%20Europe">Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe</a> (SHAPE), Clark wrote policy reports and coordinated two multinational military exercises. As a result of his work on Haig's staff, Clark was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant colonel</a> and was awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>. After his European post, he moved on to <a href="Fort%20Carson">Fort Carson, Colorado</a>, where he served first as the <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a> of the 1st Brigade, <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">4th Infantry Division</a> from August 1979 to February 1980, then as the commander of the <a href="77th%20Armor%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">1st Battalion, 77th Armor</a>, 4th Infantry Division from February 1980 to July 1982. According to the American journalist <a href="David%20Halberstam">David Halberstam</a>, the commander at Fort Carson, then Major General John Hudachek, had a reputation of disliking West Point graduates and fast-rising officers such as Clark. After two years of not making the list to attend a Senior Service College, Clark was selected to attend the <a href="National%20War%20College">National War College</a> graduating in June 1983, and he was promoted to full <a href="colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a> in October 1983.
Following his graduation, Clark worked in Washington, D.C., from July 1983 to 1984 in the offices of the <a href="Chief%20of%20Staff%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Chief and Deputy Chiefs of Staff of the United States Army</a>, earning a second Legion of Merit for his work. He then served as the Operations Group commander at the <a href="Fort%20Irwin%20Military%20Reservation">Fort Irwin Military Reservation</a> from August 1984 to June 1986. He was awarded another Legion of Merit and a <a href="Meritorious%20Service%20Medal%20%28United%20States%29">Meritorious Service Medal</a> for his work at Fort Irwin and was given a brigade command at Fort Carson in 1986. He commanded the 3rd Brigade, <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">4th Infantry Division</a> there from April 1986 to March 1988. Veneta Clark, Wesley's mother, fell ill as he began this command and died on <a href="Mother%27s%20Day">Mother's Day</a> in 1986. After Fort Carson, Clark returned to the Command and General Staff College to direct and further develop the Battle Command Training Program (BCTP) there until October 1989. The BCTP was created to teach senior officers war-fighting skills, according to the commanding general at the time. On November 1, 1989, Clark was promoted to <a href="Brigadier%20General%23United%20States">brigadier general</a>.

Clark returned to Fort Irwin and commanded the <a href="Fort%20Irwin%20Military%20Reservation">National Training Center</a> (NTC) from October 1989 to 1991. The <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> occurred during Clark's command, and many <a href="United%20States%20National%20Guard">National Guard</a> divisional round-out brigades trained under his command. Multiple generals commanding American forces in <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a> and <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a> said Clark's training helped bring about results in the field and that he had successfully begun training a new generation of the military that had moved past Vietnam-era strategy. He was awarded another Legion of Merit for his "personal efforts" that were "instrumental in maintaining" the NTC, according to the citation. He served in a planning post after this, as the Deputy Chief of Staff for Concepts, Doctrine, and Developments at <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Training%20and%20Doctrine%20Command">Training and Doctrine Command</a> (TRADOC) at <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe, Virginia</a>. While there, he helped the commanding general of TRADOC prepare the army for war and develop new post-<a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> strategies. Clark pushed for technological advancement in the army to establish a <a href="computer%20network">digital network</a> for military command, which he called the "digitization of the battlefield." He was promoted to <a href="Major%20General%23United%20States">Major General</a> in October 1992 at the end of this command.

Clark's divisional command came with the <a href="1st%20Cavalry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Cavalry Division</a> at <a href="Fort%20Hood">Fort Hood</a>, Texas. Clark was in command during three separate deployments of forces from Fort Hood for peacekeeping in Kuwait.
Some critics, such as left-wing "<a href="CounterPunch">CounterPunch</a>" and right-wing <a href="FrontPage%20Magazine">FrontPageMag.com</a>, have made allegations that Clark was, to some degree, involved in the <a href="Waco%20siege">Waco siege</a>, where 76 <a href="Branch%20Davidians">Branch Davidians</a> including <a href="David%20Koresh">David Koresh</a> were killed during the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI's</a> final raid on the group's compound. Some also suggest that, given the sensitive nature of the materials lent for the operation, Clark had some knowledge of and perhaps a hand in planning the Waco siege. Others, such as <a href="James%20Ridgeway">James Ridgeway</a>, dismiss the allegations as having "little evidence to substantiate them."

His Officer Evaluation Report (OER) for his command at Fort Hood called him "one of the Army's best and brightest". Clark was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">Distinguished Service Medal</a> for his work at Fort Hood and was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant general</a> at the end of his command in 1994. Clark's next assignment was an appointment as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5), on the staff of the <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> (JCS), from April 1994 to June 1996.

Army regulations set a so-called "ticking clock" upon promotion to a three-star general, essentially requiring that Clark be promoted to another post within two years from his initial promotion or retire. This deadline ended in 1996 and Clark said he was not optimistic about receiving such a promotion because rumors at the time suggested General <a href="Dennis%20Reimer">Dennis Reimer</a> did not want to recommend him for promotion although "no specific reason was given". According to Clark's book, General Robert Scales said that it was likely Clark's reputation for intelligence was responsible for feelings of resentment from other generals. Clark was named to the <a href="United%20States%20Southern%20Command">United States Southern Command</a> (USSOUTHCOM) post despite these rumors. Congress approved his promotion to full <a href="general%20%28United%20States%29">general</a> in June 1996, and General <a href="John%20M.%20Shalikashvili">John M. Shalikashvili</a> signed the order. Clark said he was not the original nominee, but the first officer chosen "hadn't been accepted for some reason."

Clark began planning work for responses to the <a href="war%20in%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">war in Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> upon his appointment in 1994 as the Director, Strategic Plans and Policy (J5) on the JCS staff. While collecting information to outline military options for resolving the conflict, Clark met with <a href="Army%20of%20Republika%20Srpska">Bosnian Serb military</a> leaders including <a href="Ratko%20Mladi%C4%87">Ratko Mladić</a>, who was later accused of <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s and <a href="genocide">genocide</a>. Clark was photographed exchanging hats with Mladić, and the photo drew controversy in the United States. A "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" story was published claiming Clark had made the visit despite a warning from the <a href="Ambassadors%20from%20the%20United%20States">U.S. ambassador</a>. Some <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Clinton administration</a> members privately said the incident was "like cavorting with Hermann Göring." Clark listed the visit in the itinerary he submitted to the ambassador, but he learned only afterwards that it was not approved. He said there had been no warning and no one had told him to cancel the visit, although two <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congressmen</a> called for his dismissal regardless. Clark later said he regretted the exchange, and the issue was ultimately resolved as President Clinton sent a letter defending Clark to the Congress and the controversy subsided. Clark said it was his "first experience in the rough and tumble of high visibility ... and a painful few days." <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Conservative</a> pundit <a href="Robert%20Novak">Robert Novak</a> later referred to the hat exchange in a column during Clark's 2004 presidential campaign, citing it as a "problem" with Clark as a candidate.

Clark was sent to Bosnia by <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="William%20Perry">William Perry</a> to serve as the military advisor to a diplomatic negotiating team headed by assistant Secretary of State <a href="Richard%20Holbrooke">Richard Holbrooke</a>. Holbrooke later described Clark's position as "complicated" because it presented him with future possibilities but "might put him into career-endangering conflicts with more senior officers." While the team was driving along a mountain road during the first week, the road gave way, and one of the vehicles fell over a cliff carrying passengers including Holbrooke's deputy, <a href="Robert%20Frasure">Robert Frasure</a>, a deputy assistant Secretary of Defense, Joseph Kruzel, and <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a> <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> Nelson Drew. Clark and Holbrooke attempted to crawl down the mountain, but were driven back by sniper fire. Once the fire ceased, Clark <a href="Abseiling">rappelled</a> down the mountain to collect the bodies of two dead Americans left by Bosnian forces that had taken the remaining wounded to a nearby hospital. Following funeral services in Washington, D.C., the negotiations continued and the team eventually reached the <a href="Dayton%20Agreement">Dayton Agreement</a> at the <a href="Wright-Patterson%20Air%20Force%20Base">Wright-Patterson Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, and later signed it in Paris on December 14, 1995.

Clark returned to the European theater and the Balkans following his <a href="United%20States%20Southern%20Command">USSOUTHCOM</a> position when he was appointed to <a href="United%20States%20European%20Command">U.S. European Command</a> in the summer of 1997 by President Clinton. He was, as with SOUTHCOM, not the original nominee for the position. The Army had already selected another general for the post. Because President Clinton and General Shalikashvili believed Clark was the best man for the post, he eventually received the nomination. Shalikashvili noted he "had a very strong role in [Clark's] last two jobs." Clark noted during his <a href="Advice%20and%20consent%23United%20States">confirmation hearing</a> before the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Senate Armed Services committee</a> of the <a href="105th%20United%20States%20Congress">105th Congress</a> that he believed <a href="NATO">NATO</a> had shifted since the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> from protecting Europe from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> to working towards more general stability in the region. Clark also addressed issues related to his then-current command of USSOUTHCOM, such as support for the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere%20Institute%20for%20Security%20Cooperation">School of the Americas</a> and his belief that the United States must continue aid to some South American nations to effectively fight the <a href="War%20on%20Drugs">War on Drugs</a>. Clark was quickly confirmed by a <a href="voice%20vote">voice vote</a> the same day as his confirmation hearing, giving him the command of 109,000 American troops, their 150,000 family members, 50,000 civilians aiding the military, and all American military activities in 89 countries and territories of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The position made Clark the <a href="Supreme%20Headquarters%20Allied%20Powers%20Europe">Supreme Allied Commander Europe</a> (SACEUR), which granted him overall command of NATO military forces in Europe.

The largest event of Clark's tenure as SACEUR was NATO's confrontation with the <a href="Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</a> in the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a>. On September 22, 1998, the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> introduced <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201199">Resolution 1199</a> calling for an end to hostilities in <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>, and Richard Holbrooke again tried to negotiate a peace. This process came to an unsuccessful end, however, following the <a href="Ra%C4%8Dak%20massacre">Račak massacre</a>. Then U.S. Secretary of State <a href="Madeleine%20Albright">Madeleine Albright</a> tried to force Yugoslavia into allowing separation of Kosovo with the <a href="Rambouillet%20Agreement">Rambouillet Agreement</a>, which Yugoslavia refused. Clark was at the Rambouillet talks and tried to convince Yugoslavian president <a href="Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Slobodan Milošević</a> by telling him "there's an activation order. And if they tell me to bomb you, I'm going to bomb you good." Clark later said Milošević launched into an emotional tirade against <a href="Albanians">Albanians</a> and said that they'd been "handled" in the 1940s by <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>.

Clark started the bombings codenamed <a href="1999%20NATO%20bombing%20of%20the%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Operation Allied Force</a> on March 24, 1999, on orders to try to enforce U.N. Resolution 1199 following Yugoslavia's refusal of the Rambouillet Agreement. However, critics note that Resolution 1199 was a call for cessation of hostilities and does not authorize any organization to take military action. Secretary of Defense <a href="William%20Cohen">William Cohen</a> felt that Clark had powerful allies at the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, such as President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who allowed him to circumvent <a href="The%20Pentagon">The Pentagon</a> in promoting his strategic ideas. Clark felt, however, that he was not being included enough in discussions with the <a href="National%20Command%20Authority">National Command Authority</a>, leading him to describe himself as "just a NATO officer who also reported to the United States". This command conflict came to a ceremonial head when Clark was not initially invited to a summit in Washington, D.C., to commemorate NATO's 50th anniversary, despite being its supreme military commander. Clark eventually secured an invitation to the summit, but was told by Cohen to say nothing about ground troops, and Clark agreed.

Clark returned to SHAPE following the summit and briefed the press on the continued bombing operations. A reporter from the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" asked a question about the effect of bombings on Serbian forces, and Clark noted that merely counting the number of opposing troops did not show Milošević's true losses because he was bringing in reinforcements. Many American news organizations capitalized on the remark in a way Clark said "distorted the comment" with headlines such as "NATO Chief Admits Bombs Fail to Stem Serb Operations" in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". Clark later defended his remarks, saying this was a "complete misunderstanding of my statement and of the facts," and President Clinton agreed that Clark's remarks were misconstrued. Regardless, Clark received a call the following evening from <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> General <a href="Hugh%20Shelton">Hugh Shelton</a>, who said he had been told by Secretary Cohen to deliver a piece of guidance verbatim: "Get your fucking face off the TV. No more briefings, period. That's it."

Operation Allied Force experienced another problem when <a href="US%20bombing%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%20embassy%20in%20Belgrade">NATO bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade</a> on May 7, 1999. The operation had been organized against numerous Serbian targets, including "Target 493, the Federal Procurement and Supply Directorate Headquarters", although the intended target building was actually 300 meters away from the targeted area. The embassy was located at this mistaken target, and three Chinese journalists were killed. Clark's intelligence officer called Clark taking full responsibility and offering to resign, but Clark declined, saying it was not the officer's fault. Secretary Cohen and <a href="Director%20of%20the%20Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">CIA Director</a> <a href="George%20Tenet">George Tenet</a> took responsibility the next day. Tenet would later explain in testimony before the <a href="United%20States%20House%20Permanent%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Intelligence">United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence</a> on July 22, 1999, that the targeting system used street addresses, which gave inaccurate positions for air bombings. He also said that the various databases of off-limit targets did not have the up-to-date address for the relatively new embassy location.

The bombing campaign was ended on June 10, 1999, on the order of <a href="Secretary%20General%20of%20NATO">Secretary General of NATO</a> <a href="Javier%20Solana">Javier Solana</a> after Milošević complied with conditions the international community had set and Yugoslav forces began to withdraw from Kosovo. <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%201244">United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244</a> was adopted that same day, placing Kosovo under United Nations administration and authorizing a <a href="Kosovo%20Force">Kosovo peacekeeping force</a>. NATO suffered no combat deaths, although two crew members died in an <a href="AH-64%20Apache">Apache helicopter</a> crash. A <a href="Lockheed%20F-117%20Nighthawk">F-117A</a> <a href="1999%20F-117A%20shoot-down">was downed</a> near the village of <a href="Bu%C4%91anovci">Budjanovci</a>. The bombing resulted in an estimated 495 civilian deaths and 820 wounded, as reported to the <a href="International%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20the%20former%20Yugoslavia">International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia</a>. Yugoslavia estimated that the number of civilians killed is higher than 2,000 and that more than 5,000 have been wounded. <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> estimates the number of civilian deaths due to NATO bombings as somewhere between 488 and 527.

Milošević's term in office in Yugoslavia was coming to an end, and the elections that came on September 24, 2000, were protested due to allegations of fraud and rigged elections. This all came to a head on October 5 in the so-called <a href="Overthrow%20of%20Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Bulldozer Revolution</a>. Milošević resigned on October 7. The <a href="Democratic%20Opposition%20of%20Serbia">Democratic Opposition of Serbia</a> won a majority in <a href="Serbian%20parliamentary%20election%2C%202000">parliamentary elections</a> that December. Milošević was taken into custody on April 1, 2001, and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia on June 28 to face charges of war crimes and genocide. Clark was called to testify in a closed session of Milošević's trial in December 2003. He testified on issues ranging from the <a href="Srebrenica%20massacre">Srebrenica massacre</a> to conversations Clark had had with Milošević during his career. Some anti-war activist groups also label Clark and Bill Clinton (along with several others) as war criminals for NATO's entire bombing campaign, saying the <a href="Legitimacy%20of%20NATO%20bombing%20of%20Yugoslavia">entire operation was in violation of the NATO charter</a>.

One of Clark's most debated decisions during his SACEUR command was his <a href="Incident%20at%20Pristina">attempted operation</a> to attack Russian troops at <a href="Pristina%20International%20Airport">Pristina International Airport</a>, immediately after the end of the Kosovo War in June 1999. A joint NATO–Russia peacekeeping operation was supposed to police Kosovo. Russia wanted their peacekeeping force to operate independently of NATO, but NATO refused. British forces were supposed to occupy Pristina International Airport, but a contingent of Russian troops arrived before they did and took control of the airport. Clark called then-Secretary General of NATO <a href="Javier%20Solana">Javier Solana</a>, who told him "you have transfer of authority" in the area. General Clark then issued an order for the NATO troops to attack and "overpower" the armed Russian troops.

In response, Lieutenant General <a href="Mike%20Jackson%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Mike Jackson</a> refused to obey the order, reportedly telling him "I'm not going to start the Third World War for you". Jackson has said he refused to take action because he did not believe it was worth the risk of a military confrontation with the Russians, instead insisting that troops encircle the airfield. The stand-off lasted two weeks. Russian forces continued to occupy the airport, until eventually an agreement was secured for them to be integrated into peace-keeping duties, while remaining outside of NATO command.

The refusal was criticized by some senior U.S. military personnel, with General <a href="Hugh%20Shelton">Hugh Shelton</a> calling Jackson's refusal "troubling". During hearings in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>, Senator <a href="John%20Warner">John Warner</a> suggested that the refusal might have been illegal, and that if it was legal, rules potentially should be changed. British <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Defence Staff</a> <a href="Charles%20Guthrie%2C%20Baron%20Guthrie%20of%20Craigiebank">Charles Guthrie</a> agreed with Jackson.

Clark received another call from General Shelton in July 1999 in which he was told that Secretary Cohen wanted Clark to leave his command in April 2000, less than three years after he assumed the post. Clark was surprised by this, because he believed SACEURs were expected to serve at least three years. Clark was told that this was necessary because General <a href="Joseph%20Ralston">Joseph Ralston</a> was leaving his post as the <a href="Vice%20Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> and would need another 4-star command within 60 days or he would be forced to retire. Ralston was not going to be appointed <a href="Chairman%20of%20the%20Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff</a> due to an extramarital affair in his past, and the SACEUR position was said to be the last potential post for him. Clark said this explanation "didn't wash"; he believed the legal issues did not necessarily bar him from a full term. Clinton signed on to Ralston's reassignment, although <a href="David%20Halberstam">David Halberstam</a> wrote that the president and Madeleine Albright were angered at Clark's treatment. Clark spent the remainder of his time as SACEUR overseeing peacekeeper forces and, without a new command to take, was forced into retirement from the military on May 2, 2000.

Rumors persisted that Clark was forced out due to his contentious relationship with some in Washington, D.C.; however, he has dismissed such rumors, calling it a "routine personnel action". The Department of Defense said it was merely a "general rotation of American senior ranks". However, a NATO ambassador told the "<a href="International%20Herald%20Tribune">International Herald Tribune</a>" that Clark's dismissal seemed to be a "political thing from the United States". General <a href="Hugh%20Shelton">Hugh Shelton</a>, working for the competing presidential campaign of <a href="John%20Edwards">John Edwards</a> in 2003-2004, said of Clark during his 2004 campaign that "the reason he came out of Europe early had to do with integrity and character issues, things that are very near and dear to my heart. I'm not going to say whether I'm a <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> or a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a>. I'll just say Wes won't get my vote." Shelton never elaborated further on what these issues were.

Clark set himself three initial goals in civilian life—to earn $40 million in the business world and practice philanthropy, to become an <a href="adjunct%20professor">adjunct professor</a>, and to become a <a href="professional%20golfer">professional golfer</a>. Clark began a <a href="public%20speaker">public speaking tour</a> in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House Speaker</a> <a href="Newt%20Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a>, <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">White House Chief of Staff</a> <a href="Mack%20McLarty">Mack McLarty</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Holbrooke">Richard Holbrooke</a>. Clark took McLarty's advice to move back to <a href="Little%20Rock%2C%20Arkansas">Little Rock, Arkansas</a>, and took a position with Stephens Inc, an investment firm headquartered there. He took several other board positions at defense-related firms, and in March 2003 he amicably left Stephens Inc to found Wesley K. Clark & Associates. Clark wrote two books, "Waging Modern War" and "Winning Modern Wars". He also authored <a href="foreword">foreword</a>s for a series of military biographies and a series of editorials. He had amassed only about $3.1 million towards his $40 million goal by 2003, and he began considering running for public office instead of pursuing his business career.

Clark has said that he began to truly define his politics only after his military retirement and the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202000">2000 presidential election</a>, won by <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>. Clark had a conversation with <a href="Condoleezza%20Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a> in which she told him that the war in Kosovo would not have occurred under Bush. Clark found such an admission unsettling, as he had been selected for the SACEUR position because he believed more in the <a href="interventionism%20%28politics%29">interventionist</a> policies of the Clinton administration. He said he would see it as a sign that things were "starting to go wrong" with American foreign policy under Bush. Clark supported the administration's <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a> in response to the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11, 2001, attacks</a> but did not support the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>. Clark continued to warn people as a commentator on <a href="CNN">CNN</a> that he believed the United States was undermanned in Iraq. He said the war was "never [about] ... <a href="weapons%20of%20mass%20destruction">WMD</a> or regime change" and believes "the connection to the War on Terrorism was not shown."

Clark met with a group of wealthy New York Democrats including <a href="Alan%20Patricof">Alan Patricof</a> to tell them he was considering running for the presidency in the 2004 election. Patricof, a supporter of <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a> in 2000, met with all the Democratic candidates but supported Clark in 2004. Clark said that he voted for Al Gore and <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>, held equal esteem for <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, and was a registered <a href="Independent%20%28United%20States%29">independent</a> voter throughout his military career. Clark stated that he decided he was a Democrat because "I was pro-affirmative action, I was pro-choice, I was pro-education ... I'm pro-health care ... I realized I was either going to be the loneliest Republican in America or I was going to be a happy Democrat." Clark said he liked the Democratic party, which he saw as standing for "<a href="internationalism%20%28politics%29">internationalism</a>", "ordinary men and women", and "fair play."

A "<a href="draft%20%28politics%29">Draft</a> Clark" campaign began to grow with the launch of DraftWesleyClark.com on April 10, 2003. The organization signed up tens of thousands of volunteers, made 150 media appearances discussing Clark, and raised $1.5 million in <a href="threshold%20pledge">pledges</a> for his campaign. A different website, DraftClark2004.com, was the first organization to register as a <a href="political%20action%20committee">political action committee</a> in June 2003 to persuade Clark to run. They had presented him with 1000 emails in May 2003 from throughout the country asking him to run. One of DraftClark2004's founders, Brent Blackaby, said of the draft effort: "Just fifty-two years ago citizens from all over the country were successful in <a href="Draft%20Eisenhower">their efforts to draft</a> General Eisenhower. We intend to do the same in 2004 by drafting General Clark. If he runs, he wins."

In June 2003, Clark said that he was "seriously consider[ing]" running for president in an appearance on "<a href="Meet%20the%20Press">Meet the Press</a>".
Clark announced his candidacy for the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29%20presidential%20primaries%2C%202004">Democratic presidential primary elections</a> from Little Rock on September 17, 2003, months after the other candidates. He acknowledged the influence of the Draft Clark movement, saying they "took an inconceivable idea and made it conceivable". The campaign raised $3.5 million in the first two weeks. The internet campaign would also establish the Clark Community Network of blogs, which remains in use and made heavy use of <a href="Meetup%20%28website%29">Meetup.com</a>, where DraftWesleyClark.com had established the second-largest community of Meetups at the time.

Clark's loyalty to the Democratic Party was questioned by some as soon as he entered the race. Senator <a href="Joe%20Lieberman">Joe Lieberman</a> called Clark's party choice a matter of "political convenience, not conviction." Republican Governor <a href="Bill%20Owens%20%28Colorado%20politician%29">Bill Owens</a> of <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Denver">University of Denver</a> president <a href="Marc%20Holtzman">Marc Holtzman</a> have claimed Clark once said "I would have been a Republican if <a href="Karl%20Rove">Karl Rove</a> had returned my phone calls." Clark later claimed he was simply joking, but both Owens and Holtzman said the remark was delivered "very directly" and "wasn't a joke." <a href="Katharine%20Q.%20Seelye">Katharine Q. Seelye</a> wrote that many believed Clark had chosen to be a Democrat in 2004 only because it was "the only party that did not have a nominee." On May 11, 2001, Clark also delivered a speech to the <a href="Pulaski%20County%2C%20Arkansas">Pulaski County</a> Republican Party in Arkansas saying he was "very glad we've got the great team in office, men like <a href="Colin%20Powell">Colin Powell</a>, <a href="Donald%20Rumsfeld">Don Rumsfeld</a>, <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a>, Condoleezza Rice, <a href="Paul%20O%27Neill%20%28cabinet%20member%29">Paul O'Neill</a>—people I know very well—our president George W. Bush." "U.S. News & World Report" ran a story two weeks later claiming Clark had considered a political run as a Republican.

Clark, coming from a non-political background, had no position papers to define his agenda for the public. Once in the campaign, however, several volunteers established a network of connections with the media, and Clark began to explain his stances on a variety of issues. He was, as he had told "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" in October, pro-choice and pro-affirmative action. He called for a repeal of recent Bush <a href="tax%20cut">tax cut</a>s for people earning more than $200,000 and suggested providing healthcare for the uninsured by altering the current system rather than transferring to a completely new <a href="universal%20health%20care">universal health care</a> system. He backed environmental causes such as promising to reverse "scaled down rules" the Bush administration had applied to the <a href="Clean%20Air%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Clean Air</a> and <a href="Clean%20Water%20Act">Clean Water Act</a>s and dealing with the potential <a href="effects%20of%20global%20warming">effects of global warming</a> by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, livestock flatulence and other sources. Clark also proposed a global effort to strengthen American relations with other nations, reviewing the <a href="USA%20PATRIOT%20Act">PATRIOT Act</a>, and investing $100 billion in <a href="homeland%20security">homeland security</a>. Finally, he released a budget plan that claimed to save $2.35 trillion over ten years through a repeal of the Bush tax cuts, sharing the cost of the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a> with other nations, and cutting government waste.

Some have speculated that Clark's inexperience at giving "<a href="soundbite">soundbite</a>" answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, he was asked if he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, "At the time, I probably would have voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," then "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, I probably would have voted for it." Finally, Clark's <a href="press%20secretary">press secretary</a> clarified his position as "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" ran a story with the headline "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight ... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country."

Another media incident started during the New Hampshire primary September 27, 2003, when Clark was asked by <a href="space%20shuttle">space shuttle</a> astronaut <a href="Jay%20C.%20Buckey">Jay C. Buckey</a> what his vision for the space program was after the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Columbia%20disaster">Space Shuttle Columbia disaster</a>. Clark responded he was a great believer in the exploration of space but wanted a vision well beyond that of a new shuttle or space plane. "I would like to see mankind get off this planet. I'd like to know what's out there beyond the solar system." Clark thought such a vision could probably require a lifetime of research and development in various fields of science and technology. Then at the end of his remarks, Clark dropped a bombshell when he said "I still believe in <a href="mass-energy%20equivalence"></a>. But I can't believe that in all of human history we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go. I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists about it. I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative." These comments prompted a series of derisive headlines, such as "Beam Us Up, General Clark" in "The New York Times", "Clark is Light-Years Ahead of the Competition" in "The Washington Post", "General Relativity (Retired)" on the <a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a> website, and "Clark Campaigns at Light Speed" in "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" magazine.
Several polls from September to November 2003 showed Clark leading the Democratic field of candidates or as a close second to <a href="Howard%20Dean">Howard Dean</a> with the <a href="The%20Gallup%20Organization">Gallup poll</a> having him in first place in the presidential race at 20% as late as October 2003. The <a href="John%20Edwards">John Edwards</a> campaign brought on Hugh Shelton—the general who had said Clark was made to leave the SACEUR post early due to "integrity and character issues"—as an advisor, a move that drew criticism from the Clark campaign. Since Dean consistently polled in the lead in the <a href="Iowa%20caucus">Iowa caucus</a>es, Clark opted out of participating in the caucuses entirely to focus on later primaries instead. The <a href="Iowa%20Democratic%20Party%20caucuses%2C%202004">2004 Iowa caucuses</a> marked a turning point in the campaign for the Democratic nomination, however, as front-runners Dean and <a href="Dick%20Gephardt">Dick Gephardt</a> garnered results far lower than expected, and <a href="John%20Kerry">John Kerry</a> and John Edwards' campaigns benefited in Clark's absence. Clark performed reasonably well in later primaries, including a tie for third place with Edwards in the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20primary">New Hampshire primary</a> and a narrow victory in the <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a> primary over Edwards. However, he saw his third-place finishes in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> as signs that he had lost <a href="Southern%20United%20States">the South</a>, a focus of his campaign. He withdrew from the race on February 11, 2004, and announced his endorsement of John Kerry at a rally in <a href="Madison%2C%20Wisconsin">Madison, Wisconsin</a>, on February 13. Clark believed his opting out of the Iowa caucus was one of his campaign's biggest mistakes, saying to one supporter the day before he withdrew from the race that "everything would have been different if we had [been in Iowa]."

Clark continued to speak in support of Kerry (and the eventual Kerry/Edwards ticket) throughout the remainder of the 2004 presidential campaign, including speaking at the <a href="2004%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">2004 Democratic National Convention</a> on the final evening. He founded a <a href="political%20action%20committee">political action committee</a>, WesPAC, in April 2004. <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News Channel</a> announced in June 2005 that they had signed General Clark as a military and <a href="international%20relations">foreign affairs</a> analyst. He joined the Burkle Center for International Relations at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">UCLA</a> as a senior fellow. A managing partner of the companies that support the Center, <a href="Ronald%20Burkle">Ronald Burkle</a>, described Clark's position as "illuminat[ing] the center's research" and "teaching [the] contemporary role of the United States in the international community."

Clark campaigned heavily throughout the <a href="United%20States%20general%20elections%2C%202006">2006 midterm election campaign</a>, supporting numerous Democrats in a variety of federal, statewide, and state legislature campaigns. Ultimately his PAC aided 42 Democratic candidates who won their elections, including 25 who won seats formerly held by Republicans and 6 newly elected <a href="veteran">veteran</a> members of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a>. Clark was the most-requested surrogate of the <a href="Democratic%20Congressional%20Campaign%20Committee">Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee</a> throughout the 2006 campaign, and sometimes appeared with the leadership of the Democratic Party when they commented on security issues.

Clark has opposed taking military action against <a href="Iran">Iran</a> and in January 2007 he criticized what he called "New York money people" pushing for a war. This led to accusations of antizionism.

In September 2007 Clark's memoir "A Time to Lead: For Duty, Honor and Country". In the book Clark alleged that during a visit to the Pentagon in the autumn of 2001 after 9/11, a "senior general" told him that the <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Office of the Secretary of Defense</a> had produced a confidential paper proposing a series of <a href="regime%20change">regime change</a> operations in seven countries over a period of five years. He had made the allegation a number of times in public and media appearances in 2006 and 2007. The book also described a conversation Clark had with <a href="Paul%20Wolfowitz">Paul Wolfowitz</a> in May 1991 after the Gulf War, quoting Wolfowitz as lamenting the non-removal of Saddam Hussein, but also telling him that "...we did learn one thing that's very important. With the end of the Cold War, we can now use our military with impunity. The Soviets won't come in to block us. And we've got five, maybe 10, years to clean up these old Soviet surrogate regimes like Iraq and Syria before the next superpower emerges to challenge us...".

Clark serves on the Advisory Boards of the <a href="Global%20Panel%20Foundation">Global Panel Foundation</a> and the <a href="National%20Security%20Network">National Security Network</a>. He is also the chairman of Enverra, and was also chairman of <a href="Rodman%20%26amp%3B%20Renshaw">Rodman & Renshaw</a>, a New York investment bank, and Growth Energy.

Clark was mentioned as a potential 2008 presidential candidate on the Democratic ticket before endorsing <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> for President. Before that time, he was ranked within the top Democratic candidates according to some Internet polls. After endorsing Hillary Clinton, Clark campaigned for her in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and Ohio and in campaign commercials. There are many reports that Clinton had already decided to choose Clark to be her running mate had she won the nomination. The Clinton campaign even considered picking Clark as a running mate with the team running together in the primaries, though the idea was later abandoned. After Barack Obama secured the Democratic nomination, Clark voiced his support for Obama. Clark was considered to be one of Obama's possible vice-presidential running mates. Clark, however, publicly endorsed Kansas governor <a href="Kathleen%20Sebelius">Kathleen Sebelius</a> for the position, introducing her as "the next Vice President of the United States" at a June 2008 fundraiser in Texas. Obama eventually chose <a href="Joe%20Biden">Joe Biden</a> as his running mate.

On June 29, 2008, Clark made comments on "<a href="Face%20the%20Nation">Face the Nation</a>" that were critical of Republican <a href="John%20McCain">John McCain</a>, calling into question the notion that McCain's military service alone had given him experience relevant to being president. "I certainly honor [McCain's] service as a prisoner of war", Clark said, "but he hasn't held executive responsibility. That large squadron in the Navy that he commanded—it wasn't a wartime squadron. He hasn't been in there and ordered the bombs to fall." When moderator <a href="Bob%20Schieffer">Bob Schieffer</a> noted that Obama had no military experience to prepare him for the presidency nor had he "ridden in a fighter plane and gotten shot down", Clark responded that, ultimately, Obama had not based his presidential bid on his military experience, as McCain has done throughout his campaign. Clark's retort, however, is what drew rebuke. In referring to McCain's military experience, he stated: "Well, I don't think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president." Both the McCain and Obama campaigns subsequently released statements rejecting Clark's comment. However, Clark has received the backing of several prominent liberal groups such as MoveOn.org and military veteran groups such as VoteVets.org; Obama ultimately stated that Clark's comments were "inartful" and were not intended to attack McCain's military service. In the days following the controversial interview, Clark went on several news programs to reiterate his true admiration and heartfelt support for McCain's military service as a fellow veteran who had been wounded in combat. In each program, Clark reminded the commentator and the viewing public that while he honored McCain's service, he had serious concerns about McCain's judgment in matters of national security policy, calling McCain "untested and untried".

In Clark's book, "Winning Modern Wars", published in 2003, he describes his conversation with a military officer in the Pentagon shortly after 9/11 regarding a plan to attack seven Middle Eastern countries in five years: "As I went back through the Pentagon in November 2001, one of the senior military staff officers had time for a chat. Yes, we were still on track for going against Iraq, he said. But there was more. This was being discussed as part of a five-year campaign plan, he said, and there were a total of seven countries, beginning with Iraq, then Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and finishing off Iran." Wesley regards the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a> as "a huge mistake".

On November 5, 2017, the <a href="Paradise%20Papers">Paradise Papers</a>, a set of confidential electronic documents relating to <a href="offshore%20investment">offshore investment</a>, revealed that online gambling company <a href="The%20Stars%20Group">The Stars Group</a>, then Amaya, along with its former member of board of directors Wesley Clark, made business with offshore law firm <a href="Appleby%20%28law%20firm%29">Appleby</a>.

Wesley Clark has been awarded numerous honors, awards, and knighthoods over the course of his military and civilian career. Notable military awards include the <a href="Defense%20Distinguished%20Service%20Medal">Defense Distinguished Service Medal</a> with four <a href="oak%20leaf%20cluster">oak leaf cluster</a>s, the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> with three oak leaf clusters, the <a href="Silver%20Star">Silver Star</a>, and the <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star</a> with an oak leaf cluster. Internationally Clark has received numerous civilian honors such as the <a href="Bundesverdienstkreuz">Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany</a> and military honors such as the Grand Cross of the <a href="Medal%20of%20Military%20Merit%20%28Portugal%29">Medal of Military Merit</a> from <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a> and knighthoods. Clark has been awarded some honors as a civilian, such as the <a href="Presidential%20Medal%20of%20Freedom">Presidential Medal of Freedom</a> in 2000. The people of <a href="Gjakova">Gjakova</a>, Kosovo, named a street after him for his role in helping their city and country. The city of <a href="Madison%2C%20Alabama">Madison</a> in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> has also named a boulevard after Clark. Municipal approval has been granted for the construction of a new street to be named "General Clark Court" in <a href="Virginia%20Beach%2C%20Virginia">Virginia Beach, Virginia</a>.
He has also been appointed a Fellow at the Burkle Center for International Relations at <a href="UCLA">UCLA</a>. He is a member of the guiding coalition of the <a href="Project%20on%20National%20Security%20Reform">Project on National Security Reform</a>. In 2000 he was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a>. In 2013, General Clark was awarded the <a href="Hanno%20R.%20Ellenbogen%20Citizenship%20Award">Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award</a> jointly presented by the <a href="Prague%20Society%20for%20International%20Cooperation">Prague Society for International Cooperation</a> and <a href="http%3A//globalpanel.org">Global Panel Foundation</a> .

Cat's Eye Nebula

The Cat's Eye Nebula or <a href="New%20General%20Catalogue">NGC</a> 6543, is a relatively bright <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a> in the northern constellation of <a href="Draco%20%28constellation%29">Draco</a>, discovered by <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a> on February 15, 1786. It was the first planetary nebula whose <a href="spectroscopy">spectrum</a> was investigated by the English <a href="amateur%20astronomy">amateur astronomer</a> <a href="William%20Huggins">William Huggins</a>, demonstrating that planetary nebulae were gaseous and not stellar in nature. Structurally, the object has had high-resolution images by the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> revealing knots, jets, bubbles and complex arcs, being illuminated by the central hot <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula nucleus</a> (PNN). 
It is a well-studied object that has been observed from <a href="radio">radio</a> to <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> <a href="Electromagnetic%20Spectrum">wavelengths</a>.

NGC 6543 is a high <a href="northern%20hemisphere">northern</a> <a href="declination">declination</a> deep-sky object. It has the combined <a href="apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> of 8.1, with high <a href="surface%20brightness">surface brightness</a>. Its small bright inner nebula subtends an average of 16.1 <a href="arcsecond">arcsec</a>, with the outer prominent condensations about 25 arcsec. Deep images reveal an extended <a href="halo%20%28optical%20phenomenon%29">halo</a> about 300 arcsec or 5 <a href="arcminutes">arcmin</a> across, that was once ejected by the central <a href="planetary%20nebula">progenitor</a> star during its <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> phase.

NGC 6543 is 4.4 <a href="minutes%20of%20arc">minutes of arc</a> from the current position of the <a href="Ecliptic%20pole">North Ecliptic Pole</a>, Less than of the 45 <a href="minutes%20of%20arc">arc minutes</a> between <a href="Polaris">Polaris</a> and the current location of the Earth's northern <a href="axis%20of%20rotation">axis of rotation</a>. It is a convenient and accurate marker for the axis of rotation of the Earth's <a href="ecliptic">ecliptic</a>, around which the <a href="Celestial%20pole">celestial North Pole</a> rotates. It is also a good marker for the nearby <a href="invariable%20plane">“invariable” axis</a> of the solar system, which is the center of the circles which "every" planet's north pole, and the north pole of every planet's orbit, make in the sky. Since motion in the sky of the ecliptic pole is very slow compared to the motion of the Earth's north pole, its position as an ecliptic pole station marker is essentially permanent on the time-scale of human history, as opposed to the <a href="Pole%20Star">Pole Star</a>, which changes every few thousand years.

Observations show the bright nebulosity has temperatures between and , whose densities average of about particles per cubic centimetre. Its outer halo has the higher temperature around , but is of much lower density. Velocity of the fast <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> is about , where <a href="Spectroscopy">spectroscopic analysis</a> shows the current rate of mass loss averages solar masses per year, equivalent to twenty trillion <a href="ton">ton</a>s per second (20 Eg/s).
Surface temperature for the central PNN is about , being times as luminous as the sun. <a href="Stellar%20classification">Stellar classification</a> is O7 + <a href="Wolf-Rayet%20star">[WR</a>]–type star Calculations suggest the PNN is over one <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a>, from a theoretical initial 5 solar masses. The central Wolf-Rayet star has a radius of (452,000 km). The Cat's Eye Nebula, given in some sources, lies about three thousand light-years from Earth.

The Cat's Eye was the first planetary nebula to be observed with a <a href="spectroscope">spectroscope</a> by <a href="William%20Huggins">William Huggins</a> on August 29, 1864. Huggins' observations revealed that the nebula's spectrum was non-continuous and made of a few bright emission lines, first indication that planetary nebulae consist of tenuous ionised gas. Spectroscopic observations at these wavelengths are used in abundance determinations, while images at these wavelengths have been used to reveal the intricate structure of the nebula.

Observations of NGC 6543 at <a href="far-infrared">far-infrared</a> wavelengths (about 60 μm) reveal the presence of <a href="interstellar%20cloud">stellar dust</a> at low temperatures. The dust is believed to have formed during the last phases of the progenitor star's life. It absorbs light from the central star and re-radiates it at <a href="infrared">infrared</a> wavelengths. The spectrum of the infrared dust emission implies that the dust temperature is about 85 K, while the mass of the dust is estimated at solar masses.

Infrared emission also reveals the presence of <a href="Ion%20%28physics%29">un-ionised</a> material such as <a href="molecular%20hydrogen">molecular hydrogen</a> (H) and <a href="argon">argon</a>. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This may be due to <a href="shock%20waves">shock waves</a> exciting the H as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8 μm) is similar in visible light.

The Hubble Space Telescope image produced here is in false colour, designed to highlight regions of high and low <a href="ion%20%28physics%29">ionisation</a>. Three images were taken, in filters isolating the light emitted by singly ionised <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> at 656.3 <a href="nanometre">nm</a>, singly ionised <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> at 658.4 nm and doubly ionised <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> at 500.7 nm. The images were combined as red, green and blue channels respectively, although their true colours are red, red and green. The image reveals two "caps" of less ionised material at the edge of the nebula.

In 2001, observations at <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> wavelengths by the <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> revealed the presence of extremely hot gas within NGC 6543 with the temperature of . It is thought that the very hot gas results from the violent interaction of a fast stellar wind with material previously ejected. This interaction has hollowed out the inner bubble of the nebula. Chandra observations have also revealed a <a href="wikt%3Apoint%20source">point source</a> at the position of the central star. The spectrum of this source extends to the hard part of the X-ray spectrum, to 0.5–. A star with the <a href="photosphere">photospheric</a> temperature of about would not be expected to emit strongly in hard X-rays, and so their presence is something of a mystery. It may suggest the presence of a high temperature <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a> within a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a> system. The hard X-ray data remain intriguing more than ten years later: the Cat's Eye was included in a 2012 Chandra survey of 21 central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) in the solar neighborhood, which found: "All but one of the X-ray point sources detected at CSPNe display X-ray spectra that are harder than expected from hot (~) central star photospheres, possibly indicating a high frequency of binary companions to CSPNe. Other potential explanations include self-shocking winds or PN mass fallback." 

Planetary nebulae distances like NGC 6543 are generally very inaccurate and not well known. Some recent Hubble Space Telescope observations of NGC 6543 taken several years apart determine its distance from the angular expansion rate of 3.457 milliarcseconds per year. Assuming a line of sight expansion velocity of 16.4 km·s, this implies that NGC 6543's distance is  <a href="parsec">parsec</a>s ( or  <a href="light-years">light-years</a>) away from Earth. Several other distance references, like what is quoted in <a href="SIMBAD">SIMBAD</a> in 2014 Stanghellini, L., et al. (2008) suggest the distance is parsecs ( light-years).

The angular expansion of the nebula can also be used to estimate its age. If it has been expanding at a constant rate of 10 milliarcseconds a year, then it would take to reach a diameter of 20 arcseconds. This may be an upper limit to the age, because ejected material will be slowed when it encounters material ejected from the star at earlier stages of its evolution, and the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a>.

Like most astronomical objects, NGC 6543 consists mostly of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="helium">helium</a>, with heavier elements present in small quantities. The exact composition may be determined by spectroscopic studies. Abundances are generally expressed relative to hydrogen, the most abundant element.

Different studies generally find varying values for elemental abundances. This is often because <a href="spectrograph">spectrograph</a>s attached to telescopes do not collect all the light from objects being observed, instead of gathering light from a slit or small <a href="aperture">aperture</a>. Therefore, different observations may sample different parts of the nebula.

However, results for NGC 6543 broadly agree that, relative to hydrogen, the helium abundance is about 0.12, <a href="carbon">carbon</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> abundances are both about , and the <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> abundance is about . These are fairly typical abundances for planetary nebulae, with the carbon, nitrogen and oxygen abundances all larger than the values found for the sun, due to the effects of <a href="nucleosynthesis">nucleosynthesis</a> enriching the star's atmosphere in heavy elements before it is ejected as a planetary nebula.

Deep spectroscopic analysis of NGC 6543 may indicate that the nebula contains a small amount of material which is highly enriched in heavy elements; this is discussed below.

The Cat's Eye Nebula is structurally a very complex nebula, and the mechanism or mechanisms that have given rise to its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebular consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with hot gas. It, in turn, is nested into a pair of larger spherical bubbles conjoined together along their waist. The waist is observed as the second larger ellipse lying perpendicular to the bubble with hot gas.

The structure of the bright portion of the nebula is primarily caused by the interaction of a fast <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> being emitted by the central PNN with the visible material ejected during the formation of the nebula. This interaction causes the emission of X-rays discussed above. The stellar wind, blowing with the velocity as high as , has 'hollowed out' the inner bubble of the nebula, and appears to have burst the bubble at both ends.

It is also suspected that the central WR:+O7 spectral class PNN star, HD 1064963 / BD +66 1066 / PPM 20679 of the nebula may be generated by a <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a>. The existence of an <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a> caused by mass transfer between the two components of the system may give rise to <a href="polar%20jet">polar jet</a>s, which would interact with previously ejected material. Over time, the direction of the polar jets would vary due to <a href="precession">precession</a>.

Outside the bright inner portion of the nebula, there are a series of concentric rings, thought to have been ejected before the formation of the planetary nebula, while the star was on the <a href="asymptotic%20giant%20branch">asymptotic giant branch</a> of the <a href="Hertzsprung-Russell%20diagram">Hertzsprung-Russell diagram</a>. These rings are very evenly spaced, suggesting that the mechanism responsible for their formation ejected them at very regular intervals and at very similar speeds. The total mass of the rings is about 0.1 solar masses. The pulsations that formed the rings probably started 15,000 years ago and ceased about years ago, when the formation of the bright central part began (see above).

Further out, a large faint halo extends to large distances from the star. The halo again predates the formation of the main nebula. The mass of the halo is estimated as 0.26–0.92 solar masses.

Ironclad warship

An ironclad is a <a href="steam%20engine">steam-propelled</a> <a href="warship">warship</a> protected by <a href="Wrought%20iron">iron</a> or <a href="steel">steel</a> <a href="iron%20armor">armor plates</a> used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century. The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary <a href="shell%20%28projectile%29">shells</a>. The first ironclad battleship, , was launched by the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> in November 1859. The British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored <a href="corvette">corvette</a> in 1857; in early 1859 the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> started building two iron-hulled armored frigates, and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all-armored battle fleet. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hampton%20Roads">first clashes of ironclads</a> (both with wooden ships and with one another) took place in 1862 during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the unarmored <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> as the most powerful warship afloat. This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War.

Ironclads were designed for several roles, including as high seas <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, <a href="Littoral%20%28military%29">coastal</a> defense ships, and long-range <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a>s. The rapid development of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden-hulled vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel-built, turreted battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century. This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns (the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea at the time), more sophisticated steam engines, and <a href="History%20of%20ferrous%20metallurgy">advances in metallurgy</a> which made steel shipbuilding possible.

The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished, and that naval tactics were in a state of flux. Many ironclads were built to make use of the <a href="naval%20ram">ram</a> or the <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>, which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat. There is no clear end to the ironclad period, but towards the end of the 1890s the term "ironclad" dropped out of use. New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s.

The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century. According to naval historian <a href="J.%20Richard%20Hill">J. Richard Hill</a>: "The (ironclad) had three chief characteristics: a metal-skinned hull, steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells. It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad." Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship, the <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> and the <a href="frigate">frigate</a>. The first major change to these types was the introduction of <a href="steam%20power">steam power</a> for <a href="Marine%20propulsion">propulsion</a>. While <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a> warships had been used from the 1830s onwards, steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the <a href="screw%20propeller">screw propeller</a> in the 1840s.

Steam-powered screw frigates were built in the mid-1840s, and at the end of the decade the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> introduced steam power to its <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a>. The desire for change came from the ambition of <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> to gain greater influence in Europe, which required a challenge to the British at sea. The first purpose-built steam battleship was the 90-gun in 1850. "Napoléon" was armed as a conventional ship-of-the-line, but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots (22 km/h), regardless of the wind conditions: a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement.

The introduction of the steam ship-of-the-line led to a building competition between France and <a href="United%20Kingdom">Britain</a>. Eight sister ships to "Napoléon" were built in France over a period of ten years, but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production. Altogether, France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line, while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41.

The era of the wooden steam ship-of-the-line was brief, because of new, more powerful naval guns. In the 1820s and 1830s, warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns, replacing <a href="18-pounder%20long%20gun">18-</a> and <a href="24-pounder%20long%20gun">24-pounder guns</a> with 32-pounders on sailing ships-of-the-line and introducing <a href="68-pounder">68-pounder</a>s on steamers. Then, the first <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29">shell</a> guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French Général <a href="Henri-Joseph%20Paixhans">Henri-Joseph Paixhans</a>, and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a>, <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Navy">Imperial Russian Navy</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls, as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> squadron at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sinop">Battle of Sinop</a>, spelled the end of the wooden-hulled warship. The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red-hot shot, which could lodge in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion. Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power.

The use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships' hulls began in the 1830s; the first "warship" with an iron hull was the gunboat <a href="Nemesis%20%281839%29">"Nemesis"</a>, built by <a href="John%20Laird%20%28shipbuilder%29">Jonathan Laird of Birkenhead</a> for the East India Company in 1839. There followed, also from Laird, the first full-blown warships with metal hulls, the 1842 steam frigates "Guadelupe" and "Montezuma" for the Mexican navy. But a thin iron skin, while not being susceptible to fire or lethal splintering like wood, was not the same thing as providing iron "armor" calculated to stop enemy gunfire.

In 1843, the United States Navy launched its first iron warship, <a href="USS%20Michigan%20%281843%29">USS "Michigan"</a>, on the Great Lakes. This pioneering iron-hulled, steam-powered ship served for 70 years in the relatively peaceful region.

Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sinop">Battle of Sinop</a>, and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the <a href="Paixhans%20guns">Paixhans guns</a> of Russian fortifications in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>, Emperor <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> ordered the development of light-draft floating batteries, equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor. Experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory, and on 17 July 1854, the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun-proof vessels and that plans would be communicated. After tests in September 1854, the British Admiralty agreed to build five armored floating batteries on the French plans, establishing the important <a href="Thames%20Ironworks%20and%20Shipbuilding%20Company">Thames</a> and <a href="Millwall%20Iron%20Works">Millwall Iron Works</a> within the docks.
The French <a href="floating%20battery">floating batteries</a> were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. The role of the battery was to assist unarmored mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications. The French used three of their ironclad batteries ("Lave", "Tonnante" and "Dévastation") in 1855 against the defenses at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kinburn%20%281855%29">Battle of Kinburn</a> on the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a>, where they were effective against Russian shore defences. They would later be used again during the <a href="Second%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">Italian war</a> in the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a> in 1859. The British floating batteries and arrived too late to participate to the action at Kinburn. The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against the well-fortified naval base at Kronstadt.

The batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only 4 knots (7 km/h) under their own power: they operated under their own power at the Battle of Kinburn, but had to be towed for long range transit. They were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy. The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begin work on armored warships for their battlefleet.

By the end of the 1850s it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships, and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required. The result was the first ocean-going ironclad, , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859.

"Gloire"s wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line, reduced to one deck, sheathed in iron plates 4.5 inches (110 mm) thick. She was propelled by a steam engine, driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots (24 km/h). She was armed with thirty-six rifled guns. France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships, including two more sister ships to "Gloire", and the only two-decked broadside ironclads ever built, and .

The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line, but was determined that the first British ironclad would outmatch the French ships in every respect, particularly speed. A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her invulnerable to enemy fire. The British specification was more a large, powerful <a href="frigate">frigate</a> than a ship-of-the-line. The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel, which had to be built from iron. The result was the construction of two s; and . The ships had a successful design, though there were necessarily compromises between 'sea-keeping', strategic range and armor protection; their weapons were more effective than that of "Gloire", and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14.3 knots (26.5 km/h). Yet the "Gloire" and her sisters had full iron-armor protection along the waterline and the battery itself. "Warrior" and "Black Prince" (but also the smaller <a href="HMS%20Defence%20%281861%29">"Defence"</a> and <a href="HMS%20Resistance%20%281861%29">"Resistance"</a>) were obliged to concentrate their armor in a central "citadel" or "armoured box", leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected. The use of iron in the construction of "Warrior "also came with some drawbacks; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls, and iron was more susceptible to fouling by marine life.

By 1862, navies across Europe had adopted ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads. However, the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships markedly different from the broadside-firing, masted designs of "Gloire" and "Warrior". The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War, and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lissa%20%281866%29">Battle of Lissa</a>, had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.

The first use of ironclads in action came in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">U.S. Civil War</a>. The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads, its most powerful ships being six unarmored steam-powered frigates. Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union, the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships. In May 1861, the Confederate Congress appropriated $2 million for the purchase of ironclads from overseas, and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships.

On 12 October 1861, the became the first ironclad to enter combat, when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Head%20of%20Passes">Battle of the Head of Passes</a>. She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting. In February 1862, the larger joined the Confederate Navy, having been rebuilt at <a href="Norfolk%20Naval%20Shipyard">Norfolk</a>. Constructed on the hull of , "Virginia" originally was a conventional warship made of wood, but she was converted into an iron-covered <a href="casemate%20ironclad">casemate ironclad</a> gunship, when she entered the <a href="Confederate%20navy">Confederate navy</a>. By this time, the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the , and was about to complete the , an innovative design proposed by the Swedish inventor <a href="John%20Ericsson">John Ericsson</a>. The Union was also building a large armored frigate, the , and the smaller .

The first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862, as the armored "Monitor" was deployed to protect the Union's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram "Virginia" and other Confederate warships. In this engagement, the second day of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hampton%20Roads">Battle of Hampton Roads</a>, the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor. The battle attracted attention worldwide, making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date, with the ironclads destroying them easily.

The Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides, and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the unarmored warships, commerce raiders and blockade runners. The Union built a large fleet of fifty <a href="monitor%20%28warship%29">monitors</a> modeled on their namesake. The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of "Virginia", many of which saw action, but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy – especially in Russia, the only country to openly support the Union through the war. Only <a href="Japanese%20ironclad%20K%C5%8Dtetsu">CSS "Stonewall"</a> was completed, and she arrived in American waters just in time for the end of the war.

Through the remainder of the war, ironclads saw action in the Union's attacks on Confederate ports. Seven Union monitors, including , as well as two other ironclads, the ironclad frigate "New Ironsides" and a light-draft , participated in the failed <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Charleston%20Harbor">attack on Charleston</a>; one was sunk. Two small ironclads, and participated in the defence of the harbor. For the later attack at <a href="Battle%20of%20Mobile%20Bay">Mobile Bay</a>, the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships, facing the , the Confederacy's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats , , .

On the western front, the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads, beginning with several converted riverboats and then contracting engineer <a href="James%20Eads">James Eads</a> of <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> to build the City-class ironclads. These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central paddle wheel, all protected by an armored casement. They had a shallow draft, allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries, and were very well suited for river operations. Eads also produced monitors for use on the rivers, the first two of which differed from the ocean-going monitors in that they contained a paddle wheel (the and ). 

The Union ironclads played an important role in the Mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts, installations and vessels with relative impunity to enemy fire. They were not as heavily armored as the ocean-going monitors of the Union, but they were adequate for their intended use. More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by <a href="torpedo%20%28mine%29">torpedoes (mines)</a> than by enemy fire, and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations, not Confederate vessels.

The first fleet battle, and the first ocean battle, involving ironclad warships was the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lissa%20%281866%29">Battle of Lissa</a> in 1866. Waged between the <a href="Austrian%20Empire">Austrian</a> and <a href="Regia%20Marina">Italian</a> navies, the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden <a href="frigate">frigate</a>s and <a href="corvette">corvette</a>s and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Navarino">Navarino</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Tsushima</a>.

The Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships, escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of Lissa. Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates, four smaller ironclads, and the newly built  – a double-turretted ram. Opposing them, the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates.

The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy, so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them. The Austrian fleet formed into an arrowhead formation with the ironclads in the first line, charging at the Italian ironclad squadron. In the melée which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns, and by the difficulty of ramming—nonetheless, the effective ramming attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years.

The superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads, and , while the Austrian unarmored screw two-decker remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironclads. The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years, and the victory won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the <a href="Adriatic">Adriatic</a>.

The battles of the American Civil War and at Lissa were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed. In particular, it taught a generation of naval officers the lesson that ramming was the best way to sink enemy ironclads.

The adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless, since their shot would bounce off an armored hull. To penetrate armor, increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships; nevertheless, the view that <a href="naval%20ram">ramming</a> was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread. The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside, in the manner of a ship-of-the-line, towards a handful of guns in turrets for all-round fire.

 From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the <a href="naval%20ram">ram</a> was again the most important weapon in naval warfare. With steam power freeing ships from the wind, and armor making them invulnerable to shellfire, the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow.

The scant damage inflicted by the guns of "Monitor" and "Virginia" at <a href="Battle%20of%20Hampton%20Roads">Battle of Hampton Roads</a> and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship <a href="SMS%20Erzherzog%20Ferdinand%20Max%20%281865%29">SMS "Erzherzog Ferdinand Max"</a> sinking the Italian <a href="Italian%20ironclad%20Re%20d%27Italia">"Re d'Italia"</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Lissa%20%281866%29">Lissa</a> gave strength to the ramming craze. From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram. Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by ramming struggled to be heard.

The revival of ramming had a significant effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a>, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its <a href="broadside">broadside</a> guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.

The ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s, as the same effect could be achieved with a <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>, with less vulnerability to quick-firing guns.

The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range; <a href="caliber">calibre</a> and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration. Throughout the ironclad era navies also grappled with the complexities of <a href="rifling">rifled</a> versus <a href="smoothbore">smoothbore</a> guns and <a href="breech-loading">breech-loading</a> versus <a href="muzzle-loading">muzzle-loading</a>.

Breech-loading guns seemed to offer important advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded without moving the gun, a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re-aimed. The "Warrior"s <a href="Armstrong%20gun">Armstrong gun</a>s also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and, because of their rifling, more accurate. Nonetheless, the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades.

The weakness of the breech-loader was the obvious problem of sealing the breech. All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of a solid <a href="propellant">propellant</a> into gas. This explosion propels the shot or shell out of the front of the gun, but also imposes great stresses on the gun-barrel. If the breech—which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun—is not entirely secure, then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break. This in turn reduces the <a href="muzzle%20velocity">muzzle velocity</a> of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew. "Warrior"s Armstrong guns suffered from both problems; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4.5 in (118 mm) armor of "Gloire", while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing. Similar problems were experienced with the breech-loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies.

These problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzle-loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s. After a brief introduction of 100-pounder or 9.5-inch (240 mm) smoothbore Somerset Gun, which weighed 6.5 <a href="long%20ton">tons</a> (6.6 t), the Admiralty introduced 7-inch (178 mm) rifled guns, weighing 7 tons. These were followed by a series of increasingly mammoth weapons—guns weighing 12, 25, 25, 38 and finally 81 tons, with <a href="caliber">calibre</a> increasing from 8-inch (203 mm) to 16-inch (406 mm).

The decision to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians. However, at least until the late 1870s, the British muzzle-loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech-loaders, which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns.

From 1875 onwards, the balance between breech- and muzzle-loading changed. Captain <a href="Val%C3%A9rand%20de%20Bange">de Bange</a> invented a method of reliably sealing a breech, adopted by the French in 1873. Just as compellingly, the growing size of naval guns made muzzle-loading much more complicated. With guns of such size there was no prospect of hauling in the gun for re-loading, or even re-loading by hand, and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re-loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire. In 1882, the 81-ton, 16-inch (406 mm) guns of fired only once every 11 minutes while bombarding <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> during the <a href="Urabi%20Revolt">Urabi Revolt</a>. The 100-ton, 450 mm (17.72 inch) guns of could each fire a round every 15 minutes.

In the Royal Navy, the switch to breech-loaders was finally made in 1879; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance, opinion was swayed by an explosion on board caused by a gun being double-loaded, a problem which could only happen with a muzzle-loading gun.

The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far. The larger the gun, the slower it would be to load, the greater the stresses on the ship's hull, and the less the stability of the ship. The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s, with some of the heaviest calibres of gun ever used at sea. carried two <a href="BL%2016.25%20inch%20Mk%20I%20naval%20gun">16.25-inch (413 mm) breech-loading guns</a>, each weighing 110 tons—no British battleship would ever carry guns as large. The Italian 450 mm (17.72 inch) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the <a href="40%20cm/45%20Type%2094">18.1-inch (460 mm)</a> armament of the Japanese of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models, following the Crimean War, range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy, especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as 'floating weapons-platform' could negate the advantage of rifling. American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least 'skip' along the surface of the water. Actual effective combat ranges, they had learned during the Civil War, were comparable to those in the Age of Sail—though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds. Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem. As a result, many naval engagements in the 'Age of the Ironclad' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets, and well below the maximum reach of their ships' guns.

Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the projectile fired or the nature of the propellant. Early ironclads used <a href="Gunpowder">black powder</a>, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The sharpness of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different <a href="brown%20powder">brown powder</a> which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.

The development of <a href="smokeless%20powder">smokeless powder</a>, based on nitroglycerine or nitrocellulose, by the French inventor <a href="Paul%20Marie%20Eug%C3%A8ne%20Vieille">Paul Vielle</a> in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels. The guns of the <a href="pre-Dreadnought%20battleship">pre-Dreadnought battleship</a>s of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s, most often 12 in (305 mm), but progressively grew in length of barrel, making use of improved propellants to gain greater muzzle velocity.

The nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period. Initially, the best armor-piercing projectile was a solid cast-iron shot. Later, shot of <a href="chill%20%28foundry%29">chilled iron</a>, a harder iron alloy, gave better armor-piercing qualities. Eventually the <a href="armor-piercing%20shot%20and%20shell">armor-piercing shell</a> was developed.

The first British, French and Russian ironclads, in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden <a href="Ship%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a>, carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called "<a href="broadside">broadside</a> ironclads". Both and were examples of this type. Because their armor was so heavy, they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck.

A significant number of broadside ironclads was built in the 1860s, principally in Britain and France, but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy, Austria, Russia and the United States. The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one adversary at a time, and the rigging did not impede the field of fire.

Broadside armament also had disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried. Furthermore, the adoption of ramming as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all-round fire. These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all-round fire, which included central-battery, turret, and barbette designs.

There were two main design alternatives to the broadside. In one design, the guns were placed in an armored casemate amidships: this arrangement was called the 'box-battery' or 'centre-battery'. In the other, the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire; when fully armored, this arrangement was called a <a href="Gun%20turret">turret</a> and when partially armored or unarmored, a <a href="barbette">barbette</a>.

The <a href="central%20battery%20ship">centre-battery</a> was the simpler and, during the 1860s and 1870s, the more popular method. Concentrating guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and handier than a broadside type. The first full-scale centre-battery ship was of 1865; the French laid down centre-battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870. Centre-battery ships often, but not always, had a recessed freeboard enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead.

The turret was first used in naval combat on the USS "Monitor" in 1862, with a type of turret designed by the Swedish engineer <a href="John%20Ericsson">John Ericsson</a>. A competing turret design was proposed by the British inventor <a href="Cowper%20Coles">Cowper Coles</a> with a prototype of this installed on <a href="HMS%20Trusty%20%281855%29">HMS "Trusty"</a> in 1861 for testing and evaluation purposes. Ericsson's turret turned on a central spindle, and Coles's turned on a ring of bearings. Turrets offered the maximum arc of fire from the guns, but there were significant problems with their use in the 1860s. The fire arc of a turret would be considerably limited by masts and rigging, so they were unsuited to use on the earlier ocean-going ironclads. The second problem was that turrets were extremely heavy. Ericsson was able to offer the heaviest possible turret (guns and armor protection) by deliberately designing a ship with very low freeboard. The weight thus saved from having a high broadside above the waterline was diverted to actual guns and armor. Low freeboard, however, also meant a smaller hull and therefore a smaller capacity for coal storage—and therefore range of the vessel. In many respects, the turreted, low-freeboard "Monitor" and the broadside sailer HMS "Warrior" represented two opposite extremes in what an 'Ironclad' was all about. The most dramatic attempt to compromise these two extremes, or 'squaring this circle', was designed by Captain Cowper Phipps Coles: <a href="HMS%20Captain%20%281869%29">HMS "Captain"</a>, a dangerously low freeboard turret ship which nevertheless carried a full rig of sail, and which subsequently capsized not long after her launch in 1870. Her half-sister was restricted to firing from her turrets only on the port and starboard beams. The third Royal Navy ship to combine turrets and masts was of 1876, which carried two turrets on either side of the centre-line, allowing both to fire fore, aft and broadside.

A lighter alternative to the turret, particularly popular with the French navy, was the barbette. These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a turntable. The crew was sheltered from direct fire, but vulnerable to <a href="plunging%20fire">plunging fire</a>, for instance from shore emplacements. The barbette was lighter than the turret, needing less machinery and no roof armor—though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top-weight of their ships. The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s, and with the addition of an armored 'gun-house', transformed into the turrets of the pre-Dreadnought battleships.

The ironclad age saw the development of explosive <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es as naval weapons, which helped complicate the design and tactics of ironclad fleets. The first torpedoes were static <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a>, used extensively in the American Civil War. That conflict also saw the development of the <a href="spar%20torpedo">spar torpedo</a>, an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat. For the first time, a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one—and given the relative inefficiency of shellfire against ironclads, the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously. The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become turretless armored spar-torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864–5, but these vessels never saw action. Another proposal, the towed or 'Harvey' torpedo, involved an explosive on a line or outrigger; either to deter a ship from ramming or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less suicidal.

A more practical and influential weapon was the self-propelled or <a href="Whitehead%20torpedo">Whitehead torpedo</a>. Invented in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s, the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS "Inflexible" and the Italian "Caio Duilio" and . The ironclad's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the <a href="Jeune%20Ecole">Jeune Ecole</a> school of naval thought; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo. In practice, however, the Jeune Ecole was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads.

The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls, and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden planking. Ironclads were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s.

Using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull. However, unarmored iron had many military disadvantages, and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years, particularly for long-range cruising warships.

Iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s. In the 1830s and 1840s, France, Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron-hulled but unarmored gunboats and frigates. However, the iron-hulled frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s, because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot; iron was more brittle than wood, and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood.

The unsuitability of unarmored iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor. However, iron gave the naval architect many advantages. Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design, for instance the use of watertight bulkheads on the lower decks. "Warrior", built of iron, was longer and faster than the wooden-hulled "Gloire". Iron could be produced to order and used immediately, in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of <a href="seasoning%20%28wood%29">seasoning</a>. And, given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron, iron hulls were increasingly cost-effective. The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough, and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden-hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought.

Wooden hulls continued to be used for long-range and smaller ironclads, because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage. Iron hulls suffered quick <a href="fouling">fouling</a> by marine life, slowing the ships down—manageable for a European battlefleet close to <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a>s, but a difficulty for long-range ships. The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper, a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive. Iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable: the Japanese and ordered in 1875 were sister-ships, but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction.

After 1872, steel started to be introduced as a material for construction. Compared to <a href="iron">iron</a>, <a href="steel">steel</a> allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight. The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet, starting with the , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876. "Redoutable" nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate, and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel.

Even though Britain led the world in steel production, the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships. The <a href="Bessemer%20process">Bessemer process</a> for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large-scale use on ships. French manufacturers used the <a href="Siemens-Martin%20process">Siemens-Martin process</a> to produce adequate steel, but British technology lagged behind. The first all-steel warships built by the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> were the dispatch vessels "Iris" and "Mercury", laid down in 1875 and 1876.

Iron-built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme. HMS "Warrior" was protected by 4.5 in (114 mm) of <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> backed by 15 in (381 mm) of <a href="teak">teak</a>, the strongest shipbuilding wood. The wood played two roles, preventing <a href="spalling">spalling</a> and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship. Later, wood and iron were combined in 'sandwich' armor, for instance in .

Steel was also an obvious material for armor. It was tested in the 1860s, but the steel of the time was too <a href="brittle">brittle</a> and disintegrated when struck by shells. Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates, giving a form of <a href="compound%20armor">compound armor</a>. This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s, first for turret armor (starting with HMS "Inflexible") and then for all armor (starting with of 1882). The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately, with licenses being given for the use of the 'Wilson System' of producing fused armor.

The first ironclads to have all-steel armor were the Italian and . Though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from France until 1877. The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet, but found it limited in supply, so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor. Britain stuck to compound armor until 1889.

The ultimate ironclad armor was <a href="case%20hardening">case hardened</a> nickel-steel. In 1890, the U.S. Navy tested steel armor hardened by the <a href="Harvey%20process">Harvey process</a> and found it superior to compound armor. For several years 'Harvey steel' was the state of the art, produced in the U.S., France, Germany, Britain, Austria and Italy. In 1894, the German firm <a href="Krupp">Krupp</a> developed <a href="Krupp%20armour">gas cementing</a>, which further hardened steel armor. The German , laid down in 1895, was the first ship to benefit from the new 'Krupp armor' and the new armor was quickly adopted; the Royal Navy using it from , laid down in 1896. By 1901 almost all new battleships used Krupp armor, though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade.

The equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows: 15 in (381 mm) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in (305 mm) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor, and to 7.75 in (197 mm) of Harvey armor or 5.75 in (146 mm) of Krupp armor.

Ironclad construction also prefigured the later debate in battleship design between tapering and 'all-or-nothing' armor design. "Warrior" was only semi-armored, and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern. As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns, the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished. "Inflexible"s armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships, protecting boilers and engines, turrets and magazines, and little else. An ingenious arrangement of cork-filled compartments and watertight bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un-armored sections.

The first ocean-going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors, and these features were only gradually abandoned. Early steam engines were inefficient; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry "5 to 9 days coal", and the situation was similar with the early ironclads. "Warrior" also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail (though in practice the steam engine was run at a low throttle), and a telescopic funnel which could be folded down to the deck level.
Ships designed for coastal warfare, like the floating batteries of the Crimea, or and her sisters, dispensed with masts from the beginning. The British , started in 1869, was the first large, ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts. Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters; while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic, she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean. The "Devastation" and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule. Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts, and only the Italian navy, which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the Adriatic, built consistently mastless ironclads.

During the 1860s, steam engines improved with the adoption of <a href="Steam%20engine%23Compounding%20engines">double-expansion</a> steam engines, which used 30–40% less coal than earlier models. The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double-expansion engine in 1871, and by 1875 they were widespread. However, this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast. Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails, or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation, is a matter of debate. A steam-only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide, which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands. Just as significantly, because of unsolved problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines, the performance of double-expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory.
During the 1870s the distinction grew between 'first-class ironclads' or 'battleships' on the one hand, and 'cruising ironclads' designed for long-range work on the other. The demands on first-class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement, which reduced speed under sail; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly inconvenient. , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881, was the last British battleship to carry masts, and these were widely seen as a mistake. The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships.

Sails persisted on 'cruising ironclads' for much longer. During the 1860s, the French navy had produced the and es as small, long-range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with ships like of 1870. The Russian ship , laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875, was a model of a fast, long-range ironclad which was likely to be able to outrun and outfight ships like "Swiftsure". Even the later , often described as the first British armored cruiser, would have been too slow to outrun "General-Admiral". While "Shannon" was the last British ship with a retractable propellor, later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig, sacrificing speed under steam in consequence. It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a long-range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders, , which was completed in 1888. While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s, rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century.

The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple-expansion steam engine, a further refinement which was first adopted in , laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891. Many ships also used a <a href="forced%20draught">forced draught</a> to get additional power from their engines, and this system was widely used until the introduction of the <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a> in the mid-1900s (decade).

While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide, there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads. Most European nations settled differences on land, and the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France, while providing suitable protection to Britain's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide. Ironclads remained, for the British Royal Navy, a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second. Those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second-rate naval powers. But these encounters were often enough to convince British policy-makers of the increasing hazards of strictly naval foreign intervention, from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the hardening combined defences of naval arsenals such as Kronstadt and Cherbourg.

There were many types of ironclads:

The United Kingdom possessed the largest navy in the world for the whole of the ironclad period. The <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> was the second to adopt ironclad warships, and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles. In the age of sail, the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy. Because of the limited endurance of steamships, this was no longer possible, so the British at times considered the risk-laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out. To this end, the Royal Navy developed a series of 'coast-defence battleships', starting with the "Devastation" class. These '<a href="monitor%20%28warship%29">breastwork monitors</a>' were markedly different from the other high-seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship. As long-range monitors they could reach Bermuda unescorted, for example. However, they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions (and enemy monitors) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War. The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of Kronstadt by the close of the Crimean War, but never considered running the smoke-ridden, shallow-water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads. Likewise, monitors proved acutely unable to 'overwhelm' enemy fortifications single-handed during the American conflict, though their low-profile and heavy armor protection made them ideal for running gauntlets. Mines and obstructions, however, negated these advantages—a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period. The British never laid down enough "Devastation"-class 'battleships' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg, Kronstadt or even New York City with gunfire. Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals, by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the <a href="Naval%20Defence%20Act%201889">Naval Defence Act</a>, which promulgated the idea of a 'two-power standard', that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined. This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s.

British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period. The Royal Navy's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the <a href="bombardment%20of%20Alexandria">bombardment of Alexandria</a> in 1882. Defending British interests against <a href="Ahmed%20%27Urabi">Ahmed 'Urabi</a>'s <a href="Urabi%20Revolt">Egyptian revolt</a>, a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria. A mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day, forcing the <a href="Egyptians">Egyptians</a> to retreat; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first, but inflicted little damage, killing only five British sailors. Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted, on the other hand, and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact. Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal, they might have quickly turned the tide, for the attacking British ironclads found it easy (for accuracy's sake) to simply anchor whilst firing—perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armored topdecks.

The French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British, but were consistently out-built by the British. Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like <a href="breech-loading%20weapon">breech-loading weapon</a>s and steel construction, the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy. In the 1870s, the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the <a href="Jeune%20Ecole">Jeune Ecole</a> school of naval thought took prominence, suggesting that <a href="torpedo%20boat">torpedo boat</a>s and unarmored <a href="cruisers">cruisers</a> would be the future of warships. Like the British, the French navy saw little action with its ironclads; the French blockade of Germany in the <a href="Franco-Prussian%20War">Franco-Prussian War</a> was ineffective, as the war was settled entirely on land.

Russia built a number of ironclads, generally copies of British or French designs. Nonetheless, there were real innovations from Russia; the first true type of ironclad <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>, "General-Admiral" of the 1870s, and a set of remarkably badly designed <a href="Russian%20monitor%20Novgorod">circular battleships</a> referred to as 'popovkas' (for <a href="Andrei%20Alexandrovich%20Popov">Admiral Popov</a>, who conceived the design). The Russian Navy pioneered the wide-scale use of torpedo boats during the <a href="Russo-Turkish%20War%20%281877%E2%80%9378%29">Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878</a>, mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy. Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships, but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership, which enhanced their defeat in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tsushima">Battle of Tsushima</a> on 27 May 1905.
The US Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty <a href="monitor%20%28warship%29">monitor</a>-type coastal ironclads; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve, leaving the USA virtually without an ironclad fleet. Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s. The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas, and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers. The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the <a href="Great%20White%20Fleet">Great White Fleet</a>, and it was the modern pre-Dreadnoughts and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> of 1898. This started a new era of naval warfare.
Ironclads were widely used in South America. Both sides used ironclads in the <a href="Chincha%20Islands%20War">Chincha Islands War</a> between Spain and the combined forces of <a href="Peru">Peru</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a> in the early 1860s. The powerful Spanish participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Callao">Battle of Callao</a> but was unable to inflict significant damage upon the Callao defences. Besides, Peru was able to deploy two locally built ironclads based on American Civil War designs, "Loa" (a wooden ship converted into a casemate ironclad) and (a small monitor armed with a single 68-pdr gun), as well as two British-built ironclads: , a centre-battery ship, and the turret ship . "Numancia" was the first ironclad to circumnavigate the world, arriving in <a href="C%C3%A1diz">Cádiz</a> on 20 September 1867, and earning the motto: "Enloricata navis que primo terram circuivit" ["First ironclad ship to sail around the world"]). In the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> in 1879, both Peru and Chile had ironclad warships, including some of those used a few years previously against Spain. While "Independencia" ran aground early on, the Peruvian ironclad made a great impact against Chilean shipping, delaying Chilean ground invasion by six months. She was eventually caught by two more modern Chilean centre-battery ironclads, and at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Angamos">Battle of Angamos</a> Point.

Ironclads were also used from the inception of the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>. (Japanese: 甲鉄, literally "Ironclad", later renamed Azuma 東, "East") had a decisive role in the <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Hakodate%20Bay">Naval Battle of Hakodate Bay</a> in May 1869, which marked the end of the <a href="Boshin%20War">Boshin War</a>, and the complete establishment of the <a href="Meiji%20Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a>. The IJN continued to develop its strength and commissioned a number of warships from British and European shipyards, first ironclads and later <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>s. These ships engaged the Chinese <a href="Beiyang%20fleet">Beiyang fleet</a> which was superior on paper at least at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Yalu%20River%20%281894%29">Battle of the Yalu River</a>. Thanks to superior short-range firepower, the Japanese fleet came off better, sinking or severely damaging eight ships and receiving serious damage to only four. The naval war was concluded the next year at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Weihaiwei">Battle of Weihaiwei</a>, where the strongest remaining Chinese ships were surrendered to the Japanese.

There is no clearly defined end to the ironclad, besides the transition from wood hulls to all-metal. Ironclads continued to be used in World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century, the descriptions '<a href="battleship">battleship</a>' and '<a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a>' came to replace the term 'ironclad'.

The proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships, producing the type known as the <a href="pre-Dreadnought">pre-Dreadnought</a>. These ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship. The next evolution of battleship design, the <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>, is never referred to as an 'ironclad'.

Most of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into the first decades of the 1900s. For instance, a handful of US navy monitors laid down in the 1870s saw active service in World War I. Pre-Dreadnought battleships and cruisers of the 1890s saw widespread action in World War I and in some cases through to World War II.

<a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> coined the term "<a href="The%20Land%20Ironclads">The Land Ironclads</a>" in a short story published in 1903, to describe fictional large <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armored fighting vehicles</a> moving on <a href="Pedrail%20wheels">Pedrail wheels</a>.

A number of ironclads have been preserved or reconstructed as museum ships.

Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)

"Once More, with Feeling" is the seventh episode of the <a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28season%206%29">sixth season</a> of the supernatural drama television series "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>" (1997–2003) and the only one in the series performed as a <a href="Musical%20theatre">musical</a>. It was written and directed by the show's creator, <a href="Joss%20Whedon">Joss Whedon</a>, and originally aired on <a href="UPN">UPN</a> in the United States on November 6, 2001.

"Once More, with Feeling" explores changes in the relationships of the main characters, using the <a href="plot%20device">plot device</a> that a demon—credited as "Sweet" but unnamed in the episode—compels the people of Sunnydale to break into song at random moments to express hidden truths. The title of the episode comes from a line sung by Sweet; once the characters have revealed their truths and face the consequences of hearing each other's secrets, he challenges them to "say you're happy now, once more, with feeling".

All of the regular cast performed their own vocals, although two actors were given minimal singing at their request. "Once More, with Feeling" is the most technically complex episode in the series, as extra voice and dance training for the cast was interspersed with the production of four other "Buffy" episodes. It was Joss Whedon's first attempt at writing music, and different styles—from 1950s sitcom theme music to rock opera—express the characters' secrets in specific ways. The episode was well received critically upon airing, specifically for containing the humor and wit to which fans had become accustomed. The musical format allowed characters to stay true to their natures while they struggled to overcome deceit and miscommunication, fitting with the sixth season's themes of growing up and facing adult responsibilities. It is considered one of the most effective and popular episodes of the series, and—prior to a financial dispute in 2007—was shown in theaters with the audience invited to sing along.

Throughout the series <a href="Buffy%20Summers">Buffy Summers</a> (<a href="Sarah%20Michelle%20Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>), in her role as the Vampire Slayer, is assisted by her close friends, who refer to themselves as the "<a href="Scooby%20Gang%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Scooby Gang</a>". These include <a href="Xander%20Harris">Xander Harris</a> (<a href="Nicholas%20Brendon">Nicholas Brendon</a>), a young man without particular strengths or talents, but devoted to Buffy and her calling, and <a href="Willow%20Rosenberg">Willow Rosenberg</a> (<a href="Alyson%20Hannigan">Alyson Hannigan</a>), a young woman who has grown from a shy but gifted student into a strong woman and powerful user of magic. They are mentored by Buffy's "<a href="Watcher%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Watcher</a>", <a href="Rupert%20Giles">Rupert Giles</a> (<a href="Anthony%20Head">Anthony Stewart Head</a>), a paternal figure since the first season, when Buffy moved to Sunnydale after her parents' divorce. Xander is engaged to <a href="Anya%20Jenkins">Anya Jenkins</a> (<a href="Emma%20Caulfield">Emma Caulfield</a>), a former <a href="vengeance%20demon">vengeance demon</a> who has become human. They have struggled with disclosing their engagement to the rest of the group and individually doubt their impending marriage.

Buffy died at the end of the fifth season ("<a href="The%20Gift%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">The Gift</a>"), sacrificing herself in place of her younger sister <a href="Dawn%20Summers">Dawn</a> (<a href="Michelle%20Trachtenberg">Michelle Trachtenberg</a>) in order to save the world. In the <a href="Bargaining%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">first episode</a> of the sixth season, Willow, believing Buffy to be in <a href="Hell">Hell</a>, used magic to bring her back from the grave. Buffy was in fact at peace, in what she thinks was heaven, but she has kept this a secret from her friends. Since her resurrection, Buffy has been lost and without inspiration to perform her duties as a Slayer. Willow is romantically involved with <a href="Tara%20Maclay">Tara Maclay</a> (<a href="Amber%20Benson">Amber Benson</a>), a powerful but ethical witch. Tara has previously expressed concern at Willow's use of her emergent magical powers for trivial or personal matters. In the preceding episode ("<a href="All%20the%20Way%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">All the Way</a>"), Willow cast a spell to make Tara forget an argument about her abuse of magic. In the same episode, Dawn, who has been stealing from stores, including Anya's magic shop, lies to Buffy and goes on a clandestine and almost deadly date. Left to take care of Dawn after the death of their mother <a href="Joyce%20Summers">Joyce Summers</a> (<a href="Kristine%20Sutherland">Kristine Sutherland</a>) in the fifth season ("<a href="The%20Body%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">The Body</a>"), Buffy has come to depend more heavily on Giles. Following Dawn's date, Buffy asks Giles to shoulder responsibility for disciplining her, much to his discomfort.

Buffy's former nemesis is <a href="Spike%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Spike</a> (<a href="James%20Marsters">James Marsters</a>), a vampire. In the fourth season <a href="The%20Initiative%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20organization%29">The Initiative</a>, a secret military organization whose mission is to evaluate and eliminate demonic beings, rendered Spike harmless by implanting a microchip in his head that causes him intense pain when he attacks humans. However, the chip does not affect him when he harms demons and he now often fights on Buffy's side, after at first fighting just for the pleasure of brawling. His motivations changed when, in the fifth season, Spike realized he had fallen in love with Buffy. She initially rejected him, but just before her death they had begun to form a friendship of sorts. She has been confiding in him; prior to this episode, he is the only one to whom Buffy has revealed that she was in heaven.

Throughout "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", music serves as a narrative tool, integral to character development and action. The mood is set by music, characters discuss it, and writers use it to emphasize differences between generations. In an essay on the use of music in the series, Jacqueline Bach writes that in conjunction with the sixth season themes of growing up, "Once More, with Feeling" gives music a central role instead of keeping it in the background.

When Buffy is on patrol, she laments in song about how uninspired her life has become ("Going Through the Motions"). The next morning at the Magic Box, the gang reveal that they also sang that evening. Led by Giles, the gang theorizes about the cause of the singing; they sense no immediate danger but agreeing that by working together they can overcome anything ("I've Got a Theory/Bunnies/If We're Together"). Buffy learns that the whole town is affected when she looks outside the shop to see a large group (led by series writer and producer <a href="David%20Fury">David Fury</a>) singing and dancing about how a dry-cleaning service got their stains out ("The Mustard").

Tara and Willow leave to "research" at home, but dally along the way while Tara muses about how much Willow has improved her life ("Under Your Spell"). The next morning, Xander and Anya perform a duet about their secret annoyances with each other and their respective doubts about their impending marriage ("I'll Never Tell"). They realize that the songs are bringing out hidden secrets, and later insist to Giles that something evil is to blame. As they argue, they walk past a woman (series writer and producer <a href="Marti%20Noxon">Marti Noxon</a>) protesting a parking ticket ("The Parking Ticket"). That evening, Buffy visits Spike, who angrily tells Buffy to leave him alone if she will not love him ("Rest in Peace").

Dawn tells Tara she is glad that Tara and Willow have made up after their argument. Since Tara has no recollection of an argument, she suspects that Willow has used magic to alter her memory. She goes to the Magic Box to consult a book, leaving Dawn alone. Dawn starts to bemoan that no one seems to notice her ("Dawn's Lament"), but is soon seized by minions of Sweet (<a href="Hinton%20Battle">Hinton Battle</a>), a <a href="zoot%20suit">zoot suit</a>-wearing, tap-dancing, singing demon. They take Dawn to The Bronze, where her attempt to escape transforms into an <a href="interpretive%20dance">interpretive dance</a> with the minions ("Dawn's Ballet") before she meets Sweet. He tells Dawn that he has come to <a href="Sunnydale">Sunnydale</a> in response to her "invocation", and he will take her to his dimension to make her his bride ("What You Feel") when his visit is complete.

At the Magic Box, Giles recognizes that he must stand aside if Buffy is to face her responsibilities in caring for Dawn instead of relying on him ("Standing") and Tara finds a picture of the forget-me-not flower Willow used to cast a spell on her in a book of magic. Giles and Tara separately resolve to leave the people they love, respectively Buffy and Willow — Giles wants to leave Buffy for her own good, while Tara wants to leave Willow because she has become horrified by Willow’s magical manipulation of their relationship ("Under Your Spell / Standing—Reprise"). Captured by Spike outside the store, one of Sweet’s minions conveys a challenge from Sweet for Buffy to rescue Dawn from The Bronze. Giles forbids the gang to assist Buffy, so she goes alone, despite having no will to do so; eventually Giles and the Scoobies change their minds and leave to catch up. Although Spike initially thinks that things would be better for him if Buffy was dead, he also changes his mind and decides to help Buffy; Sweet opines that Buffy is drawn to danger ("Walk Through the Fire").

Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy offers a deal to Sweet: she will take the place of her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her that the only way to go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, hoping he would be shown a happy ending for his marriage plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").

Joss Whedon had wanted to make a musical episode since the start of the series. This was heightened during the fifth season when he hosted a Shakespeare reading at his house, to which the cast was invited. They began drinking and singing, demonstrating to Whedon that certain cast members had musical talents. Whedon knew he would have to write an entire score, which would take weeks or months. During the first three seasons of "Buffy", he was unable to take more than two weeks off at a time, and the constraints of writing and directing the show precluded him from putting forth the effort of preparing a musical. Whedon spoke to the show's producer, <a href="Gareth%20Davies%20%28television%20producer%29">Gareth Davies</a>, about his idea; they agreed that a musical episode would be written.

Whedon spent six months writing the music for "Once More, with Feeling". When he returned after the end of the fifth season, he presented Davies with a script and CD, complete with notated and orchestrated music, which Davies found "mind-boggling". The actors were initially bewildered; in 2012, James Marsters commented that "it's obvious now that they were good songs but the thing was Joss and his wife Kai, they don't sing very well. And they don't play piano very well. The songs sounded really cheesy and horrible... We were saying, 'Joss, you're ruining our careers.'"

Preparing for the episode was physically difficult for some of the cast members, most of whom had little experience singing and dancing. They spent three months in voice training. Two choreographers worked with Whedon and the cast on dance sequences. Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn), who is trained in ballet, requested a dance sequence in lieu of a significant singing part, and Alyson Hannigan (Willow), according to Whedon, begged him not to give her many lines. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy) told the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> that "It took something like 19 hours of singing and 17 hours of dancing in between shooting four other episodes" and she was so anxious about singing that she "hated every moment of it". When Whedon suggested using a voice double for her, however, she said, "I basically started to cry and said, 'You mean someone else is going to do my big emotional turning point for the season?' In the end, it was an incredible experience and I'm glad I did it. And I never want to do it again." Davies was so impressed with <a href="Hinton%20Battle">Hinton Battle</a>'s performance on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in "<a href="The%20Wiz">The Wiz</a>" that he asked Battle to play the demon Sweet. Battle, a three-time Tony-winner, wore prosthetic make-up for the first time to give him a demonic red face. Sweet was portrayed as "slick", smooth and stylish; in contrast, most demons on the series were designed to be crude and ugly. The set for The Bronze was used frequently throughout the series, but stairs were built from the stage to maximize floor space for Battle's dance.

Running eight minutes longer than any in the series, the episode was also the most technical and complex. Whedon, who has stated this is one of his favorite "Buffy" episodes, used a widescreen <a href="letterbox">letterbox</a> format for filming (the only episode in the series to get this treatment), different lighting to bring out the sets more vibrantly, and long takes for shooting—including a complicated shot with a full conversation, a song, and two choreographed dances that took 21 attempts to get right. These were designed to give viewers all the clues they needed to establish all the nuances of the relationships between characters. Davies commented that the intricacies of filming this episode were "infinitely more complicated than a regular "Buffy"" episode, and Whedon stated in the DVD commentary that he was ambitious to prove what television is capable of, saying "it just depends how much you care". <a href="UPN">UPN</a>, the television network that aired "Buffy"s last two seasons, promoted the episode by displaying Gellar's face on billboards with music notes over her eyes, and held a special premiere event. Network president Dean Valentine remarked he thought it was "one of the best episodes of television I ever saw in my life".

Critics hailed the episode as successful in telling a complex story about all the characters in a unique way, while retaining the series' effective elements of writing and character development. Throughout the show—as in the rest of the series—the characters self-consciously address their own dialogue and actions. Anya describes her own duet "I'll Never Tell" as "a retro pastiche that's never gonna be a breakaway pop hit". With a characteristic dry demeanor, Giles explains that he overheard the information about Sunnydale residents spontaneously combusting as he was eavesdropping upon the police taking "witness arias". In her opening number, "Going Through the Motions", Buffy sings that she feels as though she is playing a part: "nothing here is real, nothing here is right". The song introduces the character's emotional state but also removes the barrier between the actor and the audience, as Gellar the actor portrays Buffy, who feels she is merely playing the part of the Slayer. This hints to the audience that the episode's musical format is strange to the actors and characters. According to "Buffy" essayist Richard Albright, the lack of polish among cast members' singing voices added to the authenticity of their breaking out into song for the first time in the series. Whedon included self-conscious dialogue and references about the characters being in a musical and showed their reluctance toward song and dance, so that the audience would feel more comfortable with the improbability of such a thing happening on the show.

The dynamic nature of the characters was a unique element of writing in the series at the time. Once they were established in the twelve episodes of the first season, characters began to change and relationships were developed in the second. This continued through the series to the point of unpredictability that sometimes became unsettling to fans. "Buffy" essayist Marguerite Krause asserts that the monsters and demons faced by the Scoobies are thin symbolism for the show's true focus: relationships and how to maintain or ruin them. Common among most of these relationships—romantic, platonic, and familial—is, according to Krause, a "failure to communicate, lack of trust, [and the] inability to envision or create a viable future". Miscommunication is worsened or sustained through multiple episodes and seasons, leading to overwhelming misunderstanding and critical turning points for the characters, some of whom do not recover.

"Once More, with Feeling" propelled the story arc for season six by allowing characters to confess previously taboo issues to themselves and each other. Whedon commented that he was "obsessive about progressing a plot in a song, about saying things we haven't said", comparing the musical theater format to the fourth-season episode "<a href="Hush%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Hush</a>", in which characters begin communicating when they stop talking. According to "Buffy" essayist Zoe-Jane Playdon, earlier episodes' "false saccharine behaviour" impedes the characters so crucially that it summons a demon to force them to be honest. The consequences in the episode of concealing truth, <a href="Spontaneous%20human%20combustion">spontaneous combustion</a>, is an allusion to "<a href="Bleak%20House">Bleak House</a>" by <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>—of whom Whedon is a fan—where characters also face immolation for being deceitful. For Buffy, however, truth is slow in coming, as she continues to lie to the Scoobies, claiming to forget what she sang about in the graveyard during "Going Through the Motions". Buffy continues her charade in the chorus number "If We're Together", beginning the song by persuading others to join in one by one, as if each is convinced that she is still invested and in charge, and their strength as a group is infallible. Although she asks in verse "Apocalypse / We've all been there / The same old trips / Why should we care?", all the Scoobies join her, including Giles despite his suspicions that Buffy is no longer interested in her life.

Secrets reveal themselves steadily throughout the episode. Xander fears that his future marriage will turn him into an argumentative drunk like his father. He attempts to avoid his fears through the song "I'll Never Tell", singing "'coz there's nothing to tell", after summoning Sweet to Sunnydale to show him that he and Anya will be happy. Amid the various annoyances Xander and Anya express through this song, some verses are clear-sighted observations of behavior, such as Anya's accusation that Xander—once in love with Buffy—uses Buffy as a mother figure to hide behind. Anya also avoids the truth by burying herself in wedding plans without thinking critically about what being married will entail; instead she considers Xander an accessory to her desired lifestyle. Of all the characters, Anya is the most preoccupied with the style of singing and songs, demanding to know if Spike sang "a breakaway pop hit, or a book number", and asking Dawn if the <a href="Pterosaur">pterodactyl</a> she facetiously says she gave birth to also broke into song. Anya and Xander's duet is the only song in the episode to address the audience directly. During the long single-shot scene when she and Xander talk over each other insisting to Giles that evil must be at play, Anya refers to the audience, saying "It was like we were being watched ... Like there was a wall missing ... in our apartment ... Like there were only three walls and not a <a href="fourth%20wall">fourth wall</a>." Albright asserts that Anya's constant preoccupation with her and others' performances indicates that she has serious doubts about her future supporting role as Xander's wife.

Giles' truth, according to Whedon, is that he realizes he must not "fight my kid's battles or my kid will never grow up", which he sings in "Standing" while he throws knives at Buffy as part of her training. Whedon remarked that this touch "is the kind of complete turnaround that is a staple of the "Buffy" universe". Tara's heartfelt love song also has an ironic subtext; although she appears to mean that she is fulfilled by her relationship with Willow, the lyrics include multiple allusions to Willow working her manipulative will over Tara, overlaid with Tara's euphoric singing about her pleasure in their union. In "", Lorna Jowett calls the song between Willow and Tara the transformational event in their relationship, from Tara's subservient bearing towards Willow, into a relationship of equals. Two "Buffy" essayists note that Willow and Giles sing together at the start of the episode, but later Tara and Giles share a duet to express the diminished part each plays in their respective relationships.

Although "Once More, with Feeling" allows all the characters to confess truthfully, with the exception of Willow, it does not resolve the behavior that demanded confession in the first place. At the end of the episode, Buffy kisses Spike, initiating a romance that she hides from her friends. Their relationship lasts until the end of the series, marked for a time by Buffy's loathing of him because he has no soul. Her relationship with Spike, however, allows her to feel lust and attraction, which she yearns for after being pulled back from a heavenly dimension. In "The Psychology of Joss Whedon", Mikhail Lubyansky writes that, although Buffy's first step toward re-engaging with her life is telling the Scoobies the truth in the song "Something to Sing About", she does not find meaning again until the end of the season. In his essay "A Kantian Analysis of Moral Judgment in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", Scott Stroud explains that Buffy, as the central character throughout the series, is torn between her desires and her duty, in a <a href="Immanuel%20Kant">Kantian</a> illustration of <a href="free%20will">free will</a> vs. <a href="predeterminism">predeterminism</a>, symbolized by her responsibility as a Slayer and her adolescent impulses. In earlier seasons, this takes the form of simpler pleasures such as dating and socializing, interspersed with defeating evil forces. It reaches a climax in the ultimate sacrifice when Buffy offers to die to save the world. However, "Once More, with Feeling", according to Stroud, is the turning point at which she begins to face her responsibility to the community, her friends and her family. Not only does she continue her Slaying despite a lack of inspiration, but for the rest of the season she works at a humiliating job to provide for her sister and friends.

"Once More, with Feeling" was Joss Whedon's first attempt at writing music, which he had always wanted to do. He learned how to play guitar to write several songs. <a href="Christophe%20Beck">Christophe Beck</a>, a regular composer for the series, filled in the overture and coda and composed "Dawn's Ballet". Whedon is a fan of <a href="Stephen%20Sondheim">Stephen Sondheim</a>, and used him as the inspiration for much of the music, particularly with the episode's ambiguous ending. Cast member James Marsters (Spike) said, "Some of Joss' music is surprisingly complicated. Maybe it's a Beatles thing. He doesn't know enough to know what he can't do and he's smashing rules."

The episode's musical style varies significantly. Buffy's opening number, "Going Through the Motions", was influenced heavily by the <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> song "<a href="Part%20of%20Your%20World">Part of Your World</a>" sung by <a href="Ariel%20%28The%20Little%20Mermaid%29">Ariel</a> in "<a href="The%20Little%20Mermaid%20%281989%20film%29">The Little Mermaid</a>". Whedon wanted to use a similar opening in which the heroine explains her yearning. While singing her song, Buffy fights three vampires and a demon who themselves break into a choreographed dance; Whedon wanted this to be fun but not distracting. The song ends with chord influences from <a href="Stephen%20Schwartz%20%28composer%29">Stephen Schwartz's</a> "<a href="Pippin%20%28musical%29">Pippin</a>" and a visual tribute to Disney: as Buffy stakes a vampire, it turns to dust that swirls around her face.

Whedon chose the most complicated scene, with the most dancers and choreography in the classic style of musical theater, to accompany an 18-second song ("The Mustard") "to get it out of the way" for more personal numbers later in the episode. <a href="Stephanie%20Zacharek">Stephanie Zacharek</a> of Salon.com considers this "brilliant because it frees even people who hate musicals to settle into the story without getting hung up on the genre's conventions". The musical styles span from a jaunty 1950s sitcom arrangement of the Buffy theme in the opening credits—the only episode in the series to begin without the normal version of the theme song and full cast roll, signifying a genre shift—to Anya's hard-rock version of "Bunnies". Whedon assigned Emma Caulfield the rock-opera format because Caulfield often sang in such a way to him on the set. Spike's "Rest in Peace" is also a rock song, which Whedon wrote after completing the episode's first song, Tara's "Under Your Spell", a contemporary pop song with radio-play potential. Xander and Anya's duet—the most fun to shoot but difficult to write, according to Whedon—is inspired by <a href="Fred%20Astaire">Fred Astaire</a>-<a href="Ginger%20Rogers">Ginger Rogers</a> comedies as evidenced by the silken pajama costumes and art deco apartment setting. Musically, the song uses influences from <a href="Ira%20Gershwin">Ira Gershwin</a>, a <a href="Charleston%20%28song%29">Charleston</a> rhythm, and jazz-like chord slides. Giles' "Standing" is a ballad to Buffy that she does not hear, unlike the songs revealing truths elsewhere in the episode. Whedon shot the scene so that Giles moves in real time while Buffy works out in slow motion, to accentuate Giles' distance from her. Buffy's not hearing his song was intentional; Whedon explained, "You can sing to someone in musicals and they can never know how you feel or how much you love them, even if they're standing right in front of you".

"Under Your Spell" received attention from <a href="Buffy%20studies">Buffy studies</a> writers because it presents a frank and unflinching expression of lesbian romance. "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" was the first show in U.S. television history to portray a long-term lesbian relationship among the core cast of characters. Previous televised depictions of lesbian relations were primarily limited to single "coming out" or <a href="lesbian%20kiss%20episode">"lesbian kiss" episodes</a>, showing lesbian-identified characters as affectionate but not erotic. Tara and Willow demonstrate throughout the series, and specifically in "Once More, with Feeling", that they are "intensely sexual", according to "Buffy" essayist <a href="Justine%20Larbalestier">Justine Larbalestier</a>. Near the end of Tara's song, she sings, "Lost in ecstasy / Spread beneath my Willow tree / You make me / Com — plete", as Tara levitates off the bed while Willow tacitly performs <a href="cunnilingus">cunnilingus</a> on her. Lorna Jowett called the song "the most erotic scene" of the series. Whedon admitted on the DVD commentary for the episode that the song is "pornography" and "probably the dirtiest lyric I've ever written, but also very, very beautiful".

"Buffy" essayist <a href="Ian%20Shuttleworth">Ian Shuttleworth</a> writes that Amber Benson (Tara) has "the sweetest singing voice of all the lead players", referring to "Under Your Spell" as "heavenly and salacious"; author Nikki Stafford concurs, writing that Benson "has the most stunning voice, showing a surprising range". Whedon acknowledged that the "lyrical, heavenly quality" of Benson's voice led him to assign her the episode's love song. Alyson Hannigan (Willow) was unwilling to sing much and her performance is "apprehensive", according to Shuttleworth. He considers this an example of Tara's quieter strength coming out in front of Willow's showy demonstrations of powerful magic. Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox interprets Willow's diminished role representing the show's silence about Willow's descent into addiction and darkness through the rest of the season. Benson remarked that Tara's story arc is significant within the episode, starting out with ecstasy but soon recognizing the illusory circumstances surrounding her bliss and that "life can't be perfect all the time".

The most complicated song, "Walk Through the Fire", leads all the characters to the climax from different locations for different reasons, reminiscent of the "<a href="Tonight%20Quintet">Tonight Quintet</a>" from "<a href="West%20Side%20Story">West Side Story</a>". When they all sing the chorus at once to the line "We will walk through the fire / And let it — burn", two fire trucks race behind the Scoobies as they proceed to the Bronze. Whedon called the shot the "single greatest thing we ever did". Each of the singers in this song, which "marries soft rock to the function of a dirge", connects musically to earlier songs while foreshadowing Buffy's next number and the final chorus, providing an ominous anxiety.

Buffy's numbers are the most complex, changing key and tempo when she begins to reveal the secrets she swore she never would. This appears specifically in "Something to Sing About", which starts with uptempo platitudes: "We'll sing a happy song / And you can sing along: / Where there's life, there's hope / Every day's a gift / Wishes can come true / Whistle while you work ..." While singing, she kills Sweet's minions with a pool cue. Whedon attempted to make the song tuneful yet chaotic to express the main point of the episode. It transitions suddenly into her desire to be like normal girls, then changes again, slowing the tempo as she challenges Sweet not to give her a song, but "something to sing about". Musicologist Amy Bauer categorizes the tempo shifts as "rock ballad to punk polka to hymn" that indicates Buffy's turmoil. The key and tempo slow again, as Buffy finally reveals "I live in hell / 'Cause I've been expelled from heaven / I think I was in heaven" with the chord changing from B <a href="Minor%20chord">minor</a> to B <a href="Diminished%20triad">diminished</a>, each time she repeats "heaven". When replying to her, Spike has the same shift from minor to diminished each time he repeats the word "living."

The episode nears the end with "Where Do We Go from Here?", as the Scoobies stand dazed and disoriented, facing different directions. As they sing "Understand we'll go hand in hand / But we'll walk alone in fear", they line up, hold hands, then fling each other's hands away in a piece of what Whedon calls "literal choreography". Each of the eight characters in this line wears a color in the <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a>, a conscious decision by the costume designer. The couples in the group wear opposite colors (Giles in green and Buffy in red, Anya in blue and Xander in orange, Tara in yellow and Willow in purple), and Rhonda Wilcox interprets the color-coding and choreography to represent the "tension between the individual and the group". The characters as a chorus sing "The curtains close on a kiss, God knows / We can tell the end is near", moments before Buffy runs out to kiss Spike and the show closes with actual curtains. As Spike and Buffy kiss, a swell of music accompanies them, similar to the ending of "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>". Lyrics sung moments before, however, forecast the uncertainty of the relationship between Spike and Buffy, as well as their contrasting reasons for initiating any romance; Spike wants to feel love from Buffy, while she simply wants to feel.

When the episode was originally broadcast in the United States on <a href="UPN">UPN</a> on November 6, 2001, it received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 3.4 and a <a href="Share%20%28television%29">share</a> of 5. This placed the episode in sixth place in its timeslot, and 88th among broadcast television for the week of November 5–11, 2001. It was the most watched program on UPN that night, and the third most watched program that week, trailing episodes of "" and "<a href="WWE%20Smackdown">WWF SmackDown</a>". This was a decrease from the 3.7 rating received by the <a href="All%20the%20Way%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">previous episode</a> a week prior.

"Once More, with Feeling" received widespread critical acclaim from media and critics when it aired, during overseas syndication, and in reminiscences of the best episodes of "Buffy" after the series ended. Although <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> writer Stephanie Zacharek states "(t)he songs were only half-memorable at best, and the singing ability of the show's regular cast ranged only from the fairly good to the not so great", she also asserts that it works "beautifully", paces itself gracefully, and is "clever and affecting". Zacharek's unenthusiastic assessments of the music and cast's singing abilities were not shared by other writers. Debi Enker in Australia's "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" writes, "Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and Tara (Amber Benson) are terrific, Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg) struggle valiantly, and Willow (Alyson Hannigan) barely sings a note". Tony Johnston in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Herald%20Sun">The Sunday Herald Sun</a>" writes that Gellar "struggles on some of her higher notes, but her dance routines are superb, Michelle Trachtenberg's Dawn reveals sensual dance moves way beyond her tender years, and James Marsters' Spike evokes a sort of Billy Idol yell to disguise his lack of vocal proficiency [...] The rest of the cast mix and match like ready-made Broadway troupers." Johnston counts "I'll Never Tell" as one of the episode's "standout moments". Connie Ogle in "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>" calls the songs "better and far more clever than most of the ones you'll hear on Broadway these days".

Writers agree that the episode was risky and could have failed spectacularly. Jonathan Bernstein in the British newspaper "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" writes "What could have been, at best, an eccentric diversion and, at worst, a shuddering embarrassment, succeeded on every level [...] It provided a startling demonstration that creator Joss Whedon has a facility with lyrics and melody equal to the one he's demonstrated for the past six seasons with dialogue, character and plot twists. Rather than adopt the 'Hey, wouldn't it be wacky if we suddenly burst into song?' approach practised by "<a href="Ally%20McBeal">Ally McBeal</a>", the "Buffy" musical was entirely organic to the series' labyrinthine progression." Johnston in the "Sunday Herald Sun" says, "There is just so much to this marvellously cheeky episode that suggests the show can take any route it pleases and pull it off", while Debi Enker in "The Age" comments, "Whedon demonstrates yet again what "Buffy" aficionados have known and appreciated for years: that his wit, playfulness and readiness to take a risk make his television efforts rise way above the pack." Steve Murray in "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>" characterizes the episode as "scary in a brand-new way", saying "Once More, with Feeling" is "as impressive as Whedon's milestone episodes '<a href="Hush%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">Hush</a>' and '<a href="The%20Body%20%28Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%29">The Body</a>; the episode is "often hilarious", according to Murray, and acts as "(b)oth spoof and homage, [parodying] the hokiness of musicals while also capturing the guilty pleasure and surges of feeling the genre inspires".

Writing in the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>", Vinay Menon calls "Once More, with Feeling" "dazzling" and writes of "Joss Whedon's inimitable genius"; he goes on to say "(f)or a show that already violates conventions and morphs between genres, its allegorical narrative zigging and zagging seamlessly across chatty comedy, drama and over-the-top horror, 'Once More, with Feeling' is a towering achievement [...] The show may be anchored by existential weightiness, it may be painted with broad, supernatural brushstrokes, but in the end, this coming-of-age story, filled with angst and alienation, is more real than any other so-called teen drama [...] So let's add another line of gushing praise: 'Once More, with Feeling' is rhapsodic, original, deeply affecting, and ultimately, transcendental. Quite simply, television at its best."

The episode was nominated for an <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a> for Outstanding Musical Direction, but the <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Television%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences</a> (NATAS) neglected to include the title on the ballots for Emmy nominations in 2002. NATAS attempted to remedy this by mailing a postcard informing its voters that it should be included, but the episode did not win. NATAS' oversight, according to the "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>", was "another example of the lack of industry respect afforded one of television's most consistently clever shows". Ogle in "The Miami Herald" vigorously protests this omission, writing, "[T]he most astonishing, entertaining hour (hour plus, actually) of TV in the past year slips by virtually unnoticed. Nothing here is real; nothing here is right. "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"'s musical episode, 'Once More, with Feeling', registers a paltry outstanding music direction nomination. Nice for the musical directors. A stake through the aspirations of writer/director Joss Whedon, the beating creative heart of "Buffy", the only TV writer brave and clever enough to use horror as one great big wonderful metaphor for growing up [...] 'Once More, with Feeling' is TV of a different sort, something that comes along once in a lifetime and should not be buried but celebrated and rewarded." The episode was also nominated for a Best Dramatic Presentation <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> and a Best Script <a href="Nebula%20Award">Nebula Award</a>, both given for excellence in science fiction and fantasy writing. In 2009 "<a href="TV%20Guide">TV Guide</a>" ranked the episode #14 on its list of "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time". For its 65th anniversary, "TV Guide" picked it as the <a href="TV%20Guide%27s%2065%20Best%20Episodes%20of%20the%2021st%20Century">fifth best episode of the 21st century</a>.

An album including all 14 songs in the episode, with Christophe Beck's scores for three other "Buffy" episodes, was released by <a href="Rounder%20Records">Rounder Records</a> in September 2002 as season seven premiered. John Virant, president and chief executive of Rounder Records, told the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", "I remember watching the episode when it aired last October, and after it was over, I said to my wife, 'That's the best hour of TV I've ever seen. Someone should put that [soundtrack] out.' I inquired at Fox, just following up, and they said, 'Well, we tried, it didn't happen. If you want to take a run at it, feel free. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> gives the album five out of five stars, stating that the music is "every bit as fun as the episode itself", praising the voices of Benson, Marsters and Head. Reviewer Melinda Hill states it is "a must-have for "Buffy" fans, but it wouldn't be out of place in anyone's collection".

In addition to featuring on the sixth season box set, "Once More, with Feeling" was individually released on DVD in <a href="DVD%20region%20code%23Region%20codes%20and%20countries">Region 2</a> format on April 14, 2003, the only episode to be individually released. In Region 1, the episode was released on the sixth season box set on May 25, 2004, over a year later than the Region 2 release.

Since the musical episode of "Buffy" aired, several other series have worked musical format into episodes, including "<a href="Scrubs%20%28TV%20series%29">Scrubs</a>", ("<a href="My%20Musical">My Musical</a>") in 2007, an episode of "<a href="Grey%27s%20Anatomy">Grey's Anatomy</a>" entitled "<a href="Song%20Beneath%20the%20Song">Song Beneath the Song</a>" in 2011 and "", ("<a href="Mayhem%20of%20the%20Music%20Meister%21">Mayhem of the Music Meister!</a>") in 2009. The musical television episode was declared a genre, a gimmick, according to Mary Williams at Salon.com, for series that had run out of interesting story lines and characters. Both Williams and Margaret Lyons at "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine, however, declared "Once More, with Feeling" the "gold standard" for musical episodes. Despite this, Joss Whedon recognized the influence "Once More, with Feeling" has had on other shows, but denied that it was primarily responsible for the rise in musical television episodes or series such as "<a href="Glee%20%28TV%20series%29">Glee</a>", citing the popularity of "<a href="High%20School%20Musical">High School Musical</a>" instead.

"Buffy the Vampire Slayer" developed an enthusiastic fan following while it aired. Following its series finale, fans continued their appreciation in theater showings of "Once More, with Feeling" where attendees are encouraged to dress like the show's characters, sing along to the musical numbers, and otherwise interact in the style of "<a href="The%20Rocky%20Horror%20Picture%20Show">The Rocky Horror Picture Show</a>". Clinton McClung, a New York-based film programmer, got the idea for a <a href="sing-along">sing-along</a> from audience-participation showings of "<a href="The%20Sound%20of%20Music">The Sound of Music</a>" in 2003. The next year, he began putting on sing-alongs to "Once More, with Feeling" in Boston's Coolidge Corner Theater, which became so popular that it went on the road. Audience members received props to use during key scenes, as well as directions (for example, to yell "Shut up, Dawn!" at Buffy's younger sister), and a live cast performed the episode alongside the screen.

"Buffy" sing-alongs received growing media attention as they spread. At the 2007 <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Film%20Festival">Los Angeles Film Festival</a>, a special screening and sing-along was held that featured both Marti Noxon and Joss Whedon giving brief speeches to the audience. In October 2007, after a dispute with the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild">Screen Actors Guild</a> over unpaid <a href="Residual%20%28entertainment%20industry%29">residuals</a>, <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> pulled the licensing for public screenings of "Once More, with Feeling", effectively ending official "Buffy" sing-alongs. Whedon called the cancellation "hugely depressing" and attempted to influence the studio to allow future showings.
