Otto Graham

Otto Everett Graham Jr. (December 6, 1921 – December 17, 2003) was an <a href="American%20football">American football</a> <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> who played for the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> in the <a href="All-America%20Football%20Conference">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC) and <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> (NFL). Graham is regarded by critics as one of the most dominant players of his era, having taken the Browns to league championship games every year between 1946 and 1955, winning seven of them. With Graham at quarterback, the Browns posted a record of 114 wins, 20 losses, and four ties, including a 9–3 <a href="Winning%20percentage">win–loss record</a> in the <a href="National%20Football%20League%20playoffs">playoffs</a>. While most of Graham's statistical records have been surpassed in the modern era, he still holds the NFL record for career average <a href="Yards%20from%20scrimmage">yards gained</a> per <a href="Forward%20pass%23American%20and%20Canadian%20football">pass attempt</a>, with 8.98. He also holds the record for the <a href="Most%20wins%20by%20a%20starting%20quarterback%20%28NFL%29">highest career winning percentage</a> for an NFL starting quarterback, at 0.826. Long-time <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> owner <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a>, a friend of Graham's, once called him "as great of a quarterback as there ever was."

Graham grew up in <a href="Waukegan%2C%20Illinois">Waukegan, Illinois</a>, the son of music teachers. He entered <a href="Northwestern%20University">Northwestern University</a> in 1940 on a basketball scholarship, but football soon became his main sport. After a brief stint in the military at the end of World War II, Graham played for the <a href="Rochester%20Royals">Rochester Royals</a> of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20League%20%28United%20States%29">National Basketball League</a> (NBL), winning the <a href="1945%E2%80%9346%20Rochester%20Royals%20season">1945–46 championship</a>. <a href="Paul%20Brown">Paul Brown</a>, Cleveland's coach, signed Graham to play for the Browns, where he thrived. Graham's 1946 NBL and AAFC titles made him the first of only two people on to have won championships in two of the <a href="Major%20professional%20sports%20leagues%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada">four major North American sports</a> (the second was <a href="Gene%20Conley">Gene Conley</a>). After he retired from playing football in 1955, Graham coached college teams in the <a href="College%20All-Star%20Game">College All-Star Game</a> and became head football coach at the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%20Academy">Coast Guard Academy</a> in <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. After seven years at the academy, he spent three unsuccessful seasons as head coach of the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>. Following his resignation, he returned to the Coast Guard Academy, where he served as athletic director until his retirement in 1984. He was elected to the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1965.

Born in <a href="Waukegan%2C%20Illinois">Waukegan, Illinois</a>, Graham's first interest growing up was music. Encouraged by his parents, both of whom were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, <a href="cornet">cornet</a> and <a href="French%20horn">French horn</a>. Graham also excelled in athletics, and attended <a href="Northwestern%20University">Northwestern University</a> on a basketball scholarship in 1940. There he played on the <a href="Northwestern%20Wildcats%20men%27s%20basketball">varsity basketball team</a> as a <a href="freshman">freshman</a> and continued to study music. Graham did not take up football until his <a href="Sophomore%20year">sophomore</a> year, when Northwestern coach <a href="Pappy%20Waldorf">Pappy Waldorf</a> saw him throwing in an <a href="Intramural%20sports">intramural</a> game and invited him to practice with the team. Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to sign up. Although football became Graham's primary sport, he also played <a href="Northwestern%20Wildcats%20baseball">baseball</a> and continued on the basketball team. As a <a href="senior%20%28education%29">senior</a>, he was named a first-team basketball <a href="All-America">All-America</a>n, part of a squad selected by news outlets comprising the best players at each position.

Graham's first game for the <a href="Northwestern%20Wildcats%20football">Northwestern Wildcats football</a> team was on October 4, 1941, when he caught a <a href="Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football">Kansas State</a> <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29">punt</a> and <a href="Punt%20%28gridiron%20football%29%23Return">returned</a> it 90 yards for a <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>. He <a href="Rush%20%28gridiron%20football%29">ran</a> and passed for two more touchdowns in the 51–3 victory. After scoring another pair of touchdowns in a win against <a href="1941%20Wisconsin%20Badgers%20football%20team">Wisconsin</a>, Graham <a href="Forward%20pass">passed</a> to his <a href="wide%20receiver">wide receiver</a>s for two touchdowns in a victory over the <a href="1941%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team">Ohio State</a>, coached by <a href="Paul%20Brown">Paul Brown</a>, the team's only loss of the 1941 season. Northwestern ended the year with an 11th-place showing in the <a href="AP%20Poll">AP Poll</a> of the best college teams in the country.

As America's involvement in World War II intensified after the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a>, Graham signed up for service alongside many fellow student-athletes, entering the <a href="U.S.%20Coast%20Guard">U.S. Coast Guard</a>. He was able to stay at Northwestern as he waited to be called for active duty. The Wildcats struggled in 1942 as their players joined the war effort, winning only one game. Graham still had 89 completions, setting a single-season passing record in the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten Conference</a>, a division of major college teams from the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a>.

The following year Graham and some of his teammates enlisted in the military but continued to play for Northwestern. Enlistees from other schools also enrolled at Northwestern, where the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> had a training station. The 1943 season was a strong one for Northwestern. The team beat <a href="1943%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team">Ohio State</a>, the <a href="1942%20Ohio%20State%20Buckeyes%20football%20team">defending</a> <a href="College%20football%20national%20championships%20in%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS">national champions</a>, and a good military team at <a href="Naval%20Station%20Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes Naval Station</a>. The Wildcats lost to <a href="1943%20Notre%20Dame%20Fighting%20Irish%20football%20team">Notre Dame</a> and <a href="1943%20Michigan%20Wolverines%20football%20team">Michigan</a>, however, and finished the season with an 8–2 record and a ninth-place ranking in the AP Poll. Graham set another Big Ten passing record, was named the <a href="Chicago%20Tribune%20Silver%20Football">conference's Most Valuable Player</a>, received All-American honors and finished third in <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> voting. By the end of his college career, he held a Big Ten Conference record for passing yards with 2,132.

Graham's career at Northwestern officially ended in February 1944, when he moved to <a href="Colgate%20University">Colgate University</a> in <a href="Hamilton%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Hamilton, New York</a>, in the Navy's <a href="Aviation%20Cadet%20Training%20Program%20%28USN%29">V-5 cadet program</a>, a pilot training course. He played <a href="Colgate%20Raiders%20men%27s%20basketball">basketball for Colgate</a> before moving to North Carolina Pre-Flight later in 1944, where he played on the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Pre-Flight%20Cloudbusters%20football">Cloudbusters football team</a> under coaches <a href="Glenn%20Killinger">Glenn Killinger</a> and <a href="Bear%20Bryant">Bear Bryant</a>.

Impressed by Graham's performances in Northwestern's wins over the Ohio State in 1941 and 1943, Paul Brown came and offered him a contract worth $7,500 per year ($ in dollars) in 1945 to play for a professional team he was coaching in <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> in the new <a href="All-America%20Football%20Conference">All-America Football Conference</a> (AAFC). Graham would not receive his salary until he started playing, however, and Brown added a monthly <a href="stipend">stipend</a> of $250 ($ in ) until the end of the war. It was a large amount of money at the time. "All I asked was, where do I sign?" Graham said later. "Some of the other navy men said I was rooting for the war to last forever." Graham was also drafted by the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>'s <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a>, but he did not sign a contract or play a game with the team as the war wore on.

Large numbers of athletes came home as the conflict wound down in Europe following <a href="German%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">Germany's surrender</a> in mid-1945. The AAFC's first season was not set to start until the fall of 1946, and Graham occupied the intervening months by joining the <a href="Cincinnati%20Royals%23Rochester">Rochester Royals</a> of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20League%20%28United%20States%29">National Basketball League</a> (NBL), a forerunner of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a>. In March 1946, the Royals swept a best-of-five series against the <a href="Sheboygan%20Redskins">Sheboygan Redskins</a> to win the NBL title.

By the time Graham was discharged from the Navy late in the summer of 1946, <a href="Training%20camp%20%28National%20Football%20League%29">training camp</a> for Brown's new team, the <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a>, had already begun. Concerned that Graham was not ready to start, Brown put in <a href="Cliff%20Lewis%20%28quarterback%29">Cliff Lewis</a> at quarterback in the first game of the season. Graham, however, soon replaced Lewis in Brown's <a href="T%20formation">T formation</a> offense. Handing the ball to <a href="fullback%20%28American%20football%29">fullback</a> <a href="Marion%20Motley">Marion Motley</a> and throwing to <a href="Wide%20receiver">ends</a> <a href="Dante%20Lavelli">Dante Lavelli</a> and <a href="Mac%20Speedie">Mac Speedie</a>, Graham led the team to a 12–2 regular-season record and a spot in the championship game against the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees%20%28AAFC%29">AAFC's New York Yankees</a>. The Browns won that game, touching off a period of dominance. The team won each of the AAFC's four championships between 1946 and 1949, and had professional football's second perfect season in 1948 by finishing undefeated and untied.

Graham's play was crucial to Cleveland's success. He averaged 10.5 yards per pass and had a <a href="quarterback%20rating">quarterback rating</a> of 112.1 in 1946, a professional football record until <a href="Joe%20Montana">Joe Montana</a> surpassed it in 1989. Graham was named the AAFC's Most Valuable Player in 1947 and shared the Most Valuable Player award with <a href="Frankie%20Albert">Frankie Albert</a> of the <a href="San%20Francisco%2049ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> in 1948. He led the league in passing yards between 1947 and 1949. The AAFC dissolved after the 1949 season, and three of its teams, including the Browns, merged into the more established <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>. Graham was the AAFC's all-time leading passer, throwing for 10,085 yards and 86 touchdowns.

Graham became the Browns' uncontested leader, but he was also "just one of the guys", tackle <a href="Mike%20McCormack%20%28American%20football%29">Mike McCormack</a> said in 1999. "He was not aloof, which you see a lot of times today." He was good at spinning and moving in the <a href="Passing%20pocket">pocket</a>, skills he learned playing basketball. In his autobiography, Paul Brown praised Graham's ability to anticipate his receivers' route-running by watching their shoulders. "I remember his tremendous peripheral vision and his great athletic skill, as well as his ability to throw a football far and accurately with just a flick of his arm", Brown said. His short passes were hard and accurate, teammates later said, and his long balls were soft. "I used to catch a lot of them one-handed", Lavelli said. "He had great touch in his hands." He was nicknamed "Automatic Otto" for his consistency and toughness.

With Graham at the helm, the Browns continued to succeed when they joined the NFL in 1950. Graham led the Browns to a 10–2 record, which set up a playoff against the <a href="New%20York%20Giants">New York Giants</a> for a spot in the <a href="1950%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">championship game</a>. The Browns' only two losses of the season had come against the Giants, but in a frozen <a href="Cleveland%20Stadium">Cleveland Stadium</a> on Cleveland beat New York. With the game tied 3–3 in the fourth quarter, Graham gained 45 yards by running with the ball on a long drive to set up a 28-yard <a href="Lou%20Groza">Lou Groza</a> field goal that put the Browns ahead 6–3. A <a href="Safety%20%28American%20and%20Canadian%20football%20score%29">safety</a> after the ensuing kickoff made the final score 8–3.

The win put Cleveland in the NFL championship game against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a>. Graham's rushing and passing were again key to the Browns' 30–28 victory. He drove the offense downfield as time expired to set up a last-minute Groza field goal that sealed the win. Graham had 99 yards rushing in the game, adding 298 yards of passing and four touchdowns.

Cleveland posted an 11–1 record in 1951, losing their only game to the San Francisco 49ers in the season opener. That gave the Browns another spot in the <a href="1951%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">championship game</a>, again against the Rams. This time, however, the Rams won 24–17. Graham fumbled the ball in the third quarter, setting up a touchdown that put the Rams ahead 14–10. Three of his throws were <a href="Interception">intercepted</a>, but he put up 280 yards of passing and a touchdown. After the season, Graham was named the league's Most Valuable Player.
With Graham at quarterback, Cleveland finished the 1952 season with a 9–3 record and faced the <a href="Detroit%20Lions">Detroit Lions</a> in the <a href="1952%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">NFL championship game</a>. Despite gaining 384 total yards to Detroit's 258, Graham and the Browns lost their second straight championship, 17–7. Cleveland had several long drives that ended with missed field goals, and a fourth-quarter touchdown was negated because Graham's throw to <a href="Pete%20Brewster">Pete Brewster</a> was first tipped by receiver <a href="Ray%20Renfro">Ray Renfro</a>; under rules in place at the time, balls deflected by offensive teammates were automatic incompletions. After the season, as Graham was practicing for the <a href="Pro%20Bowl">Pro Bowl</a> in Los Angeles on his six-week-old son Stephen died from a severe cold.

The 1953 season began with a 27–0 win over the <a href="Green%20Bay%20Packers">Green Bay Packers</a> in which Graham passed for 292 yards and ran for two touchdowns. It was the first of 11 straight victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a>. Near the end of the season in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from <a href="Art%20Michalik">Art Michalik</a> that opened a gash on his chin requiring 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic face mask, and he came back into the game; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask. Despite an 11–1 record, Cleveland lost in the <a href="1953%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">championship game</a> for the third year in a row, falling to the Detroit Lions 17–16. Two of Graham's passes were intercepted. He said after the game that he wanted to "jump off a building" for letting his teammates down. "I was the main factor in losing", he said. "If I had played my usual game, we would have won." Still, Graham finished the season as the NFL's leading passer and again won the Most Valuable Player award.

Before the start of the Browns' 1954 training camp, Graham was questioned as part of the <a href="Sam%20Sheppard">Sam Sheppard</a> murder case. Sheppard, an <a href="osteopath">osteopath</a>, was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death, and Graham and his wife, Beverly, were friends with the couple. Graham told police that while he and Beverly liked the Sheppards, they did not know much about their relationship.

The 1954 season was a transitional one for the Browns. Many of the players who joined the 1946 team had retired or were nearing the end of their careers. Graham, meanwhile, told Brown that he would retire after the season. After losing the first three games, Cleveland won eight in a row and earned another shot at the <a href="1954%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">championship</a>, again against the Lions. This time, the Browns won 56–10 as Graham ran for three touchdowns and passed for three more. He announced his retirement after the game.

After Graham's potential replacements struggled during the 1955 training camp and preseason, Brown convinced Graham to come back and play one more year. He was offered a salary of $25,000 ($ today), making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The Browns lost the opener against the <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>, but went on to a 9–2–1 regular-season record and another chance at a <a href="1955%20NFL%20Championship%20Game">championship</a>. Graham threw two touchdowns and ran for two more as the Browns beat the Rams 38–14. When Brown took Graham out of the game in the fourth quarter, the crowd in the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Coliseum">Los Angeles Coliseum</a> gave him a standing ovation. It was the final performance of a 10-year career in which Graham's team reached the championship each year and won seven. "Nothing would induce me to come back", he said later. He was the NFL's passing leader and Most Valuable Player in 1955. He also won the <a href="Hickok%20Belt">Hickok Belt</a>, awarded to the best professional athlete of the year. Without Graham, the Browns floundered the following year and posted a 5–7 record, their first-ever losing season.

The Browns' record with Graham as starting quarterback was 114–20–4, including a 9–3 record in the playoffs. He still holds the NFL career record for yards per pass attempt, averaging nine. He also holds the record for the <a href="Most%20wins%20by%20a%20starting%20quarterback%20%28NFL%29">highest career winning percentage</a> for an NFL starting quarterback, with 0.814. Graham was inducted into the <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> in 1965. Having won seven championships in 10 seasons and reached the championship game in every year he played, Graham is regarded by sportswriters as one of the greatest winners of all time and one of the best professional quarterbacks ever to play the game. He never missed a game in his career.

Graham wore number 60 for much of his career, but he was forced to change it to 14 in 1952 after the NFL passed a rule requiring <a href="offensive%20line">offensive line</a>men to wear jersey numbers 50–79 so referees could more easily identify <a href="eligible%20receiver">ineligible receivers</a>. The Browns retired his number 14, while 60 remains in circulation. While at Northwestern, Graham wore number 48.

When Graham retired from football, he planned to focus on managing the insurance and appliance businesses he owned. In 1957, however, Graham signed on as an assistant coach for the college squad in the annual <a href="College%20All-Star%20Game">College All-Star Game</a>, a now-defunct exhibition contest between the NFL champion and a selection of the best collegiate players from around the country. The next year, he was named head coach of the team. With Graham coaching the all-stars in 1958, the team beat the Detroit Lions 35–19.

Following his convincing win in the all-star game, Graham's friend <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a> helped get him a job as the head football coach for the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard%20Academy">Coast Guard Academy</a> in <a href="New%20London%2C%20Connecticut">New London, Connecticut</a>. Graham, by then 37 years old, was also named athletic director and given a salary "in five figures". School officials said the hiring did not mean Coast Guard would "go big time"; the <a href="NCAA%20Division%20III">Division III</a> school played a relatively short schedule at the time against smaller schools in New England. The Coast Guard team had a 3–5 record in Graham's first year as coach in 1959, but improved steadily over the ensuing three years. The team went undefeated in 1963, earning the academy its first-ever post-season bowl appearance. Coast Guard lost to <a href="WKU%20Hilltoppers%20football">Western Kentucky</a> 27–0 in the <a href="Tangerine%20Bowl%20%281947%E2%80%9382%29">Tangerine Bowl</a>. Graham continued to coach in the College All-Star Game while at Coast Guard, and his college team beat <a href="Vince%20Lombardi">Vince Lombardi</a>'s Green Bay Packers in a 20–17 upset in 1963. Graham was offered coaching jobs in the NFL numerous times during his tenure at Coast Guard, but he said in 1964 that he was content to stay at the small school on a $9,000 salary. He said he deplored the "win at all costs philosophy" that was necessary to be successful in the professional ranks.

Despite his reservations about the professional game, Graham, who moonlighted as a television and radio commentator for the <a href="American%20Football%20League">American Football League</a>'s <a href="New%20York%20Jets">New York Jets</a> in 1964 and 1965, left Coast Guard after seven years in 1966 to become head coach of the NFL's <a href="Washington%20Redskins">Washington Redskins</a>. Graham's tenure as the Redskins' coach between 1966 and 1968 was unsuccessful; the team's record during that span was 17–22–3. In his last season as the coach of the Redskins, calls for his firing had intensified as the team's performance worsened from a 7–7 record to a 5–9 record in his third year. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Daily%20News">The Washington Daily News</a>" called for his firing in a front-page editorial in November 1968. Lombardi took over as the Redskins' coach in 1969.

After being dismissed as the Redskins' coach, Graham returned to the Coast Guard Academy as <a href="athletic%20director">athletic director</a> and said he planned to stay there until he retired. He coached the college team in the College All-Star Game in 1970 for his tenth and final time. The college stars lost for the seventh time in a row that year, falling 24–3 to the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</a>. He was replaced in 1971 by <a href="Blanton%20Collier">Blanton Collier</a>, who had retired after succeeding Brown as Cleveland's head coach.

In 1974, Graham was named Coast Guard's football coach once again, although he resigned two years later to focus on his duties as athletic director. In nine years of coaching, Graham's Coast Guard teams had a combined record of 44–32–1. After eight more years as the school's athletic director, Graham retired in 1984.

An avid golfer and tennis player, Graham partnered with <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> great <a href="Joe%20DiMaggio">Joe DiMaggio</a> in numerous golf tournaments later in life. He retired to a house on a golf course in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Graham overcame <a href="colon%20cancer">colon cancer</a> in 1977, but was later plagued by heart ailments and other health problems. He was diagnosed as being in the early stages of <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> in 2001, and died of a heart <a href="aneurysm">aneurysm</a> in <a href="Sarasota%2C%20Florida">Sarasota, Florida</a>, on December 17, 2003. He had two sons and a daughter with his wife Beverly. In 2013, Northwestern's fundraising department created The Otto Graham Society to honor his achievements at the school and support its athletics programs. In 2014, a new gymnasium at <a href="Waterford%20Country%20School">Waterford Country School</a> was dedicated to Otto Graham's memory.

Elias Ashmole

Elias Ashmole (; 23 May 1617 – 18 May 1692) was an English <a href="antiquarian">antiquary</a>, politician, <a href="officer%20of%20arms">officer of arms</a>, <a href="astrology">astrologer</a> and student of <a href="alchemy">alchemy</a>. Ashmole supported the <a href="Cavalier">royalist</a> side during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, and at the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">restoration</a> of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> he was rewarded with several lucrative offices.

Ashmole was an antiquary with a strong <a href="Baconian%20method">Baconian</a> leaning towards the study of nature. His library reflected his intellectual outlook, including works on English history, law, <a href="numismatics">numismatics</a>, <a href="chorography">chorography</a>, alchemy, astrology, astronomy, and botany. Although he was one of the founding <a href="Fellow">Fellow</a>s of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>, a key institution in the development of experimental science, his interests were antiquarian and mystical as well as scientific. He was an early <a href="Freemasonry">freemason</a>, although the extent of his involvement and commitment is unclear. Throughout his life he was an avid collector of curiosities and other artefacts. Many of these he acquired from the traveller, botanist, and collector <a href="John%20Tradescant%20the%20Younger">John Tradescant the Younger</a>. Ashmole donated most of his collection, his antiquarian library and priceless <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>s to the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> to create the <a href="Ashmolean%20Museum">Ashmolean Museum</a>.

Ashmole was born on 23 May 1617 in Breadmarket Street, <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>, <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a>. His family had been prominent, but its fortunes had declined by the time of Ashmole's birth. His mother, Anne, was the daughter of a wealthy <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a> draper, Anthony Bowyer, and a relative of James Paget, a <a href="Exchequer%20of%20pleas">Baron of the Exchequer</a>. His father, Simon Ashmole (1589–1634), was a <a href="saddle">saddle</a>r, who had served as a soldier in Ireland and Europe. Elias Ashmole attended <a href="Lichfield%20Grammar%20School">Lichfield Grammar School</a> (now <a href="King%20Edward%20VI%20School%20%28Lichfield%29">King Edward VI School</a>) and became a <a href="chorister">chorister</a> at <a href="Lichfield%20Cathedral">Lichfield Cathedral</a>. In 1633, he went to live in London as mentor to Paget's sons, and in 1638, with James Paget's help, he qualified as a <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a>. He enjoyed a successful legal practice in London, and married Eleanor Mainwaring (1603–1641), a member of a "déclassé" Cheshire <a href="Aristocracy%20%28class%29">aristocratic</a> family, who died, while pregnant, only three years later on 6 December 1641. Still in his early twenties, Ashmole had taken the first steps towards status and wealth. He also became allied with <a href="Charles%20Worsley">Major-General Charles Worsley</a> (who died 12 June 1656 and was buried at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>), brother-in-law of his sister, Mary Ashmole, who married John <a href="Booth%20baronets">Booth</a>, of <a href="Hundred%20of%20Salford">Salford</a>.

Ashmole supported the side of <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">Charles I</a> in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. At the outbreak of fighting in 1642, he left London for the house of his father-in-law, Peter Mainwaring of <a href="Smallwood%2C%20Cheshire">Smallwood</a>, Cheshire. There he lived a retired life until 1644, when he was appointed <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Customs%20and%20Excise">King's Commissioner of Excise</a> at Lichfield. Soon afterwards, at the suggestion of <a href="Sir%20George%20Wharton%2C%201st%20Baronet">George Wharton</a>, a leading astrologer with strong court connections, Ashmole was given a military post at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, where he served as an ordnance officer for the King's forces. In his spare time, he studied mathematics and physics at his lodgings, <a href="Brasenose%20College">Brasenose College</a>. There he acquired a deep interest in astronomy, astrology, and magic. In late 1645, he left Oxford to accept the position of Commissioner of Excise at <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>. Ashmole was given the additional military post of <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a> in <a href="Jacob%20Astley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Astley%20of%20Reading">Lord Astley's</a> <a href="Regiment%20of%20Foot">Regiment of Foot</a>, part of the Royalist Infantry, though as a mathematician, he was seconded to artillery positions. He seems never to have participated in any actual fighting.

After the surrender of Worcester to the Parliamentary Forces in July 1646, he retired to Cheshire. Passing through Lichfield on his way there, he learnt that his mother had died just three weeks before from the plague. During this period, he was admitted as a <a href="Freemasonry">freemason</a>. His diary entry for 16 October 1646 reads in part: "I was made a Free Mason at Warrington in Lancashire, with Coll: Henry Mainwaring of Karincham [Kermincham] in Cheshire." Although there is only one other mention of masonic activity in his diary he seems to have remained in good standing and well-connected with the fraternity as he was still attending meetings in 1682. On 10 March that year he wrote: "About 5 H: P.M. I received a Sumons to appeare at a Lodge to held the next day, at Masons Hall London." The following day, 11 March 1682, he wrote: "Accordingly, I went ... I was the Senior Fellow among them (it being 35 yeares since I was admitted) ... We all dyned at the halfe Moone Taverne in <a href="Cheapside">Cheapeside</a>, at a Noble Dinner prepaired at the charge of the New-accepted Masons." Ashmole's notes are one of the earliest references to Freemasonry known in England, but apart from these entries in his autobiographical notes, there are no further details about Ashmole's involvement.

In 1646–47, Ashmole made several simultaneous approaches to rich widows in the hope of securing a good marriage. In 1649, he married Mary, Lady Mainwaring (daughter of Sir William Forster of <a href="Aldermaston">Aldermaston</a>), a wealthy thrice-widowed woman twenty years his senior; she may have been a relative by marriage of his first wife's family and was the mother of grown children. The marriage took place despite the opposition of the bride's family, and it did not prove to be harmonious: Lady Mainwaring filed suit for separation and <a href="alimony">alimony</a> but it was dismissed by the courts in 1657. Nevertheless, the marriage provided Ashmole with Mary's first husband's estates centred on <a href="Bradfield%2C%20Berkshire">Bradfield</a> in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a> which left him wealthy enough to pursue his interests, including botany and alchemy, without concern for having to earn a living. He arranged for his friend Wharton to be released from prison and appointed him to manage the estates.

During the 1650s, Ashmole devoted a great deal of energy to the study of alchemy. In 1650, he published "<a href="Fasciculus%20Chemicus">Fasciculus Chemicus</a>" under the <a href="anagram">anagram</a>matic pseudonym "James Hasolle". This work was an English translation of two <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a> alchemical works, one by <a href="Arthur%20Dee">Arthur Dee</a>, the son of <a href="John%20Dee%20%28mathematician%29">John Dee</a>. In 1652, he published his most important alchemical work, "<a href="Theatrum%20Chemicum%20Britannicum">Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum</a>", an extensively annotated compilation of metaphysical poems in English. The book preserved and made available many works that had previously existed only in privately held manuscripts. A corrected edition using Ashmole's two errata sheets and the additional chapter seven of a piece by Thomas Charnock was published in 2011. There is little evidence that Ashmole conducted his own alchemical experiments. He appears to have been a collector of alchemical writings and a student of alchemy rather than an active practitioner. He referred to himself as the son of <a href="William%20Backhouse">William Backhouse</a>, who adopted him in 1651 as his spiritual son - for the connection he gave him to the long spiritual chain of hermetic wisdom that Backhouse was part of. According to Ashmole, Backhouse "intytle[d] me to some small parte Of grand sire <a href="Hermes%20Trismegistus">Hermes</a> wealth [sic]". His final alchemical publication was "<a href="The%20Way%20to%20Bliss">The Way to Bliss</a>" in 1658, but thereafter his interest seems to wane in favour of his other pursuits. Ashmole promoted the use of therapeutic remedies drawing on both <a href="Galen">Galen</a>ic and <a href="Paracelsianism">Paracelsian</a> principles, and his works attempt to merge the two schools. "The Way to Bliss" recommends ways to prevent illness: a balanced diet, moderate exercise and enough sleep. His works were avidly studied by other natural philosophers, such as <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>.

Ashmole met the <a href="botanist">botanist</a> and collector <a href="John%20Tradescant%20the%20younger">John Tradescant the younger</a> around 1650. Tradescant had, with <a href="John%20Tradescant%20the%20elder">his father</a>, built up a vast and renowned collection of exotic plants, mineral specimens and other curiosities from around the world at their house in <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a>. Ashmole helped Tradescant catalogue his collection in 1652, and, in 1656, he financed the publication of the catalogue, the "<a href="Musaeum%20Tradescantianum">Musaeum Tradescantianum</a>". In 1659, Tradescant, who had lost his only son seven years earlier, legally deeded his collection to Ashmole. Under the agreement, Ashmole would take possession at Tradescant's death. When Tradescant died in 1662, his widow, Hester, contested the deed, claiming her husband had signed it when drunk without knowing its contents, but the matter was settled in <a href="Court%20of%20Chancery">Chancery</a> in Ashmole's favour two years later. Hester was to hold the collection in trust for Ashmole until her death. Ashmole's determined aggressiveness in obtaining the Tradescant collection for himself has led some scholars to consider that Ashmole was an ambitious, ingratiating social climber who stole a hero's legacy for his own glorification.

Ashmole embarked on further catalogues, including one of the Roman coin collection of the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a>, which he finally completed in 1666 after eight years of work. It may have taken so long because Ashmole's progress was interrupted by the <a href="English%20Restoration">Restoration</a> of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> in 1660, when Ashmole's loyalty was richly rewarded with political offices. He was appointed Secretary and Clerk of the Courts of <a href="Surinam">Surinam</a> and <a href="Comptroller%20of%20the%20Household">Comptroller of the White Office</a>. While these two titles do not seem to have provided either an income or any specific duties, he also became <a href="Commissioner">Commissioner</a> and then <a href="Comptroller">Comptroller</a> for the Excise in London, and later was made the <a href="HM%20Revenue%20and%20Customs">Accountant-General of the Excise</a>, a position that made him responsible for a large portion of the King's revenue. These latter posts yielded him considerable income as well as considerable power of <a href="patronage">patronage</a>.

The King commissioned Ashmole to prepare a catalogue of the coins and medals held in the <a href="Royal%20Collection">Royal Collection</a>, and appointed him to lead a commission responsible for tracing items from the collection which had been dispersed or sold by the parliamentary regime. Ashmole also appears to have been involved in the organisation of the <a href="coronation">coronation</a>, or at least set himself up as an expert upon it.

Ashmole became one of the founding Fellows of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> in 1661, but he was not very active in the society. His most significant appointment was to the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> as <a href="Windsor%20Herald">Windsor Herald of Arms in Ordinary</a> in June 1660. In this position he devoted himself to the study of the history of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>, which had been a special interest of his since the 1650s, and he proposed a design for the Royal Society's <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>.

By 1665, he was collecting information for his <a href="English%20county%20histories">county history</a>, "The Antiquities of Berkshire"; and in 1672 he published "The Institution, Laws and Ceremonies of the Most Noble Order of the Garter", a lavish <a href="Book%20size">folio</a> with illustrations by <a href="Wenceslaus%20Hollar">Wenceslaus Hollar</a>, for which he had conducted years of research. An earlier attempt to promote himself as the official historiographer of the order had failed but this work firmly established Ashmole as an expert. He had written a large part of it in 1665 while living in the country to escape the Great Plague which was then raging in London. Presentation copies sent to the foreign members of the order were reciprocated by gifts of gold insignia from the <a href="Christian%20V%20of%20Denmark">King of Denmark</a>, the <a href="Frederick%20William%2C%20Elector%20of%20Brandenburg">Elector of Brandenburg</a> and the <a href="Charles%20I%20Louis%2C%20Elector%20Palatine">Elector Palatine</a>. Ashmole performed the <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> and <a href="genealogy">genealogical</a> work of his office scrupulously, and he was considered a leading authority on court protocol and <a href="ceremony">ceremony</a>.

On 1 April 1668, Lady Mainwaring died, and on 3 November the same year Ashmole married Elizabeth Dugdale (1632–1701), the much younger daughter of his friend and fellow <a href="herald">herald</a>, the antiquarian Sir <a href="William%20Dugdale">William Dugdale</a>. All of Elizabeth's pregnancies ended in stillbirths or miscarriages, and Ashmole remained childless. In 1675, he resigned as Windsor Herald, perhaps because of factional strife within the College of Arms. He was offered the post of <a href="Garter%20Principal%20King%20of%20Arms">Garter Principal King of Arms</a>, which traditionally came with a knighthood, but he turned it down in favour of Dugdale.

Ashmole possessed his own <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>, to which he proved his entitlement by descent from <a href="armigerous">armigerous</a> ancestors, expressed in <a href="blazon">heraldic terminology</a> as "Quarterly, Gules and Or a Fleur de lis Argent in the first quarter" with "a Greyhound courant" for the <a href="crest%20%28heraldry%29">crest</a>. After the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a>, Ashmole was granted a new crest in place of the <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>, one which reflected his interest in astrology: "On a wreath Sable and Or the Planet Mercury collocated in the middle of the <a href="Astronomical%20object">caelestiall Signe Gemini</a> Proper his right hand extended toward Heaven and left holding a <a href="Caduceus">caducan Rod</a> Or". The new grant also altered the tinctures of his arms to "Quarterly Sable and Or a Fleur de lis in the first quarter".

The Restoration led to the re-establishment of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, and Ashmole presented new <a href="prayer%20book">prayer book</a>s to <a href="Lichfield%20Cathedral">Lichfield Cathedral</a>. In 1684, Dugdale wrote to his son-in-law that "the vulgar sort of people" were not "yet weaned from the presbyterian practises, which was long prayers of their own devising, and senseless sermons". Like many royalists, Ashmole's circle was contemptuous of non-conformity. Though Ashmole was "one of the earliest <a href="Freemasons">Freemasons</a>, [and] appears from his writings to have been a zealous <a href="Rosicrucian">Rosicrucian</a>", <a href="John%20Gadbury">John Gadbury</a> wrote that "<a href="Anthony%20Wood%20%28antiquary%29">Anthony Wood</a> hath falsely called him a Rosicrucian, Whereas no man was further from fostring such follies." Ashmole's involvement with Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism may have been social or the interest of an antiquarian, rather than born out of any religious fervour. However, the notion of a repository of universal knowledge is described in Rosicrucian writings and this idea may have partly inspired Ashmole's desire to found a great museum.

In 1669, Ashmole received a Doctorate in Medicine from the University of Oxford. He maintained his links with the University and, in 1677, Ashmole made a gift of the Tradescant Collection, together with material he had collected independently, to the University on the condition that a suitable home be built to house the materials and make them available to the public. Ashmole had already moved into the house adjacent to the Tradescants' property in 1674 and had already removed some items from their house into his. In 1678, in the midst of further legal wrangling over the Tradescant Collection, Hester was found drowned in a garden pond. By early 1679, Ashmole had taken over the lease of the Tradescant property and began merging his and their collections into one. The Ashmolean Museum was completed in 1683, and is considered by some to be the first truly public museum in Europe. According to <a href="Anthony%20Wood%20%28antiquary%29">Anthony Wood</a>, the collection filled twelve wagons when it was transferred to Oxford. It would have been more, but a large part of Ashmole's own collection, destined for the museum, including antiquities, books, manuscripts, prints, and 9,000 coins and medals, was destroyed in a disastrous fire in the <a href="Middle%20Temple">Middle Temple</a> on 26 January 1679. As a result of the fire, the proportion of the collection derived from the Tradescants was larger than originally anticipated and in the opinion of <a href="Michael%20Hunter%20%28historian%29">Professor Michael Hunter</a> this misfortune has contributed to criticisms that Ashmole took an unfair share of the credit in assembling the collection at the expense of the Tradescants.

In 1678, Ashmole stood as a candidate in a by-election for the <a href="Lichfield%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Lichfield borough parliamentary constituency</a> caused by the death of one of the two incumbent members. During Ashmole's campaign his cousin, Thomas Smalridge, who was acting as a kind of campaign manager, fell ill and died. Ashmole did not visit the constituency, and, as Ashmole's own horoscope had predicted, he lost the election. He also put himself forward as a candidate in the general election of 1685. Surviving documents indicate that he was the most popular candidate, but after <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">King James II</a> requested he stand down (in an age when monarchs were likely to interfere with parliamentary elections), Ashmole did so. On election day, all the votes cast for Ashmole, instead of being declared invalid, were declared as votes for the King's candidate, and only as a result of this ruse was the candidate favoured by the Court (<a href="Richard%20Leveson%20%28died%201699%29">Richard Leveson</a>) elected.

Ashmole's health began to deteriorate during the 1680s. He continued to hold his excise office throughout the reign of James II and after the <a href="Glorious%20Revolution">Glorious Revolution</a> until his death but became much less active in affairs. His home cures included hanging three spiders around his neck which "drove my Ague away". He began to collect notes on his life in diary form to serve as source material for a biography; although the biography was never written, these notes are a rich source of information on Ashmole and his times. He died at his house in <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a> on 18 May 1692, and was buried at <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Lambeth">St. Mary's Church, Lambeth</a> on 26 May. Ashmole bequeathed the remainder of his collection and library to Oxford for the Ashmolean Museum. Two-thirds of his library now resides in the <a href="Bodleian">Bodleian</a> at <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>; its separation from the museum collection in the Victorian era contributed to the belief that Ashmole designed the museum around the Tradescant collection, rather than his own. Ashmole's widow, Elizabeth, married a stonemason, John Reynolds, on 15 March 1694. They had no children and on her death seven years later the house and lands in Lambeth passed into Reynolds's hands.

Vittoria Feola, in her recent monograph, Elias Ashmole and the Uses of Antiquity (Paris, 2013) has described Ashmole as an antiquary first and foremost, who understood the value of the New Science, which he promoted through his Museum. Feola, however, has warned that antiquity was Ashmole's greatest passion, as well as his main tool for self-fashioning. Michael Hunter, in his entry on Ashmole for the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", concluded that the most salient points of Ashmole's character were his ambition and his hierarchical vision of the world—a vision that unified his <a href="monarchism">royalism</a> and his interests in heraldry, genealogy, ceremony, and even astrology and magic. He was as successful in his legal, business and political affairs as he was in his collecting and scholarly pursuits. His antiquarian work is still considered valuable, and his alchemical publications, especially the "<a href="Theatrum%20Chemicum%20Britannicum">Theatrum Chemicum Britannicum</a>" (1652), preserved many works that might otherwise have been lost. He formed several close and long-lasting friendships, with the astrologer <a href="William%20Lilly">William Lilly</a> for example, but, as <a href="Richard%20Garnett%20%28writer%29">Richard Garnett</a> observed, "acquisitiveness was his master passion".

Boshin War

The , sometimes known as the Japanese Revolution, was a <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a> in Japan, fought from 1868 to 1869 between forces of the ruling <a href="Tokugawa%20shogunate">Tokugawa shogunate</a> and those seeking to return political power to the <a href="Imperial%20Court%20in%20Kyoto">Imperial Court</a>.

The war found its origins in dissatisfaction among many <a href="Kazoku">nobles</a> and young <a href="samurai">samurai</a> with the shogunate's handling of foreigners following the <a href="opening%20of%20Japan">opening of Japan</a> during the prior decade. Increasing <a href="Unequal%20treaties">Western influence in the economy</a> led to a decline similar to other Asian countries at the time. An alliance of western samurai, particularly the domains of <a href="Ch%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB%20Domain">Chōshū</a>, <a href="Satsuma%20Domain">Satsuma</a> and <a href="Tosa%20Domain">Tosa</a>, and court officials, secured control of the Imperial Court and influenced the young <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a>. <a href="Tokugawa%20Yoshinobu">Tokugawa Yoshinobu</a>, the sitting shōgun, realizing the futility of his situation, abdicated political power to the emperor. Yoshinobu had hoped that by doing this, the Tokugawa house could be preserved and participate in the future government.

However, military movements by imperial forces, partisan violence in <a href="Edo">Edo</a>, and an imperial decree promoted by Satsuma and Chōshū abolishing the house of Tokugawa led Yoshinobu to launch a military campaign to seize the emperor's court in <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>. The military tide rapidly turned in favor of the smaller but relatively modernized imperial faction, and after a series of battles culminating in the surrender of Edo, Yoshinobu personally surrendered. Those loyal to the Tokugawa retreated to northern <a href="Honsh%C5%AB">Honshū</a> and later to <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a>, where they founded the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ezo">Ezo republic</a>. Defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hakodate">Battle of Hakodate</a> broke this last holdout and left the imperial rule supreme throughout the whole of Japan, completing the military phase of the <a href="Meiji%20Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a>.

Around 120,000 men were mobilized during the conflict, and of these about 3,500 were killed. In the end, the victorious imperial faction abandoned its objective to expel foreigners from Japan and instead adopted a policy of continued modernization with an eye to eventual renegotiation of the unequal treaties with the Western powers. Due to the persistence of <a href="Saig%C5%8D%20Takamori">Saigō Takamori</a>, a prominent leader of the imperial faction, the Tokugawa loyalists were shown <a href="clemency">clemency</a>, and many former shogunate leaders and samurai were later given positions of responsibility under the new government.

When the Boshin War began, Japan was already modernizing, following the same course of advancement as that of the industrialized Western nations. Since Western nations, especially the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a> and <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">France</a>, were deeply involved in the country's politics, the installation of Imperial power added more turbulence to the conflict. Over time, the war has been romanticized as a "bloodless revolution", because of the small number of casualties.

For the two centuries prior to 1854, Japan had severely <a href="sakoku">limited exchange with foreign nations</a>, with the notable exceptions of <a href="Korea">Korea</a> via <a href="Tsushima%20Island">Tsushima</a>, <a href="Qing%20China">Qing China</a> via the <a href="Ry%C5%ABky%C5%AB%20islands">Ryūkyūs</a>, and the <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Dutch</a> through the trading post of <a href="Dejima">Dejima</a>. In 1854, <a href="Matthew%20Perry%20%28naval%20officer%29">Commodore Perry</a> opened Japan to global commerce with the implied threat of force, thus initiating a period of rapid development in foreign trade and Westernization. In large part due to the humiliating terms of the <a href="unequal%20treaties">unequal treaties</a>, as agreements like those conveyed by Perry are called, the <a href="Tokugawa%20shogunate">shogunate</a> soon faced internal hostility, which materialized into a radical movement, the "<a href="sonn%C5%8D%20j%C5%8Di">sonnō jōi</a>" ("revere the Emperor, expel the barbarians").

<a href="Emperor%20K%C5%8Dmei">Emperor Kōmei</a> agreed with such sentiments, and—breaking with centuries of imperial tradition—began to take an active role in matters of state: as opportunities arose, he fulminated against the treaties and attempted to interfere in the shogunal succession. His efforts culminated in March 1863 with his "<a href="Order%20to%20expel%20barbarians">Order to expel barbarians</a>". Although the shogunate had no intention of enforcing it, the order nevertheless inspired attacks against the shogunate itself and against foreigners in Japan: the most famous incident was that of the English trader <a href="Charles%20Lennox%20Richardson">Charles Lennox Richardson</a>, for whose death the Tokugawa government had to pay an indemnity of one hundred thousand <a href="Pound%20sterling">British pound</a>s. Other attacks included the shelling of foreign shipping in <a href="Shimonoseki">Shimonoseki</a>.

During 1864, these actions were successfully countered by armed retaliations by foreign powers, such as the British <a href="bombardment%20of%20Kagoshima">bombardment of Kagoshima</a> and the multinational <a href="Shimonoseki%20Campaign">Shimonoseki Campaign</a>. At the same time, the forces of <a href="Ch%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB%20Domain">Chōshū</a>, together with "<a href="r%C5%8Dnin">rōnin</a>", raised the <a href="Kinmon%20incident">Hamaguri rebellion</a> trying to seize the city of Kyoto, where the Emperor's court was held, but were repelled by shogunate forces under the future "<a href="sh%C5%8Dgun">shōgun</a>" <a href="Tokugawa%20Yoshinobu">Tokugawa Yoshinobu</a>. The shogunate further ordered a <a href="punitive%20expedition">punitive expedition</a> against Chōshū, the <a href="First%20Ch%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB%20expedition">First Chōshū expedition</a>, and obtained Chōshū's submission without actual fighting. At this point initial resistance among the leadership in Chōshū and the Imperial Court subsided, but over the next year the Tokugawa proved unable to reassert full control over the country as most "<a href="daimy%C5%8D">daimyō</a>s" began to ignore orders and questions from Edo.

Despite the bombardment of Kagoshima, the Satsuma Domain had become closer to the British and was pursuing the modernization of its army and navy with their support. The Scottish dealer <a href="Thomas%20Blake%20Glover">Thomas Blake Glover</a> sold quantities of warships and guns to the southern domains. American and British military experts, usually former officers, may have been directly involved in this military effort. The British ambassador <a href="Harry%20Smith%20Parkes">Harry Smith Parkes</a> supported the anti-shogunate forces in a drive to establish a legitimate, unified Imperial rule in Japan, and to counter French influence with the shogunate. During that period, southern Japanese leaders such as <a href="Saig%C5%8D%20Takamori">Saigō Takamori</a> of Satsuma, or <a href="It%C5%8D%20Hirobumi">Itō Hirobumi</a> and <a href="Inoue%20Kaoru">Inoue Kaoru</a> of Chōshū cultivated personal connections with British diplomats, notably <a href="Ernest%20Mason%20Satow">Ernest Mason Satow</a>.

The shogunate also was preparing for further conflict by modernizing its forces. In line with Parkes' designs, the British, previously the shogunate's primary partner, proved reluctant to provide assistance. The Tokugawa thus came to rely mainly on French expertise, comforted by the military prestige of <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> at that time, acquired through his successes in the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> and the <a href="Second%20Italian%20War%20of%20Independence">Second Italian War of Independence</a>.

The shogunate took major steps towards the construction of a modern and powerful military: a navy with a core of eight steam warships had been built over several years and was already the strongest in Asia. In 1865, Japan's first modern naval <a href="arsenal">arsenal</a> was built in <a href="Yokosuka">Yokosuka</a> by the French engineer <a href="L%C3%A9once%20Verny">Léonce Verny</a>. In January 1867, a French military mission arrived to reorganize the shogunal army and create the "<a href="Densh%C5%ABtai">Denshūtai</a>" elite force, and an order was placed with the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> to buy the French-built ironclad warship CSS "Stonewall", a relic of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. Due to the Western powers' declared neutrality, the Americans refused to release the ship, but once neutrality was lifted, the imperial faction obtained the vessel and employed it in engagements in Hakodate under the name "<a href="Japanese%20ironclad%20K%C5%8Dtetsu">Kōtetsu</a>" ("Ironclad").

Following a coup within Chōshū which returned to power the extremist factions opposed to the shogunate, the shogunate announced its intention to lead a <a href="Second%20Ch%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB%20expedition">Second Chōshū expedition</a> to punish the renegade domain. This in turn prompted Chōshū to form a secret alliance with <a href="Satsuma%20domain">Satsuma</a>. In the summer of 1866, the shogunate was defeated by Chōshū, leading to a considerable loss of authority. In late 1866, however, first "shōgun" <a href="Tokugawa%20Iemochi">Iemochi</a> and then <a href="Emperor%20K%C5%8Dmei">Emperor Kōmei</a> died, respectively succeeded by <a href="Tokugawa%20Yoshinobu">Yoshinobu</a> and <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a>. These events, in the words of historian <a href="Marius%20Jansen">Marius Jansen</a>, "made a truce inevitable".

On November 9, 1867, a secret order was created by Satsuma and Chōshū in the name of Emperor Meiji commanding the "slaughtering of the traitorous subject Yoshinobu". Just prior to this however, and following a proposal from the "daimyō" of Tosa, Yoshinobu resigned his post and authorities to the emperor, agreeing to "be the instrument for carrying out" imperial orders. The Tokugawa shogunate had ended.

While Yoshinobu's resignation had created a nominal void at the highest level of government, his apparatus of state continued to exist. Moreover, the shogunal government, the Tokugawa family in particular, would remain a prominent force in the evolving political order and would retain many executive powers, a prospect hard-liners from Satsuma and Chōshū found intolerable. Events came to a head on January 3, 1868, when these elements seized the imperial palace in Kyoto, and the following day had the fifteen-year-old Emperor Meiji declare his own restoration to full power. Although the majority of the imperial consultative assembly was happy with the formal declaration of direct rule by the court and tended to support a continued collaboration with the Tokugawa (under the concept of ), <a href="Saig%C5%8D%20Takamori">Saigō Takamori</a> threatened the assembly into abolishing the title ""shōgun"" and ordering the confiscation of Yoshinobu's lands.

Although he initially agreed to these demands, on January 17, 1868, Yoshinobu declared that he would not be bound by the Restoration proclamation and called for its rescission. On January 24, he decided to prepare an attack on <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, occupied by Satsuma and Chōshū forces. This decision was prompted by his learning of a series of arsons in Edo, starting with the burning of the outerworks of <a href="Edo%20Castle">Edo Castle</a>, the main Tokugawa residence. This was blamed on Satsuma "rōnin", who on that day attacked a government office. The next day shogunate forces responded by attacking the Edo residence of the "daimyō" of Satsuma, where many opponents of the shogunate, under Takamori's direction, had been hiding and creating trouble. The palace was burned down, and many opponents killed or later executed.

On 27 January 1868, shogunate forces attacked the forces of Chōshū and Satsuma, clashing near Toba and <a href="Fushimi%2C%20Kyoto">Fushimi</a>, at the southern entrance of Kyoto. Some parts of the 15,000-strong shogunate forces had been trained by <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">French</a> military advisers, but the majority remained samurai forces. Of those samurai forces there were the "<a href="Shinsengumi">Shinsengumi</a>". Meanwhile, the forces of Chōshū and Satsuma were outnumbered 3:1 but fully modernized with <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong</a> <a href="howitzers">howitzers</a>, <a href="Mini%C3%A9%20rifle">Minié rifle</a>s and a few Gatling guns. After an inconclusive start, on the second day, an Imperial banner was remitted to the defending troops, and a relative of the Emperor, <a href="Prince%20Komatsu%20Akihito">Ninnajinomiya Yoshiaki</a>, was named nominal <a href="commander%20in%20chief">commander in chief</a>, making the forces officially an . Moreover, convinced by courtiers, several local "daimyōs", up to this point faithful to the "shōgun", started to defect to the side of the Imperial Court. These included "daimyōs" of <a href="Yodo%20Domain">Yodo</a> on February 5, and the "daimyō" of <a href="Tsu%20Domain">Tsu</a> on February 6, tilting the military balance in favour of the Imperial side.

On February 7, Tokugawa Yoshinobu, apparently distressed by the imperial approval given to the actions of Satsuma and Chōshū, fled Osaka aboard the <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Kaiy%C5%8D%20Maru">"Kaiyō Maru"</a>, withdrawing to <a href="Edo">Edo</a>. Demoralized by his flight and by the betrayal by Yodo and Tsu, shogunate forces retreated, making the Toba–Fushimi encounter an Imperial victory, although it is often considered the shogunate forces should have won the encounter. Osaka Castle was soon invested on February 8 (on March 1, Western calendar), putting an end to the battle of Toba–Fushimi.
At the same time, on 28 January 1868, the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Awa">Battle of Awa</a> between the shogunate and elements of the Satsuma navy took place. This was Japan's second engagement between two modern navies. The battle, although small in scale, ended in favour of the shogunate.

On the diplomatic front, the ministers of foreign nations, gathered in the open harbor of Hyōgo (present day <a href="Kobe">Kobe</a>) in early February, issued a declaration according to which the shogunate was still considered the only rightful government in Japan, giving hope to Tokugawa Yoshinobu that foreign nations (especially France) might consider an intervention in his favour. A few days later however an Imperial delegation visited the ministers declaring that the shogunate was abolished, that harbours would be open in accordance with International treaties, and that foreigners would be protected. The ministers finally decided to recognize the new government.

The rise of anti-foreign sentiment nonetheless led to several attacks on foreigners in the following months. Eleven French sailors from the <a href="corvette">corvette</a> <a href="FS%20Dupleix%20%281861%29">"Dupleix"</a> were killed by "samurai" of <a href="Tosa%20Province">Tosa</a> in the <a href="Sakai%20incident">Sakai incident</a> on March 8, 1868. Fifteen days later, Sir <a href="Harry%20Smith%20Parkes">Harry Parkes</a>, the British ambassador, was attacked by a group of "samurai" in a street of Kyoto.

Beginning in February, with the help of the French ambassador <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Roches">Léon Roches</a>, a plan was formulated to stop the Imperial Court's advance at <a href="Odawara">Odawara</a>, the last strategic entry point to Edo, but Yoshinobu decided against the plan. Shocked, Léon Roches resigned from his position. In early March, under the influence of the British minister <a href="Harry%20Smith%20Parkes">Harry Parkes</a>, foreign nations signed a strict neutrality agreement, according to which they could not intervene or provide military supplies to either side until the resolution of the conflict.

<a href="Saig%C5%8D%20Takamori">Saigō Takamori</a> led the victorious imperial forces north and east through Japan, winning the <a href="Battle%20of%20K%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB-Katsunuma">Battle of Kōshū-Katsunuma</a>. He eventually surrounded <a href="Edo">Edo</a> in May 1868, leading to its unconditional defeat after <a href="Katsu%20Kaish%C5%AB">Katsu Kaishū</a>, the "shōgun"s Army Minister, negotiated the surrender. Some groups continued to resist after this surrender but were defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ueno">Battle of Ueno</a> on 4 July 1868.

Meanwhile, the leader of the "shōgun"s navy, <a href="Enomoto%20Takeaki">Enomoto Takeaki</a>, refused to surrender all his ships. He remitted just four ships, among them the <a href="Japanese%20warship%20Fujiyama">"Fujiyama"</a>, but he then escaped north with the remnants of the "shōgun"s navy (eight steam warships: <a href="Japanese%20warship%20Kaiten">"Kaiten"</a>, <a href="Japanese%20warship%20Banry%C5%AB">"Banryū"</a>, <a href="Japanese%20gunboat%20Chiyodagata">"Chiyodagata"</a>, <a href="Japanese%20warship%20Ch%C5%8Dgei">"Chōgei"</a>, <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Kaiy%C5%8D%20Maru">"Kaiyō Maru"</a>, <a href="Japanese%20warship%20Kanrin%20Maru">"Kanrin Maru"</a>, <a href="Japanese%20warship%20Mikaho">"Mikaho"</a> and <a href="Japanese%20warship%20Shinsoku">"Shinsoku"</a>), and 2,000 members of the navy, in the hope of staging a counter-attack together with the northern "daimyōs". He was accompanied by a handful of French military advisers, notably <a href="Jules%20Brunet">Jules Brunet</a>, who had formally resigned from the French Army to accompany the rebels.

After Yoshinobu's surrender, most of Japan accepted the emperor's rule, but a core of domains in the North, supporting the <a href="Aizu">Aizu</a> clan, continued the resistance. In May, several northern "<a href="daimy%C5%8D">daimyō</a>s" formed an Alliance to fight Imperial troops, the <a href="Ouetsu%20Reppan%20Domei">coalition of northern domains</a> composed primarily of forces from the domains of <a href="Sendai">Sendai</a>, <a href="Yonezawa">Yonezawa</a>, <a href="Aizu">Aizu</a>, <a href="Sh%C5%8Dnai">Shōnai</a> and <a href="Nagaoka%2C%20Niigata">Nagaoka</a>, with a total of 50,000 troops. An Imperial Prince, <a href="Kitashirakawa%20Yoshihisa">Kitashirakawa Yoshihisa</a> had fled north with partisans of the Tokugawa shogunate and was made the nominal head of the Northern Coalition, with the intention of naming him "Emperor Tobu".

In May 1868, the "daimyō" of Nagaoka inflicted high losses on the Imperial troops in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hokuetsu">Battle of Hokuetsu</a>, but his castle ultimately fell on May 19. Imperial troops continued to progress north, defeating the <a href="Shinsengumi">Shinsengumi</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bonari%20Pass">Battle of Bonari Pass</a>, which opened the way for their attack on the castle of <a href="Aizuwakamatsu">Aizuwakamatsu</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aizu">Battle of Aizu</a> in October 1868, thus making the position in Sendai untenable.

Enomoto's fleet joined <a href="Sendai">Sendai</a> harbour on August 26. Although the Northern Coalition was numerous, it was poorly equipped, and relied on traditional fighting methods. Modern armament was scarce, and last-minute efforts were made to build <a href="cannon">cannon</a>s made of wood and reinforced with roping, firing stone projectiles. Such cannons, installed on defensive structures, could only fire four or five projectiles before bursting. On the other hand, the "daimyō" of Nagaoka managed to procure two of the three <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a>s in Japan and 2,000 modern French rifles from the German weapons dealer <a href="Henry%20Schnell">Henry Schnell</a>.

The coalition crumbled, and on October 12, 1868, the fleet left Sendai for <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a>, after having acquired two more ships ("Oe" and <a href="Japanese%20warship%20H%C5%8D%C5%8D%20Maru">"Hōō"</a>, previously borrowed by Sendai from the shogunate), and about 1,000 more troops: remaining shogunate troops under <a href="%C5%8Ctori%20Keisuke">Ōtori Keisuke</a>, <a href="Shinsengumi">Shinsengumi</a> troops under <a href="Hijikata%20Toshiz%C5%8D">Hijikata Toshizō</a>, the guerilla corps ("yugekitai") under <a href="Hitomi%20Katsutar%C5%8D">Hitomi Katsutarō</a>, as well as several more French advisers (Fortant, Garde, Marlin, Bouffier).

On October 26, Edo was renamed <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, and the <a href="Meiji%20period">Meiji period</a> officially started. Aizu was besieged starting that month, leading to the mass suicide of the "<a href="Byakkotai">Byakkotai</a>" (White Tiger Corps) young warriors. After a protracted month-long battle, <a href="Aizu">Aizu</a> finally admitted defeat on November 6.

Following defeat on Honshū, <a href="Enomoto%20Takeaki">Enomoto Takeaki</a> fled to <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a> with the remnants of the navy and his handful of French advisers. Together they organized a government, with the objective of establishing an independent island nation dedicated to the development of Hokkaidō. They formally established the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ezo">Republic of Ezo</a> on the American model, Japan's only ever republic, and Enomoto was elected as President, with a large majority. The republic tried to reach out to foreign legations present in Hakodate, such as the Americans, French, and <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russians</a>, but was not able to garner any international recognition or support. Enomoto offered to confer the territory to the Tokugawa "shōgun" under Imperial rule, but his proposal was declined by the Imperial Governing Council.

During the winter, they fortified their defenses around the southern peninsula of <a href="Hakodate">Hakodate</a>, with the new fortress of <a href="Gory%C5%8Dkaku">Goryōkaku</a> at the center. The troops were organized under a Franco-Japanese command, the commander-in-chief <a href="%C5%8Ctori%20Keisuke">Ōtori Keisuke</a> being seconded by the French captain <a href="Jules%20Brunet">Jules Brunet</a>, and divided between four <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s. Each of these was commanded by a French non-commissioned officer (<a href="Arthur%20Fortant">Fortant</a>, <a href="Jean%20Marlin">Marlin</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Cazeneuve">Cazeneuve</a>, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Bouffier">Bouffier</a>), and were themselves divided into eight half-brigades, each under Japanese command.

The Imperial Navy reached the harbour of <a href="Miyako%2C%20Iwate">Miyako</a> on March 20, but anticipating the arrival of the Imperial ships, the Ezo rebels organized a daring plan to seize the <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Kotetsu">"Kōtetsu"</a>. Led by Shinsengumi commander <a href="Hijikata%20Toshiz%C5%8D">Hijikata Toshizō</a>, three warships were dispatched for a surprise attack, in what is known as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Miyako%20Bay">Battle of Miyako Bay</a>. The battle ended in failure for the Tokugawa side, owing to bad weather, engine trouble and the decisive use of a <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a> by Imperial troops against samurai boarding parties.

Imperial forces soon consolidated their hold on mainland Japan, and, in April 1869, dispatched a fleet and an infantry force of 7,000 to Ezo, starting the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hakodate">Battle of Hakodate</a>. The Imperial forces progressed swiftly and won the <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Hakodate%20Bay">naval engagement at Hakodate Bay</a>, Japan's first large-scale naval battle between modern navies, as the fortress of <a href="Gory%C5%8Dkaku">Goryōkaku</a> was surrounded with 800 remaining men. Seeing the situation had become desperate, the French advisers escaped to a French ship stationed in Hakodate Bay—"<a href="Co%C3%ABtlogon%2C%20C%C3%B4tes-d%27Armor">Coëtlogon</a>", under the command of <a href="Abel-Nicolas%20Bergasse%20Dupetit%20Thouars">Dupetit Thouars</a>—from where they were shipped back to <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a> and then France. The Japanese requested that the French advisers be given judgement in France; however, due to popular support in France for their actions, the former French advisers in Japan were not punished for their actions.

Enomoto had resolved to fight to the end, and had sent his valuables to his adversary for safekeeping. These included the Naval Codes he had brought back from Holland, which he entrusted to the general of the Imperial troops, <a href="Kuroda%20Kiyotaka">Kuroda Kiyotaka</a>, but Otori convinced him to surrender, telling him that deciding to live through defeat is the truly courageous way: "If it's dying you want you can do it anytime." Enomoto surrendered on June 27, 1869, accepting the <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Meiji Emperor</a>'s rule, and the Ezo Republic ceased to exist.

Following victory, the new government proceeded with unifying the country under a single, legitimate and powerful rule by the Imperial Court. The emperor's residence was effectively transferred from <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a> to Edo at the end of 1868, and the city renamed to <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. The military and political power of the <a href="abolition%20of%20the%20han%20system">domains was progressively eliminated</a>, and the domains themselves were soon transformed into <a href="Prefectures%20of%20Japan">prefecture</a>s, whose governors were appointed by the emperor. A major reform was the effective expropriation and abolition of the <a href="Samurai">samurai class</a>, allowing many samurai to change into administrative or entrepreneurial positions, but forcing many others into poverty. The southern domains of Satsuma, Chōshū and Tosa, having played a decisive role in the victory, occupied most of the key posts in government for several decades following the conflict, a situation sometimes called the "<a href="Meiji%20oligarchy">Meiji oligarchy</a>" and formalized with the institution of the <a href="genr%C5%8D">genrō</a>. In 1869, the <a href="Yasukuni%20Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a> in Tokyo was built in honour of the victims of the Boshin War.

Some leading partisans of the former "shōgun" were imprisoned, but narrowly escaped execution. This clemency derives from the insistence of Saigō Takamori and <a href="Iwakura%20Tomomi">Iwakura Tomomi</a>, although much weight was placed on the advice of <a href="Harry%20Smith%20Parkes">Parkes</a>, the British envoy. He had urged Saigō, in the words of Ernest Satow, "that severity towards Keiki [Yoshinobu] or his supporters, especially in the way of personal punishment, would injure the reputation of the new government in the opinion of European Powers". After two or three years of imprisonment, most of them were called to serve the new government, and several pursued brilliant careers. <a href="Enomoto%20Takeaki">Enomoto Takeaki</a>, for instance, would later serve as an envoy to Russia and China and as the education minister.

The Imperial side did not pursue its objective to expel foreign interests from Japan, but instead shifted to a more progressive policy aiming at the continued modernization of the country and the renegotiation of <a href="unequal%20treaties">unequal treaties</a> with foreign powers, later under the motto. The shift in stance towards the foreigners came during the early days of the civil war: on April 8, 1868, new signboards were erected in Kyoto (and later throughout the country) that specifically repudiated violence against foreigners. During the course of the conflict, Emperor Meiji personally received European envoys, first in Kyoto, then later in Osaka and Tokyo. Also unprecedented was Emperor Meiji's reception of <a href="Duke%20of%20Edinburgh%20Alfred">Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, in Tokyo, as his "equal" in point of blood'."

Although the early Meiji era witnessed a warming of relations between the Imperial Court and foreign powers, <a href="Franco-Japanese%20relations">relations with France</a> temporarily soured due to the initial support by France for the shōgun. Soon however a <a href="French%20military%20mission%20to%20Japan%20%281872%E2%80%9380%29">second military mission</a> was invited to Japan in 1874, and <a href="French%20Military%20Mission%20to%20Japan%20%281884%29">a third one</a> in 1884. A high level of interaction resumed around 1886, when France helped build the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a>'s first large-scale modern fleet, under the direction of naval engineer <a href="Louis-%C3%89mile%20Bertin">Louis-Émile Bertin</a>. The modernization of the country had started during the <a href="Late%20Tokugawa%20shogunate">last years of the shogunate</a>, and the Meiji government ultimately adopted the same policy.
Upon his coronation, Meiji issued his <a href="Charter%20Oath">Charter Oath</a>, calling for deliberative assemblies, promising increased opportunities for the common people, abolishing the "evil customs of the past", and seeking knowledge throughout the world "to strengthen the foundations of imperial rule". Prominent reforms of the Meiji government included the 1871 <a href="Abolition%20of%20the%20han%20system">abolition of the domain system</a>, by which the feudal domains and their hereditary rulers were replaced by <a href="Prefectures%20of%20Japan">prefectures</a> with governors appointed by the emperor. Others included the introduction of compulsory schooling and the abolition of Confucian class distinctions. The reforms culminated in the 1889 issuance of the <a href="Meiji%20Constitution">Meiji Constitution</a>. However, despite the support given to the Imperial Court by samurai, many of the early Meiji reforms were seen as detrimental to their interests: the creation of a conscript army made of commoners, as well as the loss of hereditary prestige and stipends antagonized many former samurai. Tensions ran particularly high in the south, leading to the 1874 <a href="Saga%20Rebellion">Saga Rebellion</a>, and a rebellion in Chōshū in 1876. Former samurai in Satsuma, led by Saigō Takamori, who had left government over foreign policy differences, started the <a href="Satsuma%20Rebellion">Satsuma Rebellion</a> in 1877. Fighting for the maintenance of the <a href="samurai">samurai</a> class and a more virtuous government, their slogan was . It ended with a heroic but total defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiroyama">Battle of Shiroyama</a>.

In modern summaries, the <a href="Meiji%20Restoration">Meiji Restoration</a> is often described as a "bloodless revolution" leading to the sudden modernization of Japan. The facts of the Boshin War, however, clearly show that the conflict was quite violent: about 120,000 troops were mobilized altogether with roughly 3,500 known casualties during open hostilities but much more during terrorist attacks. Later Japanese depictions of the war tended to be highly romanticized, showing the shogunal side fighting with traditional methods, against an already modernized Imperial side. Although traditional weapons and techniques were used, both sides employed some of the most modern armaments and fighting techniques of the period, including the <a href="ironclad%20warship">ironclad warship</a>, <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a>s, and fighting techniques learned from Western military advisors.

Such Japanese depictions include numerous dramatizations, spanning many genres. Notably, <a href="Jir%C5%8D%20Asada">Jirō Asada</a> wrote a four-volume novel of the account, "Mibu Gishi-den". A film adaptation of Asada's work, directed by <a href="Y%C5%8Djir%C5%8D%20Takita">Yōjirō Takita</a>, is known as "<a href="When%20the%20Last%20Sword%20Is%20Drawn">When the Last Sword Is Drawn</a>". A ten-hour television "<a href="jidaigeki">jidaigeki</a>" based on the same novel starred <a href="Ken%20Watanabe">Ken Watanabe</a>. The 2001 "Goryōkaku" film is another "jidaigeki" highlighting the resistance in Hokkaidō. Among Japanese <a href="anime">anime</a>, "<a href="Bakumatsu%20Kikansetsu%20Irohanihoheto">Bakumatsu Kikansetsu Irohanihoheto</a>" in part dramatizes the Boshin War, while "<a href="Rurouni%20Kenshin">Rurouni Kenshin</a>" is set 10 years after. The "Rurouni Kenshin" OVA "" is set during the Boshin War and depicts several events of the war (such as the raid on the "daimyō" of Satsuma's residence and the failed boarding of the "Kōtetsu" at the Battle of Miyako Bay).

Western interpretations include the 2003 American film "<a href="The%20Last%20Samurai">The Last Samurai</a>" directed by <a href="Edward%20Zwick">Edward Zwick</a>, which combines into a single narrative historical situations belonging both to the Boshin War, the 1877 <a href="Satsuma%20Rebellion">Satsuma Rebellion</a>, and other similar uprisings of ex-samurai during the early Meiji period. The elements of the movie pertaining to the early modernization of Japan's military forces as well as the direct involvement of foreign (mostly French) forces relate to the Boshin War and the few years leading to it. However, the suicidal stand of traditionalist samurai forces led by <a href="Saig%C5%8D%20Takamori">Saigō Takamori</a> against the modernized Imperial army relate to the much later Satsuma Rebellion.

The main campaign in the 2012 expansion to <a href="Creative%20Assembly">Creative Assembly</a>'s game "" depicts the Boshin War. Players can choose from various historical clans, such as the Imperial <a href="Satsuma%20Domain">Satsuma</a> or the shogunate <a href="Aizu%20Domain">Aizu</a>.

The forces of Chōshū and Satsuma were fully modernized with <a href="Armstrong%20Gun">Armstrong guns</a>, <a href="Mini%C3%A9%20rifle">Minié rifle</a>s and one <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a>. The shogunate forces had been slightly lagging in term of equipment, although the <a href="French%20military%20mission%20to%20Japan%20%281867%E2%80%9368%29">French military mission to Japan (1867–68)</a> had recently trained a core elite force. The "shōgun" also relied on troops supplied by allied domains, which were not necessarily as advanced in terms of military equipment and methods, composing an army that had both modern and outdated elements.

Numerous types of more or less modern <a href="smoothbore">smoothbore</a> guns and <a href="rifle">rifle</a>s were imported, from countries as varied as <a href="Second%20French%20Empire">France</a>, <a href="North%20German%20Confederation">Germany</a>, the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Britain</a>, or the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, and coexisted with traditional types such as the <a href="Tanegashima%20%28Japanese%20matchlock%29">tanegashima matchlock</a>.

Most shogunate troops used "Büchse" (<a href="Gewehr">Gewehr</a>) smoothbore guns, which had been imported in Japan since around 1840, initially from the Netherlands by Takashima Akiho. These guns were rather ancient and had limited capabilities, with an effective lethal range of about 50 meters, and a firing rate of about 2 rounds per minute. The "daimyō" of <a href="Nagaoka%2C%20Niigata">Nagaoka</a> however, an ally of the "shōgun", possessed two Gatling guns and several thousand modern rifles. The shogunate is known to have placed an order for 30,000 modern <a href="Dreyse%20needle%20gun">Dreyse needle gun</a>s in 1866. <a href="Napoleon%20III">Napoleon III</a> provided Tokugawa Yoshinobu with 2,000 state-of-the-art <a href="Chassepot">Chassepot</a> rifles, which he used to equip his personal guard. Antiquated tanegashima matchlock guns are also known to have been used by the Bakufu however.

Imperial troops mainly used <a href="Mini%C3%A9%20rifle">Minié rifle</a>s, which were much more accurate, lethal, and had a much longer range than the smoothbore Gewehr guns, although, being also muzzle-loading, they were similarly limited to two shots per minute. Improved breech-loading mechanisms, such as the <a href="Snider-Enfield">Snider</a>, developing a rate of about ten shots a minute, are known to have been used by troops of the <a href="Ch%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB%20Domain">Chōshū Domain</a> against the shogunate's <a href="Sh%C5%8Dgitai">Shōgitai</a>, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ueno">Battle of Ueno</a> in July 1868. In the second half of the conflict, in the northeast theater, <a href="Tosa%20Province">Tosa Province</a> troops are known to have used American-made <a href="Spencer%20repeating%20rifle">Spencer repeating rifle</a>s. American-made handguns were also popular, such as the 1863 <a href="Smith%20%26amp%3B%20Wesson">Smith & Wesson Army No 2</a>, which was imported to Japan by the Scottish trader <a href="Thomas%20Blake%20Glover">Thomas Blake Glover</a> and used by the Satsuma forces.

For artillery, <a href="wooden%20cannon">wooden cannon</a>s, only able to fire 3 or 4 shots before bursting, coexisted with state-of-the-art <a href="Armstrong%20Gun">Armstrong gun</a>s using explosive <a href="Shell%20%28projectile%29">shells</a>. Armstrong guns were efficiently used by the troops of <a href="Satsuma%20Domain">Satsuma</a> and <a href="Saga%20Domain">Saga</a> throughout the war.
These were not the only cannons to exist, but are instead on opposite ends of the spectrum. The Shogunate as well as the Imperial side also used native Japanese cannons, with Japan making cannons domestically as far back as the year 1575.

In the area of warships also, some of the most recent ironclads such as the "<a href="Japanese%20battleship%20K%C5%8Dtetsu">Kōtetsu</a>" coexisted with older types of steamboats and even traditional sailboats. The shogunate initially had a rather strong edge in warships, and it had the vision to order the state-of-the-art French-made "Kōtetsu", although the ship was blocked from delivery by foreign powers on ground of neutrality once the conflict had started, and was ultimately remitted to the Imperial faction shortly after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Toba%E2%80%93Fushimi">Battle of Toba–Fushimi</a>.

Uniforms were Western-style for modernized troops (usually dark, with variations in the shape of the helmet: tall conical for Satsuma, flat conical for Chōshū, rounded for the shogunate). Officers of the shogunate often wore French and British uniforms. Traditional troops however retained their <a href="samurai">samurai</a> clothes. Some of the headgear for some of the Imperial troops was quite peculiar, involving the use of long, colored, "bear" hair. The wigs indicate officers from <a href="Tosa%20Domain">Tosa</a>, the wigs officers from <a href="Ch%C5%8Dsh%C5%AB%20Domain">Chōshū</a>, and the "black bear" (黒熊, "koguma") wigs officers from <a href="Satsuma%20han">Satsuma</a>.

Mary Celeste

Mary Celeste (; often misreported as "Marie Celeste") was an American <a href="merchant">merchant</a> <a href="brigantine">brigantine</a>, discovered adrift and deserted in the Atlantic Ocean, off the <a href="Azores">Azores Islands</a>, on December 5, 1872. The Canadian brigantine found her in a dishevelled but seaworthy condition, under <a href="Reefing">partial sail</a>, and with her lifeboat missing. The last entry in her log was dated ten days earlier. She had left <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> for <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> on November 7, and on discovery was still amply provisioned. Her cargo of <a href="denatured%20alcohol">denatured alcohol</a> was intact, and the captain's and crew's personal belongings were undisturbed. None of those who had been on board were ever seen or heard from again.

"Mary Celeste" was built in <a href="Spencer%27s%20Island">Spencer's Island</a>, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, and launched under British registration as "Amazon", in 1861. She transferred to American ownership and registration in 1868, when she acquired her new name, and thereafter sailed uneventfully until her 1872 voyage. At the salvage hearings in <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, following her recovery, the court's officers considered various possibilities of foul play, including mutiny by "Mary Celeste"s crew, piracy by the "Dei Gratia" crew or others, and conspiracy to carry out insurance or salvage fraud. No convincing evidence supported these theories, but unresolved suspicions led to a relatively low salvage award.

The inconclusive nature of the hearings helped to foster continued speculation as to the nature of the mystery, and the story has repeatedly been complicated by false detail and fantasy. Hypotheses that have been advanced include the effects on the crew of alcohol fumes rising from the cargo, <a href="submarine%20earthquake">submarine earthquake</a>s (seaquakes), <a href="waterspouts">waterspouts</a>, attack by a <a href="giant%20squid">giant squid</a>, and paranormal intervention.

After the Gibraltar hearings, "Mary Celeste" continued in service under new owners. In 1885, her captain deliberately wrecked her off the coast of <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a>, as part of an attempted insurance fraud. The story of her 1872 abandonment has been recounted and dramatized many times, in documentaries, novels, plays and films, and the name of the ship has become a byword for unexplained desertion.

The <a href="keel">keel</a> of the future "Mary Celeste" was laid in late 1860 at the shipyard of Joshua Dewis in the village of <a href="Spencer%27s%20Island">Spencer's Island</a>, on the shores of the <a href="Bay%20of%20Fundy">Bay of Fundy</a> in <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. The ship was constructed of locally felled timber, with two masts, and was rigged as a <a href="brigantine">brigantine</a>; she was <a href="Carvel%20%28boat%20building%29">carvel-built</a>, with the hull planking flush rather than overlapping. She was launched on May 18, 1861, given the name "Amazon", and registered at nearby <a href="Parrsboro">Parrsboro</a> on June 10, 1861. Her registration documents described her as in length, broad, with a depth of , and of 198.42 <a href="Gross%20register%20tonnage">gross tonnage</a>. She was owned by a local consortium of nine people, headed by Dewis; among the co-owners was Robert McLellan, the ship's first captain.

For her maiden voyage in June 1861, "Amazon" sailed to <a href="Five%20Islands%2C%20Nova%20Scotia">Five Islands</a> to take on a cargo of timber for passage across the Atlantic to London. After supervising the ship's loading, Captain McLellan fell ill; his condition worsened, and "Amazon" returned to Spencer's Island where McLellan died on June 19. John Nutting Parker took over as captain, and resumed the voyage to London, in the course of which "Amazon" encountered further misadventures. She collided with fishing equipment in the narrows off <a href="Eastport%2C%20Maine">Eastport, Maine</a>, and after leaving London ran into and sank a <a href="brig">brig</a> in the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>.

Parker remained in command for two years, during which "Amazon" worked mainly in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a> trade. She crossed the Atlantic to France in November 1861, and in <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> was the subject of a painting, possibly by Honoré de Pellegrin, a well-known maritime artist of the Marseilles School. In 1863 Parker was succeeded by William Thompson, who remained in command until 1867. These were quiet years; "Amazon"s mate later recalled that, "We went to the West Indies, England and the Mediterranean—what we call the foreign trade. Not a thing unusual happened." In October 1867, at <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Island">Cape Breton Island</a>, "Amazon" was driven ashore in a storm, and was so badly damaged that her owners abandoned her as a wreck. On October 15, she was acquired as a <a href="Flotsam%2C%20jetsam%2C%20lagan%20and%20derelict">derelict</a> by Alexander McBean, of <a href="Glace%20Bay">Glace Bay</a>, Nova Scotia.

Within a month, McBean sold the wreck to a local businessman, who in November 1868, sold it to Richard W. Haines, an American mariner from New York. Haines paid US$1,750 for the wreck, and then spent $8,825 restoring it. He made himself her captain, and in December 1868 registered her with the <a href="Collector%20of%20the%20Port%20of%20New%20York">Collector of Customs in New York</a> as an American vessel, under a new name, "Mary Celeste".

In October 1869, the ship was seized by Haines's creditors, and sold to a New York consortium headed by James H. Winchester. During the next three years, the composition of this consortium changed several times, although Winchester retained at least a half-share throughout. There is no record of "Mary Celeste"s trading activities during this period. Early in 1872, the ship underwent a major refit, costing $10,000, which enlarged her considerably. Her length was increased to , her breadth to and her depth to . Among the structural changes, a second deck was added; an inspector's report refers to extensions to the <a href="poop%20deck">poop deck</a>, new <a href="transom%20%28nautical%29">transom</a>s and the replacement of many timbers. The work increased the ship's tonnage to 282.28. On October 29, 1872, the consortium was made up of Winchester with six-twelfths and two minor investors with one-twelfth apiece, with the remaining four-twelfths held by the ship's new captain, <a href="Benjamin%20Briggs">Benjamin Spooner Briggs</a>.

Benjamin Briggs was born in <a href="Wareham%2C%20Massachusetts">Wareham, Massachusetts</a>, on April 24, 1835, one of five sons of sea captain Nathan Briggs. All but one of the sons went to sea, two becoming captains. Benjamin was an observant Christian who read the Bible regularly and often bore witness to his faith at prayer meetings. In 1862, he married his cousin Sarah Elizabeth Cobb, and enjoyed a Mediterranean honeymoon on board his <a href="schooner">schooner</a> "Forest King". Two children were born: son Arthur in September 1865, and daughter Sophia Matilda in October 1870.

By the time of Sophia's birth, Briggs had achieved a high standing within his profession. Nevertheless, he considered retiring from the sea to go into business with his seafaring brother Oliver, who had also grown tired of the wandering life. They did not proceed with this project, but instead each invested his savings in a share of a ship: Oliver in "Julia A. Hallock", and Benjamin in "Mary Celeste". In October 1872, Benjamin took command of "Mary Celeste" for her first voyage following her extensive New York refit, which was to take her to <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> in Italy. He arranged for his wife and infant daughter to accompany him, while his school-aged son was left at home with his grandmother.

Briggs chose the crew for this voyage with care. First mate Albert G. Richardson was married to a niece of Winchester and had sailed under Briggs before. Second mate Andrew Gilling, aged about 25, was Danish in origin although born in New York. The steward, newly married Edward William Head, was signed on with a personal recommendation from Winchester. The four general seamen were all Germans from the <a href="Frisian%20Islands">Frisian Islands</a>: the brothers Volkert and Boz Lorenzen, Arian Martens, and Gottlieb Goudschaal. A later testimonial described them as "peaceable and first-class sailors." In a letter to his mother shortly before the voyage, Briggs declared himself eminently satisfied with ship and crew. Sarah Briggs informed her mother that the crew appeared to be quietly capable, "... if they continue as they have begun."

On October 20, 1872, Briggs arrived at Pier 50 on the <a href="East%20River">East River</a>, New York City, to supervise the loading of the ship's cargo for Genoa: 1,701 barrels of poisonous <a href="denatured%20alcohol">denatured alcohol</a>. A week later, Briggs was joined by his wife and baby daughter. On Sunday, November 3, Briggs wrote to his mother, telling her that he intended to leave on Tuesday, adding that, "Our vessel is in beautiful trim and I hope we shall have a fine passage."

On Tuesday morning, November 5, "Mary Celeste" left Pier 50 with Briggs, his wife and daughter, and seven crew members, and moved into <a href="New%20York%20Harbor">New York Harbor</a>. The weather was uncertain, and Briggs decided to wait for better conditions. He anchored the ship just off <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>, where Sarah used the delay to send a final letter to her mother-in-law, in which she wrote: "Tell Arthur I make great dependence on the letters I shall get from him, and will try to remember anything that happens on the voyage which he would be pleased to hear." On November 7, when the weather eased, "Mary Celeste" left the harbor and went out into the Atlantic.

While "Mary Celeste" prepared to sail, another brigantine, the Canadian , lay in nearby <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a>, awaiting a cargo of petroleum destined for Genoa via <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. Her captain, David Morehouse, and his first mate Oliver Deveau, were <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>ns, both highly experienced and respected seamen. As captains with common interests, it is likely that Morehouse and Briggs knew each other, if only casually. Some accounts assert that they were close friends who, on the evening before "Mary Celeste"s departure, dined together, but the evidence for this is limited to a recollection by Morehouse's widow, 50 years after the event. "Dei Gratia" departed for Gibraltar on November 15, eight days after "Mary Celeste", following the same general route.

"Dei Gratia" had reached a position of , midway between the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> and the coast of Portugal at about 1 pm on Wednesday, December 4, 1872, land time (Thursday, December 5, sea time). As Captain Morehouse came on deck, the helmsman reported a vessel about distant, heading unsteadily towards "Dei Gratia". The ship's erratic movements and the odd set of her sails led Morehouse to suspect that something was wrong. As the vessels drew close, he could see nobody on deck, and he received no reply to his signals, so he sent Deveau and second mate John Wright in a ship's boat to investigate. From the name on her stern the pair established that this was the "Mary Celeste"; they then climbed aboard, where they found the ship deserted. The sails, partly set, were in a poor condition, some missing altogether, and much of the rigging was damaged, with ropes hanging loosely over the sides. The main hatch cover was secure, but the fore and <a href="lazarette">lazarette</a> hatches were open, their covers beside them on the deck. The ship's single lifeboat, a small <a href="yawl">yawl</a> that had apparently been stowed across the main hatch, was missing, while the <a href="binnacle">binnacle</a> housing the ship's compass had shifted from its place, its glass cover broken. There was about of water in the hold, a significant but not alarming amount for a ship this size. A makeshift <a href="Sound%20%28nautical%29">sounding rod</a> (a device for measuring the amount of water in the hold) was found abandoned on the deck.

The last entry on the ship's daily log, found in the mate's cabin, was dated at 8:00 am on November 25, nine days earlier. It recorded "Mary Celeste"s position then as , off <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Island">Santa Maria Island</a> in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>—nearly from the point where "Dei Gratia" encountered her. Deveau saw that the cabin interiors were wet and untidy from water that had entered through doorways and skylights, but were otherwise in reasonable order. In Briggs's cabin, Deveau found personal items scattered about, including a sheathed sword under the bed, but most of the ship's papers were missing, together with the captain's navigational instruments. Galley equipment was neatly stowed away; there was no food prepared or under preparation, but there were ample provisions in the stores. There were no obvious signs of fire or violence; the evidence indicated an orderly departure from the ship, by means of the missing lifeboat.

Deveau returned to report these findings to Morehouse, who decided to bring the derelict into Gibraltar, away. Under maritime law, a <a href="marine%20salvage">salvor</a> could expect a substantial share of the combined value of rescued vessel and cargo, the exact award depending on the degree of danger inherent in the salvaging. Morehouse divided "Dei Gratia"s crew of eight between the two vessels, sending Deveau and two experienced seamen to "Mary Celeste", while he and four others remained on "Dei Gratia". The weather was relatively calm for most of the way to Gibraltar, but with each ship seriously undermanned, progress was slow. "Dei Gratia" reached Gibraltar on December 12, 1872, and "Mary Celeste", which had encountered fog, arrived on the following morning. She was immediately impounded by the <a href="vice%20admiralty%20court">vice admiralty court</a>, preparatory to salvage hearings. Deveau wrote to his wife that the ordeal of bringing the ship in was such that "I can hardly tell what I am made of, but I do not care so long as I got in safe. I shall be well paid for the "Mary Celeste"."

The salvage court hearings began in Gibraltar on December 17, 1872, under <a href="James%20Cochrane%20%28chief%20justice%20of%20Gibraltar%29">Sir James Cochrane</a>, the chief justice of Gibraltar. The hearing was conducted by <a href="Frederick%20Solly-Flood%20%28attorney%20general%29">Frederick Solly-Flood</a>, <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Gibraltar">Attorney General of Gibraltar</a> who was also Advocate-General and Proctor for the Queen in Her Office of Admiralty. Flood was described by a historian of the "Mary Celeste" affair as a man "whose arrogance and pomposity were inversely proportional to his IQ", and as "... the sort of man who, once he had made up his mind about something, couldn't be shifted." The testimonies of Deveau and Wright convinced Flood unalterably that a crime had been committed, a belief picked up by the New York "Shipping and Commercial List" on December 21: "The inference is that there has been foul play somewhere, and that alcohol is at the bottom of it."

On December 23, Flood ordered an examination of "Mary Celeste", which was carried out by John Austin, Surveyor of Shipping, with the assistance of a diver, Ricardo Portunato. Austin noted cuts on each side of the bow, caused, he thought, by a sharp instrument, and found possible traces of blood on the captain's sword. His report emphasized that the ship did not appear to have been struck by heavy weather, citing a <a href="vial">vial</a> of sewing machine oil found upright in its place. Austin did not acknowledge that the vial might have been replaced since the abandonment, nor did the court raise this point. Portunato's report on the hull concluded that the ship had not been involved in a collision or run aground. A further inspection by a group of <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Naval</a> captains endorsed Austin's opinion that the cuts on the bow had been caused deliberately. They also discovered stains on one of the ship's rails that might have been blood, together with a deep mark possibly caused by an axe. These findings strengthened Flood's suspicions that human wrongdoing rather than natural disaster lay behind the mystery. On January 22, 1873, he sent the reports to the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a> in London, adding his own conclusion that the crew had got at the alcohol (he ignored its non-potability) and murdered the Briggs family and the ship's officers in a drunken frenzy. They had cut the bows to simulate a collision, then fled in the yawl to suffer an unknown fate. Flood thought that Morehouse and his men were hiding something, specifically that "Mary Celeste" had been abandoned in a more easterly location, and that the log had been doctored. He could not accept that "Mary Celeste" could have traveled so far while unmanned.

James Winchester arrived in Gibraltar on January 15, to inquire when "Mary Celeste" might be released to deliver its cargo. Flood demanded a surety of $15,000, money Winchester did not have. He became aware that Flood thought he might have deliberately engaged a crew that would kill Briggs and his officers as part of some conspiracy. On January 29, during a series of sharp exchanges with Flood, Winchester testified to Briggs's high character, and insisted that he would not have abandoned the ship except in extremity. Flood's theories of mutiny and murder received significant setbacks when scientific analysis of the stains found on the sword and elsewhere on the ship showed that they were not blood. A second blow to Flood followed in a report commissioned by Horatio Sprague, the American consul in Gibraltar, from Captain Shufeldt of the US Navy. In Shufeldt's view the marks on the bow were not man-made, but came from the natural actions of the sea on the ship's timbers.

With nothing concrete to support his suspicions, Flood reluctantly released "Mary Celeste" from the court's jurisdiction on February 25. Two weeks later, with a locally raised crew headed by Captain George Blatchford from Massachusetts, she left Gibraltar for Genoa. The question of the salvage payment was decided on April 8, when Cochrane announced the award: £1,700, or about one-fifth of the total value of ship and cargo. This was far lower than the general expectation—one authority thought that the award should have been twice or even three times that amount, given the level of hazard in bringing the derelict into port. Cochrane's final words were harshly critical of Morehouse for his decision, earlier in the hearing, to send "Dei Gratia" under Deveau to deliver its cargo of petroleum—although Morehouse had remained in Gibraltar at the disposal of the court. Cochrane's tone carried an implication of wrongdoing, which, says Hicks, ensured that Morehouse and his crew "...would be under suspicion in the court of public opinion forever."

A recent theory – put by the Smithsonian Channel's "The True Story of the Mary Celeste" in 2007 – for the abandonment of the ship is that of possible pump congestion and instrumental malfunction. The "Mary Celeste" had been used for transporting coal, which is known for its dust, before it was loaded with industrial alcohol. As the pump was found disassembled on deck, the crew may have been attempting to repair it of congestion. Since the hull was packed full, the captain would have had no way of judging how much water had been taken on-board while navigating rough seas. It is also believed that the chronometer was also faulty, meaning that Briggs could have ordered abandonment thinking they were close to Santa Maria when, in fact, they were some farther west.

Although the evidence in Gibraltar failed to support Flood's theories of murder and conspiracy, the suspicion of foul play lingered. Insurance fraud on the part of Winchester was briefly suspected, on the grounds of newspaper reports that "Mary Celeste" had been heavily over-insured. Winchester was able to refute these allegations, and no inquiry was instituted by the insurance companies that issued the policies. In 1931 an article in the "<a href="Quarterly%20Review">Quarterly Review</a>" suggested that Morehouse could have lain in wait for "Mary Celeste", then lured Briggs and his crew aboard "Dei Gratia" and killed them there. Paul Begg, in his account of the mystery, comments that this theory ignores undisputed facts: "Dei Gratia" left New York eight days after "Mary Celeste", was a slower ship, and would not have caught "Mary Celeste" before the latter reached Gibraltar. Another theory posits that Briggs and Morehouse were partners in a conspiracy to share the salvage proceedings. The unsubstantiated friendship between the two captains has been cited by commentators as making such a plan a plausible explanation. Hicks comments that, "If Morehouse and Briggs had been planning such a scam, they would not have devised such an attention-drawing mystery," and also asks why, if Briggs intended to disappear permanently, he left his son Arthur behind.

Other theories of foul play have suggested an attack by <a href="Riffian%20people">Riffian</a> pirates, who were active off the coast of Morocco in the 1870s. Charles Edey Fay, in his 1942 account, observes that pirates would have looted the ship, yet the personal possessions of captain and crew, some of significant value, were left undisturbed. In 1925, the historian John Gilbert Lockhart surmised that Briggs, in a fit of a religious mania, had slaughtered all on board and then killed himself. In a later edition of his book Lockhart, who had by then spoken to Briggs's descendants, apologized and withdrew this theory.

In Cobb's view, the transfer of personnel to the yawl may have been intended as a temporary safety measure. He speculated from Deveau's report on the state of the rigging and ropes that the ship's main <a href="halliard">halliard</a> may have been used to attach the yawl to the ship, enabling the company to return on board when the danger had passed. If, however, the line had subsequently parted, "Mary Celeste" would have sailed away empty leaving the yawl to founder with its occupants. Begg notes the illogicality of attaching the yawl to a vessel that the crew thought was about to explode or sink, while the writer Macdonald Hastings asks whether Briggs, an experienced captain, would have effected a panicky abandonment of the ship when, "If the "Mary Celeste" had blown her timbers, she would still have been a better bet for survival than the ship's boat." If this is what happened, says Hastings, Briggs "... behaved like a fool; worse, a frightened one."

Commentators generally agree that, to precipitate such a course of action as abandonment of an apparently sound and seaworthy ship, with ample provisions, some extraordinary and alarming circumstance must have arisen. In his evidence to the enquiry, Deveau ventured an explanation based on the <a href="Depth%20sounding">sounding</a> rod found on the derelict's deck. He suggested that Briggs abandoned ship after a sounding that, because of a malfunction of the pumps or other mishap, had given a false impression that the vessel was taking on water rapidly. A severe <a href="waterspout">waterspout</a> strike before the abandonment could explain the amount of water in the ship, and the ragged state of her rigging and sails. The low barometric pressure generated by the spout could have driven water from the bilges up into the pumps, leading the crew to assume the ship had taken on more water than she had, and was in danger of sinking.

Other proffered explanations are the possible appearance of a displaced iceberg, the fear of running aground while becalmed, and a sudden <a href="seaquake">seaquake</a>. Hydrographical evidence suggests that an iceberg drifting so far south was improbable, and had it done so other ships would have seen it. Begg gives more consideration to a theory that "Mary Celeste", while becalmed, began drifting towards the <a href="Dollabarat">Dollabarat reef</a> off Santa Maria Island. The theory supposes that Briggs, fearing his ship would run aground, launched the yawl in the hope of reaching land. The wind could then have picked up and blown "Mary Celeste" away from the reef, while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been becalmed, all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet the ship was found with many of its sails furled.

An earthquake on the sea bed—a "seaquake"—could have caused sufficient turbulence on the surface to damage parts of "Mary Celeste"s cargo, thus releasing noxious fumes. Rising fears of an imminent explosion could plausibly have led Briggs to order the ship's abandonment; the displaced hatches suggest that an inspection, or an attempted airing, had taken place. The "<a href="New%20York%20World">New York World</a>" of 24 January 1886 drew attention to a case where a vessel carrying alcohol had exploded. The same journal's issue of 9 February 1913 cited a seepage of alcohol through a few porous barrels as the source of gases that may have caused or threatened an explosion in "Mary Celeste"s hold. Briggs's cousin Oliver Cobb was a strong proponent of this theory as providing a sufficiently alarming scenario—rumblings from the hold, the smell of escaping fumes and possibly an explosion—for Briggs to have ordered the evacuation of the ship. In his haste to leave the ship before it exploded, Briggs may have failed to properly secure the yawl to the tow line. A sudden breeze could have blown the ship away from the occupants of the yawl, leaving them to succumb to the elements. The lack of damage from an explosion and the generally sound state of the cargo upon discovery tend to weaken this case. In 2006 an experiment was carried out for <a href="Channel%20Five">Channel Five</a> television by <a href="Andrea%20Sella">Andrea Sella</a> of <a href="University%20College%2C%20London">University College, London</a>, the results of which helped to revive the "explosion" theory. Sella built a model of the hold, with paper cartons representing the barrels. Using butane gas, he created an explosion that caused a considerable blast and ball of flame—but contrary to expectation, no fire damage within the replica hold. "What we created was a pressure-wave type of explosion. There was a spectacular wave of flame but, behind it, was relatively cool air. No soot was left behind and there was no burning or scorching."

In the decades that followed, fact and fiction became intertwined. As early as June 1883, the "Los Angeles Times" retold the "Mary Celeste" story with invented detail: "Every sail was set, the tiller was lashed fast, not a rope was out of place ... The fire was burning in the galley. The dinner was standing untasted and scarcely cold ... the log [was] written up to the hour of her discovery." Twenty years later, in the November 1906 "Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine", "Mary Celeste" was recorded as drifting off the <a href="Cape%20Verde%20Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a>, some south of the actual location. Among many inaccuracies, the first mate was "a man named Briggs," and there were live chickens on board.

The most influential retelling, which according to many commentators ensured that the "Mary Celeste" affair would never be forgotten, was a story in the January 1884 issue of the "<a href="Cornhill%20Magazine">Cornhill Magazine</a>". This was an early work of <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>, then a 25-year-old ship's surgeon. Doyle's story, titled "<a href="J.%20Habakuk%20Jephson%27s%20Statement">J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement</a>", did not adhere to the facts. He renamed the ship "Marie Celeste", the captain's name was J. W. Tibbs, the fatal voyage took place in 1873 and was from Boston to Lisbon. The vessel carried passengers, among them the titular Jephson. In the story, another passenger, a fanatic named Septimus Goring with a hatred of the white race, has suborned members of the crew to murder Tibbs and take the vessel to the shores of Western Africa. Here, the rest of the ship's company is killed, save for Jephson who is spared because he possesses a magical charm that is venerated by Goring and his accomplices. Doyle had not expected his story to be taken seriously, but Sprague, still serving as the US consul in Gibraltar, was sufficiently intrigued to inquire if any part of the story might be true.

In 1913, "<a href="The%20Strand%20Magazine">The Strand Magazine</a>" provided another alleged survivor's account, from one Abel Fosdyk, supposedly "Mary Celeste"'s steward. In this version all on board (except Fosdyk) were drowned or eaten by sharks after a temporary platform, on which they had crowded to watch a swimming contest, collapsed into the sea. Unlike Doyle's story, this was proposed by the magazine as a serious solution to the enigma, but it contained many simple mistakes: "Griggs" for Briggs, "Boyce" for Morehouse, Briggs's daughter as a seven-year-old child rather than a two-year-old, a crew of 13 and an ignorance of nautical language. Many more people were convinced by a plausible literary hoax of the 1920s, perpetrated by an Irish writer, Laurence J. Keating. Again presented as a survivor's story—one "John Pemberton"—this told a complex tale of murder, madness and collusion with the "Dei Gratia". It included basic errors such as using Doyle's name ("Marie Celeste"), and misnaming key personnel. Nevertheless, the story was so convincingly told that the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>" of July 26, 1926, thought its truth beyond dispute. Hastings describes Keating's hoax as "... an impudent trick, by a man not without imaginative ability."

In 1924, the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" published a story from a retired naval war hero, Captain R. Lucy, whose informant, allegedly, was "Mary Celeste"'s former <a href="Boatswain">bosun</a>—no such person is recorded in the registered crew list. In this tale, Briggs and his crew are cast in the role of predators; they sight a derelict steamer, which they board and find deserted, with £3,500-worth of gold and silver in its safe. They decide to split the money, abandon "Mary Celeste", and seek new lives in Spain, which they reach by using the steamer's lifeboats. Hastings finds it astonishing that such an unlikely story was, for a time, widely believed; readers, he says "... were fooled by the magic of print."

"Chambers's Journal" of September 17, 1904, suggests that the entire complement of "Mary Celeste" was plucked off one by one by a giant octopus or squid. According to the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum">Natural History Museum</a>, giant squid, or "<a href="Architeuthis%20dux">Architeuthis dux</a>", can reach in length; they have been known to attack ships. Begg remarks that while such a creature could conceivably have picked off a crew member, it could hardly have taken the yawl and the captain's navigation instruments. Other explanations have suggested paranormal intervention; an undated edition of the "British Journal of Astrology" describes the "Mary Celeste" story as "... a mystical experience, connecting it by processes of reasoning beyond the power of ordinary human understanding, with the Great Pyramid of Gizeh, the lost continent of Atlantis, and the <a href="British%20Israelism">British Israel Movement</a>." The <a href="Bermuda%20Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a> has been invoked, even though "Mary Celeste" was abandoned in a completely different part of the Atlantic. Similar fantasies have considered theories of abduction by aliens in flying saucers.

"Mary Celeste" left Genoa on June 26, 1873, and arrived in New York on September 19. The Gibraltar hearings, with newspaper stories of bloodshed and murder, had made her an unpopular ship; Hastings records that she "... rotted on wharves where nobody wanted her." In February 1874, the consortium sold the ship, at a considerable loss, to a partnership of New York businessmen.
Under this new ownership, "Mary Celeste" sailed mainly in the West Indian and Indian Ocean routes, regularly losing money. Details of her movements occasionally appeared in the shipping news; in February 1879, she was reported at the island of <a href="St.%20Helena">St. Helena</a>, where she had called to seek medical assistance for her captain, Edgar Tuthill, who had fallen ill. Tuthill died on the island, encouraging the idea that the ship was cursed—he was her third captain to die prematurely. In February 1880, the owners sold the "Mary Celeste" to a partnership of Bostonians headed by Wesley Gove. A new captain, Thomas L. Fleming, remained in the post until August 1884, when he was replaced by Gilman C. Parker. During these years, the ship's port of registration changed several times, before reverting to Boston. There are no records of her voyages during this time, although Brian Hicks, in his study of the affair, asserts that Gove tried hard to make a success of her.

In November 1884, Parker conspired with a group of Boston shippers, who filled "Mary Celeste" with a largely worthless cargo, misrepresented on the ship's manifest as valuable goods and insured for US$30,000 ($ today). On December 16, Parker set out for <a href="Port-au-Prince">Port-au-Prince</a>, the capital and chief port of Haiti. On January 3, 1885, "Mary Celeste" approached the port via the channel between <a href="Gon%C3%A2ve%20Island">Gonâve Island</a> and the mainland, in which lay a large and well-charted coral reef, the Rochelois Bank. Parker deliberately ran the ship on to this reef, ripping out her bottom and wrecking her beyond repair. He and the crew then rowed themselves ashore, where Parker sold the salvageable cargo for $500 to the American consul, and instituted insurance claims for the alleged value.

When the consul reported that what he had bought was almost worthless, the ship's insurers began a thorough investigation, which soon revealed the truth of the over-insured cargo. In July 1885, Parker and the shippers were tried in Boston for conspiracy to commit insurance fraud. Parker was additionally charged with "wilfully cast[ing] away the ship," a crime known as <a href="barratry%20%28admiralty%20law%29">barratry</a> and at the time carrying the death penalty. The conspiracy case was heard first, but on August 15, the jury announced that they could not agree on a verdict. Some jurors were unwilling to risk prejudicing Parker's forthcoming capital trial by finding him guilty on the conspiracy charge. Rather than ordering an expensive retrial, the judge negotiated an arrangement whereby the defendants withdrew their insurance claims and repaid all they had received. The barratry charge against Parker was deferred, and he was allowed to go free. Nevertheless, his professional reputation was ruined, and he died in poverty three months later. One of his co-defendants went mad, and another committed suicide. Begg observes that "if the court of man could not punish these men ... the curse that had devilled the ship since her first skipper Robert McLellan had died on her maiden voyage could reach beyond the vessel's watery grave and exact its own terrible retribution."

In August 2001, an expedition headed by the marine archaeologist and author <a href="Clive%20Cussler">Clive Cussler</a> announced that they had found the remains of a ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a few pieces of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of "Mary Celeste"s 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the "Mary Celeste" had been found. However, <a href="Dendrochronology">dendrochronological</a> tests carried out by Scott St George of the <a href="Geological%20Survey%20of%20Canada">Geological Survey of Canada</a> showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that would still have been growing in 1894, about ten years after the "Mary Celeste"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s demise.

"Mary Celeste" was not the first reported case of a ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas. <a href="Rupert%20Gould">Rupert Gould</a>, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of these stories, it is the "Mary Celeste" that is remembered; the ship's name, or the misspelt "Marie Celeste", has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.

In October 1955, , a 70-ton motor vessel, disappeared in the South Pacific while traveling between <a href="Samoa">Samoa</a> and <a href="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>, with 25 people on board. The vessel was found a month later, deserted and drifting north of <a href="Vanua%20Levu">Vanua Levu</a>, from its route. None of those aboard was seen again, and a commission of inquiry failed to establish an explanation. David Wright, the affair's principal historian, has described the case as "... a classic marine mystery of "Mary Celeste" proportions."

The "Mary Celeste" story inspired two well-received radio plays in the 1930s, by L. Du Garde Peach and Tim Healey respectively, and a stage version of Peach's play in 1949. Several novels have been published, generally offering natural rather than fantastic explanations. In 1935, the British film company <a href="Hammer%20Film%20Productions">Hammer Film Productions</a> issued "<a href="The%20Mystery%20of%20the%20Mary%20Celeste">The Mystery of the Mary Celeste</a>" (retitled "Phantom Ship" for American audiences), starring <a href="Bela%20Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a> as a deranged sailor. It was not a commercial success, although Begg considers it "a period piece well worth watching." A 1938 short film titled "<a href="The%20Ship%20That%20Died">The Ship That Died</a>" presents dramatizations of a range of theories to explain the abandonment: mutiny, fear of explosion due to alcohol fumes, and the supernatural. The January 24, 1980, episode of the paranormal investigation television series "<a href="In%20Search%20of...%20%28TV%20series%29">In Search of...</a>" focused on the mystery.

Reference is made to the ship in the second season of the BBC TV science fiction series "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>". In the episode "<a href="Flight%20Through%20Eternity">Flight Through Eternity</a>" (1965) <a href="The%20Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">the Doctor</a>'s time machine the <a href="TARDIS">TARDIS</a> materialises on the "Mary Celeste". The pursuing <a href="Dalek">Dalek</a>s also materialise, in their own time machine, causing the terrified crew of "Mary Celeste" to throw themselves into the sea. Both time machines then dematerialise, leaving the ship deserted.

In November 2007, the <a href="Smithsonian%20Channel">Smithsonian Channel</a> screened a documentary, "The True Story of the Mary Celeste", which investigated many aspects of the case without offering any definite solution.

Author John Wallace Spencer, a proponent of the theory of abduction by <a href="Unidentified%20flying%20object">UFOs</a>, appeared on a 1972 episode of the American game show "<a href="To%20Tell%20the%20Truth">To Tell the Truth</a>" in which the Mary Celeste was mistakenly identified as having been abandoned in the <a href="Bermuda%20Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>.

At Spencer's Island, "Mary Celeste" and her lost crew are commemorated by a monument at the site of the brigantine's construction and by a memorial outdoor cinema built in the shape of the vessel's hull. Postage stamps commemorating the incident have been issued by Gibraltar (twice) and by the Maldives (twice, once with the name of the ship misspelt as "Marie Celeste").

Réunion ibis

The Réunion ibis or Réunion sacred ibis ("Threskiornis solitarius") is an <a href="list%20of%20extinct%20birds">extinct</a> <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="ibis">ibis</a> that was <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to the volcanic island of <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> in the Indian Ocean. The first subfossil remains were found in 1974, and the ibis was first scientifically described in 1987. Its closest relatives are the <a href="Malagasy%20sacred%20ibis">Malagasy sacred ibis</a>, the <a href="African%20sacred%20ibis">African sacred ibis</a>, and the <a href="straw-necked%20ibis">straw-necked ibis</a>.

Travellers' accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries described a white bird on Réunion that flew with difficulty and preferred <a href="solitude">solitude</a>, which was subsequently referred to as the Réunion solitaire. In the mid 19th century, the old travellers' accounts were incorrectly assumed to refer to white relatives of the <a href="dodo">dodo</a>, due to one account specifically mentioning dodos on the island, and because 17th-century paintings of white dodos had recently surfaced. However, no fossils referable to dodo-like birds were ever found on Réunion, and it was later questioned whether the paintings had anything to do with the island. Other identities were suggested as well, based only on speculation. In the late 20th century, the discovery of a <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> ibis led to the idea that the old accounts actually referred to an ibis species instead. The idea that the solitaire and the subfossil ibis are identical has only met with limited dissent, and is now widely accepted.

Combined, the old descriptions and subfossils show that the Réunion ibis was mainly white, with this colour merging into yellow and grey. The wing tips and plumes of <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>-like feathers on its rear were black. The neck and legs were long, the beak was relatively straight and short for an ibis. It was more robust in build than its extant relatives, but was otherwise quite similar to them. It would have been no longer than 65 cm (25 in) in length. Subfossil wing-bones indicate it had reduced flight capabilities, a feature perhaps linked to seasonal fattening. The diet of the Réunion ibis was worms and other items foraged from soil. In the 17th century, it lived in mountainous areas, but it may have been confined to these remote heights by heavy hunting by humans and predation by <a href="introduced%20animals">introduced animals</a> in the more accessible areas of the island. Visitors to Réunion praised its flavour, and therefore sought after its flesh. These factors are believed to have driven the Réunion ibis to extinction by the early 18th century.

The taxonomic history of the Réunion ibis is convoluted and complex, due to the ambiguous and meagre evidence that was available to scientists until recently. The supposed "white dodo" of Réunion is now believed to have been an erroneous conjecture based on the few contemporary reports which described the Réunion ibis, combined with paintings of white dodos from Mauritius by the <a href="Dutch%20people">Dutch</a> painters <a href="Pieter%20Withoos">Pieter Withoos</a> and <a href="Pieter%20Holsteyn%20II">Pieter Holsteyn II</a> (and derivatives) from the 17th century that surfaced in the 19th century.

The English Chief Officer John Tatton was the first to mention a specifically white bird on Réunion, in 1625. The French occupied the island from 1646 and onwards, and referred to this bird as the "solitaire". M. Carré of the <a href="French%20East%20Indies%20Company">French East Indies Company</a> described the solitaire in 1699, explaining the reason for its name:

A <a href="marooning">marooned</a> French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a>, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Leguat">François Leguat</a>, used the name "solitaire" for the <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a>, a <a href="Raphine">Raphine</a> bird (related to the dodo) he encountered on the nearby island of <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a> in the 1690s, but it is thought he borrowed the name from a 1689 <a href="Tract%20%28literature%29">tract</a> by Marquis Henri Duquesne which mentioned the Réunion species. Duquesne himself had probably based his own description on an earlier one. No specimens of the solitaire were ever preserved. The two individuals Carré attempted to send to the <a href="Subsidiary%20structures%20of%20the%20Palace%20of%20Versailles">royal menagerie</a> in France did not survive in captivity. Billiard claimed that the French administrator <a href="Bertrand-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mah%C3%A9%20de%20La%20Bourdonnais">Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais</a> sent a "solitaire" to France from Réunion around 1740. Since the Réunion ibis is believed to have gone extinct by this date, the bird may actually have been a Rodrigues solitaire.

The only contemporary writer who referred specifically to "dodos" inhabiting <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> was the Dutch sailor <a href="Willem%20Ysbrandtszoon%20Bontekoe">Willem Ysbrandtszoon Bontekoe</a>, though he did not mention their colouration:

When his journal was published in 1646, it was accompanied by an engraving which is now known to have been copied after one of the dodos in the <a href="Flemish">Flemish</a> painter <a href="Roelant%20Savery">Roelant Savery</a>'s "Crocker Art Gallery sketch". Since Bontekoe was <a href="shipwreck">shipwreck</a>ed and lost all his belongings after visiting Réunion in 1619, he may not have written his account until he returned to <a href="Holland">Holland</a>, seven years later, which would put its reliability in question. He may have concluded in hindsight that it was a dodo, finding what he saw similar to accounts of that bird.

In the 1770s, the French naturalist <a href="Comte%20de%20Buffon">Comte de Buffon</a> stated that the dodo inhabited both <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and Réunion. It is unclear why he included Réunion, but he also combined accounts about the Rodrigues solitaire and a third bird ("oiseau de Nazareth", now thought to be a dodo) under the same section. The English naturalist <a href="Hugh%20Edwin%20Strickland">Hugh Edwin Strickland</a> discussed the old descriptions of the Réunion solitaire in his 1848 book "The Dodo and Its Kindred", and concluded it was distinct from the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire. The Belgian scientist <a href="Edmond%20de%20S%C3%A9lys%20Longchamps">Edmond de Sélys Longchamps</a> coined the <a href="scientific%20name">scientific name</a> "Apterornis solitarius" for the Réunion solitaire in 1848, apparently making it the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus, in which he also included two other <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> birds only known from contemporary accounts, the <a href="red%20rail">red rail</a> and the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20swamphen">Réunion swamphen</a>. As the name "<a href="Apterornis">Apterornis</a>" had already been used for a different bird by the English biologist <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a>, and the other former names were likewise invalid, Bonaparte coined the new <a href="binomial%20name">binomial</a> "Ornithaptera borbonica" in 1854 (<a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a> was the original French name for Réunion). In 1854, the German ornithologist <a href="Hermann%20Schlegel">Hermann Schlegel</a> placed the solitaire in the same genus as the dodo, and named it "Didus apterornis". He restored it strictly according to contemporary accounts, which resulted in an ibis or stork-like bird instead of a dodo. As it was considered <a href="Conspecificity">congeneric</a> with the dodo, the Réunion solitaire was long believed to also be a member of the <a href="Dididae">Dididae</a> family of <a href="Columbidae">pigeons</a>.

In 1856, William Coker announced the discovery of a 17th-century "<a href="Persia">Persia</a>n" painting of a white dodo among <a href="waterfowl">waterfowl</a>, which he had been shown in England. The artist was later identified as Pieter Withoos, and many prominent 19th-century naturalists subsequently assumed the image depicted the white solitaire of Réunion, a possibility originally proposed by ornithologist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a>. Simultaneously, several similar paintings of white dodos by Pieter Holsteyn II were discovered in the Netherlands. In 1869, the English ornithologist <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a> argued that the Withoos' painting and engraving in Bontekoe's memoir depicted a living Réunion dodo that had been brought to Holland, while explaining its blunt beak as a result of <a href="beak%20trimming">beak trimming</a> to prevent it from injuring humans. He also brushed aside the inconsistencies between the illustrations and descriptions, especially the long, thin beak implied by one contemporary account.

Newton's words particularly cemented the validity of this connection among contemporary peers, and several of them expanded on his views. Dutch zoologist <a href="Anthonie%20Cornelis%20Oudemans">Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans</a> suggested that the discrepancies between the paintings and the old descriptions were due to the paintings showing a female, and that the species was therefore <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a>. The British zoologist <a href="Walter%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a> claimed the yellow wings might have been due to <a href="albinism">albinism</a> in this particular specimen, since the old descriptions described these as black. By the early 20th century, many other paintings and even physical remains were claimed to be of white dodos, amid much speculation. Some believed the solitaire of the old descriptions was rather a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire. Rothschild commissioned British artist <a href="Frederick%20William%20Frohawk">Frederick William Frohawk</a> to restore the Réunion solitaire as both a white dodo, based on the Withoos painting, and as a distinct bird based on the French traveller <a href="Sieur%20Dubois">Sieur Dubois</a>' 1674 description, for his 1907 book "<a href="Extinct%20Birds%20%28Rothschild%20book%29">Extinct Birds</a>". In 1953, the Japanese writer <a href="Masauji%20Hachisuka">Masauji Hachisuka</a> went as far as referring to the white dodos of the paintings as "Victoriornis imperialis", and the solitaire of the accounts as "Ornithaptera solitarius".

Until the late 1980s, belief in the existence of a white dodo on Réunion was the orthodox view, and only a few researchers doubted the connection between the solitaire accounts and the dodo paintings. They cautioned that no conclusions could be made without solid evidence such as fossils, and that nothing indicated that the white dodos in the paintings had anything to do with Réunion. In 1970, the American ornithologist <a href="Robert%20W.%20Storer">Robert W. Storer</a> predicted that if any such remains were found, they would not belong to <a href="Raphinae">Raphinae</a>, or even Columbidae.

The first subfossil bird remains on Réunion were found in 1974, and assigned to a <a href="stork">stork</a>, "<a href="Ciconia">Ciconia</a>" sp., by the British ornithologist Graham S. Cowles. The remains were found in a cave, which indicated it had been brought there and eaten by early settlers. It was speculated that the remains could have belonged to a large, mysterious bird described by Leguat, and called "Leguat's giant" by some ornithologists. "Leguat's giant" is now thought to be based on a locally extinct population of <a href="flamingos">flamingos</a>. In 1987, subfossils of a recently extinct species of <a href="ibis">ibis</a> from Réunion were described as "Borbonibis latipes" by the French palaeontologists Cécile Mourer-Chauviré and François Moutou, and thought related to the <a href="bald%20ibises">bald ibises</a> of the genus "Geronticus". In 1994, the "stork" remains were shown to belong to this ibis as well. The 1987 discovery led the English biologist Anthony S. Cheke to suggest to one of the describers of "Borbonibis" that the subfossils may have been of the Réunion solitaire. This suggestion was published by the describers in 1995, and they also reassigned it to the genus "<a href="Threskiornis">Threskiornis</a>", now combined with the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "" from de Sélys-Longchamps' 1848 binomial for the solitaire. The authors pointed out that the contemporary descriptions matched the appearance and behaviour of an ibis more than a member of the Raphinae, especially since a fragment of a comparatively short and straight ibis mandible was discovered in 1994, and because ibis remains were abundant in some localities; it would be strange if contemporary writers never mentioned such a relatively common bird, whereas they mentioned most other species subsequently known from fossils.

The possible origin of the 17th-century white dodo paintings has also recently been examined by the Spanish biologist Arturo Valledor de Lozoya in 2003, and independently by experts of Mascarene fauna Cheke and <a href="Julian%20Hume">Julian Hume</a> in 2004. The Withoos and Holsteyn paintings are clearly derived from each other, and Withoos likely copied his dodo from one of Holsteyn's works, since these were probably produced at an earlier date. All later white dodo pictures are thought to be based on these paintings. According to the aforementioned writers, it appears these pictures were themselves derived from a whitish dodo in a previously unreported painting containing, called "Landscape with Orpheus and the Animals", produced by Roelant Savery c. 1611. The dodo was apparently based on a stuffed specimen then in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>; a "walghvogel" (old Dutch for dodo) described as having a "dirty off-white colouring" was mentioned in an inventory of specimens in the Prague collection of the <a href="Rudolf%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II</a> to whom Savery was contracted at the time (1607–1611). Savery's several later dodo images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had by then seen a normal specimen. Cheke and Hume concluded the painted specimen was white due to albinism, and that this peculiar feature was the reason it was collected from Mauritius and brought to Europe. Valledor de Lozoya instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of bleaching of old taxidermy specimens, or simply due to artistic license. In 2018, the British ornithologist Jolyon C. Parish and Cheke suggested that the painting was instead executed after 1614, or even after 1626, based on some of the motifs.

No fossil remains of dodo-like birds have ever been found on Réunion. A few later sources take issue with the proposed ibis-identity of the solitaire, and have even regarded the "white dodo" as a valid species. The British writer <a href="Errol%20Fuller">Errol Fuller</a> agrees that the 17th-century paintings do not depict Réunion birds, but has questioned whether the ibis subfossils are necessarily connected to the solitaire accounts. He notes that no evidence indicates the extinct ibis survived until the time Europeans reached Réunion. Cheke and Hume have dismissed such sentiments as being mere "belief" and "hope" in the existence of a dodo on the island.

The volcanic island of Réunion is only three million years old, whereas Mauritius and Rodrigues, with each of their flightless Raphine species, are eight to ten million years old, and it is unlikely that either bird would have been capable of flying after five or more million years of adapting to the islands. Therefore, it is unlikely that Réunion could have been colonised by flightless birds from these islands, and only flighted species on the island have relatives there. Three million years is enough time for flightless and weak flying abilities to have evolved in bird species on Réunion itself. But such species would have been wiped out by the eruption of the <a href="volcano">volcano</a> <a href="Piton%20des%20Neiges">Piton des Neiges</a> between 300,000 and 180,000 years ago. Most recent species would therefore likely be descendants of animals which had recolonised the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event, which is not enough time for a bird to become flightless.

In 1995, a morphological study by Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues suggested the closest extant relatives of the Réunion ibis are the <a href="African%20sacred%20ibis">African sacred ibis</a> ("T. aethiopicus") of Africa and the <a href="straw-necked%20ibis">straw-necked ibis</a> ("T. spinicollis") of Australia. It has also been suggested that it was closest to the <a href="Malagasy%20sacred%20ibis">Malagasy sacred ibis</a> ("T. bernieri"), and therefore of ultimately African origin.

Contemporary accounts described the species as having white and grey plumage merging into yellow, black wing tips and tail feathers, a long neck and legs, and limited flight capabilities. Dubois' 1674 account is the most detailed contemporary description of the bird, here as translated by Strickland in 1848:
According to Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues, the plumage colouration mentioned is similar to that of the related African sacred ibis and straw-necked ibis, which are also mainly white and glossy black. In the reproductive season, the ornamental feathers on the back and wing tips of the African sacred ibis look similar to the feathers of an <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>, which echoes Dubois' description. Likewise, a subfossil lower jaw found in 1994 showed that the bill of the Réunion ibis was relatively short and straight for an ibis, which corresponds with Dubois' <a href="woodcock">woodcock</a> comparison. Cheke and Hume have suggested that the French word ("bécasse") from Dubois' original description, usually translated to "woodcock", could also mean <a href="oystercatcher">oystercatcher</a>, another bird with a long, straight, but slightly more robust, bill. They have also pointed out that the last sentence is mistranslated, and actually means the bird could be caught by running after it. The bright colouration of the plumage mentioned by some authors may refer to <a href="iridescence">iridescence</a>, as seen in the straw-necked ibis.

Subfossils of the Réunion ibis show that it was more robust, likely much heavier, and had a larger head than the African sacred and straw-necked ibises. It was nonetheless similar to them in most features. According to Hume, it would have been no longer than 65 cm (25 in) in length, the size of the African sacred ibis. Rough protuberances on the wing bones of the Réunion ibis are similar to those of birds that use their wings in combat. It was perhaps flightless, but this has not left significant <a href="osteological">osteological</a> traces; no complete skeletons have been collected, but of the known <a href="Chest">pectoral</a> elements, only one feature indicates reduction in flight capability. The <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> is elongated and the <a href="radius">radius</a> and <a href="ulna">ulna</a> are robust, as in flighted birds, but a particular <a href="foramen">foramen</a> (or opening) between a <a href="metacarpal">metacarpal</a> and the <a href="alular">alular</a> is otherwise only known from flightless birds, such as some <a href="ratites">ratites</a>, <a href="penguins">penguins</a>, and several extinct species.

As contemporary accounts are inconsistent on whether the solitaire was flightless or had some flight capability, Mourer-Chauvire and colleagues suggested that this was dependent on seasonal fat-cycles, meaning that individuals fattened themselves during cool seasons, but were slim during hot seasons; perhaps it could not fly when it was fat, but could when it was not. However, Dubois specifically stated the solitaires did not have fat-cycles, unlike most other Réunion birds. The only mention of its diet and exact habitat is the account of the French cartographer <a href="Jean%20Feuilley">Jean Feuilley</a> from 1708, which is also the last record of a living individual:

The diet and mode of <a href="foraging">foraging</a> described by Feuilley matches that of an ibis, whereas members of the Raphinae are known to have been <a href="frugivorous">fruit eaters</a>. The species was termed a land-bird by Dubois, so it did not live in typical ibis habitats such as <a href="wetlands">wetlands</a>. It has been proposed that this is because the ancestors of the bird colonised Réunion before swamps had developed, and had therefore become adapted to the available habitats. They were perhaps prevented from colonising Mauritius as well due to the presence of red rails there, which may have occupied a similar niche. It appears to have lived in high altitudes, and perhaps had a limited distribution. Accounts by early visitors indicate the species was found near their landing sites, but they were found only in remote places by 1667. The bird may have survived in eastern lowlands until the 1670s. Though many late 17th century accounts state the bird was good food, Feuilley stated it tasted bad. This may be because it changed its diet when it moved to more rugged, higher terrain, to escape pigs that destroyed its nests; since it had limited flight capabilities, it probably nested on the ground.

Many other <a href="endemic%20species">endemic species</a> of Réunion became extinct after the arrival of man and the resulting disruption of the island's <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>. The Réunion ibis lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the <a href="hoopoe%20starling">hoopoe starling</a>, the <a href="Mascarene%20parrot">Mascarene parrot</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20parakeet">Réunion parakeet</a>, the Réunion swamphen, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20owl">Réunion owl</a>, the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20night%20heron">Réunion night heron</a>, and the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20pink%20pigeon">Réunion pink pigeon</a>. Extinct reptiles include the <a href="R%C3%A9union%20giant%20tortoise">Réunion giant tortoise</a> and an undescribed "<a href="Leiolopisma">Leiolopisma</a>" skink. The <a href="small%20Mauritian%20flying%20fox">small Mauritian flying fox</a> and the snail "<a href="Tropidophora%20carinata">Tropidophora carinata</a>" lived on Réunion and Mauritius, but vanished from both islands.

As Réunion was populated by settlers, the Réunion ibis appears to have become confined to the tops of mountains. Introduced predators such as cats and rats took a toll. Overhunting also contributed and several contemporary accounts state the bird was widely hunted for food. In 1625, John Tatton described the <a href="island%20tameness">tameness</a> of the bird and how easy it was to hunt, as well as the large quantity consumed:
In 1671, Melet mentioned the culinary quality of this species, and described the slaughter of several types of birds on the island:

The last definite account of the "solitaire" of Réunion was Feuilley's from 1708, indicating that the species probably became extinct sometime early in the century. In the 1820s, the French navigator <a href="Louis%20de%20Freycinet">Louis de Freycinet</a> asked an old slave about "drontes" (old Dutch word for dodo), and was told the bird existed around <a href="Saint-Joseph%2C%20R%C3%A9union">Saint-Joseph</a> when his father was an infant. This would perhaps be a century earlier, but the account may be unreliable. Cheke and Hume suspect that feral cats initially hunted wildlife in the lowlands and later turned to higher inland areas, which were probably the last stronghold of the Réunion ibis, as they were unreachable by pigs. The species is thought to have been driven to extinction around 1710–1715.

King vulture

The king vulture ("Sarcoramphus papa") is a large <a href="bird">bird</a> found in <a href="Central%20America">Central</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>. It is a member of the <a href="New%20World%20vulture">New World vulture</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Cathartidae">Cathartidae</a>. This vulture lives predominantly in tropical lowland forests stretching from southern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> to northern <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. It is the only surviving member of the genus Sarcoramphus, although fossil members are known.

Large and predominantly white, the king vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail <a href="feather">feather</a>s. The head and neck are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy <a href="Wattle%20%28anatomy%29">caruncle</a> on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures have been known to live for up to 30 years in captivity.

King vultures were popular figures in the <a href="Mayan%20codices">Mayan codices</a> as well as in local folklore and medicine. Although currently listed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>, they are decreasing in number, due primarily to <a href="habitat%20loss">habitat loss</a>.

The king vulture was originally described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in 1758 in the <a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">tenth edition</a> of his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" as "Vultur papa", the type specimen originally collected in <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>. It was reassigned to the genus "Sarcoramphus" in 1805 by French zoologist <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Marie%20Constant%20Dum%C3%A9ril">André Marie Constant Duméril</a>. The generic name is a <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a> compound formed from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words σάρξ ("sarx", "flesh", the combining form of which is σαρκο-) and ῥάμφος ("rhamphos", "crooked beak of bird of prey"). The genus name is often misspelled as "Sarcorhamphus", improperly retaining the Greek <a href="rough%20breathing">rough breathing</a> despite <a href="agglutination">agglutination</a> with the previous word-element. The bird was also assigned to the genus "Gyparchus" by <a href="Constantin%20Wilhelm%20Lambert%20Gloger">Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger</a> in 1841, but this classification is not used in modern literature since "Sarcoramphus" has priority as the earlier name. The species name is derived from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "papa" "bishop", alluding the bird's plumage resembling the clothing of one. The king vulture's closest living relative is the <a href="Andean%20condor">Andean condor</a>, "Vultur gryphus". Some authors have even put these species in a separate subfamily from the other New World vultures, though most authors consider this subdivision unnecessary.

There are two theories on how the king vulture earned the "king" part of its common name. The first is that the name is a reference to its habit of displacing smaller vultures from a carcass and eating its fill while they wait. An alternative theory reports that the name is derived from <a href="Maya%20civilization">Mayan</a> legends, in which the bird was a king who served as a messenger between humans and the gods. This bird was also known as the "white crow" by the <a href="Spain">Spanish</a> in <a href="Paraguay">Paraguay</a>. It was called "cozcacuauhtli" in <a href="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a>, derived from "cozcatl" "collar" and "cuauhtli" "bird of prey".

The exact <a href="systematics">systematic</a> placement of the king vulture and the remaining six species of <a href="New%20World%20vulture">New World vulture</a>s remains unclear. Though both are similar in appearance and have similar <a href="Ecological%20niche">ecological roles</a>, the New World and <a href="Old%20World%20vultures">Old World vultures</a> evolved from different ancestors in different parts of the world. Just how different the two are is currently under debate, with some earlier authorities suggesting that the New World vultures are more closely related to <a href="storks">storks</a>. More recent authorities maintain their overall position in the order <a href="Falconiformes">Falconiformes</a> along with the Old World vultures or place them in their own order, Cathartiformes. The <a href="South%20American%20Classification%20Committee">South American Classification Committee</a> has removed the New World vultures from <a href="Ciconiiformes">Ciconiiformes</a> and instead placed them in "<a href="Incertae%20sedis">Incertae sedis</a>", but notes that a move to Falconiformes or Cathartiformes is possible. Like other New World vultures, the king vulture has a diploid chromosome number of 80.

The genus "Sarcoramphus", which today contains only the king vulture, had a wider distribution in the past. The Kern vulture ("Sarcoramphus kernense"), lived in southwestern <a href="North%20America">North America</a> during the mid-<a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> (<a href="Piacenzian">Piacenzian</a>), some 3.5–2.5 million years ago). It was a little-known component of the <a href="Blancan">Blancan</a>/<a href="Delmontian">Delmontian</a> <a href="faunal%20stage">faunal stage</a>s. The only material is a broken <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Proximal%20and%20distal">distal</a> <a href="humerus">humerus</a> <a href="fossil">fossil</a>, found at <a href="Pozo%20Creek">Pozo Creek</a>, <a href="Kern%20County%2C%20California">Kern County, California</a>. As per <a href="Loye%20H.%20Miller">Loye H. Miller</a>'s original description, "[c]ompared with ["S. papa"] the <a href="type%20%28biology%29">type</a> conforms in general form and curvature except for its greater size and robustness." The large span in time between the existence of the two species suggests that the Kern vulture might be distinct, but as the fossil is somewhat damaged and rather non-diagnostic, even assignment to this genus is not completely certain. During the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a>, another species probably assignable to the genus, "Sarcoramphus fisheri", occurred in <a href="Peru">Peru</a>. A supposed king vulture relative from <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> cave deposits on <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> turned out to be bones of the <a href="eagle">eagle</a>-sized <a href="hawk">hawk</a> "<a href="Buteogallus%20borrasi">Buteogallus borrasi</a>" (formerly in "Titanohierax").

Little can be said of the <a href="evolution">evolution</a>ary history of the genus, mainly because remains of other <a href="Neogene">Neogene</a> New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The <a href="teratorn">teratorn</a>s held sway over the <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a> of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the <a href="Great%20American%20Interchange">Great American Interchange</a>, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the "S. fisheri – S. papa" lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports the theory that the ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>.

A "painted vulture" ("Sarcoramphus sacra" or "S. papa sacra") is described in <a href="William%20Bartram">William Bartram</a>'s notes of his travels in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> during the 1770s. This bird's description matches the appearance of the king vulture except that it had a white, not black, tail. Bartram describes the bird as being relatively common and even claimed to have collected one. However, no other naturalists record the painted vulture in Florida and sixty years after the sighting its validity began to be questioned, leading to what <a href="John%20Cassin">John Cassin</a> described as the most inviting problem in North American ornithology. An independent account and painting was made of a similar bird by <a href="Eleazar%20Albin">Eleazar Albin</a> in 1734.

While most early ornithologists defended Bartram's honesty, <a href="Joel%20Asaph%20Allen">Joel Asaph Allen</a> argued that the painted vulture was mythical and that Bartram mixed elements of different species to create this bird. Allen pointed out that the birds' behavior, as recorded by Bartram, is in complete agreement with the <a href="caracara">caracara</a>'s. For example, Bartram observed the birds following <a href="wildfire">wildfire</a>s to scavenge for burned insects and <a href="box%20turtle">box turtle</a>s. Such behavior is typical of caracaras, but the larger and shorter-legged king vultures are not well adapted for walking. The <a href="northern%20crested%20caracara">northern crested caracara</a> ("Caracara cheriway") was believed to be common and conspicuous in Bartram's days, but it is notably absent from Bartram's notes if the painted vulture is accepted as a "Sarcoramphus". However, <a href="Francis%20Harper%20%28biologist%29">Francis Harper</a> argued that the bird could, as in the 1930s, have been rare in the area Bartram visited and could have been missed.

Harper noticed that Bartram's notes were considerably altered and expanded in the printed edition, and the detail of the white tail appeared in print for the first time in this revised account. Harper believed that Bartram could have tried to fill in details of the bird from memory and got the tail coloration wrong. Harper and several other researchers have attempted to prove the former existence of a king vulture relative in Florida at this late date, suggesting that the population was in the process of <a href="extinct">extinct</a>ion and finally disappeared during a cold spell. Additionally, William McAtee, noting the tendency of birds to form Floridian subspecies, suggested that the white tail could be a sign that the painted vulture was a subspecies of the king vulture.

Excluding the two species of <a href="condor">condor</a>s, the king vulture is the largest of the New World vultures. Its overall length ranges from and its wingspan is . Its weight ranges from . An imposing bird, the adult king vulture has predominantly white plumage, which has a slight rose-yellow tinge to it. In stark contrast, the wing coverts, flight feathers and tail are dark grey to black, as is the prominent thick neck ruff. The head and neck are devoid of feathers, the skin shades of red and purple on the head, vivid orange on the neck and yellow on the throat. On the head, the skin is wrinkled and folded, and there is a highly noticeable irregular golden crest attached on the <a href="cere">cere</a> above its orange and black bill; this <a href="wattle%20%28anatomy%29">caruncle</a> does not fully form until the bird’s fourth year.

The king vulture has, relative to its size, the largest skull and braincase, and strongest bill of the New World vultures. This bill has a hooked tip and a sharp cutting edge. The bird has broad wings and a short, broad, and square tail. The <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a> of its eyes are white and bordered by bright red <a href="sclera">sclera</a>. Unlike some New World vultures, the king vulture lacks eyelashes. It also has gray legs and long, thick claws.
The vulture is minimally <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>, with no difference in plumage and little in size between males and females. The juvenile vulture has a dark bill and eyes, and a downy, gray neck that soon begins to turn the orange of an adult. Younger vultures are a slate gray overall, and, while they look similar to the adult by the third year, they do not completely molt into adult plumage until they are around five or six years of age. Jack Eitniear of the Center for the Study of Tropical Birds in San Antonio, Texas reviewed the plumage of birds in captivity of various ages and found that ventral feathers were the first to begin turning white from two years of age onwards, followed by wing feathers, until the full adult plumage was achieved. The final immature stages being a scattered black feathers in the otherwise white lesser wing coverts.

The vulture's head and neck are featherless as an adaptation for hygiene, though there are black bristles on parts of the head; this lack of feathers prevents <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> from the <a href="carrion">carrion</a> it eats from ruining its feathers and exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of the sun.

Dark-plumaged immature birds may be confused with turkey vultures, but soar with flat wings, while the pale plumaged adults could feasibly be confused with the <a href="wood%20stork">wood stork</a>, although the latter's long neck and legs allow for easy recognition from afar.

The king vulture inhabits an estimated between southern <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and northern <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. In <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, it does not live west of the <a href="Andes">Andes</a>, except in western <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, north-western <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> and far north-western <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>. It primarily inhabits undisturbed <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20moist%20broadleaf%20forests">tropical lowland forests</a> as well as <a href="savanna">savanna</a>s and <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s with these forests nearby. It is often seen near <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s or marshy places in the forests. This bird is often the most numerous or only vulture present in primary lowland forests in its range, but in the <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon rainforest</a> it is typically outnumbered by the <a href="greater%20yellow-headed%20vulture">greater yellow-headed vulture</a>, while typically outnumbered by the <a href="lesser%20yellow-headed%20vulture">lesser yellow-headed</a>, <a href="turkey%20vulture">turkey</a> and <a href="American%20black%20vulture">American black vulture</a> in more open habitats. King vultures generally do not live above , although are found in places at altitude east of the Andes, and have been rarely recorded up to They inhabit the emergent forest level, or above the canopy. Pleistocene remains have been recovered from <a href="Buenos%20Aires%20Province">Buenos Aires Province</a> in central Argentina, over south of its current range, giving rise to speculation on the habitat there at the time which had not been thought to be suitable.

The king vulture soars for hours effortlessly, only flapping its wings infrequently. While in flight, its wings are held flat with slightly raised tips, and from a distance the vulture can appear to be headless while in flight. Its wing beats are deep and strong. Birds have been observed engaging in tandem flight on two occasions in Venezuela by naturalist Marsha Schlee, who has proposed it could be a part of courtship behaviour.

Despite its size and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite inconspicuous when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is <a href="bird%20migration">non-migratory</a> and, unlike the <a href="turkey%20vulture">turkey</a>, <a href="lesser%20yellow-headed%20vulture">lesser yellow-headed</a> and <a href="American%20black%20vulture">American black vulture</a>, it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses <a href="urohidrosis">urohidrosis</a>, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a <a href="Syrinx%20%28biology%29">voice box</a>, although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are <a href="snake">snake</a>s, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as <a href="jaguar">jaguar</a>s, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.

The reproductive behaviour of the king vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the <a href="M%C3%A9nagerie%20du%20Jardin%20des%20Plantes">Paris Menagerie</a>. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is about four or five years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. A king vulture mates for life and generally lays a single unmarked white <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">egg</a> in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-<a href="altricial">altricial</a>—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on their toes by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.

The king vulture eats anything from cattle carcasses to beached fish and dead lizards. Principally a carrion eater, there are isolated reports of it killing and eating injured animals, newborn calves and small lizards. Although it locates food by vision, the role smell has in how it specifically finds carrion has been debated. Consensus has been that it does not detect odours, and instead follows the smaller <a href="turkey%20vulture">turkey</a> and <a href="greater%20yellow-headed%20vulture">greater yellow-headed vulture</a>s, which do have a sense of smell, to a carcass, but a 1991 study demonstrated that the king vulture could find carrion in the forest without the aid of other vultures, suggesting that it locates food using an <a href="Olfaction">olfactory</a> sense. The king vulture primarily eats carrion found in the forest, though it is known to venture onto nearby savannas in search of food. Once it has found a carcass, the king vulture displaces the other vultures because of its large size and strong bill. However, when it is at the same kill as the larger <a href="Andean%20condor">Andean condor</a>, the king vulture always defers to it. Using its bill to tear, it makes the initial cut in a fresh carcass. This allows the smaller, weaker-beaked vultures, which can not open the hide of a carcass, access to the carcass after the king vulture has fed. The vulture’s tongue is <a href="rasp">rasp</a>-like, which allows it to pull flesh off of the carcass’s bones. Generally, it only eats the skin and harder parts of the tissue of its meal. The king vulture has also been recorded eating fallen fruit of the <a href="moriche%20palm">moriche palm</a> when carrion is scarce in <a href="Bol%C3%ADvar%20%28state%29">Bolívar state</a>, Venezuela.

This bird is a species of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> to the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a>, with an estimated range of and between 10,000 and 100,000 wild individuals. However, there is evidence that suggests a decline in population, though it is not significant enough to cause it to be listed. This decline is due primarily to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and <a href="poaching">poaching</a>. Although distinctive, its habit of perching in tall trees and flying at altitude render it difficult to monitor.

The king vulture is one of the most common species of birds represented in the <a href="Maya%20codices">Maya codices</a>. Its <a href="glyph">glyph</a> is easily distinguishable by the knob on the bird's beak and by the concentric circles that make up the bird's eyes. Sometimes the bird is portrayed as a god with a human body and a bird head. According to Maya mythology, this god often carried messages between humans and the other gods. It may also be used to represent <a href="Cozcacuauhtli">Cozcacuauhtli</a>, the thirteenth day of the month in the <a href="Aztec%20calendar">Aztec calendar</a> (13 Reed). An <a href="ocellated%20turkey">ocellated turkey</a> ("Meleagris ocellata") was also considered to be the bird depicted, but the hooked bill and wattle point to the raptor.

The bird's blood and feathers were also used to cure diseases. The king vulture is also a popular subject on the stamps of the countries within its range. It appeared on a stamp for <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a> in 1963, <a href="Belize">Belize</a> in 1978, <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> in 1979, <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> in 1997, <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a> in 1998, and <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> in 1999.

Because of its large size and beauty, the king vulture is an attraction at zoos around the world. The king vulture is one of several bird species with an <a href="Association%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquariums">AZA</a> studbook, which is kept by Shelly Collinsworth of the <a href="Fort%20Worth%20Zoo">Fort Worth Zoo</a>.

As in its predecessor, "<a href="System%20Shock">System Shock</a>", gameplay in "System Shock 2" is an amalgamation of the <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing game</a> and <a href="survival%20horror">survival horror</a> genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a <a href="Role-playing%20game%20system">role-playing system</a> allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person view</a> and complemented with a <a href="HUD%20%28computer%20gaming%29">heads-up display</a> that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a <a href="drag%20and%20drop">drag and drop</a> inventory.

The <a href="backstory">backstory</a> is explained progressively through the player's acquisition of audio logs and encounters with ghostly <a href="Apparitional%20experience">apparitions</a>. At the beginning of the game, the player chooses a career in a branch of the Unified National Nominate, a fictional military organization. Each branch of service gives the player a set of starting bonuses composed of certain skills, though may thereafter freely develop as the player chooses. The <a href="Marine%20%28military%29">Marine</a> begins with bonuses to weaponry, the <a href="Navy">Navy</a> officer is skilled in repairing and <a href="Hacker%20%28computer%20security%29">hacking</a>, and the OSA agent gets a starting set of <a href="Psionics">psionic</a> powers.

The player can upgrade their skills by using "cyber-modules" given as rewards for completing objectives such as searching the ship and then spend them at devices called "cyber-upgrade units" to obtain enhanced skills. Operating system (O/S) units allow one-time character upgrades to be made (e.g. permanent health enhancement). An in-game currency called "nanites" may be spent on items at vending machines, including ammunition supplies and health packs. "Quantum Bio-Reconstruction Machines" can be activated and reconstitute the player for 10 nanites if they die inside the area in which the machine resides. Otherwise, the game ends and progress must be resumed from a <a href="Saved%20game">save point</a>. The player can hack devices, such as keypads to open alternate areas and vending machines to reduce prices. When a hack is attempted, a <a href="minigame">minigame</a> begins that features a grid of green nodes; the player must connect three in a straight row to succeed. Optionally, electronic <a href="Lock%20picking">lock picks</a>, called "<a href="Intrusion%20Countermeasures%20Electronics">ICE</a>-picks", can be found that will automatically hack a machine, regardless of its difficulty.

Throughout the game, the player can procure various weapons, including melee weapons, pistols, shotguns, and alien weapons. Non-melee weapons degrade with use and will break if they are not regularly repaired with maintenance tools. There are a variety of ammunition types, each of which is most damaging to a specific enemy. For example, organic enemies are vulnerable to <a href="Anti-personnel%20weapon">anti-personnel rounds</a>, while mechanical foes are weak against <a href="Kinetic%20energy%20penetrator">armor-piercing rounds</a>. Similarly, energy weapons cause the most damage against robots and cyborgs, and the annelid-made exotic weaponry is particularly harmful to organic targets. Because ammunition is scarce, to be effective the player must use it sparingly and carefully search rooms for supplies.

The game includes a research function. When new objects are encountered in the game, especially enemies, their organs can be collected and, when combined with chemicals found in storage rooms, the player can research the enemies and thus improve their damage against them. Similarly, some exotic weapons and items can only be used after being researched. OSA agents effectively have a separate weapons tree available to them. Psionic powers can be learned, such as invisibility, fireballs, and teleportation.

In 2072, after the <a href="System%20Shock">Citadel Station's demise</a>, TriOptimum's attempts to cover up the incident were exposed to the media and the corporation was brought up on charges from multiple individuals and companies for the ensuing scandal. The virus developed there killed the station's population; the ruthless malevolent <a href="artificial%20intelligence">A.I supercomputer</a> named <a href="SHODAN">SHODAN</a> controlled, and eventually destroyed the Citadel Station in hopes of enslaving and destroying humanity. After a massive number of trials, the company went bankrupt and their operations were shut down. The United Nations Nominate (UNN), a <a href="United%20Nations">UN</a> successor, was established to combat the malevolence and corruption of power-hungry corporations, including TriOptimum. Artificial intelligence was reduced to most rudimentary tasks in order to prevent the creation of another SHODAN-like malevolent AI, and development of new technologies was halted. Meanwhile, the hacker, who became the most famous person in the world, vanished from public eye.

In 2100, 28 years later, the company's failed stocks and assets were bought by a <a href="Russian%20oligarch">Russian oligarch</a> named Anatoly Korenchkin, a former black market operator who sought to make money in legitimate ways. He re-licensed and restored the company to its former status in the following decade. Along with producing healthcare and consumer products, Korenchkin signed weapons contracts with various military organizations, private and political-owned. The new UNN was almost virtually powerless with Korenchkin exercising control over them.

In January 2114, 42 years after the Citadel events and 12 years into rebuilding TriOptimum, the company created an experimental <a href="faster-than-light">FTL</a> <a href="starship">starship</a>, the "Von Braun", which is now on its maiden voyage. The ship is also followed by a UNN space vessel, the "Rickenbacker", which is controlled by Captain William Bedford Diego, son of Edward Diego, the Citadel Station's infamous commander and public hero of the Battle of the Boston Harbor during the Eastern States Police Action. Because the "Rickenbacker" does not have an FTL system of its own, the two ships are attached for the trip. However, Korenchkin was egotistical enough to make himself the captain of the "Von Braun" despite being inexperienced.

In July 2114, 5 months into the journey, the ships respond to a <a href="distress%20signal">distress signal</a> from the planet Tau Ceti V, outside the Solar System. A rescue team is sent to the planet's surface where they discover strange eggs; these eggs, found in an old ejection pod, infect the rescue team and integrate them into an alien communion known as "the Many" - a psychic hive mind generated by parasitic worms which can infect and mutate a human host. The parasites eventually spread to both ships and take over or kill most of their crews.

Owing to a computer malfunction, the remaining soldier awakens with <a href="amnesia">amnesia</a> in a <a href="Cryonics">cryo-tube</a> on the medical deck of the "Von Braun", being implanted with an illegal cyber-neural interface. He is immediately contacted by another survivor, Dr. Janice Polito, who guides him to safety before the <a href="cabin%20pressurization%23Loss%20of%20pressurization">cabin depressurizes</a>. She demands that he meets her on deck 4 of the Von Braun. Along the way, the soldier battles the infected crew members. The Many also telepathically communicate with him, attempting to convince him to join them. After restarting the ship's engine core, the soldier reaches deck 4 and discovers that Polito is dead. He is then confronted by SHODAN. It is revealed she has been posing as Polito to gain the soldier's trust.

SHODAN mentions that she is responsible for creating the Many through her bioengineering experiments on Citadel Station. The <a href="Hacker%20%28computer%20security%29">Hacker</a>, who created her, ejected the grove that contained her experiments to prevent them contaminating Earth, an act that allowed part of SHODAN to survive in the grove. The grove crash-landed on <a href="Tau%20Ceti">Tau Ceti</a> V. While SHODAN went into forced hibernation, The Many evolved beyond her control. SHODAN tells the soldier that his only chance for survival lies in helping destroy her creations. Efforts to regain control of XERXES, the main computer on the "Von Braun", fail. SHODAN informs the soldier that destroying the ship is their only option, but he must transmit her program to the "Rickenbacker" first. While en route, the soldier briefly encounters two survivors, Thomas "Tommy" Suarez and Rebecca Siddons, who flee the ship aboard an escape pod.

With the transfer complete, the soldier travels to the "Rickenbacker" and learns both ships have been enveloped by the infection's source, a gigantic mass of bio-organic tissue that has wrapped itself over the two ships. The soldier enters the biomass and destroys its core, stopping the infection. SHODAN congratulates him and tells of her intentions to merge real space and cyberspace through the "Von Braun's" faster-than-light drive. The soldier confronts SHODAN in <a href="cyberspace">cyberspace</a> and defeats her. The final scene shows Tommy and Rebecca receiving a message from the "Von Braun". Tommy responds, saying they will return and noting that Rebecca is acting strange. Rebecca is shown speaking in a SHODAN-like voice, asking Tommy if he "likes her new look", as the screen fades to black.

Development of "System Shock 2" began in 1997 when <a href="Looking%20Glass%20Studios">Looking Glass Studios</a> approached <a href="Irrational%20Games">Irrational Games</a> with an idea to co-develop a new game. The development team were fans of "System Shock" and sought to create a similar game. Early story ideas were similar to the novella "<a href="Heart%20of%20Darkness">Heart of Darkness</a>". In an early draft, the player was tasked with assassinating an insane commander on a starship. The original title of the game, according to its pitch document, was "Junction Point". The philosophy of the design was to continue to develop the concept of a dungeon crawler, like "", in a science fiction setting, the basis for "System Shock". However, the press mistook "System Shock" to be closer to a "<a href="Doom%20%28series%29">Doom</a>" clone which was cited for poor financial success of "System Shock". With "Junction Point", the goal was to add in significant role-playing elements and a persistent storyline as to distance the game from "Doom".

The title took 18 months to create with a budget of $1.7 million and was pitched to several publishers until <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a>—who owned the rights to the "Shock" franchise—responded by suggesting the game become a sequel to "System Shock". The development team agreed; Electronic Arts became the publisher and story changes were made to incorporate the franchise. The project was allotted one year to be completed and to compensate for the short time frame, the staff began working with Looking Glass Studio's unfinished <a href="Dark%20Engine">Dark Engine</a>, the same engine used to create "".

The designers included role-playing elements in the game. Similar to "<a href="Ultima%20Underworld">Ultima Underworld</a>", another Looking Glass Studios project, the environment in "System Shock 2" is <a href="persistent%20world">persistent</a> and constantly changes without the player's presence. <a href="Paper-and-pencil%20game">Paper-and-pencil</a> <a href="role-playing%20games">role-playing games</a> were influential; the character customization system was based on "<a href="Traveller%20%28role-playing%20game%29">Traveller</a>"s methodology and was implemented in the fictional military branches which, by allowing multiple character paths, the player could receive a more open-ended gameplay experience. <a href="Horror%20and%20terror">Horror</a> was a key focus and four major points were identified to successfully incorporate it. Isolation was deemed primary, which resulted in the player having little physical contact with other sentient beings. Secondly, a vulnerability was created by focusing on a fragile character. Last were the inclusion of moody sound effects and "the intelligent placement of lighting and shadows". The game's lead designer, Ken Levine, oversaw the return of "System Shock" villain SHODAN. Part of Levine's design was to ally the player with her, as he believed that game characters were too trusting, stating "good guys are good, bad guys are bad. What you see and perceive is real". Levine sought to challenge this notion by having SHODAN betray the player: "Sometimes characters are betrayed, but the "player" never is. I wanted to violate that trust and make the player feel that "they", and not [only] the character, were led on and deceived". This design choice was controversial with the development team.

Several problems were encountered during the project. Because the team comprised two software companies, tension emerged regarding job assignments and some developers left the project. Additionally, many employees were largely inexperienced, but in retrospect project manager Jonathan Chey felt this was advantageous, stating "inexperience also bred enthusiasm and commitment that might not have been present with a more jaded set of developers." The Dark Engine posed problems of its own. It was unfinished, forcing the programmers to fix <a href="software%20bug">software bug</a>s when encountered. In contrast, working closely with the <a href="source%20code">engine code</a> allowed them to write additional features. Not all setbacks were localized; a demonstration build at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> was hindered when it was requested all guns be removed from the presentation due to then-recent <a href="Columbine%20High%20School%20massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a>.

A <a href="Game%20demo">demo</a> for the game, featuring a tutorial and a third of the first mission, was released on August 2, 1999. Nine days later, "System Shock 2" was shipped to retailers. An enhancement <a href="Patch%20%28computing%29">patch</a> was released a month later and added significant features, such as <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">co-operative multiplayer</a> and control over weapon degradation and enemy <a href="Spawning%20%28computer%20gaming%29">respawn</a> rates. A port was planned for the <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> but was canceled.

Around 2000, with the <a href="End-of-life%20%28product%29">end-of-support</a> for the game by the developer and publisher, remaining bugs and <a href="Software%20incompatibility">compatibility</a> with newer <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s and hardware became a growing problem. To compensate the missing support, some fans of the game became active in the <a href="Mod%20%28computer%20gaming%29">modding</a> community to update the game. For instance, the "Rebirth" graphical enhancement <a href="Mod%20%28computer%20gaming%29">mod</a> replaced many <a href="Low%20poly">low-polygonal</a> <a href="3D%20modeling">models</a> with higher quality ones, a "Shock Texture Upgrade Project" increased the <a href="image%20resolution">resolution</a> of <a href="Texture%20mapping">textures</a>, and an updated <a href="level%20editor">level editor</a> was released by the <a href="user%20community">user community</a>. In 2009, a complete copy of "System Shock 2"s <a href="Dark%20Engine">Dark Engine</a> <a href="source%20code">source code</a> was discovered in the possession of an ex-Looking Glass Studios employee who was at the time continuing his work for <a href="Eidos%20Interactive">Eidos Interactive</a>. In late April 2010, a user on the Dreamcast Talk forum disassembled the contents of a <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> <a href="development%20kit">development kit</a> he had purchased. In 2012 several <a href="Community%20patch">unofficial updates</a> for "System Shock 2" (and other Dark Engine-based games) were published.

The <a href="intellectual%20property">intellectual property</a> (IP) rights of "System Shock 2" were caught for years in complications between Electronic Arts and Meadowbrook Insurance Group (the parent company of Star Insurance Company), the entity that acquired the assets of Looking Glass Studios on their closure, though according to a lawyer for Star Insurance, they themselves have since acquired the lingering intellectual property rights from EA.

In October 2012 Stephen Kick of <a href="Night%20Dive%20Studios">Night Dive Studios</a>, seeking to bring the game to modern systems, started negotiations with the rights holders and was able to secure the rights. Kick worked with <a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a> for a timed-exclusive release on their <a href="digital%20distribution">digital distribution</a> website on February 2013, where the game was the most requested to be added to the catalog. This version, considered by GOG.com to be a "<a href="collector%27s%20edition">collector's edition</a>", incorporates fan-created updates to the original game to make it work on modern systems prepared by an anonymous user named "Le Corbeau". In addition, the updates allow user-made modifications to be applied more seamlessly. The release also contains additional material such as the game's soundtrack, maps of the Von Braun, and the original pitch document for the game. The update rights also allowed a Mac OS X version of "System Shock 2" to be subsequently released on June 18, 2013, through GOG.com. The title was later also available on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> on May 10, 2013. In April 2014 a <a href="Linux">Linux</a> version was also released.

Since then, Night Dive Studios also acquired the rights to "System Shock", releasing an enhanced version of the game in September 2015. Kick has reported they have acquired full rights to the series since then.

"System Shock 2" received critical acclaim. It received over a dozen awards, including seven "<a href="Game%20of%20the%20Year">Game of the Year</a>" prizes. Reviews were very positive and lauded the title for its hybrid gameplay, moody sound design, and engaging story. "System Shock 2" is regarded by critics as highly influential, particularly on <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a>s and the <a href="survival%20horror">horror</a> genre. In a retrospective article, <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> declared the title "well ahead of its time" and stated that it "upped the ante in dramatic and mechanical terms" by creating a horrific gameplay experience. Despite critical acclaim, the title did not perform well commercially; only 58,671 copies were sold by April 2000.

Several publications praised the title for its open-ended gameplay. With regard to character customization, Trent Ward of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> stated the best element of the role-playing system was allowing gamers to "play the game as completely different characters", and felt this made each play-through unique. Erik Reckase writing for Just Adventure agreed, saying "There are very few games that allow you [to] play the way you want". Alec Norands of <a href="Allgame">Allgame</a> believed that the different character classes made the game “diverse enough to demand instant replayability". Robert Mayer from "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" called "System Shock 2" "a game that truly defies classification in a single genre", and ensured that "the action is occasionally fast-paced, it's more often tactical, placing a premium on thought rather than on reflexes."

A number of critics described the game as frightening. "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" described the atmosphere as "gripping" and guaranteed readers they would "jump out of [their] skin" numerous times. Allgame found the <a href="sound%20design">sound design</a> particularly effective, calling it “absolutely, teeth-clenchingly disturbing", while "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>"s William Harms christened "System Shock 2" as the most frightening game he had ever played. Some critics found the weapon degradation system to be irritating, and members of the development team have also expressed misgivings about the system. The role-playing system was another point of contention; GameSpot described the job system as "badly unbalanced" because the player can develop skills outside their career choice. Allgame felt similarly about the system, saying it "leaned towards a hacker character".

Along with "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>", Sid Shuman of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" christened "System Shock 2" "[one of the] twin barrels of modern [first-person shooter] innovation", owing to its complex role-playing gameplay. IGN writer Cam Shea referred to the game as "another reinvention of the FPS genre", citing the story, characters, and RPG system. "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" lauded the game as a "fabulous example of a modern-day computer game" and named it "a sci-fi horror masterpiece". The title has been inducted into a number of features listing the greatest games ever made, including ones by <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>, "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" , "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>", IGN, GameSpot and "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>". IGN also ranked "System Shock 2" as the 35th greatest first-person shooter of all time. <a href="X-Play">X-Play</a> called it the second scariest game of all time, behind "<a href="Silent%20Hill%202">Silent Hill 2</a>". SHODAN has proven to be a popular character among most critics, including IGN, GameSpot and <a href="The%20Phoenix%20%28newspaper%29">"The Phoenix"</a>.

"System Shock 2" won "PC Gamer US"s 1999 "Best Roleplaying Game" and "Special Achievement in Sound" awards, and was a runner-up in the magazine's overall "Game of the Year" category. The editors of "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" nominated it for their "Role-Playing Game of the Year" prize, which ultimately went to "".

"System Shock 2" has amassed a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>, with fans asking for a sequel. On January 9, 2006, <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> reported that Electronic Arts had renewed its trademark protection on the "System Shock" name, leading to speculation that "System Shock 3" might be under development. Three days later, "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>" reported a reliable source had come forward and confirmed the title's production. Electronic Arts UK made no comment when confronted with the information. "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20UK">PC Gamer UK</a>" stated the team behind "" (EA Redwood Shores) was charged with its creation. Ken Levine, when asked whether he would helm the third installment, replied: "that question is completely out of my hands". He expressed optimism at the prospect of "System Shock 3", but revealed that EA had not shown interest in his own proposal for a sequel, and was not optimistic with regards to their abilities. Electronic Arts did not confirm a new title in the series and allowed the "System Shock" trademark registration to lapse. Redwood Shores' next release was 2008's "<a href="Dead%20Space%20%282008%20video%20game%29">Dead Space</a>", a game with noted similarities in theme and presentation to the "System Shock" series. According to "Dead Space" designers Ben Wanat and Wright Bagwell, their project was originally intended to be "System Shock 3", before the release of "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>" inspired them to go back to the drawing board and develop it into something more along those lines, eventually becoming "Dead Space".

In November 2015, Night Dive Studios, after acquiring the rights to the "System Shock" franchise, stated they are considering developing a third title in the series. In December 2015, <a href="OtherSide%20Entertainment">OtherSide Entertainment</a>, a studio founded by former Looking Glass Studios designer <a href="Paul%20Neurath">Paul Neurath</a>, announced they were developing "System Shock 3" with rights granted to them by Night Dive Studios. OtherSide had acquired rights to make sequels to "System Shock" some years before this point but did not have the rights to the series name, which Night Dive was able to provide. The sequel will feature <a href="Terri%20Brosius">Terri Brosius</a> reprising her voice for SHODAN, and will include work from original "System Shock" concept artist Robb Waters. <a href="Warren%20Spector">Warren Spector</a>, the producer of the first "System Shock", announced in February 2016 that he has joined OtherSide Entertainment and will be working on "System Shock 3". According to Spector, the narrative will pick up immediately from the end of "System Shock 2", with SHODAN having taken over Rebecca's body. <a href="Starbreeze%20Studios">Starbreeze Studios</a> is providing a $12 million "publishing-only" investment in "System Shock 3", allowing OtherSide to retain all rights while seeking a 120% return on investment followed by equal shares of revenue splitting. Starbreeze's investment will allow the game to be developed for consoles in addition to the planned personal computer versions. However, in the wake of several financial problems in late 2018, Starbreeze has given back the publishing rights to "System Shock 3" to OtherSide, and separated itself from the project. "System Shock 3" will use the <a href="Unity%20%28engine%29">Unity game engine</a>, with a teaser shown during Unity's press event at the 2019 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>.

In 2007, <a href="Irrational%20Games">Irrational Games</a>—briefly known as <a href="2K%20Boston/2K%20Australia">2K Boston/2K Australia</a>—released a <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a> to the "<a href="System%20Shock">System Shock</a>" series, entitled "<a href="BioShock">BioShock</a>". The game takes place in an abandoned underwater <a href="utopia">utopia</a>n community destroyed by the genetic modification of its populace and shares many gameplay elements with "System Shock 2": reconstitution stations can be activated, allowing the player to be resurrected when they die; <a href="Hacker%20%28computer%20security%29">hacking</a>, ammo conservation, and exploration are integral parts of gameplay; and unique powers may be acquired via plasmids, special abilities that function similarly to <a href="psionic">psionic</a>s in "System Shock 2". The two titles also share plot similarities and employ audio logs and encounters with <a href="ghost">ghost</a>ly <a href="Apparitional%20experience">apparitions</a> to reveal <a href="backstory">backstory</a>. In "<a href="BioShock%20Infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>", Irrational Games included a gameplay feature called "1999 Mode", specifically in reference to "System Shock 2"s release year, designed to provide a similar game experience with a higher difficulty and long-lasting effects of choices made that would remind players of "System Shock"s unforgiving nature.

In 2017, <a href="Arkane%20Studios">Arkane Studios</a> published "<a href="Prey%20%282017%20video%20game%29">Prey</a>", which takes place on a space station named "Talos I", similar to "System Shock". It, too, features psionic abilities, in the form of "Neuromods", as a fundamental gameplay feature, and uses a mixture of audio logs and pieces of text to advance the game's backstory. "Prey" also features elements like hacking, crafting, and features a heavy emphasis on side-quest exploration and careful conservation of ammunition and "Psi Points", player stat that controls how many psi abilities can be used. The game features crew members who have become infected, though, not as the result of an AI, but instead as the result of a failure of containment around a mysterious alien species known as the Typhon. Within the game, references are made to "System Shock"s developers, such as the "Looking Glass" technology that plays a significant role in the story's plot.

Stella Gibbons

Stella Dorothea Gibbons (5 January 1902 – 19 December 1989) was an English author, journalist, and poet. She established her reputation with her <a href="debut%20novel">first novel</a>, "<a href="Cold%20Comfort%20Farm">Cold Comfort Farm</a>" (1932) which has been reprinted many times. Although she was active as a writer for half a century, none of her later 22 novels or other literary works—which included a sequel to "Cold Comfort Farm"—achieved the same critical or popular success. Much of her work was long out of print before a modest revival in the 21st century.

The daughter of a London doctor, Gibbons had a turbulent and often unhappy childhood. After an indifferent school career she trained as a journalist, and worked as a reporter and features writer, mainly for the "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lady%20%28magazine%29">The Lady</a>". Her first book, published in 1930, was a collection of poems which was well received, and through her life she considered herself primarily a poet rather than a novelist. After "Cold Comfort Farm", a satire on the genre of rural-themed "loam and lovechild" novels popular in the late 1920s, most of Gibbons's novels were based within the middle-class suburban world with which she was familiar.

Gibbons became a Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Literature">Royal Society of Literature</a> in 1950. Her style has been praised by critics for its charm, barbed humour and descriptive skill, and has led to comparison with <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>. The impact of "Cold Comfort Farm" dominated her career, and she grew to resent her identification with the book to the exclusion of the rest of her output. Widely regarded as a one-work novelist, she and her works have not been accepted into the canon of English literature—partly, other writers have suggested, because of her detachment from the literary world and her tendency to mock it.

The Gibbons family originated in Ireland. Stella's grandfather, Charles Preston Gibbons, was a civil engineer who spent long periods in South Africa building bridges. He and his wife Alice had six children, the second of whom—the eldest of four sons—was born in 1869 and was known by his fourth Christian name of "Telford". The Gibbons household was a turbulent one, with tensions arising from Charles Gibbons's frequent adulteries. Telford Gibbons trained as a doctor, and qualified as a physician and surgeon at the <a href="Royal%20London%20Hospital">London Hospital</a> in 1897. On 29 September 1900 he married Maude Williams, the daughter of a <a href="stockbroker">stockbroker</a>. The couple bought a house in Malden Crescent, <a href="Kentish%20Town">Kentish Town</a>, a working-class district of North London, where Telford established the medical practice in which he continued for the remainder of his life.

Stella, the couple's first child, was born on 5 January 1902; two brothers, Gerald and Lewis, followed in 1905 and 1909 respectively. The atmosphere in the Kentish Town house echoed that of the elder Gibbons's household, and was dominated by Telford's frequent bouts of ill-temper, drinking, womanising and occasional acts of violence. Stella later described her father as "a bad man, but a good doctor". He was charitable to his poorer patients and imaginative in finding cures, but made life miserable for his family. Initially Stella was his favourite, but by the time she reached puberty he frequently mocked her looks and size. Fortunately, her mother was a calm and stabilising influence. Until Stella reached the age of 13 she was educated at home by a succession of governesses, who never stayed long. The family's bookshelves provided reading material, and she
developed a talent for storytelling with which she amused her young brothers.

In 1915 Stella became a pupil at the <a href="North%20London%20Collegiate%20School">North London Collegiate School</a>, then situated in <a href="Camden%20Town">Camden Town</a>. The school, founded in 1850 by <a href="Frances%20Buss">Frances Buss</a>, was among the first in England to offer girls an academic education, and by 1915 was widely recognised as a model girls' school. After the haphazard teaching methods of her governesses, Stella initially had difficulty in adjusting to the strict discipline of the school, and found many of its rules and practices oppressive. She shared this attitude with her contemporary <a href="Stevie%20Smith">Stevie Smith</a>, the future <a href="Queen%27s%20Gold%20Medal%20for%20Poetry">Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry</a> winner, who joined the school in 1917. Although a moderate performer in school subjects, Stella found outlets for her talents by writing stories for her fellow-pupils, becoming vice president of the Senior Dramatic Club, and featuring prominently in the school's Debating Society, of which she became the honorary secretary.

While at school, Gibbons formed an ambition to be a writer, and on leaving in 1921 began a two-year Diploma in Journalism at <a href="University%20College%2C%20London">University College, London</a> (UCL). The course had been established for ex-servicemen returning from the First World War, but attracted several women, among them the future novelist <a href="Elizabeth%20Bowen">Elizabeth Bowen</a>. As well as English Literature, the curriculum covered economics, politics, history, science and languages; practical skills such as shorthand and typing were not included.

After the stifling experience of school, Gibbons found university exhilarating and made numerous friendships, particularly with Ida Graves, an aspiring poet who, although on a different course, attended some of the same lectures. The two shared a love of literature and a taste for subversive humour. Graves lived until 1999, and recalled in an interview late in life that many of the jokes they shared found their way into "Cold Comfort Farm", as did some of their common acquaintances. Soon after Gibbons began the course she contributed a poem, "The Marshes of My Soul", to the December 1921 issue of "University College Magazine". This parody, in the newly fashionable "<a href="vers%20libre">vers libre</a>" style, was her first published literary work. During the next two years she contributed further poems and prose to the magazine, including "The Doer, a Story in the Russian Manner", which foreshadows her later novels in both theme and style. Gibbons completed her course in the summer of 1923, and was awarded her diploma.

Gibbons's first job was with the <a href="British%20United%20Press">British United Press</a> (BUP) news agency, where she decoded overseas cables which she rewrote in presentable English. During slack periods she practised at writing articles, stories and poems. She made her first trips abroad, travelling to France in 1924 and Switzerland in 1925. Swiss Alpine scenery inspired several poems, some of which were later published. In 1924 she met Walter Beck, a naturalised German employed by his family's cosmetics firm. The couple became engaged, and enjoyed regular weekends together, signing hotel registers as a married couple using false names.

In May 1926 Gibbons's mother, Maude, died suddenly at the age of 48. With little reason to remain with her father in the Kentish Town surgery, Gibbons took lodgings in Willow Road, near <a href="Hampstead%20Heath">Hampstead Heath</a>. Five months later, on 15 October, her father died from heart disease aggravated by heavy drinking. Gibbons was now the family's principal breadwinner; her youngest brother Lewis was still at school, while the elder, Gerald, was intermittently employed as an actor. The three set up home in a cottage on the <a href="Vale%20of%20Health">Vale of Health</a>, a small settlement in the middle of Hampstead Heath, with literary connections to <a href="John%20Keats">Keats</a> (whom Gibbons revered), <a href="Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a> and <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a>. Later that year, as a result of an error involving the calculation and reporting of foreign exchange rates, Gibbons was sacked from the BUP, but quickly found a new position as secretary to the editor of the London "<a href="Evening%20Standard">Evening Standard</a>". Within a short time she was promoted, and became a reporter and features writer at the then substantial salary of just under £500 a year, although she was not given a by-line until 1928.

During her "Evening Standard" years, Gibbons persevered with poetry, and in September 1927 her poem "The Giraffes" appeared in "<a href="The%20Criterion">The Criterion</a>", a literary magazine edited by <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>. This work was read and admired by <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>, who enquired if Gibbons would write poems for the Woolf publishing house, the <a href="Hogarth%20Press">Hogarth Press</a>. In January 1928 , a leading voice in the <a href="Georgian%20Poetry">"Georgian"</a> poetry movement, began to publish Gibbons's poems in his magazine, "<a href="London%20Mercury">The London Mercury</a>". Squire also persuaded <a href="Longman">Longman</a>s to publish the first collection of Gibbons's verses, entitled "The Mountain Beast", which appeared in 1930 to critical approval. By this time her by-line was appearing with increasing frequency in the "Standard". As part of a series on "Unusual Women" she interviewed, among others, the former royal mistress <a href="Lillie%20Langtry">Lillie Langtry</a>. The paper also published several of Gibbons's short stories.

Despite this evident industry, Gibbons was dismissed from the "Standard" in August 1930. This was ostensibly an economy measure although Gibbons, in later life, suspected other reasons, particularly the increasing distraction from work that arose from her relationship with Walter Beck. The engagement had ended painfully in 1928, primarily because Gibbons was looking for a fully committed relationship whereas he wanted something more open. Her biographer and nephew, <a href="Reggie%20Oliver">Reggie Oliver</a>, believes Gibbons never entirely got over Beck, even after 1929 when she met Allan Webb, her future husband. She was not unemployed for long; she quickly accepted a job offer as an editorial assistant at the women's magazine, "<a href="The%20Lady%20%28magazine%29">The Lady</a>". Here, according to "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" writer <a href="Rachel%20Cooke">Rachel Cooke</a>, "she applied her versatility as a writer to every subject under the sun bar cookery, which was the province of a certain Mrs Peel." At the same time she began work on the novel that would become "<a href="Cold%20Comfort%20Farm">Cold Comfort Farm</a>"; her colleague and friend Elizabeth Coxhead recorded that Gibbons "neglected her duties disgracefully" to work on this project.

In her time with "The Lady", Gibbons established a reputation as a caustic book reviewer, and was particularly critical of the then fashionable "loam and lovechild" rural novels. Novelists such as <a href="Mary%20Webb">Mary Webb</a> and <a href="Sheila%20Kaye-Smith">Sheila Kaye-Smith</a> had achieved considerable popularity through their depictions of country life; Webb was a favourite of the British Prime Minister <a href="Stanley%20Baldwin">Stanley Baldwin</a>. Gibbons had first become familiar with the genre when she provided summaries of Webb's "The Golden Arrow" for the "Evening Standard's" 1928 serialisation. She found the writing overblown and the plotting ridiculous, and decided that her own first novel would be a comic parody of the genre. By February 1932 she had completed the manuscript and delivered it to her publishers, Longmans.
Gibbons's chosen title for her novel had been "Curse God Farm", before her friend Elizabeth Coxhead, who had connections in the <a href="Hinckley">Hinckley</a> district of <a href="Leicestershire">Leicestershire</a>, suggested "Cold Comfort" as an alternative, using the name of a farm in the Hinckley area. Gibbons was delighted with the suggestion, and the work was published as "<a href="Cold%20Comfort%20Farm">Cold Comfort Farm</a>" in September 1932. The plot concerns the efforts of "a rational, bossy London heroine" to bring order and serenity to her rustic relations, the Starkadders, on their run-down <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a> farm. According to the "Feminist Companion to Literature in English", Gibbons's parody "[demolishes] ... the stock-in-trade of earthy regionalists such as <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>, Mary Webb, Sheila Kaye-Smith and D. H. Lawrence". The literary scholar Faye Hammill describes the work as "an extremely sophisticated and intricate parody whose meaning is produced through its relationship with the literary culture of its day and with the work of such canonical authors as D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Hardy, and Emily Brontë". In her history of the 1930s, Juliet Gardiner ascribes a socio-economic dimension to the book: "a picture of rural gloom caused by government lassitude and urban indifference".

The work was an immediate critical and popular success. The satire was heightened by Gibbons's mockery of <a href="purple%20prose">purple prose</a>, whereby she marked the most florid and overwritten passages of the book with asterisks, "for the reader's delectation and mirth". One critic found it hard to accept that so well-developed a parody was the work of a scarcely known woman writer, and speculated that "Stella Gibbons" was a pen-name for <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a>. Gibbons suddenly found herself in demand in literary circles and from fellow writers, raised to a celebrity status that she found distasteful. She acquired an agent, who advised her that she could confidently expect a regular and comfortable income as a novelist. This assurance prompted her, at the end of 1932, to resign her position with "The Lady" and to embark on a full-time writing career.

In March 1931 Gibbons had become engaged to Allan Webb, a budding actor and opera singer five years her junior. He was the son of <a href="Charles%20Webb%20%28cricketer%29">a cricketing parson</a>, and the grandson of <a href="Allan%20Webb">Allan Becher Webb</a>, a former <a href="Diocese%20of%20the%20Free%20State">Bishop of Bloemfontein</a> who served as <a href="Dean%20of%20Salisbury">Dean of Salisbury Cathedral</a>. On 1 April 1933 the couple were married at <a href="St%20Matthew%27s%2C%20Bayswater">St Matthew's, Bayswater</a>. Later that year she learned that "Cold Comfort Farm" had been awarded the "Prix Étranger", the foreign novel category of the prestigious French literary prize, the "<a href="Prix%20Femina">Prix Femina</a>". It had won against works by two more experienced writers, Bowen and <a href="Rosamond%20Lehmann">Rosamond Lehmann</a>. This outcome irritated Virginia Woolf, herself a former "Prix Étranger" winner, who wrote to Bowen: "I was enraged to see they gave the £40 (the cash value of the prize) to Gibbons; still, now you and Rosamond can join in blaming her". Cooke observes that of all the "Prix Étranger" winners from the inter-war years, only "Cold Comfort Farm" and Woolf's "<a href="To%20the%20Lighthouse">To the Lighthouse</a>" are remembered today, and that only the former has bequeathed a phrase that has passed into common usage: "something nasty in the woodshed".

During the remainder of the 1930s Gibbons produced five more novels, as well as two poetry collections, a children's book, and a number of short stories. From November 1936 the family home was in Oakshott Avenue, on the <a href="Holly%20Lodge%20Estate">Holly Lodge Estate</a> off Highgate West Hill, where Gibbons regularly worked in the mornings from ten until lunchtime. Her novels were generally well received by critics and the public, though none earned the accolades or attention that had been given to "Cold Comfort Farm"; readers of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" were specifically warned not to expect Gibbons's second novel, "Bassett" (1934), to be a repetition of the earlier masterpiece. "Enbury Heath" (1935) is a relatively faithful account of her childhood and early adult life with, according to Oliver, "only the thinnest veil of fictional gauze cover[ing] raw experience". "Miss Linsey and Pa" (1936) was thought by Nicola Beauman, in her analysis of women writers from 1914 to 1939, to parody <a href="Radclyffe%20Hall">Radclyffe Hall</a>'s 1928 lesbian novel "<a href="The%20Well%20of%20Loneliness">The Well of Loneliness</a>". Gibbons's final prewar novels were "Nightingale Wood" (1935)—"Cinderella brought right up to date"—and "My American" (1939), which Oliver considers her most escapist novel, "a variant of <a href="Hans%20Christian%20Andersen">Hans Christian Andersen</a>'s "The Snow Queen"."

Gibbons always considered herself a serious poet rather than a comic writer. She published two collections of poetry in the 1930s, the latter of which, "The Lowland Verses" (1938) contains "The Marriage of the Machine", an early lament on the effects of industrial pollution: "What oil, what poison lulls/Your wings and webs, my cormorants and gulls?" Gibbons's single children's book was the fairy tale collection "The Untidy Gnome", published in 1935 and dedicated to her only child Laura, who was born that year.

The advent of war in September 1939 did not diminish Gibbons's creative energy. In November she began a series of articles, "A Woman's Diary of the War", for "St Martin's Review", the journal of the London church of <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>. The series ran until November 1943, and includes many of Gibbons's private reflections on the conflict. In October 1941 she wrote: "[T]he war has done me good ... I get a dour satisfaction out of managing the rations, salvaging, fire watching, and feeling that I am trying to work for a better world". In July 1940 Webb enlisted in the <a href="Middlesex%20Regiment">Middlesex Regiment</a>, and the following year was commissioned into the <a href="King%27s%20Royal%20Rifle%20Corps">King's Royal Rifle Corps</a>. He later served overseas, mostly in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>.

The title story in Gibbons's 1940 collection, "Christmas at Cold Comfort Farm", failed to equal the impact of the original. When the collection was reissued many years later it was described as "oddly comforting and amusing ... and possibly a truer depiction of the times than we might think". Gibbons published three novels during the war: "The Rich House" (1941), "Ticky" (1942) and "The Bachelor" (1944). "Ticky", a satire on mid-nineteenth century army life, was Gibbons's favourite of all her novels, although she acknowledged that hardly anyone liked it. It failed commercially, despite a favourable review in "<a href="The%20Times%20Literary%20Supplement">The Times Literary Supplement</a>". Oliver surmises that "the middle of the Second World War was perhaps the wrong time to satirise ... the ridiculous and dangerous rituals that surround the male aggressive instinct". "The Bachelor" won critical praise for its revealing account of life in war-torn Britain—as did several of Gibbons's postwar novels.

Gibbons's first postwar novel was "Westwood" (1946). The book incorporates a comic depiction of the novelist <a href="Charles%20Langbridge%20Morgan">Charles Morgan</a>, whose novel "The Fountain" Gibbons had reviewed before the war and found "offensive as well as wearisome". In "Westwood", Morgan appears in the guise of the novelist "Gerald Challis", a pompous, humourless bore. Oliver considers this characterisation to be one of Gibbons's "most enjoyable and vicious" satirical portraits. In her introduction to the book's 2011 reprint, <a href="Lynne%20Truss">Lynne Truss</a> describes it as "a rich, mature novel, romantic and wistful, full of rounded characters and terrific dialogue" that deserved more commercial success than it received. The public's expectations were still prejudiced by "Cold Comfort Farm", which by 1949 had sold 28,000 copies in hardback and 315,000 in paperback. Anticipating that a sequel would be popular, that year Gibbons produced "Conference at Cold Comfort Farm", her shortest novel, in which the farm has become a conference centre and tourist attraction. There is much mockery of contemporary and indeed future artistic and intellectual trends, before the male Starkadders return from overseas, wreck the centre and restore the farm to its original primitive state. The book was moderately successful but, Oliver remarks, does not compare with the original.

In 1950 Gibbons published her "Collected Poems", and in the same year was made a Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Literature">Royal Society of Literature</a>. Throughout the 1950s she continued, at roughly two-year intervals, to produce politely received novels, none of which created any particular stir. Among these was "Fort of the Bear" (1953), in which she departed from her familiar London milieu by setting the story largely in the wilder regions of Canada. This was the last of her books handled by Longmans; thereafter her work was published by Hodder and Stoughton. A journey to Austria and Venice in 1953 provided material for her novel "The Shadow of a Sorcerer" (1955). From 1954, having accepted an invitation from <a href="Malcolm%20Muggeridge">Malcolm Muggeridge</a>, the editor of "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>", Gibbons provided frequent contributions to the magazine for the following 15 years. Among these was a science fiction story, "Jane in Space", written in the style of <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a>. Gibbons, who wrote the introduction to the 1957 Heritage edition of "<a href="Sense%20and%20Sensibility">Sense and Sensibility</a>", was a long-time admirer of Austen, and had described her in a "Lady" article as "one of the most exquisite" of woman artists.

After the war, Allan Webb resumed his stage career with the role of Count Almaviva in the 1946 <a href="English%20National%20Opera">Sadler's Wells</a> production of "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>". In 1947 he appeared in the original run of the <a href="Vivian%20Ellis">Vivian Ellis</a> musical "<a href="Bless%20the%20Bride">Bless the Bride</a>", and made several further stage appearances in the following two years. During this time he had a brief affair with the actress Sydney Malcolm, for which Gibbons quickly forgave him. He left the theatre in 1949 to become a director of a book club specialising in special editions, and later bought a bookshop in the <a href="Archway%2C%20London">Archway</a> district of London. His health failed in the late 1950s and in 1958 he was diagnosed with cancer of the liver. He died in July 1959 at Oakshott Avenue.

After Webb's death, Gibbons remained at Oakshott Avenue and continued to write novels. From 1961 she rented a summer house at <a href="Trevone">Trevone</a> in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, which became the setting for her 1962 novel "The Weather at Tregulla". She returned to literary criticism after many years, when in 1965 she contributed an essay to "Light on C.S. Lewis", a review of that writer's work edited by Jocelyn Gibb. In 1966 she wrote an essay for "Punch", "Genesis of a Novel", in which she mused on the detrimental effect of "Cold Comfort Farm" on her long term career. She likened the book to "some unignorable old uncle, to whom you have to be grateful because he makes you a handsome allowance, but is often an embarrassment and a bore". Gibbons made her last overseas trip in 1966, to <a href="Grenoble">Grenoble</a> in France where she visited her old friend Elizabeth Coxhead. This visit provided material for her 1968 novel "The Snow Woman" in which Gibbons overcame her habitual distaste for emotional excess by opening the book with a melodramatic birth on a sofa. "The Woods in Winter" (1970) was her last published novel; she decided at that point that she was no longer prepared to subject her work to editorial control. In the 1980s she wrote two more novels for private circulation among friends, "The Yellow Houses" and "An Alpha". These books – "An Alpha" retitled "Pure Juliet" – were published by Vintage Classics in 2016, after the manuscripts were released by Gibbons's family.

The last two decades of Gibbons's life were uneventful and lived almost entirely beyond the public eye. She kept her health and looks until almost the end of her life—in a biographical sketch, Jill Neville recorded that "her beauty endured, as did her upright carriage, typical of Edwardian ladies who were forced as girls to walk around with a book balanced on their heads." As well as her unpublished novels she wrote occasional short stories, two of which were rejected by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, and contributed three new poems to <a href="Richard%20Adams">Richard Adams</a>'s 1986 anthology "Occasional Poets", a work which included verses from part-time poets such as <a href="Iris%20Murdoch">Iris Murdoch</a>, <a href="William%20Golding">William Golding</a>, <a href="Alan%20Ayckbourn">Alan Ayckbourn</a> and <a href="Quentin%20Crisp">Quentin Crisp</a>. These were Gibbons's last published works. One of Gibbons's poems in the anthology was "Writ in Water", inspired by her love for the poetry of Keats. In 2013 the manuscript of this poem was presented to the <a href="Keats-Shelley%20Memorial%20House">Keats-Shelley Memorial House</a> museum in Rome.

Gibbons maintained a wide circle of friends, who in her later years included Adams, the entertainer <a href="Barry%20Humphries">Barry Humphries</a> and the novelist <a href="John%20Braine">John Braine</a>. From the mid-1970s she established a pattern of monthly literary tea parties in Oakshott Avenue at which, according to Neville, "she was known to expel guests if they were shrill, dramatic, or wrote tragic novels." As her own productivity dwindled and finally ceased altogether, she kept a <a href="commonplace%20book">commonplace book</a> in which she was recording her thoughts and opinions on literature as late as 1988.

From the mid-1980s Gibbons experienced recurrent health problems, not helped when she resumed smoking. In her last months she was looked after at home by her grandson and his girlfriend. She died there on 19 December 1989, after collapsing the previous day, and was buried in <a href="Highgate%20Cemetery">Highgate Cemetery</a>, alongside her husband. At her funeral, her nephew and future biographer <a href="Reggie%20Oliver">Reggie Oliver</a> read two of her poems, the latter of which, "Fairford Church", concludes with the words: "Little is sure. Life is hard./We love, we suffer and die./But the beauty of the earth is real/And the Spirit is nigh."

Gibbons's writing has been praised by critics for its perspicacity, sense of fun, charm, wit and descriptive skill—the last a product of her journalistic training—which she used to convey both atmosphere and character. Although Beauman refers to "malicious wit", Truss sees no cruelty in the often barbed humour, which reflected Gibbons's detestation of pomposity and pretence. Truss has described Gibbons as "the Jane Austen of the 20th century", a parallel which the novelist <a href="Malcolm%20Bradbury">Malcolm Bradbury</a> thought apt; Flora Poste in "Cold Comfort Farm", with her "higher common sense", is "a Jane-ite heroine transformed into a clear-eyed modern woman". Bradbury also observed that many of Gibbons's novels end in Austen-like nuptials.

Truss highlights the importance that Gibbons places on detachment as a necessary adjunct to effective writing: "Like many a good doctor, she seems to have considered sympathy a peculiar and redundant emotion, and a terrible waste of time." This matter-of-fact quality in her prose might, according to Gibbons's "Guardian" obituarist <a href="Richard%20Boston">Richard Boston</a>, be a reaction against the turbulent and sometimes violent emotions that she witnessed within her own family who, she said, "were all madly highly-sexed, like the Starkadders". It is, observed Neville, an irony that the overheated melodrama that Gibbons most disliked was at the heart of her one great success; Gibbons's writings on everyday life brought her restrained approval, but no noticeable literary recognition. Nevertheless, her straightforward, style, unadorned except in parody, is admired by Rachel Cooke, who praises her as "a sworn enemy of the flatulent, the pompous and the excessively sentimental." While short of sentimentality, Gibbons's writing, in prose or verse, did not lack sensitivity. She had what one analyst described as "a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable".

Some of Gibbons's poetry expressed her love of nature and a prophetic awareness for environmental issues such as sea pollution, decades before such concerns became fashionable. In a critical summary of Gibbons's poems, Loralee MacPike has described them as "slight lyrics ... [which] tend toward classic, even archaic, diction, and only occasionally ... show flashes of the novels' wit". Such lines as "my thoughts, like purple parrots / Brood / In the sick light" come dangerously close indeed to the overblown rhetoric she satirized in "Cold Comfort Farm": "How like yaks were your drowsy thoughts".

The immediate and enduring success of "Cold Comfort Farm" dominated the rest of Gibbons's career. Neville thought that after so singular a success at the start of her career, the rest was something of an anticlimax, despite her considerable industry and undoubted skills. The 1985 edition of "The Oxford Companion to English Literature" defines Gibbons solely in terms of "Cold Comfort Farm"; it mentions none of her other works—while providing her "bêtes noires" Morgan and Mary Webb with full entries. To Gibbons, "Cold Comfort Farm" became "That Book" or "You-Know-What", its title never mentioned. Despite her growing irritation and expressed distaste for it, the book continued to be lauded by successive generations of critics, Boston described it as "one of those rare books of comic genius that imprints itself on the brain and can never afterwards be eradicated". A more negative view of the book has been expressed by the literary critic <a href="Mary%20Beard%20%28classicist%29">Mary Beard</a>, who considers it "a rather controlling victory of modern order, cleanliness, contraception and medicine over these messy, different, rural types ... I found myself screaming for the rights of these poor country folk NOT to fall into the hands of people like Flora".

Although Boston suggested that Gibbons's rating in the academic English Literature world ought to be high, her literary status is indeterminate. She did not promote herself, and was indifferent to the attractions of public life: "I'm not shy", she told Oliver, "I'm just unsociable". Truss records that Gibbons had "overtly rejected the literary world ... she didn't move in literary circles, or even visit literary squares, or love in literary triangles". Truss posits further reasons why Gibbons did not become a literary canon. Because she was a woman who wrote amusingly, she was classified as "middlebrow"; furthermore, she was published by Longmans, a non-literary publisher. Her lampooning of the literary establishment in the spoof dedication of "Cold Comfort Farm" to one "Anthony Pookworthy" did not amuse that establishment, who were further offended by the book's mockery of the writing of such canonical figures as Lawrence and Hardy—hence Virginia Woolf's reaction to the "Prix Étranger" award. Her belief in what she called "the gentle powers (Pity, Affection, Time, Beauty, Laughter)" also flew in the face of a disillusioned <a href="Modernist%20literature">modernism</a>.

The literary critic <a href="John%20Carey%20%28critic%29">John Carey</a> suggests that the abandonment by intellectuals of "the clerks and the suburbs" as subjects of literary interest provided an opening for writers prepared to exploit this underexplored area. He considers <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a> and Stevie Smith as two writers who successfully achieved this. Hammill believes that Gibbons should be named alongside these two, since in her writings she rejects the stereotypical view of suburbia as unexciting, conventional and limited. Instead, says Hammill, "Gibbons's fictional suburbs are socially and architecturally diverse, and her characters—who range from experimental writers to shopkeepers—read and interpret suburban styles and values in varying and incompatible ways". Hammill adds that Gibbons's strong identification with her own suburban home, in which she lived for 53 years, may have influenced her preference to stay outside the mainstream of metropolitan literary life, and from time to time mock it.

After many years in which almost all of Gibbons's output has been out of print, in 2011 the publishers <a href="Vintage%20Classics">Vintage Classics</a> reissued paperback versions of "Westwood", "Starlight", and "Conference at Cold Comfort Farm". They also announced plans to publish 11 of the other novels, on a print-on-demand basis.

Publisher information relates to first publication only. Many of the books have been reissued, usually by different publishers.

His style demonstrates a wide range of rich atmospheric <a href="texture%20%28music%29">textures</a>. He began developing his own characteristic composition techniques in the late 1950s. His music from this period onwards incorporates his own methods of building <a href="harmony">harmonies</a> from small groups of <a href="interval%20%28music%29">musical intervals</a>. It also uses <a href="Aleatoric%20music">aleatoric</a> processes, in which the rhythmic coordination of parts is subject to an element of chance.

During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, after escaping German capture, Lutosławski made a living by playing the piano in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> bars. After the war, <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> authorities banned his First Symphony for being "<a href="Russian%20Formalism">formalist</a>"—allegedly accessible only to an elite. Lutosławski believed such anti-formalism was an unjustified retrograde step, and he resolutely strove to maintain his artistic integrity. In the 1980s, Lutosławski gave artistic support to the <a href="Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29">Solidarity</a> movement. Near the end of his life, he was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20White%20Eagle%20%28Poland%29">Order of the White Eagle</a>, Poland's highest honour.

Lutosławski's parents were both born into the Polish landed nobility. His family owned estates in the area of <a href="Drozdowo%2C%20Podlaskie%20Voivodeship">Drozdowo</a>. His father Józef was involved in the Polish <a href="National%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Poland%29">National Democratic Party</a> (""Endecja""), and the Lutosławski family became intimate with its founder, <a href="Roman%20Dmowski">Roman Dmowski</a> (Witold Lutosławski's middle name was Roman). Józef Lutosławski studied in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, where in 1904 he met and married a fellow student, Maria Olszewska, who later became Lutosławski's mother. Józef pursued his studies in London, where he acted as correspondent for the <a href="National%20Democracy">National-Democratic</a> newspaper, "Goniec". He continued to be involved in National Democracy politics after returning to Warsaw in 1905, and took over the management of the family estates in 1908. Witold Roman Lutosławski, the youngest of three brothers, was born in Warsaw shortly before the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. In 1915, with Russia at war with Germany, <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n forces drove towards Warsaw. The Lutosławskis travelled east to Moscow, where Józef remained politically active, organising <a href="Polish%20Legions%20in%20World%20War%20I">Polish Legions</a> ready for any action that might liberate Poland (which was divided according to the 1815 <a href="Congress%20of%20Vienna">Congress of Vienna</a>—<a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> was part of <a href="Imperial%20Russia">Tsarist Russia</a>). Dmowski's strategy was for Russia to guarantee security for a new Polish state. However, in 1917, the <a href="February%20Revolution">February Revolution</a> forced the <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Tsar</a> to abdicate, and the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> started a new <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> government that made peace with Germany. Józef's activities were now in conflict with the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s, who arrested him and his brother Marian. Thus, although fighting stopped on the Eastern Front in 1917, the Lutosławskis were prevented from returning home. The brothers were interned in <a href="Butyrka%20prison">Butyrskaya prison</a> in central Moscow, where Witold—by then aged five—visited his father. Józef and Marian were executed by a firing squad in September 1918, some days before their scheduled trial.

After the war, the family returned to <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">the newly independent Poland</a>, only to find their estates ruined. After his father's death, other members of the family played an important part in his early life, especially Józef's half-brother <a href="Kazimierz%20Lutos%C5%82awski">Kazimierz Lutosławski</a> – priest and politician.

Lutosławski started piano lessons in Warsaw for two years from the age of six. After the <a href="Polish-Soviet%20War">Polish-Soviet War</a> the family left Warsaw to return to Drozdowo, but after a few years of running the estates with limited success, his mother returned to Warsaw. She worked as a physician, and translated books for children from English. In 1924 Lutosławski entered secondary school (<a href="Gimnazjum%20i%20Liceum%20im.%20Stefana%20Batorego%20%28Warsaw%2C%20Poland%29">Stefan Batory Gymnasium</a>) while continuing piano lessons. A performance of <a href="Karol%20Szymanowski">Karol Szymanowski</a>'s "Third Symphony" deeply affected him. In 1925 he started violin lessons at the Warsaw Music School. In 1931 he enrolled at <a href="Warsaw%20University">Warsaw University</a> to study mathematics, and in 1932 he formally joined the composition classes at the Conservatory. His only composition teacher was <a href="Witold%20Maliszewski">Witold Maliszewski</a>, a renowned Polish composer who had been a pupil of <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov</a>. Lutosławski was given a strong grounding in musical structures, particularly <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movements</a> in <a href="sonata%20form">sonata form</a>. In 1932 he gave up the violin, and in 1933 he discontinued his mathematics studies to concentrate on the piano and composition. As a student of <a href="Jerzy%20Lefeld">Jerzy Lefeld</a>, he gained a diploma for piano performance from the Conservatory in 1936, after presenting a virtuoso program including <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>'s "<a href="Toccata">Toccata</a>" and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%204%20%28Beethoven%29">fourth piano concerto</a>. His diploma for composition was awarded by the same institution in 1937.

Military service followed—Lutosławski was trained in signalling and radio operating in Zegrze near Warsaw. He completed his "Symphonic Variations" in 1939, and the work was premiered by the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by <a href="Grzegorz%20Fitelberg">Grzegorz Fitelberg</a>, and this performance was broadcast on radio on 9 March 1939. Like most young Polish composers, Lutosławski wanted to continue his education in Paris. His plans for further musical study were dashed in September 1939, when <a href="Invasion%20of%20Poland">Germany invaded western Poland</a> and <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Poland">Russia invaded eastern Poland</a>. Lutosławski was mobilised with the radio unit for the <a href="Krak%C3%B3w%20Army">Kraków Army</a>. He was soon captured by German soldiers, but he escaped while being marched to prison camp, and walked back to Warsaw. Lutosławski's brother was captured by Russian soldiers and later died in a <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>n <a href="Labor%20camp">labour camp</a>.

To earn a living, Lutosławski joined as an arranger-pianist "Dana Ensemble", the first Polish revellers, singing in "Ziemiańska Cafe". Then he formed a piano duo with friend and fellow composer <a href="Andrzej%20Panufnik">Andrzej Panufnik</a>, and they performed together in Warsaw cafés. Their repertoire consisted of a wide range of music in their own arrangements, including the first incarnation of Lutosławski's "Paganini Variations", a highly original transcription of the <a href="Caprice%20No.%2024%20%28Paganini%29">24th Caprice</a> for solo violin by <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Paganini">Niccolò Paganini</a>. Defiantly, they even sometimes played Polish music (the Nazis banned Polish music in Poland—including Chopin), and composed Resistance songs. Listening in cafés was the only way in which the Poles of German-occupied Warsaw could hear live music; putting on concerts was impossible since the Germans occupying Poland prohibited any organised gatherings. In café "Aria", where they played, Lutosławski met his future wife Maria Danuta Bogusławska, a sister of the writer <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Dygat">Stanisław Dygat</a>.

Lutosławski left Warsaw in July 1944 with his mother, merely a few days before the <a href="Warsaw%20Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a>, salvaging only a few scores and sketches—the rest of his music was lost during the complete destruction of the city by Germans after the fall of uprising, as were the family's Drozdowo estates. Of the 200 or so arrangements that Lutosławski and Panufnik had worked on for their piano duo, only Lutosławski's "Paganini Variations" survived. Lutosławski returned to the ruins of Warsaw after the Polish-Soviet treaty in April 1945.

During the postwar years, Lutosławski worked on his first symphony—sketches of which he had salvaged from Warsaw—which he had started in 1941 and which was first performed in 1948, conducted by Fitelberg. To provide for his family, he also composed music that he termed "functional", such as the "Warsaw Suite" (written to accompany a silent film depicting the city's reconstruction), sets of "Polish Carols", and the study pieces for piano, "Melodie Ludowe" ("Folk Melodies").

In 1945, Lutosławski was elected as secretary and treasurer of the newly constituted (ZKP—"Związek Kompozytorów Polskich"). In 1946, he married Danuta Bogusławska. The marriage was a lasting one, and Danuta's drafting skills were of great value to the composer: she became his copyist, and she solved some of the notational challenges of his later works.

In 1947, the <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> political climate led to the adoption and imposition by the ruling <a href="Polish%20United%20Workers%27%20Party">Polish United Workers' Party</a> of the tenets of <a href="Socialist%20realism">Socialist realism</a>, and the authorities' condemnation of modern music which was deemed to be non-conformist. This artistic censorship, which ultimately came from <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a> personally, was to some degree prevalent over the whole <a href="Eastern%20bloc">Eastern bloc</a>, and was reinforced by the 1948 <a href="Zhdanov%20Doctrine">Zhdanov decree</a>. By 1948, the ZKP was taken over by musicians willing to follow the party line on musical matters, and Lutosławski resigned from the committee. He was implacably opposed to the ideas of Socialist realism. His "First Symphony" was proscribed as "formalist", and he found himself shunned by the Soviet authorities, a situation that continued throughout the era of <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Khrushchev</a>, <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Brezhnev</a>, <a href="Yuri%20Andropov">Andropov</a> and <a href="Konstantin%20Chernenko">Chernenko</a>. In 1954, the climate of musical oppression drove his friend Andrzej Panufnik to <a href="defector">defect</a> to the United Kingdom. Against this background, Lutosławski was content to compose pieces for which there was social need, but in 1954 this earned him—much to the composer's chagrin—the Prime Minister's Prize for a set of children's songs. He commented: "[I]t was for those functional compositions of mine that the authorities decorated me ... I realised that I was not writing indifferent little pieces, only to make a living, but was carrying on an artistic creative activity in the eyes of the outside world."

It was his substantial and original <a href="Concerto%20for%20Orchestra%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">Concerto for Orchestra</a> of 1954 that established Lutosławski as an important composer of art music. The work, commissioned in 1950 by the conductor <a href="Witold%20Rowicki">Witold Rowicki</a> for the newly reconstituted Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra, earned the composer two state prizes in the following year.

<a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>'s death in 1953 allowed a certain relaxation of the cultural totalitarianism in Russia and its <a href="Eastern%20bloc">satellite states</a>. By 1956, <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%23De-Stalinization%20and%20the%20Khrushchev%20era">political events</a> had led to a partial thawing of the musical climate, and the <a href="Warsaw%20Autumn">Warsaw Autumn</a> Festival of Contemporary Music was founded. Conceived as a biennial festival, it has been held annually ever since 1958 (except under <a href="Martial%20law%20in%20Poland">Martial law in 1982</a> when, in protest, the ZKP refused to organise it). The first performance of his "<a href="Musique%20fun%C3%A8bre">Musique funèbre</a>" (in Polish, "Muzyka żałobna", English "Funereal Music" or "Music of Mourning") took place in 1958. It was written to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the death of <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Béla Bartók</a>, but took the composer four years to complete. This work brought international recognition, the annual ZKP prize and the <a href="International%20Rostrum%20of%20Composers">International Rostrum of Composers</a> prize in 1959. Lutosławski's <a href="harmony">harmonic</a> and <a href="counterpoint">contrapuntal</a> thinking were developed in this work, and in the "Five songs" of 1956–57, as he introduced his twelve-note system, the fruits of many years of thought and experiment. He established another feature of his compositional technique, which became a Lutosławski signature, when he began introducing randomness into the exact <a href="synchronization">synchronisation</a> of various parts of the musical ensemble in "<a href="Jeux%20v%C3%A9nitiens">Jeux vénitiens</a>" ("Venetian games"). These harmonic and temporal techniques became part of every subsequent work, and integral to his style.

In a departure from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym "Derwid". Mostly <a href="waltz">waltz</a>es, <a href="Tango%20music">tangos</a>, <a href="Foxtrot%20%28dance%29">foxtrots</a> and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish "actors' songs". Their place in Lutosławski's output may be seen as less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music during the war, and in the light of his relationship by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer <a href="Kalina%20J%C4%99drusik">Kalina Jędrusik</a> (who was his wife's sister-in-law).

In 1963, Lutosławski fulfilled a commission for the <a href="Music%20Biennale%20Zagreb">Music Biennale Zagreb</a>, his "Trois poèmes d'Henri Michaux" for chorus and orchestra. It was the first work he had written for a commission from abroad, and brought him further international acclaim. It earned him a second State Prize for music (Lutosławski was not cynical about the award this time), and Lutosławski gained an agreement for the international publication of his music with <a href="Chester%20Music">Chester Music</a>, then part of the Hansen publishing house. His <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">String Quartet</a> was first performed in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> in 1965, followed the same year by the first performance of his orchestral <a href="song%20cycle">song-cycle</a> "Paroles tissées". This shortened title was suggested by the poet <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Chabrun">Jean-François Chabrun</a>, who had published the poems as "Quatre tapisseries pour la Châtelaine de Vergi". The song cycle is dedicated to the tenor <a href="Peter%20Pears">Peter Pears</a>, who first performed it at the 1965 <a href="Aldeburgh%20Festival">Aldeburgh Festival</a> with the composer conducting. The Aldeburgh Festival was founded and organised by <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a>, with whom the composer formed a lasting friendship.

Shortly after this, Lutosławski started work on his <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">Second Symphony</a>, which had two premieres: <a href="Pierre%20Boulez">Pierre Boulez</a> conducted the second movement, "Direct", in 1966, and when the first movement, "Hésitant", was finished in 1967, the composer conducted a complete performance in <a href="Katowice">Katowice</a>. The "Second Symphony" is very different from a conventional classical <a href="symphony">symphony</a> in structure, but Lutosławski used all of his technical innovations up to that point to build a large-scale, dramatic work worthy of the name. In 1968, the work earned Lutosławski first prize from the <a href="International%20Music%20Council">International Music Council</a>'s <a href="International%20Rostrum%20of%20Composers">International Rostrum of Composers</a>, his third such award, which confirmed his growing international reputation. In 1967 Lutosławski was awarded the <a href="L%C3%A9onie%20Sonning%20Music%20Prize">Léonie Sonning Music Prize</a>, Denmark's highest musical honour.

The "Second Symphony", and "Livre pour orchestre" and the "<a href="Cello%20Concerto%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">Cello Concerto</a>" which followed, were composed during a particularly traumatic period in Lutosławski's life. His mother died in 1967, and in 1967–70 there was a great deal of unrest in Poland. This sprang first from the suppression of the theatre production "<a href="Dziady%20%28poem%29">Dziady</a>", which sparked a summer of protests; later, in 1968, the use of Polish troops to suppress the liberal reforms in <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>'s <a href="Prague%20Spring">Prague Spring</a>, and the <a href="Gda%C5%84sk%20Shipyard">Gdańsk Shipyard</a>s strike of 1970—which led to a violent clampdown by the authorities, both caused significant political and social tension in Poland. Lutosławski did not support the Soviet regime, and these events have been postulated as reasons for the increase in antagonistic effects in his work, particularly the "Cello Concerto" of 1968–70 for <a href="Rostropovich">Rostropovich</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a>. Indeed, Rostropovich's own opposition to the Soviet regime in Russia was just coming to a head (he shortly afterwards declared his support for the dissident <a href="Aleksandr%20Solzhenitsyn">Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>). Lutosławski himself did not hold the view that such influences had a direct effect on his music, although he acknowledged that they impinged on his creative world to some degree. In any case, the "Cello Concerto" was a great success, earning both Lutosławski and Rostropovich accolades. At the work's première with the <a href="Bournemouth%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Bliss">Arthur Bliss</a> presented Rostropovich with the Royal Philharmonic Society's gold medal.

In 1973, Lutosławski attended a recital given by the baritone <a href="Dietrich%20Fischer-Dieskau">Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</a> with the pianist <a href="Sviatoslav%20Richter">Sviatoslav Richter</a> in Warsaw; he met the singer after the concert and this inspired him to write his extended orchestral song "<a href="Les%20Espaces%20du%20sommeil">Les Espaces du sommeil</a>" ("The spaces of sleep"). This work, "Preludes and Fugue", "Mi-Parti" (a French expression that roughly translates as "divided into two equal but different parts"), "Novelette", and a short piece for cello in honour of <a href="Paul%20Sacher">Paul Sacher</a>'s seventieth birthday, occupied Lutosławski throughout the 1970s, while in the background he was working away at a projected third symphony and a "concertante" piece for the <a href="oboe">oboist</a> <a href="Heinz%20Holliger">Heinz Holliger</a>. These latter pieces were proving difficult to complete as Lutosławski struggled to introduce greater fluency into his sound world and to reconcile tensions between the harmonic and melodic aspects of his style, and between foreground and background. The <a href="Double%20Concerto%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">Double Concerto for oboe, harp and chamber orchestra</a>—commissioned by Paul Sacher—was finally finished in 1980, and the <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">Third Symphony</a> in 1983. In 1977 he received the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Builders%20of%20People%27s%20Poland">Order of the Builders of People's Poland</a>. In 1983 he received the <a href="Ernst%20von%20Siemens%20Music%20Prize">Ernst von Siemens Music Prize</a>.

During this period, Poland was undergoing yet more upheaval: in 1980, the influential movement <a href="Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29">Solidarność</a> was created, led by <a href="Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa">Lech Wałęsa</a>; and in 1981, <a href="Martial%20law%20in%20Poland">martial law</a> was declared by General <a href="Wojciech%20Jaruzelski">Wojciech Jaruzelski</a>. From 1981–89, Lutosławski refused all professional engagements in Poland as a gesture of solidarity with the artists' <a href="boycott">boycott</a>. He refused to enter the Culture Ministry to meet any of the ministers, and was careful not be photographed in their company. In 1983, as a gesture of support, he sent a recording of the first performance (in Chicago) of the "Third Symphony" to Gdańsk to be played to strikers in a local church. In 1983, he was awarded the Solidarity prize, of which Lutosławski was reported to be more proud than any other of his honours.

He also bought a house in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> and had a cabin in the Norwegian countryside. He and his wife would stay here several times a year to be near her son from an earlier marriage, who was a Norwegian citizen.

Through the mid-1980s, Lutosławski composed three pieces called "Łańcuch" ("Chain"), which refers to the way the music is constructed from contrasting strands which overlap like the links of a chain. "Chain 2" was written for <a href="Anne-Sophie%20Mutter">Anne-Sophie Mutter</a> (commissioned by Paul Sacher), and for Mutter he also orchestrated his slightly earlier "Partita" for violin and piano, providing a new linking Interlude, so that when played together the Partita, Interlude and "Chain 2" form his longest work.

The Third Symphony earned Lutosławski the first <a href="Grawemeyer%20Award%20%28Music%20Composition%29">Grawemeyer Prize</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville">University of Louisville</a>, <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, awarded in 1985. The significance of the prize lay not just in its prestige—other eminent nominations have included <a href="Elliott%20Carter">Elliott Carter</a> and <a href="Michael%20Tippett">Michael Tippett</a>—but in the size of its financial award (then US$150,000). The intention of the award is to remove recipients' financial concerns for a period to allow them to concentrate on serious composition. In a gesture of <a href="altruism">altruism</a>, Lutosławski announced that he would use the fund to set up a scholarship to enable young Polish composers to study abroad; Lutosławski also directed that his fee from the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Symphony%20Orchestra">San Francisco Symphony Orchestra</a> for "Chain 3" should go to this scholarship fund.

In 1987 Lutosławski was presented (by <a href="Michael%20Tippett">Michael Tippett</a>) with the rarely awarded <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society%23The%20Gold%20Medal">Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal</a> during a concert in which Lutosławski conducted his Third Symphony; also that year a major celebration of his work was made at the <a href="Huddersfield%20Contemporary%20Music%20Festival">Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival</a>. In addition, he was awarded <a href="honorary%20doctorate">honorary doctorate</a>s at several universities worldwide, including <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a>.

Lutosławski was at this time writing his <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">Piano Concerto</a> for <a href="Krystian%20Zimerman">Krystian Zimerman</a>, commissioned by the <a href="Salzburg%20Festival">Salzburg Festival</a>. His earliest plans to write a piano concerto dated from 1938; he was himself in his younger days a <a href="virtuoso">virtuoso</a> pianist. It was a performance of this work and the Third Symphony at the Warsaw Autumn Festival in 1988 that marked the composer's return to the conductor's podium in Poland, after substantive talks had been arranged between the government and the opposition.

Lutosławski also, around 1990, worked on a fourth symphony and his orchestral song-cycle "<a href="Chantefleurs%20et%20Chantefables">Chantefleurs et Chantefables</a>" for <a href="soprano">soprano</a>. The latter was first performed at a <a href="The%20Proms">Prom</a> concert in London in 1991, and the Fourth Symphony in 1993 with the composer conducting the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Philharmonic">Los Angeles Philharmonic</a>. In between, and after initial reluctance, Lutosławski took on the presidency of the newly reconstituted "<a href="Polish%20Cultural%20Council">Polish Cultural Council</a>". This had been set up after the reforms in 1989 in Poland brought about by the almost total support for Solidarity in <a href="Polish%20legislative%20election%2C%201989">the elections of that year</a>, and the subsequent end of communist rule and the reinstatement of Poland as an independent republic rather than the <a href="communist%20state">communist state</a> of the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland">People's Republic of Poland</a>.
He continued his busy schedule, travelling to the United States, England, Finland, Canada and Japan, and sketching a violin concerto, but by the first week of 1994 it was clear that cancer had taken hold, and after an operation the composer weakened quickly and died on 7 February at the age of eighty-one. He had, a few weeks before, been awarded Poland's highest honour, the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20White%20Eagle%20%28Poland%29">Order of the White Eagle</a> (only the second person to receive this since the collapse of communism in Poland—the first had been <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>). He was cremated; his wife Danuta died shortly afterwards.

Lutosławski described musical composition as a search for listeners who think and feel the same way he did—he once called it "fishing for souls".

A complete list of Lutosławski's compositions in chronological order can be found at <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20150402124732/http%3A//www.usc.edu/dept/polish_music/VEPM/lutos/lu-wrk-f.html">"The Polish Music Center"</a>.

Lutosławski's works up until and including the "Dance Preludes" clearly show the influence of Polish <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a>, both harmonically and melodically. Part of his art was in transforming folk music, rather than quoting it exactly. In some cases, folk music is unrecognisable as such without careful analysis, for example, in the <a href="Concerto%20for%20Orchestra%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">Concerto for Orchestra</a>. As Lutosławski developed the techniques of his mature compositions, he stopped using folk material explicitly, although its influence remained as subtle features until the end. As he said, "[in those days] I could not compose as I wished, so I composed as I was able", and about this change of direction he said, "I was simply not so interested in it [using folk music]". Also, Lutosławski was dissatisfied with composing in a "post-tonal" idiom: while composing the first symphony, he felt that this was for him a "cul-de-sac".

In "Five Songs" (1956–57) and "<a href="Musique%20fun%C3%A8bre">Musique funèbre</a>" (1958) Lutosławski introduced his own brand of <a href="Twelve-tone%20technique">twelve-tone music</a>, marking his departure from the explicit use of folk music. His twelve-tone technique allowed him to build harmony and melody from specific intervals (in "Musique funèbre", <a href="augmented%20fourth">augmented fourth</a>s and <a href="semitone">semitone</a>s). This system also gave him the means to write dense <a href="Chord%20%28music%29">chords</a> without resorting to <a href="tone%20cluster">tone cluster</a>s, and enabled him to build towards these dense chords (which often include all twelve notes of the chromatic scale) at climactic moments. Lutosławski's twelve-note techniques were thus completely different in conception from <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>'s <a href="tone-row">tone-row</a> system, although "Musique funèbre"' does happen to be based on a tone row. This twelve-note intervallic technique had its genesis in earlier works such as Symphony No. 1, and "Paganini Variations".

Although "Musique funèbre" was internationally acclaimed, his new harmonic techniques led to something of a crisis for Lutosławski, during which he still could not see how to express his musical ideas. Then on 16 March 1960, listening to Polish Radio broadcast on new music, he happened to hear <a href="John%20Cage">John Cage</a>'s "Concert for Piano and Orchestra". Although he was not influenced by the sound or the philosophy of the music, Cage's explorations of <a href="Indeterminacy%20%28music%29">indeterminacy</a> set off a train of thought which resulted in Lutosławski finding a way to retain the harmonic structures he wanted while introducing the freedom for which he was searching. His "Three Postludes" were hastily rounded off (he had intended to write four) and he moved on to compose works in which he explored these new ideas.

In works from "<a href="Jeux%20v%C3%A9nitiens">Jeux vénitiens</a>", Lutosławski wrote long passages in which the parts of the ensemble are not to be <a href="synchronization">synchronised</a> exactly. At cues from the conductor, each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way, the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term "aleatory" are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski <a href="Musical%20notation">notated</a> the music exactly; there is no <a href="improvisation">improvisation</a>, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus no doubt about how the musical performance is to be realised.

For his <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Lutos%C5%82awski%29">String Quartet</a>, Lutosławski had produced only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind them in a full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, as is the case with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking them together in boxes (which Lutosławski called "mobiles"), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.

Lutosławski's called this technique of his mature period "limited aleatorism". This controlled freedom given to the individual musicians is contrasted with passages where the orchestra is asked to synchronise their parts; the score for these passages is notated conventionally using <a href="bar%20%28music%29">bars (measures)</a> and <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s.

Both Lutosławski's harmonic and aleatory processes are illustrated by "example 1", an excerpt from "Hésitant", the first movement of the Symphony No. 2. At number 7, the conductor gives a cue to the flutes, celesta and percussionist, who then play their parts in their own time, without any attempt to synchronise with the other instrumentalists. The harmony of this section is based on a 12-note chord built from <a href="major%20second">major second</a>s and <a href="perfect%20fourth">perfect fourth</a>s. After all the instrumentalists have finished their parts, a two-second general pause is indicated (P.G. 2" at top right of the example). The conductor then gives a cue at number 8 (and indicates the tempo of the following section) for two oboes and the cor anglais. They each play their part, again with no attempt to synchronise with the other players. The harmony of this part is based on the hexachord F–G–A–C–D–D, arranged in such a way that the harmony of the section never includes any sixths or thirds. When the conductor gives another cue at number 9, the players each continue until they reach the <a href="repeat%20sign">repeat sign</a>, and then stop: they are unlikely to end the section at the same time. This "refrain" (from numbers 8 to 9) recurs throughout the movement, slightly altered each time, but always played by double-reed instruments which do not play elsewhere in the movement: Lutosławski thus also carefully controls the orchestral palette.

The combination of Lutosławski's aleatory techniques and his harmonic discoveries allowed him to build up complex <a href="texture%20%28music%29">musical textures</a>. According to Bodman Rae, in his later works Lutosławski evolved a more mobile, simpler, harmonic style, in which less of the music is played with an "ad libitum" coordination. This development first appeared in the brief "Epitaph" for oboe and piano, around the time Lutosławski was struggling to find the technical means to complete his Third Symphony. In chamber works for just two instrumentalists the scope for aleatory counterpoint and dense harmonies is significantly less than for orchestra, but these developments also influenced his orchestral style in late works including the Piano Concerto, "<a href="Chantefleurs%20et%20Chantefables">Chantefleurs et Chantefables</a>", "Chain 2" and the "Fourth Symphony", which require mostly conventional coordination.

Lutosławski's formidable technical developments grew out of his creative imperative; that he left a lasting body of major compositions is a testament to his resolution of purpose in the face of the anti-<a href="formalism%20%28music%29">formalist</a> authorities under which he formulated his methods.

Lutosławski's life, as well as detailed and thorough discussion of Lutosławski's music and compositional techniques, can be found in both Stucky (1981) and Bodman Rae (1994, 1996, 1999), but also in "Witold Lutosławski – Guide to Warsaw" (2013) by the National Institute of Fryderyk Chopin.

Endometrial cancer

Endometrial cancer is a <a href="cancer">cancer</a> that arises from the <a href="endometrium">endometrium</a> (the <a href="epithelium">lining</a> of the <a href="uterus">uterus</a> or womb). It is the result of the abnormal growth of <a href="cells%20%28biology%29">cells</a> that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often <a href="vaginal%20bleeding">vaginal bleeding</a> not associated with a <a href="menstrual%20period">menstrual period</a>. Other symptoms include <a href="dysuria">pain with urination</a>, <a href="dyspareunia">pain during sexual intercourse</a>, or <a href="pelvic%20pain">pelvic pain</a>. Endometrial cancer occurs most commonly after <a href="menopause">menopause</a>.
Approximately 40% of cases are related to obesity. Endometrial cancer is also associated with excessive <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a> exposure, <a href="hypertension">high blood pressure</a> and <a href="diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes</a>. Whereas taking estrogen alone increases the risk of endometrial cancer, taking both estrogen and a <a href="progestogen">progestogen</a> in combination, as in most <a href="birth%20control%20pills">birth control pills</a>, decreases the risk. Between two and five percent of cases are related to genes inherited from the parents. Endometrial cancer is sometimes loosely referred to as "<a href="uterine%20cancer">uterine cancer</a>", although it is distinct from other forms of uterine cancer such as <a href="cervical%20cancer">cervical cancer</a>, <a href="uterine%20sarcoma">uterine sarcoma</a>, and <a href="trophoblastic%20disease">trophoblastic disease</a>. The most frequent <a href="Histopathology">type</a> of endometrial cancer is endometrioid <a href="carcinoma">carcinoma</a>, which accounts for more than 80% of cases. Endometrial cancer is commonly diagnosed by <a href="endometrial%20biopsy">endometrial biopsy</a> or by taking samples during a procedure known as <a href="dilation%20and%20curettage">dilation and curettage</a>. A <a href="pap%20smear">pap smear</a> is not typically sufficient to show endometrial cancer. Regular screening in those at normal risk is not called for.
The leading treatment option for endometrial cancer is <a href="abdominal%20hysterectomy">abdominal hysterectomy</a> (the total removal by <a href="surgery">surgery</a> of the uterus), together with removal of the <a href="fallopian%20tube">fallopian tube</a>s and <a href="ovary">ovaries</a> on both sides, called a bilateral <a href="salpingo-oophorectomy">salpingo-oophorectomy</a>. In more advanced cases, <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a>, <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> or <a href="hormone%20therapy">hormone therapy</a> may also be recommended. If the disease is diagnosed at an early <a href="Cancer%20staging">stage</a>, the <a href="prognosis">outcome</a> is favorable, and the overall <a href="five-year%20survival%20rate">five-year survival rate</a> in the United States is greater than 80%.
In 2012, endometrial cancers newly occurred in 320,000 women and caused 76,000 deaths. This makes it the third most common cause of death in cancers which only affect women, behind <a href="ovarian%20cancer">ovarian</a> and cervical cancer. It is more common in the developed world and is the most common cancer of the <a href="female%20reproductive%20tract">female reproductive tract</a> in developed countries. Rates of endometrial cancer have risen in a number of countries between the 1980s and 2010. This is believed to be due to the increasing number of elderly people and increasing rates of obesity.

<a href="Vaginal%20bleeding">Vaginal bleeding</a> or spotting in women after <a href="menopause">menopause</a> occurs in 90% of endometrial cancer. Bleeding is especially common with <a href="adenocarcinoma">adenocarcinoma</a>, occurring in two-thirds of all cases. Abnormal <a href="menstrual%20cycle">menstrual cycle</a>s or extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of bleeding in women before menopause may also be a sign of endometrial cancer.

Symptoms other than bleeding are not common. Other symptoms include thin white or clear <a href="vaginal%20discharge">vaginal discharge</a> in postmenopausal women. More advanced disease shows more obvious symptoms or signs that can be detected on a <a href="physical%20examination">physical examination</a>. The uterus may become enlarged or the cancer may spread, causing lower abdominal pain or pelvic cramping. <a href="Dyspareunia">Painful sexual intercourse</a> or <a href="dysuria">painful or difficult urination</a> are less common signs of endometrial cancer. The uterus may also fill with pus (<a href="pyometrea">pyometrea</a>). Of women with these less common symptoms (vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, and pus), 10–15% have cancer.

Risk factors for endometrial cancer include <a href="obesity">obesity</a>, <a href="diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes mellitus</a>, <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a>, use of <a href="tamoxifen">tamoxifen</a>, <a href="nulliparity">never having had a child</a>, late menopause, high levels of <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a>, and increasing age. Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, show that there is some environmental component to endometrial cancer. These environmental <a href="risk%20factor">risk factor</a>s are not well characterized.

Most of the risk factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An estimated 40% of cases are thought to be related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of <a href="adipose%20tissue">adipose tissue</a> increases conversion of <a href="androstenedione">androstenedione</a> into <a href="estrone">estrone</a>, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes <a href="oligo-ovulation">less</a> or <a href="anovulation">no ovulation</a> and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. <a href="Polycystic%20ovary%20syndrome">Polycystic ovary syndrome</a> (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, type II diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for Type I endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.

<a href="Estrogen%20replacement%20therapy">Estrogen replacement therapy</a> during menopause when not balanced (or "opposed") with <a href="progestin">progestin</a> is another risk factor. Higher doses or longer periods of estrogen therapy have higher risks of endometrial cancer. Women of lower weight are at greater risk from unopposed estrogen. A longer period of fertility—either from an early <a href="menarche">first menstrual period</a> or late menopause—is also a risk factor. Unopposed estrogen raises an individual's risk of endometrial cancer by 2–10 fold, depending on weight and length of therapy. In <a href="trans%20men">trans men</a> who take <a href="testosterone%20%28medication%29">testosterone</a> and have not had a hysterectomy, the conversion of testosterone into estrogen via androstenedione may lead to a higher risk of endometrial cancer.

<a href="Genetic%20disorder">Genetic disorder</a>s can also cause endometrial cancer. Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of endometrial cancer cases. <a href="Lynch%20syndrome">Lynch syndrome</a>, an <a href="autosomal%20dominant">autosomal dominant</a> genetic disorder that mainly causes <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a>, also causes endometrial cancer, especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60% risk of developing endometrial cancer, higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and endometrial cancer develop simultaneously in 20% of people. Endometrial cancer nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11 years before. <a href="Carcinogenesis">Carcinogenesis</a> in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in <a href="MLH1">MLH1</a> and/or <a href="MLH2">MLH2</a>: genes that participate in the process of <a href="mismatch%20repair">mismatch repair</a>, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include <a href="MSH2">MSH2</a>, <a href="MSH6">MSH6</a>, and <a href="PMS2">PMS2</a>, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of endometrial cancer cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of endometrial cancer. With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.

Women with a family history of endometrial cancer are at higher risk. Two genes most commonly associated with some other women's cancers, <a href="BRCA1">BRCA1</a> and <a href="BRCA2">BRCA2</a>, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition <a href="Cowden%20syndrome">Cowden syndrome</a> can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10% lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3% risk for unaffected women.

Common genetic variation has also been found to affect endometrial cancer risk in large-scale <a href="Genome-wide%20association%20study">genome-wide association studies</a>. Sixteen genomic regions have been associated with endometrial cancer and the common variants explain up to 7% of the familial relative risk.

Some therapies for other forms of cancer increase the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2–3%. Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat <a href="Breast%20cancer%23Classification">estrogen-positive breast cancers</a>, has been associated with endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer. A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. <a href="Raloxifene">Raloxifene</a>, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer. Previously having <a href="ovarian%20cancer">ovarian cancer</a> is a risk factor for endometrial cancer, as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian <a href="granulosa%20cell%20tumor">granulosa cell tumor</a>s and <a href="thecoma">thecoma</a>s are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.

<a href="Immunodeficiency">Low immune function</a> has also been implicated in endometrial cancer. <a href="Hypertension">High blood pressure</a> is also a risk factor, but this may be because of its association with obesity. <a href="Sitting">Sitting</a> regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.

<a href="Smoking">Smoking</a> and the use of progestin are both protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the <a href="combined%20oral%20contraceptive">combined oral contraceptive</a> pill and the hormonal <a href="intrauterine%20device">intrauterine device</a> (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than five infants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18 months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of <a href="soy">soy</a> is protective.

Endometrial cancer forms when there are errors in normal endometrial <a href="cell%20cycle">cell growth</a>. Usually, when cells grow old or get damaged, they <a href="apoptosis">die</a>, and new cells take their place. Cancer starts when new cells form unneeded, and old or damaged cells do not die as they should. The buildup of extra cells often forms a mass of tissue called a growth or tumor. These abnormal cancer cells have many <a href="genetic%20mutation">genetic abnormalities</a> that cause them to grow excessively.

In 10–20% of endometrial cancers, mostly Grade 3 (the highest <a href="Grading%20%28tumors%29">histologic grade</a>), <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s are found in a <a href="tumor%20suppressor">tumor suppressor</a> gene, commonly <a href="p53">p53</a> or <a href="PTEN%20%28gene%29">PTEN</a>. In 20% of <a href="endometrial%20hyperplasia">endometrial hyperplasia</a>s and 50% of <a href="endometrioid%20cancer">endometrioid cancer</a>s, PTEN suffers a <a href="loss-of-function%20mutation">loss-of-function mutation</a> or a <a href="null%20mutation">null mutation</a>, making it less effective or completely ineffective. Loss of PTEN function leads to up-regulation of the PI3k/Akt/mTOR pathway, which causes cell growth. The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer. When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed, the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive. P53 mutations and <a href="chromosome%20instability">chromosome instability</a> are associated with serous carcinomas, which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas. Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from <a href="endometrial%20intraepithelial%20carcinoma">endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma</a>.

PTEN and <a href="p27%20%28gene%29">p27</a> loss of function mutations are associated with a good prognosis, particularly in obese women. The <a href="Her2/neu">Her2/neu</a> <a href="oncogene">oncogene</a>, which indicates a poor prognosis, is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and serous carcinomas. <a href="CTNNB1">CTNNB1</a> (beta-catenin; a <a href="transcription%20%28genetics%29">transcription</a> gene) mutations are found in 14–44% of endometrial cancers and may indicate a good prognosis, but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in endometrial cancers with <a href="squamous%20cell">squamous cell</a>s. <a href="FGFR2">FGFR2</a> mutations are found in approximately 10% of endometrial cancers, and their prognostic significance is unclear. <a href="SPOP">SPOP</a> is another tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.

Type I and Type II cancers (explained below) tend to have different mutations involved. ARID1A, which often carries a <a href="point%20mutation">point mutation</a> in Type I endometrial cancer, is also mutated in 26% of clear cell carcinomas of the endometrium, and 18% of serous carcinomas. <a href="Gene%20silencing">Epigenetic silencing</a> and <a href="point%20mutations">point mutations</a> of several genes are commonly found in Type I endometrial cancer. Mutations in tumor suppressor genes are common in Type II endometrial cancer. <a href="PIK3CA">PIK3CA</a> is commonly mutated in both Type I and Type II cancers. In women with Lynch syndrome-associated endometrial cancer, <a href="microsatellite%20instability">microsatellite instability</a> is common.

Development of an <a href="endometrial%20hyperplasia">endometrial hyperplasia</a> (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is a significant risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do develop into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can develop without the presence of a hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias develop into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the <a href="cell%20nucleus">nuclei</a>. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as <a href="endometrial%20intraepithelial%20neoplasia">endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia</a>. Mutations in the <a href="KRAS">KRAS</a> gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. <a href="Endometrial%20glandular%20dysplasia">Endometrial glandular dysplasia</a> occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.

Diagnosis of endometrial cancer is made first by a physical examination and <a href="dilation%20and%20curettage">dilation and curettage</a> (removal of endometrial tissue; D&C). This tissue is then examined histologically for characteristics of cancer. If cancer is found, medical imaging may be done to see whether the cancer has spread or invaded tissue.

Routine screening of asymptomatic people is not indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, should be aware of the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A <a href="cervical%20screening">cervical screening</a> test, such as a <a href="Pap%20smear">Pap smear</a>, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a <a href="pelvic%20examination">pelvic examination</a> are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. <a href="stenosis%20of%20uterine%20cervix">Cervical stenosis</a>, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or <a href="hematometra">hematometra</a>).

Women with <a href="Lynch%20syndrome">Lynch syndrome</a> should begin to have annual biopsy screening at the age of 35. Some women with Lynch syndrome elect to have a prophylactic hysterectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy to greatly reduce the risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer.

<a href="Transvaginal%20ultrasound">Transvaginal ultrasound</a> to examine the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used to aid in the diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an <a href="endometrial%20biopsy">endometrial biopsy</a> and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. <a href="CT%20scan">CT scan</a>s are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of <a href="metastasis">metastasis</a>). They can also be used to investigate extrapelvic disease. An <a href="MRI">MRI</a> can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.

Dilation and curettage or an endometrial biopsy are used to obtain a tissue sample for histological examination. Endometrial biopsy is the less invasive option, but it may not give conclusive results every time. <a href="Hysteroscopy">Hysteroscopy</a> only shows the gross anatomy of the endometrium, which is often not indicative of cancer, and is therefore not used, unless in conjunction with a biopsy. Hysteroscopy can be used to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. New evidence shows that D&C has a higher false negative rate than endometrial biopsy.

Before treatment is begun, several other investigations are recommended. These include a chest x-ray, <a href="liver%20function%20tests">liver function tests</a>, <a href="kidney%20function%20tests">kidney function tests</a>, and a test for levels of <a href="CA-125">CA-125</a>, a <a href="tumor%20marker">tumor marker</a> that can be elevated in endometrial cancer.

Endometrial cancers may be tumours derived from epithelial cells (carcinomas), mixed epithelial and mesenchymal tumours (carcinosarcomas), or mesenchymal tumours.

Traditional classification of endometrial carcinomas is based either on clinical and endocrine features (Type I and Type II), or histopathological characteristics (endometroid, serous, and clear-cell). Some tumours are difficult to classify and have features overlapping more than one category. High grade endometroid tumours in particular tend to have both type I and type II features.

The vast majority of endometrial cancers are carcinomas (usually adenocarcinomas), meaning that they originate from the single layer of <a href="epithelium">epithelial</a> cells that line the endometrium and form the endometrial glands. There are many <a href="histopathology">microscopic</a> subtypes of endometrial carcinoma, but they are broadly organized into two categories, Type I and Type II, based on clinical features and pathogenesis. The two subtypes are genetically distinct.

Type I endometrial carcinomas occur most commonly before and around the time of menopause. In the United States they are more common in <a href="White%20people">white women</a>, particularly those with a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type I endometrial cancers are often low-grade, minimally invasive into the underlying uterine wall (<a href="myometrium">myometrium</a>), estrogen-dependent, and have a good outcome with treatment. Type I carcinomas represent 75–90% of endometrial cancer.

Type II endometrial carcinomas usually occur in older, post-menopausal people, in the United States are more common in <a href="Black%20people">black women</a>, and are not associated with increased exposure to estrogen or a history of endometrial hyperplasia. Type II endometrial cancers are often high-grade, with deep invasion into the underlying uterine wall (myometrium), are of the <a href="uterine%20papillary%20serous%20carcinoma">serous</a> or <a href="uterine%20clear%20cell%20carcinoma">clear cell</a> type, and carry a poorer prognosis. They can appear to be <a href="epithelial%20ovarian%20cancer">epithelial ovarian cancer</a> on evaluation of symptoms. They tend to present later than Type I tumors and are more aggressive, with a greater risk of relapse and/or metastasis.

In endometrioid adenocarcinoma, the cancer cells grow in patterns reminiscent of normal endometrium, with many new glands formed from <a href="columnar%20epithelium">columnar epithelium</a> with some <a href="nuclear%20atypia">abnormal nuclei</a>. Low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have well differentiated cells, have not invaded the myometrium, and are seen alongside endometrial hyperplasia. The tumor's glands form very close together, without the <a href="stroma%20%28animal%20tissue%29">stromal</a> tissue that normally separates them. Higher-grade endometrioid adenocarcinomas have less well-differentiated cells, have more solid sheets of tumor cells no longer organized into glands, and are associated with an <a href="atrophy">atrophied</a> endometrium. There are several subtypes of endometrioid adenocarcinoma with similar prognoses, including villoglandular, secretory, and ciliated cell variants. There is also a subtype characterized by <a href="squamous">squamous</a> differentiation. Some endometrioid adenocarcinomas have foci of mucinous carcinoma.

The genetic mutations most commonly associated with endometrioid adenocarcinoma are in the genes PTEN, a tumor suppressor; PIK3CA, a <a href="kinase">kinase</a>; KRAS, a <a href="GTPase">GTPase</a> that functions in <a href="signal%20transduction">signal transduction</a>; and CTNNB1, involved in adhesion and cell signaling. The CTNNB1 (beta-catenin) gene is most commonly mutated in the squamous subtype of endometrioid adenocarcinoma.

Serous carcinoma is a Type II endometrial tumor that makes up 5–10% of diagnosed endometrial cancer and is common in postmenopausal women with atrophied endometrium and black women. Serous endometrial carcinoma is aggressive and often invades the myometrium and metastasizes within the peritoneum (seen as <a href="omental%20cake">omental caking</a>) or the lymphatic system. Histologically, it appears with many atypical nuclei, <a href="papilloma">papillary structures</a>, and, in contrast to endometrioid adenocarcinomas, rounded cells instead of columnar cells. Roughly 30% of endometrial serous carcinomas also have <a href="psammoma%20bodies">psammoma bodies</a>. Serous carcinomas spread differently than most other endometrial cancers; they can spread outside the uterus without invading the myometrium.

The genetic mutations seen in serous carcinoma are <a href="chromosomal%20instability">chromosomal instability</a> and mutations in <a href="TP53">TP53</a>, an important tumor suppressor gene.

Clear cell carcinoma is a Type II endometrial tumor that makes up less than 5% of diagnosed endometrial cancer. Like serous cell carcinoma, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis. Histologically, it is characterized by the features common to all <a href="clear%20cell">clear cell</a>s: the eponymous clear cytoplasm when <a href="H%26amp%3BE%20stain">H&E stain</a>ed and visible, distinct cell membranes. The p53 cell signaling system is not active in endometrial clear cell carcinoma. This form of endometrial cancer is more common in postmenopausal women.

<a href="Mucinous%20carcinoma">Mucinous carcinoma</a>s are a rare form of endometrial cancer, making up less than 1–2% of all diagnosed endometrial cancer. Mucinous endometrial carcinomas are most often stage I and grade I, giving them a good prognosis. They typically have well-differentiated columnar cells organized into glands with the characteristic <a href="mucin">mucin</a> in the cytoplasm. Mucinous carcinomas must be differentiated from <a href="cervical%20adenocarcinoma">cervical adenocarcinoma</a>.

Mixed carcinomas are those that have both Type I and Type II cells, with one making up at least 10% of the tumor. These include the malignant <a href="mixed%20M%C3%BCllerian%20tumor">mixed Müllerian tumor</a>, which derives from endometrial epithelium and has a poor prognosis.

Undifferentiated endometrial carcinomas make up less than 1–2% of diagnosed endometrial cancers. They have a worse prognosis than grade III tumors. Histologically, these tumors show sheets of identical epithelial cells with no identifiable pattern.

Non-metastatic <a href="squamous%20cell%20carcinoma">squamous cell carcinoma</a> and <a href="transitional%20cell%20carcinoma">transitional cell carcinoma</a> are very rare in the endometrium. Squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium has a poor prognosis. It has been reported fewer than 100 times in the medical literature since its characterization in 1892. For primary squamous cell carcinoma of the endometrium (PSCCE) to be diagnosed, there must be no other primary cancer in the endometrium or cervix and it must not be connected to the cervical epithelium. Because of the rarity of this cancer, there are no guidelines for how it should be treated, nor any typical treatment. The common genetic causes remain uncharacterized. Primary transitional cell carcinomas of the endometrium are even more rare; 16 cases had been reported . Its pathophysiology and treatments have not been characterized. Histologically, TCCE resembles endometrioid carcinoma and is distinct from other transitional cell carcinomas.

In contrast to endometrial carcinomas, the uncommon endometrial stromal <a href="sarcomas">sarcomas</a> are cancers that originate in the non-glandular <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a> of the endometrium. They are generally non-aggressive and, if they recur, can take decades. Metastases to the lungs and pelvic or peritoneal cavities are the most frequent. They typically have estrogen and/or progesterone receptors. The prognosis for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma is good, with 60–90% five-year survival. <a href="High-grade%20undifferentiated%20endometrial%20sarcoma">High-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma</a> (HGUS) has a worse prognosis, with high rates of recurrence and 25% five-year survival. HGUS prognosis is dictated by whether or not the cancer has invaded the arteries and veins. Without vascular invasion, the five-year survival is 83%; it drops to 17% when vascular invasion is observed. Stage I ESS has the best prognosis, with five-year survival of 98% and ten-year survival of 89%. ESS makes up 0.2% of uterine cancers.

Endometrial cancer frequently metastasizes to the ovaries and Fallopian tubes when the cancer is located in the upper part of the uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the <a href="serosa">serosa</a>, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the <a href="lymphatic%20system">lymphatic system</a> is involved, the <a href="pelvic%20lymph%20nodes">pelvic</a> and <a href="para-aortic%20lymph%20nodes">para-aortic nodes</a> are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the time, more than any other gynecologic cancer.

There is a three-tiered system for histologically classifying endometrial cancers, ranging from cancers with well-differentiated cells (grade I), to very poorly-differentiated cells (grade III). Grade I cancers are the least aggressive and have the best prognosis, while grade III tumors are the most aggressive and likely to recur. Grade II cancers are intermediate between grades I and III in terms of cell differentiation and aggressiveness of disease.

The histopathology of endometrial cancers is highly diverse. The most common finding is a well-differentiated endometrioid adenocarcinoma, which is composed of numerous, small, crowded glands with varying degrees of nuclear atypia, mitotic activity, and stratification. This often appears on a background of endometrial hyperplasia. Frank adenocarcinoma may be distinguished from atypical hyperplasia by the finding of clear stromal invasion, or "back-to-back" glands which represent nondestructive replacement of the endometrial stroma by the cancer. With progression of the disease, the myometrium is infiltrated.

Endometrial carcinoma is surgically staged using the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Gynecology%20and%20Obstetrics">FIGO</a> <a href="cancer%20staging">cancer staging</a> system. The 2009 FIGO staging system is as follows:

Myometrial invasion and involvement of the pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes are the most commonly seen patterns of spread. A Stage 0 is sometimes included, in this case it is referred to as "<a href="carcinoma%20in%20situ">carcinoma in situ</a>". In 26% of presumably early-stage cancers, intraoperative staging revealed pelvic and distant metastases, making comprehensive surgical staging necessary.

The initial treatment for endometrial cancer is surgery; 90% of women with endometrial cancer are treated with some form of surgery. Surgical treatment typically consists of <a href="hysterectomy">hysterectomy</a> including a bilateral <a href="salpingo-oophorectomy">salpingo-oophorectomy</a>, which is the removal of the uterus, and both ovaries and Fallopian tubes. <a href="Lymphadenectomy">Lymphadenectomy</a>, or removal of pelvic and para-aortic <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>s, is performed for tumors of histologic grade II or above. Lymphadenectomy is routinely performed for all stages of endometrial cancer in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, the lymph nodes are typically only removed with disease of stage II or greater. The topic of lymphadenectomy and what survival benefit it offers in stage I disease is still being debated. In stage III and IV cancers, <a href="cytoreductive%20surgery">cytoreductive surgery</a> is the norm, and a biopsy of the <a href="Greater%20omentum">omentum</a> may also be included. In stage IV disease, where there are distant metastases, surgery can be used as part of palliative therapy. <a href="Laparotomy">Laparotomy</a>, an open-abdomen procedure, is the traditional surgical procedure; however, <a href="laparoscopy">laparoscopy</a> (keyhole surgery) is associated with lower operative morbidity. The two procedures have no difference in overall survival. <a href="Abdominal%20hysterectomy">Removal of the uterus via the abdomen</a> is recommended over <a href="vaginal%20hysterectomy">removal of the uterus via the vagina</a> because it gives the opportunity to examine and obtain <a href="peritoneal%20washing">washings</a> of the abdominal cavity to detect any further evidence of cancer. Staging of the cancer is done during the surgery.

The few contraindications to surgery include inoperable tumor, massive obesity, a particularly high-risk operation, or a desire to preserve fertility. These contraindications happen in about 5–10% of cases. Women who wish to preserve their fertility and have low-grade stage I cancer can be treated with progestins, with or without concurrent tamoxifen therapy. This therapy can be continued until the cancer does not respond to treatment or until childbearing is done. <a href="Uterine%20perforation">Uterine perforation</a> may occur during a D&C or an endometrial biopsy. Side effects of surgery to remove endometrial cancer can specifically include sexual dysfunction, temporary incontinence, and <a href="lymphedema">lymphedema</a>, along with more common side effects of any surgery, including <a href="constipation">constipation</a>.

There are a number of possible additional therapies. Surgery can be followed by <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiation therapy</a> and/or <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> in cases of high-risk or high-grade cancers. This is called <a href="adjuvant%20therapy">adjuvant therapy</a>.

<a href="Adjuvant%20chemotherapy">Adjuvant chemotherapy</a> is a recent innovation, consisting of some combination of <a href="paclitaxel">paclitaxel</a> (or other <a href="taxane">taxane</a>s like <a href="docetaxel">docetaxel</a>), <a href="doxorubicin">doxorubicin</a> (and other <a href="anthracyclines">anthracyclines</a>), and <a href="platins">platins</a> (particularly <a href="cisplatin">cisplatin</a> and <a href="carboplatin">carboplatin</a>). Adjuvant chemotherapy has been found to increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than <a href="adjuvant%20radiotherapy">added radiotherapy</a>. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include <a href="alopecia">hair loss</a>, <a href="neutropenia">low neutrophil levels</a> in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.

In cases where surgery is not indicated, <a href="palliative%20chemotherapy">palliative chemotherapy</a> is an option; higher-dose chemotherapy is associated with longer survival. Palliative chemotherapy, particularly using <a href="capecitabine">capecitabine</a> and <a href="gemcitabine">gemcitabine</a>, is also often used to treat recurrent endometrial cancer.

Adjuvant radiotherapy is commonly used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). <a href="Brachytherapy">Brachytherapy</a> involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; in the case of endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved. VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT.

Radiotherapy can also be used before surgery in certain cases. When pre-operative imaging or clinical evaluation shows tumor invading the cervix, radiation can be given before a <a href="radical%20hysterectomy">total hysterectomy</a> is performed. Brachytherapy and EBRT can also be used, singly or in combination, when there is a contraindication for hysterectomy. Both delivery methods of radiotherapy are associated with side effects, particularly in the <a href="Human%20gastrointestinal%20tract">gastrointestinal tract</a>.

Hormonal therapy is only beneficial in certain types of endometrial cancer. It was once thought to be beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, <a href="hydroxyprogesterone%20caproate">hydroxyprogesterone caproate</a>, <a href="letrozole">letrozole</a>, <a href="megestrol%20acetate">megestrol acetate</a>, and <a href="medroxyprogesterone">medroxyprogesterone</a>. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have <a href="estrogen%20receptor">estrogen</a> and/or <a href="progestin%20receptor">progestin receptor</a>s. Progestin receptors function as <a href="tumor%20suppressor">tumor suppressor</a>s in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments to have a high rate of response even in metastatic disease.

The tumor marker CA-125 is frequently elevated in endometrial cancer and can be used to monitor response to treatment, particularly in serous cell cancer or advanced disease. Periodic MRIs or CT scans may be recommended in advanced disease and women with a history of endometrial cancer should receive more frequent pelvic examinations for the five years following treatment. Examinations conducted every three to four months are recommended for the first two years following treatment, and every six months for the next three years.

Women with endometrial cancer should not have routine surveillance imaging to monitor the cancer unless new symptoms appear or <a href="tumor%20markers">tumor markers</a> begin rising. Imaging without these indications is discouraged because it is unlikely to detect a recurrence or improve survival, and because it has its own costs and side effects. If a recurrence is suspected, PET/CT scanning is recommended.

The five-year survival rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, which has the best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to ten months. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher survival rate than black women, who tend to develop more aggressive forms of the disease by the time of their diagnosis. Tumors with high <a href="progesterone%20receptor">progesterone receptor</a> expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to three years, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. <a href="Heart%20disease">Heart disease</a> is the most common cause of death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common. Following diagnosis, quality of life is also positively associated with a healthy lifestyle (no obesity, high-quality diet, physical activity).

Recurrence of early stage endometrial cancer ranges from 3 to 17%, depending on primary and adjuvant treatment. Most recurrences (75–80%) occur outside of the pelvis, and most occur two to three years after treatment, 64% after two years and 87% after three years.

Higher-staged cancers are more likely to recur, as are those that have invaded the myometrium or cervix, or that have metastasized into the lymphatic system. <a href="Papillary%20serous%20carcinoma">Papillary serous carcinoma</a>, <a href="uterine%20clear-cell%20carcinoma">clear cell carcinoma</a>, and <a href="endometrioid%20carcinoma">endometrioid carcinoma</a> are the subtypes at the highest risk of recurrence. High-grade histological subtypes are also at elevated risk for recurrence.

The most common site of recurrence is in the <a href="vagina">vagina</a>; vaginal relapses of endometrial cancer have the best prognosis. If relapse occurs from a cancer that has not been treated with radiation, EBRT is the first-line treatment and is often successful. If a cancer treated with radiation recurs, <a href="pelvic%20exenteration">pelvic exenteration</a> is the only option for curative treatment. Palliative chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery, and radiation are also performed. Radiation therapy (VBT and EBRT) for a local vaginal recurrence has a 50% five-year survival rate. Pelvic recurrences are treated with surgery and radiation, and abdominal recurrences are treated with radiation and, if possible, chemotherapy. Other common recurrence sites are the pelvic lymph nodes, para-aortic lymph nodes, peritoneum (28% of recurrences), and lungs, though recurrences can also occur in the brain (<1%), liver (7%), adrenal glands (1%), bones (4–7%; typically the <a href="axial%20skeleton">axial skeleton</a>), lymph nodes outside the abdomen (0.4–1%), spleen, and muscle/soft tissue (2–6%).

, approximately 320,000 women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer worldwide each year and 76,000 die, making it the sixth most common cancer in women. It is more common in developed countries, where the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer in people born with uteri is 1.6%, compared to 0.6% in developing countries. It <a href="Incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">occurs</a> in 12.9 out of 100,000 women annually in developed countries.

In the United States, endometrial cancer is the most frequently diagnosed gynecologic cancer and, in women, the fourth most <a href="prevalence">common</a> cancer overall, representing 6% of all cancer cases in women. In that country, it was estimated that 52,630 women were diagnosed yearly and 8,590 would die from the disease. Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America have the highest rates of endometrial cancer, whereas Africa and West Asia have the lowest rates. Asia saw 41% of the world's endometrial cancer diagnoses in 2012, whereas Northern Europe, Eastern Europe, and North America together comprised 48% of diagnoses. Unlike most cancers, the number of new cases has risen in recent years, including an increase of over 40% in the United Kingdom between 1993 and 2013. Some of this rise may be due to the increase in obesity rates in developed countries, increasing life expectancies, and lower birth rates. The average lifetime risk for endometrial cancer is approximately 2–3% in people with uteruses. In the UK, approximately 7,400 cases are diagnosed annually, and in the EU, approximately 88,000.

Endometrial cancer appears most frequently during <a href="perimenopause">perimenopause</a> (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), between the ages of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of endometrial cancer occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of endometrial cancer cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50 years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide <a href="median">median</a> age of diagnosis is 63 years of age; in the United States, the <a href="average">average</a> age of diagnosis is 60 years of age. White American women are at higher risk for endometrial cancer than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.

There are several experimental therapies for endometrial cancer under research, including immunologic, hormonal, and chemotherapeutic treatments. <a href="Trastuzumab">Trastuzumab</a> (Herceptin), an <a href="antibody">antibody</a> against the Her2 protein, has been used in cancers known to be positive for the Her2/neu oncogene, but research is still underway. Immunologic therapies are also under investigation, particularly in uterine papillary serous carcinoma.
Cancers can be analyzed using genetic techniques (including <a href="DNA%20sequencing">DNA sequencing</a> and <a href="immunohistochemistry">immunohistochemistry</a>) to determine if certain therapies specific to mutated genes can be used to treat it. <a href="PARP%20inhibitor">PARP inhibitor</a>s are used to treat endometrial cancer with PTEN mutations, specifically, mutations that lower the expression of PTEN. The PARP inhibitor shown to be active against endometrial cancer is <a href="olaparib">olaparib</a>. Research is ongoing in this area as of the 2010s.
Research is ongoing on the use of <a href="metformin">metformin</a>, a diabetes medication, in obese women with endometrial cancer before surgery. Early research has shown it to be effective in slowing the rate of cancer cell proliferation. Preliminary research has shown that preoperative metformin administration can reduce expression of tumor markers. Long-term use of metformin has not been shown to have a preventative effect against developing cancer, but may improve overall survival.
<a href="Temsirolimus">Temsirolimus</a>, an mTOR inhibitor, is under investigation as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. <a href="Ridaforolimus">Ridaforolimus</a> (deforolimus) is also being researched as a treatment for people who have previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. <a href="Bevacizumab">Bevacizumab</a> and <a href="tyrosine%20kinase%20inhibitor">tyrosine kinase inhibitor</a>s, which inhibit <a href="angiogenesis">angiogenesis</a>, are being researched as potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of <a href="vascular%20endothelial%20growth%20factor">vascular endothelial growth factor</a>. <a href="Ixabepilone">Ixabepilone</a> is being researched as a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being researched, as there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and <a href="ifosfamide">ifosfamide</a>.
There is also research in progress on more genes and <a href="biomarker">biomarker</a>s that may be linked to endometrial cancer. The protective effect of combined oral contraceptives and the IUD is being investigated. Preliminary research has shown that the <a href="levonorgestrel">levonorgestrel</a> IUD placed for a year, combined with 6 monthly injections of <a href="gonadotropin-releasing%20hormone">gonadotropin-releasing hormone</a>, can stop or reverse the progress of endometrial cancer in young women. An experimental drug that combines a hormone with doxorubicin is also under investigation for greater efficacy in cancers with hormone receptors. Hormone therapy that is effective in treating breast cancer, including use of <a href="aromatase%20inhibitor">aromatase inhibitor</a>s, is also being investigated for use in endometrial cancer. One such drug is <a href="anastrozole">anastrozole</a>, which is currently being researched in hormone-positive recurrences after chemotherapy. Research into hormonal treatments for endometrial stromal sarcomas is ongoing as well. It includes trials of drugs like <a href="mifepristone">mifepristone</a>, a progestin antagonist, and <a href="aminoglutethimide">aminoglutethimide</a> and letrozole, two aromatase inhibitors.
Research continues into the best imaging method for detecting and staging endometrial cancer. In surgery, research has shown that complete pelvic lymphadenectomy along with hysterectomy in stage 1 endometrial cancer does not improve survival and increases the risk of negative side effects, including lymphedema. Other research is exploring the potential of identifying the <a href="sentinel%20lymph%20node">sentinel lymph node</a>s for biopsy by injecting the tumor with dye that shines under <a href="infrared">infrared</a> light. <a href="Intensity%20modulated%20radiation%20therapy">Intensity modulated radiation therapy</a> is currently under investigation, and already used in some centers, for application in endometrial cancer, to reduce side effects from traditional radiotherapy. Its risk of recurrence has not yet been quantified. Research on <a href="hyperbaric%20oxygen%20therapy">hyperbaric oxygen therapy</a> to reduce side effects is also ongoing. The results of the PORTEC 3 trial assessing combining adjuvant radiotherapy with chemotherapy were awaited in late 2014.

There is not enough evidence to determine if people with endometrial cancer benefit from additional behavioural and life style interventions that are aimed at losing excess weight.

Endometrial cancer is not widely known by the general populace, despite its frequency. There is low awareness of the symptoms, which can lead to later diagnosis and worse survival.

Folding@home

Folding@home (FAH or F@h) is a <a href="distributed%20computing">distributed computing</a> project for disease research that simulates <a href="protein%20folding">protein folding</a>, computational <a href="drug%20design">drug design</a>, and other types of <a href="molecular%20dynamics">molecular dynamics</a>. The project uses the <a href="Idle%20%28CPU%29">idle processing resources</a> of thousands of <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s owned by volunteers who have installed the software on their systems. Its main purpose is to determine the mechanisms of protein folding, which is the process by which <a href="protein">protein</a>s reach their <a href="Protein%20tertiary%20structure">final three-dimensional structure</a>, and to examine the causes of <a href="protein%20misfolding">protein misfolding</a>. This is of significant academic interest with major implications for <a href="medical%20research">medical research</a> into <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>, <a href="Huntington%27s%20disease">Huntington's disease</a>, and many forms of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, among other diseases. To a lesser extent, Folding@home also tries to <a href="Protein%20structure%20prediction">predict</a> a protein's <a href="native%20state">final structure</a> and determine how other molecules may <a href="Protein%E2%80%93ligand%20docking">interact</a> with it, which has applications in drug design. Folding@home is developed and operated by the Pande Laboratory at <a href="Stanford%20University">Stanford University</a>, under the direction of Prof. <a href="Vijay%20Pande">Vijay Pande</a>, and is shared by various scientific institutions and research laboratories across the world.

The project has pioneered the use of <a href="graphics%20processing%20unit">graphics processing unit</a>s (GPUs), <a href="PlayStation%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3">PlayStation 3</a>s, <a href="Message%20Passing%20Interface">Message Passing Interface</a> (used for computing on <a href="multi-core%20processor">multi-core processor</a>s), and some <a href="Sony%20Xperia">Sony Xperia</a> smartphones for distributed computing and scientific research. The project uses statistical <a href="simulation">simulation</a> methodology that is a <a href="paradigm%20shift">paradigm shift</a> from traditional computing methods. As part of the <a href="client%E2%80%93server%20model">client–server model</a> <a href="network%20architecture">network architecture</a>, the volunteered machines each receive pieces of a simulation (work units), complete them, and return them to the project's <a href="database%20server">database server</a>s, where the units are compiled into an overall simulation. Volunteers can track their contributions on the Folding@home website, which makes volunteers' participation competitive and encourages long-term involvement.

Folding@home is one of the world's fastest computing systems, with a speed of approximately 135 <a href="FLOPS">petaFLOPS</a> . This performance from its large-scale computing network has allowed researchers to run <a href="Analysis%20of%20algorithms">computationally costly</a> atomic-level simulations of protein folding thousands of times longer than formerly achieved. Since its launch on October 1, 2000, the Pande Lab has produced 206 <a href="Academic%20publishing">scientific research papers</a> as a direct result of Folding@home. Results from the project's simulations agree well with experiments.

<a href="Protein">Protein</a>s are an essential component to many biological functions and participate in virtually all processes within <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">biological cell</a>s. They often act as <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s, performing biochemical reactions including <a href="cell%20signaling">cell signaling</a>, molecular transportation, and <a href="Cell%20cycle%23Regulation%20of%20eukaryotic%20cell%20cycle">cellular regulation</a>. As structural elements, some proteins act as a type of <a href="cytoskeleton">skeleton for cells</a>, and as <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a>, while other proteins participate in the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a>. Before a protein can take on these roles, it must fold into a functional <a href="Protein%20tertiary%20structure">three-dimensional structure</a>, a process that often occurs spontaneously and is dependent on interactions within its <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a> sequence and interactions of the amino acids with their surroundings. Protein folding is driven by the search to find the most energetically favorable conformation of the protein, i.e., its <a href="native%20state">native state</a>. Thus, understanding protein folding is critical to understanding what a protein does and how it works, and is considered a holy grail of <a href="computational%20biology">computational biology</a>. Despite folding occurring within a <a href="macromolecular%20crowding">crowded cellular environment</a>, it typically proceeds smoothly. However, due to a protein's chemical properties or other factors, proteins may <a href="protein%20misfolding">misfold</a>, that is, fold down the wrong pathway and end up misshapen. Unless cellular mechanisms can destroy or refold misfolded proteins, they can subsequently <a href="Protein%20aggregation">aggregate</a> and cause a variety of debilitating diseases. Laboratory experiments studying these processes can be limited in scope and atomic detail, leading scientists to use physics-based computing models that, when complementing experiments, seek to provide a more complete picture of protein folding, misfolding, and aggregation.

Due to the complexity of proteins' conformation or <a href="Configuration%20space%20%28physics%29">configuration space</a> (the set of possible shapes a protein can take), and limits in computing power, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations have been severely limited in the timescales which they can study. While most proteins typically fold in the order of milliseconds, before 2010, simulations could only reach nanosecond to microsecond timescales. General-purpose <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a>s have been used to simulate protein folding, but such systems are intrinsically costly and typically shared among many research groups. Further, because the computations in kinetic models occur serially, strong <a href="scalability">scaling</a> of traditional molecular simulations to these architectures is exceptionally difficult. Moreover, as protein folding is a <a href="stochastic%20process">stochastic process</a> and can statistically vary over time, it is challenging computationally to use long simulations for comprehensive views of the folding process.
Protein folding does not occur in one step. Instead, proteins spend most of their folding time, nearly 96% in some cases, "waiting" in various intermediate <a href="protein%20conformation">conformational</a> states, each a local <a href="thermodynamic%20free%20energy">thermodynamic free energy</a> minimum in the protein's <a href="energy%20landscape">energy landscape</a>. Through a process known as <a href="adaptive%20sampling">adaptive sampling</a>, these conformations are used by Folding@home as starting points for a <a href="set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> of simulation trajectories. As the simulations discover more conformations, the trajectories are restarted from them, and a <a href="Hidden%20Markov%20model">Markov state model</a> (MSM) is gradually created from this cyclic process. MSMs are <a href="discrete-time">discrete-time</a> <a href="master%20equation">master equation</a> models which describe a biomolecule's conformational and energy landscape as a set of distinct structures and the short transitions between them. The adaptive sampling Markov state model method significantly increases the efficiency of simulation as it avoids computation inside the local energy minimum itself, and is amenable to distributed computing (including on <a href="GPUGRID">GPUGRID</a>) as it allows for the statistical aggregation of short, independent simulation trajectories. The amount of time it takes to construct a Markov state model is inversely proportional to the number of parallel simulations run, i.e., the number of processors available. In other words, it achieves linear <a href="parallelization">parallelization</a>, leading to an approximately four <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a> reduction in overall serial calculation time. A completed MSM may contain tens of thousands of sample states from the protein's <a href="phase%20space">phase space</a> (all the conformations a protein can take on) and the transitions between them. The model illustrates folding events and pathways (i.e., routes) and researchers can later use kinetic clustering to view a coarse-grained representation of the otherwise highly detailed model. They can use these MSMs to reveal how proteins misfold and to quantitatively compare simulations with experiments.

Between 2000 and 2010, the length of the proteins Folding@home has studied have increased by a factor of four, while its timescales for protein folding simulations have increased by six orders of magnitude. In 2002, Folding@home used Markov state models to complete approximately a million <a href="CPU">CPU</a> days of simulations over the span of several months, and in 2011, MSMs parallelized another simulation that required an aggregate 10 million CPU hours of computing. In January 2010, Folding@home used MSMs to simulate the dynamics of the slow-folding 32-<a href="amino%20acid">residue</a> NTL9 protein out to 1.52 milliseconds, a timescale consistent with experimental folding rate predictions but a thousand times longer than formerly achieved. The model consisted of many individual trajectories, each two orders of magnitude shorter, and provided an unprecedented level of detail into the protein's energy landscape. In 2010, Folding@home researcher Gregory Bowman was awarded the <a href="Thomas%20Kuhn%23Thomas%20Kuhn%20Paradigm%20Shift%20Award">Thomas Kuhn Paradigm Shift Award</a> from the <a href="American%20Chemical%20Society">American Chemical Society</a> for the development of the <a href="open-source%20software">open-source</a> MSMBuilder software and for attaining quantitative agreement between theory and experiment. For his work, Pande was awarded the 2012 Michael and Kate Bárány Award for Young Investigators for "developing field-defining and field-changing computational methods to produce leading theoretical models for protein and <a href="RNA">RNA</a> folding", and the 2006 Irving Sigal Young Investigator Award for his simulation results which "have stimulated a re-examination of the meaning of both ensemble and single-molecule measurements, making Dr. Pande's efforts pioneering contributions to simulation methodology."

Protein misfolding can result in a <a href="proteopathy">variety of diseases</a> including Alzheimer's disease, <a href="cancer">cancer</a>, <a href="Creutzfeldt%E2%80%93Jakob%20disease">Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease</a>, <a href="cystic%20fibrosis">cystic fibrosis</a>, Huntington's disease, <a href="sickle-cell%20anemia">sickle-cell anemia</a>, and <a href="type%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20diabetes">type II diabetes</a>. Cellular infection by viruses such as <a href="HIV">HIV</a> and <a href="influenza">influenza</a> also involve folding events on <a href="cell%20membrane">cell membrane</a>s. Once protein misfolding is better understood, therapies can be developed that augment cells' natural ability to regulate protein folding. Such <a href="therapies">therapies</a> include the use of engineered molecules to alter the production of a given protein, help destroy a misfolded protein, or assist in the folding process. The combination of computational molecular modeling and experimental analysis has the possibility to fundamentally shape the future of molecular medicine and the <a href="drug%20design">rational design of therapeutics</a>, such as expediting and lowering the costs of <a href="drug%20discovery">drug discovery</a>. The goal of the first five years of Folding@home was to make advances in understanding folding, while the current goal is to understand misfolding and related disease, especially Alzheimer's.

The simulations run on Folding@home are used in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>" differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011, Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a <a href="ribosome">ribosomal</a> exit tunnel, to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical <a href="denaturation%20%28biochemistry%29">denaturants</a> to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, and it is difficult to experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of <a href="Protein%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BL">Protein L</a>, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.

The Pande Lab is part of Stanford University, a <a href="non-profit%20organization">non-profit entity</a>, and does not sell the results generated by Folding@home. The large data sets from the project are freely available for other researchers to use upon request and some can be accessed from the Folding@home website. The Pande lab has collaborated with other molecular dynamics systems such as the <a href="Blue%20Gene">Blue Gene</a> supercomputer, and they share Folding@home's key software with other researchers, so that the algorithms which benefited Folding@home may aid other scientific areas. In 2011, they released the open-source Copernicus software, which is based on Folding@home's MSM and other parallelizing methods and aims to improve the efficiency and scaling of molecular simulations on large <a href="computer%20cluster">computer cluster</a>s or <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a>s. Summaries of all scientific findings from Folding@home are posted on the Folding@home website after publication.

<a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a> is an incurable <a href="neurodegeneration">neurodegenerative</a> disease which most often affects the elderly and accounts for more than half of all cases of <a href="dementia">dementia</a>. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a <a href="proteopathy">protein misfolding disease</a>. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic <a href="protein%20aggregation">aggregations</a> of the <a href="amyloid%20beta">amyloid beta</a> (Aβ) <a href="peptide">peptide</a>, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger <a href="senile%20plaques">senile plaques</a>, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a> and <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">nuclear magnetic resonance</a> (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.

Preventing Aβ aggregation is a promising method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a <a href="literature%20review">literature review</a> article. In 2008, Folding@home simulated the dynamics of Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales of the order of tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used the results of this study to identify a <a href="beta%20hairpin">beta hairpin</a> that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure. The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.

In December 2008, Folding@home found several small drug candidates which appear to inhibit the toxicity of Aβ aggregates. In 2010, in close cooperation with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, these drug leads began to be tested on <a href="biological%20tissue">biological tissue</a>. In 2011, Folding@home completed simulations of several <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s of Aβ that appear to stabilize the aggregate formation, which could aid in the development of therapeutic drug therapies for the disease and greatly assist with experimental <a href="nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance%20spectroscopy">nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy</a> studies of Aβ <a href="oligomer">oligomer</a>s. Later that year, Folding@home began simulations of various Aβ fragments to determine how various natural enzymes affect the structure and folding of Aβ.

<a href="Huntington%27s%20disease">Huntington's disease</a> is a neurodegenerative <a href="genetic%20disorder">genetic disorder</a> that is associated with protein misfolding and aggregation. <a href="Polyglutamine%20tract">Excessive repeats</a> of the <a href="glutamine">glutamine</a> amino acid at the <a href="N-terminus">N-terminus</a> of the <a href="Huntingtin%20protein">Huntingtin protein</a> cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease. As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure. Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the Huntingtin protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with <a href="rational%20drug%20design">rational drug design</a> methods to stop the aggregate formation. The N17 fragment of the Huntington protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown. Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease. Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.

More than half of all known cancers involve <a href="mutations">mutations</a> of <a href="p53">p53</a>, a <a href="tumor%20suppressor">tumor suppressor</a> protein present in every cell which regulates the <a href="cell%20cycle">cell cycle</a> and signals for <a href="cell%20death">cell death</a> in the event of damage to <a href="DNA">DNA</a>. Specific mutations in p53 can disrupt these functions, allowing an abnormal cell to continue growing unchecked, resulting in the development of <a href="tumors">tumors</a>. Analysis of these mutations helps explain the root causes of p53-related cancers. In 2004, Folding@home was used to perform the first molecular dynamics study of the refolding of p53's <a href="protein%20dimer">protein dimer</a> in an <a href="water%20model">all-atom simulation of water</a>. The simulation's results agreed with experimental observations and gave insights into the refolding of the dimer that were formerly unobtainable. This was the first <a href="peer%20review">peer review</a>ed publication on cancer from a distributed computing project. The following year, Folding@home powered a new method to identify the amino acids crucial for the stability of a given protein, which was then used to study mutations of p53. The method was reasonably successful in identifying cancer-promoting mutations and determined the effects of specific mutations which could not otherwise be measured experimentally.

Folding@home is also used to study <a href="chaperone%20%28protein%29">protein chaperones</a>, <a href="heat%20shock%20protein">heat shock protein</a>s which play essential roles in cell survival by assisting with the folding of other proteins in the <a href="Macromolecular%20crowding">crowded</a> and chemically stressful environment within a cell. Rapidly growing cancer cells rely on specific chaperones, and some chaperones play key roles in <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> resistance. Inhibitions to these specific chaperones are seen as potential modes of action for efficient chemotherapy drugs or for reducing the spread of cancer. Using Folding@home and working closely with the Center for Protein Folding Machinery, the Pande lab hopes to find a drug which inhibits those chaperones involved in cancerous cells. Researchers are also using Folding@home to study other molecules related to cancer, such as the enzyme <a href="Src%20kinase">Src kinase</a>, and some forms of the <a href="Engrailed%20%28gene%29">engrailed</a> <a href="homeodomain">homeodomain</a>: a large protein which may be involved in many diseases, including cancer. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the small <a href="Trefoil%20knot%20fold">knottin</a> protein EETI, which can identify <a href="carcinoma">carcinoma</a>s in <a href="medical%20imaging">imaging scan</a>s by binding to <a href="cell%20surface%20receptor">surface receptor</a>s of cancer cells.

<a href="Interleukin%202">Interleukin 2</a> (IL-2) is a protein that helps <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>s of the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> attack pathogens and tumors. However, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as <a href="pulmonary%20edema">pulmonary edema</a>. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently than it does to T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. <a href="Pharmaceutical%20companies">Pharmaceutical companies</a> have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a> are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.

<a href="Osteogenesis%20imperfecta">Osteogenesis imperfecta</a>, known as brittle bone disease, is an incurable genetic bone disorder which can be lethal. Those with the disease are unable to make functional connective bone tissue. This is most commonly due to a mutation in <a href="Type-I%20collagen">Type-I collagen</a>, which fulfills a variety of structural roles and is the most abundant protein in <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s. The mutation causes a deformation in <a href="Collagen%20helix">collagen's triple helix structure</a>, which if not naturally destroyed, leads to abnormal and weakened bone tissue. In 2005, Folding@home tested a new <a href="quantum%20mechanical">quantum mechanical</a> method that improved upon prior simulation methods, and which may be useful for future computing studies of collagen. Although researchers have used Folding@home to study collagen folding and misfolding, the interest stands as a pilot project compared to <a href="Alzheimer">Alzheimer</a>'s and Huntington's research.

Folding@home is assisting in research towards preventing some <a href="virus">virus</a>es, such as <a href="influenza">influenza</a> and <a href="HIV">HIV</a>, from recognizing and entering <a href="Cell%20%28biology%29">biological cells</a>. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations of the dynamics of the enzyme <a href="RNase%20H">RNase H</a>, a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it. Folding@home has also been used to study <a href="membrane%20fusion">membrane fusion</a>, an essential event for <a href="viral%20entry">viral infection</a> and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves <a href="conformational%20change">conformational change</a>s of viral fusion proteins and <a href="protein%20docking">protein docking</a>, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown. Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude. The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs. In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.

Following detailed simulations from Folding@home of small cells known as <a href="vesicle%20%28biology%29">vesicles</a>, in 2007, the Pande lab introduced a new computing method to measure the <a href="topology">topology</a> of its structural changes during fusion. In 2009, researchers used Folding@home to study mutations of <a href="Hemagglutinin%20%28influenza%29">influenza hemagglutinin</a>, a protein that attaches a virus to its <a href="Host%20%28biology%29">host</a> cell and assists with viral entry. Mutations to hemagglutinin affect <a href="binding%20affinity">how well the protein binds</a> to a host's <a href="cell%20surface%20receptor">cell surface receptor</a> molecules, which determines how <a href="infectivity">infective</a> the virus strain is to the host organism. Knowledge of the effects of hemagglutinin mutations assists in the development of <a href="antiviral%20drug">antiviral drug</a>s. As of 2012, Folding@home continues to simulate the folding and interactions of hemagglutinin, complementing experimental studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a>.

<a href="Drug">Drug</a>s function by <a href="ligand%20binding">binding</a> to <a href="binding%20site">specific locations</a> on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a <a href="conformational%20change">conformational change</a>. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, it is difficult to precisely determine where and <a href="binding%20affinity">how tightly</a> two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current "<a href="in%20silico">in silico</a>" methods usually must trade speed for <a href="accuracy">accuracy</a>; e.g., use rapid <a href="protein%20docking">protein docking</a> methods instead of computationally costly <a href="free%20energy%20calculation">free energy calculation</a>s. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the <a href="villin">villin</a> protein to within 1.8 <a href="angstrom">angstrom</a> (Å) <a href="root%20mean%20square%20deviation">root mean square deviation</a> (RMSD) from the <a href="crystalline%20structure">crystalline structure</a> experimentally determined through <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a>. This accuracy has implications to future <a href="protein%20structure%20prediction">protein structure prediction</a> methods, including for <a href="intrinsically%20unstructured%20proteins">intrinsically unstructured proteins</a>. Scientists have used Folding@home to research <a href="drug%20resistance">drug resistance</a> by studying <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a>, an antibiotic <a href="drug%20of%20last%20resort">drug of last resort</a>, and <a href="beta-lactamase">beta-lactamase</a>, a protein that can break down antibiotics like <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>.

Chemical activity occurs along a protein's <a href="active%20site">active site</a>. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to this site and blocking its activity, under the assumption that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain <a href="allosteric%20site">allosteric site</a>s which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very <a href="Analysis%20of%20algorithms">computationally costly</a>. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, <a href="interleukin-2">interleukin-2</a>, and <a href="RNase%20H">RNase H</a>.

Approximately half of all known <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s interfere with the workings of a bacteria's <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs <a href="protein%20biosynthesis">protein biosynthesis</a> by <a href="translation%20%28biology%29">translating</a> <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a> into proteins. <a href="Macrolide%20antibiotics">Macrolide antibiotics</a> clog the ribosome's exit tunnel, preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a <a href="grant%20%28money%29">grant</a> to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated <a href="ribosomal%20protein">ribosomal protein</a>s, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.

There are many more <a href="proteopathy%23list%20of%20proteopathies">protein misfolding promoted diseases</a> that can be benefited from Folding@home to either discern the misfolded protein structure or the misfolding kinetics, and assist in drug design in the future. The often fatal <a href="prion%20diseases">prion diseases</a> is among the most significant.

<a href="Prion">Prion</a> (PrP) is a <a href="cell%20membrane">transmembrane</a> cellular protein found widely in <a href="eukaryotic%20cells">eukaryotic cells</a>. In mammals, it is more abundant in the <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a>. Although its function is unknown, its high conservation among species indicates an important role in the cellular function. The conformational change from the normal prion protein (PrPc, stands for cellular) to the disease causing <a href="isoform">isoform</a> PrPSc (stands for prototypical prion disease–<a href="scrapie">scrapie</a>) causes a various type of fatal prion diseases including <a href="Bovine%20spongiform%20encephalopathy">Bovine spongiform encephalopathy</a> (BSE) in bovine, <a href="Creutzfeldt-Jakob%20disease">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</a> (CJD) and <a href="fatal%20insomnia">fatal insomnia</a> in human, <a href="chronic%20wasting%20disease">chronic wasting disease</a> (CWD) in the deer family. The conformational change is widely accepted as the result of <a href="protein%20misfolding">protein misfolding</a>. What distinguishes TSEs from other protein misfolding diseases is its transmissible nature. The ‘seeding’ of the infectious PrPSc, either arising spontaneously, hereditary or acquired via exposure to contaminated tissues, can cause a chain reaction of transforming normal PrPc into <a href="fibrils">fibrils</a> aggregates or <a href="amyloid">amyloid</a> like plaques consist of PrPSc.

The molecular structure of PrPSc has not been fully characterized due to its aggregated nature. Neither is known much about the mechanism of the protein misfolding nor its <a href="chemical%20kinetics">kinetics</a>. Using the known structure of PrPc and the results of the in vitro and in vivo studies described below, Folding@home could be valuable in elucidating how PrPSc is formed and how the infectious protein arrange themselves to form fibrils and amyloid like plaques, bypassing the requirement to purify PrPSc or dissolve the aggregates.

The PrPc has been <a href="enzyme">enzymatically</a> dissociated from the membrane and purified, its structure studied using structure characterization techniques such as <a href="NMR%20spectroscopy">NMR spectroscopy</a> and <a href="X-ray%20crystallography">X-ray crystallography</a>. <a href="post-translational%20modification">Post-translational</a> PrPc has 231 <a href="amino%20acids">amino acids</a> (aa) in murine. The molecule consists of a long and unstructured <a href="n-terminus">amino terminal</a> region spanning up to aa residue 121 and a structured <a href="c-terminus">carboxy terminal</a> domain. This globular domain harbours two short sheet-forming anti-parallel <a href="beta%20sheet">β-strands</a> (aa 128 to 130 and aa 160 to 162 in murine PrPc) and three <a href="alpha%20helix">α-helices</a> (helix I: aa 143 to 153; helix II: aa 171 to 192; helix III: aa 199 to 226 in murine PrPc), Helices II and III are anti-parallel orientated and connected by a short loop. Their structural stability is supported by a <a href="disulfide%20bridge">disulfide bridge</a>, which is parallel to both sheet-forming β-strands. These α-helices and the β-sheet form the rigid core of the globular domain of PrPc.

The disease causing PrPSc is <a href="proteinase%20K">proteinase K</a> resistant and insoluble. Attempts to purify it from the brains of infected animals invariably yield heterogeneous mixtures and aggregated states that are not amenable to characterization by NMR spectroscopy or X-ray crystallography. However, it is a general consensus that PrPSc contains a high percentage of tightly stacked β-sheets than the normal PrPc that renders the protein insoluble and resistant to proteinase. Using techniques of <a href="cryoelectron%20microscopy">cryoelectron microscopy</a> and structural modeling based on similar common protein structures, it has been discovered that PrPSc contains ß-sheets in the region of aa 81-95 to aa 171, while the carboxy terminal structure is supposedly preserved, retaining the disulfide-linked α-helical conformation in the normal PrPc. These ß-sheets form a parallel left-handed beta-helix. Three PrPSc molecules are believed to form a primary unit and therefore build the basis for the so-called scrapie-associated fibrils. The catalytic activity depends on the size of the particle. PrPSc particles which consist of only 14-28 PrPc molecules exhibit the highest rate of infectivity and conversion.

Despite the difficulty to purify and characterize PrPSc, from the known molecular structure of PrPc and using <a href="transgenic%20mice">transgenic mice</a> and N-terminal deletion, the potential ‘hot spots’ of protein misfolding leading to the pathogenic PrPSc could be deduced and Folding@home could be of great value in confirming these. Studies found that both the <a href="protein%20primary%20structure">primary</a> and <a href="protein%20secondary%20structure">secondary</a> structure of the prion protein can be of significance of the conversion.

There are more than twenty <a href="mutations">mutations</a> of the prion protein gene (<a href="PRNP">PRNP</a>) that are known to be associated with or that are directly linked to the hereditary form of human TSEs [56], indicating single amino acids at certain position, likely within the carboxy domain, of the PrPc can affect the susceptibility to TSEs.

The post-translational amino terminal region of PrPc consists of residues 23-120 which make up nearly half of the amino sequence of full-length matured PrPc. There are two sections in the amino terminal region that may influence conversion. First, residues 52-90 contains an octapeptide repeat (5 times) region that likely influences the initial binding (via the octapeptide repeats) and also the actual conversion via the second section of aa 108-124. The highly <a href="hydrophobic">hydrophobic</a> AGAAAAGA is located between aa residue 113 and 120 and is described as putative aggregation site, although this sequence requires its flanking parts to form fibrillar aggregates.

In the carboxy globular domain, among the three helices, study show that helix II has a significant higher propensity to β-strand conformation. Due to the high conformational flexvoribility seen between residues 114-125 (part of the unstructured N-terminus chain) and the high β-strand propensity of helix II, only moderate changes in the environmental conditions or interactions might be sufficient to induce misfolding of PrPc and subsequent fibril formation.

Other studies of NMR structures of PrPc showed that these residues (~108–189) contain most of the folded domain including both β-strands, the first two α-helices, and the loop/turn regions connecting them, but not the helix III. Small changes within the loop/turn structures of PrPc itself could be important in the conversion as well. In another study, Riek et al. showed that the two small regions of β-strand upstream of the loop regions act as a nucleation site for the conformational conversion of the loop/turn and α-helical structures in PrPc to β-sheet.

The energy threshold for the conversion are not necessarily high. The folding stability, i.e. the <a href="thermodynamic%20free%20energy">free energy</a> of a globular protein in its environment is in the range of one or two <a href="hydrogen%20bonds">hydrogen bonds</a> thus allows the transition to an isoform without the requirement of high transition energy.

From the respective of the interactions among the PrPc molecules, hydrophobic interactions play a crucial role in the formation of β-sheets, a hallmark of PrPSc, as the sheets bring fragments of <a href="polypeptide">polypeptide</a> chains into close proximity. Indeed, Kutznetsov and Rackovsky showed that disease-promoting mutations in the human PrPc had a statistically significant tendency towards increasing local hydrophobicity.

In vitro experiments showed the kinetics of misfolding has an initial lag phase followed by a rapid growth phase of fibril formation. It is likely that PrPc goes through some intermediate states, such as at least partially unfolded or degraded, before finally ending up as part of an amyloid fibril.

Like other <a href="distributed%20computing">distributed computing</a> projects, Folding@home is an online <a href="citizen%20science">citizen science</a> project. In these projects non-specialists contribute computer processing power or help to analyse data produced by professional scientists. Participants in these projects play an invaluable role in facilitating research for little or no obvious reward.

Research has been carried out into the motivations of citizen scientists and most of these studies have found that participants are motivated to take part because of altruistic reasons, that is, they want to help scientists and make a contribution to the advancement of their research. Many participants in citizen science have an underlying interest in the topic of the research and gravitate towards projects that are in disciplines of interest to them. Folding@home is no different in that respect. Research carried out recently on over 400 active participants revealed that they wanted to help make a contribution to research and that many had friends or relatives affected by the diseases that the Folding@home scientists investigate.

Folding@home attracts participants who are computer hardware enthusiasts (sometimes called ‘overclockers’). These groups bring considerable expertise to the project and are able to build computers with advanced processing power. Other distributed computing projects attract these types of participants and projects are often used to benchmark the performance of modified computers, and this aspect of the hobby is accommodated through the competitive nature of the project. Individuals and teams can compete to see who can process the most computer processing units (CPUs).

This latest research on Folding@home involving interview and ethnographic observation of online groups showed that teams of hardware enthusiasts can sometimes work together, sharing best practice with regard to maximising processing output. Such teams can become <a href="Communities%20of%20Practice">communities of practice</a>, with a shared language and online culture. This pattern of participation has been observed in other distributed computing projects.

Another key observation of Folding@home participants is that many are male. This has also been observed in other distributed projects. Furthermore, many participants work in computer and technology-based jobs and careers.

Not all Folding@home participants are hardware enthusiasts. Many participants run the project software on unmodified machines and do take part competitively. Over 100,000 participants are involved in Folding@home. However, it is difficult to ascertain what proportion of participants are hardware enthusiasts. Although, according to the project managers, the contribution of the enthusiast community is substantially larger in terms of processing power.

On September 16, 2007, due in large part to the participation of PlayStation 3 consoles, the Folding@home project officially attained a sustained performance level higher than one native petaFLOPS, becoming the first computing system of any kind to do so. <a href="Top500">Top500</a>'s fastest supercomputer at the time was <a href="BlueGene/L">BlueGene/L</a>, at 0.280 petaFLOPS. The following year, on May 7, 2008, the project attained a sustained performance level higher than two native petaFLOPS, followed by the three and four native petaFLOPS milestones on August 2008 and September 28, 2008 respectively. On February 18, 2009, Folding@home achieved five native petaFLOPS, and was the first computing project to meet these five levels. In comparison, November 2008's fastest supercomputer was <a href="IBM">IBM</a>'s <a href="IBM%20Roadrunner">Roadrunner</a> at 1.105 petaFLOPS. On November 10, 2011, Folding@home's performance exceeded six native petaFLOPS with the equivalent of nearly eight x86 petaFLOPS. In mid-May 2013, Folding@home attained over seven native petaFLOPS, with the equivalent of 14.87 x86 petaFLOPS. It then reached eight native petaFLOPS on June 21, followed by nine on September 9 of that year, with 17.9 x86 petaFLOPS. On May 11, 2016 Folding@home announced that it was moving towards reaching the 100 x86 petaFLOPS mark.

Similarly to other distributed computing projects, Folding@home quantitatively assesses user computing contributions to the project through a credit system. All units from a given protein project have uniform base credit, which is determined by benchmarking one or more work units from that project on an official reference machine before the project is released. Each user receives these base points for completing every work unit, though through the use of a passkey they can receive added bonus points for reliably and rapidly completing units which are more demanding computationally or have a greater scientific priority. Users may also receive credit for their work by clients on multiple machines. This point system attempts to align awarded credit with the value of the scientific results.

Users can register their contributions under a team, which combine the points of all their members. A user can start their own team, or they can join an existing team. In some cases, a team may have their own community-driven sources of help or recruitment such as an <a href="Internet%20forum">Internet forum</a>. The points can foster friendly competition between individuals and teams to compute the most for the project, which can benefit the folding community and accelerate scientific research. Individual and team statistics are posted on the Folding@home website.

If a user does not form a new team, or does not join an existing team, that user automatically becomes part of a "Default" team. This "Default" team has a team number of "0". Statistics are accumulated for this "Default" team as well as for specially named teams.

Folding@home software at the user's end involves three primary components: work units, cores, and a client.

A work unit is the protein data that the client is asked to process. Work units are a fraction of the simulation between the states in a Markov state model. After the work unit has been downloaded and completely processed by a volunteer's computer, it is returned to Folding@home servers, which then award the volunteer the credit points. This cycle repeats automatically. All work units have associated deadlines, and if this deadline is exceeded, the user may not get credit and the unit will be automatically reissued to another participant. As protein folding occurs serially, and many work units are generated from their predecessors, this allows the overall simulation process to proceed normally if a work unit is not returned after a reasonable period of time. Due to these deadlines, the minimum system requirement for Folding@home is a Pentium 3 450 MHz CPU with <a href="Streaming%20SIMD%20Extensions">Streaming SIMD Extensions</a> (SSE). However, work units for high-performance clients have a much shorter deadline than those for the uniprocessor client, as a major part of the scientific benefit is dependent on rapidly completing simulations.

Before public release, work units go through several <a href="quality%20assurance">quality assurance</a> steps to keep problematic ones from becoming fully available. These testing stages include internal, beta, and advanced, before a final full release across Folding@home. Folding@home's work units are normally processed only once, except in the rare event that errors occur during processing. If this occurs for three different users, the unit is automatically pulled from distribution. The Folding@home support forum can be used to differentiate between issues arising from problematic hardware and bad work units.

Specialized molecular dynamics programs, referred to as "FahCores" and often abbreviated "cores", perform the calculations on the work unit as a <a href="background%20process">background process</a>. A large majority of Folding@home's cores are based on <a href="GROMACS">GROMACS</a>, one of the fastest and most popular molecular dynamics software packages, which largely consists of manually optimized <a href="assembly%20language">assembly language</a> code and hardware optimizations. Although GROMACS is <a href="open-source%20software">open-source software</a> and there is a cooperative effort between the Pande lab and GROMACS developers, Folding@home uses a <a href="closed-source">closed-source</a> license to help ensure data validity. Less active cores include ProtoMol and SHARPEN. Folding@home has used <a href="AMBER">AMBER</a>, <a href="CPMD">CPMD</a>, <a href="Desmond%20%28software%29">Desmond</a>, and <a href="TINKER">TINKER</a>, but these have since been retired and are no longer in active service. Some of these cores perform <a href="explicit%20water%20model">explicit solvation</a> calculations in which the surrounding <a href="solvent">solvent</a> (usually water) is modeled atom-by-atom; while others perform <a href="implicit%20solvation">implicit solvation</a> methods, where the solvent is treated as a mathematical continuum. The core is separate from the client to enable the scientific methods to be updated automatically without requiring a client update. The cores periodically create calculation <a href="application%20checkpointing">checkpoints</a> so that if they are interrupted they can resume work from that point upon startup.

A Folding@home participant installs a <a href="client%20%28computing%29">client</a> <a href="computer%20program">program</a> on their <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>. The user interacts with the client, which manages the other software components in the background. Through the client, the user may pause the folding process, open an event log, check the work progress, or view personal statistics. The computer clients run continuously in the <a href="background%20%28computer%20software%29">background</a> at a very low priority, using idle processing power so that normal computer use is unaffected. The maximum CPU use can be adjusted via client settings. The client connects to a Folding@home <a href="server%20%28computing%29">server</a> and retrieves a work unit and may also download the appropriate core for the client's settings, operating system, and the underlying hardware architecture. After processing, the work unit is returned to the Folding@home servers. Computer clients are tailored to <a href="uniprocessor">uniprocessor</a> and <a href="multi-core%20processor">multi-core processor</a> systems, and <a href="graphics%20processing%20unit">graphics processing unit</a>s. The diversity and power of each <a href="hardware%20architecture">hardware architecture</a> provides Folding@home with the ability to efficiently complete many types of simulations in a timely manner (in a few weeks or months rather than years), which is of significant scientific value. Together, these clients allow researchers to study biomedical questions formerly considered impractical to tackle computationally.

Professional software developers are responsible for most of Folding@home's code, both for the client and server-side. The development team includes programmers from Nvidia, ATI, Sony, and Cauldron Development. Clients can be downloaded only from the official Folding@home website or its commercial partners, and will only interact with Folding@home computer files. They will upload and download data with Stanford's Folding@home data servers (over <a href="Computer%20port%20%28software%29">port</a> 8080, with 80 as an alternate), and the communication is verified using 2048-bit <a href="digital%20signature">digital signature</a>s. While the client's <a href="graphical%20user%20interface">graphical user interface</a> (GUI) is open-source, the client is <a href="proprietary%20software">proprietary software</a> citing security and scientific integrity as the reasons.

However, this rationale of using proprietary software is disputed since while the license could be enforceable in the legal domain retrospectively, it doesn't practically prevent the modification (also known as <a href="Patch%20%28computing%29">patching</a>) of the executable <a href="binary%20file">binary file</a>s. Likewise, <a href="binary-only%20software">binary-only</a> distribution does not prevent the malicious modification of executable binary-code, either through a <a href="man-in-the-middle%20attack">man-in-the-middle attack</a> while being downloaded via the internet, or by the redistribution of binaries by a third-party that have been previously modified either in their binary state (i.e. <a href="Patch%20%28computing%29">patched</a>), or by decompiling and recompiling them after modification. Unless the binary files – and the transport channel – are <a href="digital%20signature">signed</a> and the recipient person/system is able to verify the digital signature, in which case unwarranted modifications should be detectable, but not always. Either way, since in the case of Folding@Home the input data and output result processed by the client-software are both digitally signed, the integrity of work can be verified independently from the integrity of the client software itself.

Folding@home uses the <a href="Cosm%20%28software%29">Cosm</a> software libraries for networking. Folding@home was launched on October 1, 2000, and was the first distributed computing project aimed at bio-molecular systems. Its first client was a <a href="screensaver">screensaver</a>, which would run while the computer was not otherwise in use. In 2004, the Pande lab collaborated with <a href="David%20P.%20Anderson">David P. Anderson</a> to test a supplemental client on the open-source BOINC framework. This client was released to closed beta in April 2005; however, the method became unworkable and was shelved in June 2006.

The specialized hardware of <a href="graphics%20processing%20unit">graphics processing unit</a>s (GPU) is designed to accelerate rendering of 3-D graphics applications such as video games and can significantly outperform CPUs for some types of calculations. GPUs are one of the most powerful and rapidly growing computing platforms, and many scientists and researchers are pursuing <a href="general-purpose%20computing%20on%20graphics%20processing%20units">general-purpose computing on graphics processing units</a> (GPGPU). However, GPU hardware is difficult to use for non-graphics tasks and usually requires significant algorithm restructuring and an advanced understanding of the underlying architecture. Such customization is challenging, more so to researchers with limited software development resources. Folding@home uses the <a href="open-source%20software">open-source</a> <a href="OpenMM">OpenMM</a> <a href="library%20%28computing%29">library</a>, which uses a <a href="bridge%20pattern">bridge design pattern</a> with two <a href="application%20programming%20interface">application programming interface</a> (API) levels to interface molecular simulation software to an underlying hardware architecture. With the addition of hardware optimizations, OpenMM-based GPU simulations need no significant modification but achieve performance nearly equal to hand-tuned GPU code, and greatly outperform CPU implementations.

Before 2010, the computing reliability of GPGPU consumer-grade hardware was largely unknown, and circumstantial evidence related to the lack of built-in <a href="error%20detection%20and%20correction">error detection and correction</a> in GPU memory raised reliability concerns. In the first large-scale test of GPU scientific accuracy, a 2010 study of over 20,000 hosts on the Folding@home network detected <a href="soft%20error">soft error</a>s in the memory subsystems of two-thirds of the tested GPUs. These errors strongly correlated to board architecture, though the study concluded that reliable GPU computing was very feasible as long as attention is paid to the hardware traits, such as software-side error detection.

The first generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU1) was released to the public on October 2, 2006, delivering a 20–30 times speedup for some calculations over its CPU-based <a href="GROMACS">GROMACS</a> counterparts. It was the first time GPUs had been used for either distributed computing or major molecular dynamics calculations. GPU1 gave researchers significant knowledge and experience with the development of <a href="General-purpose%20computing%20on%20graphics%20processing%20units">GPGPU</a> software, but in response to scientific inaccuracies with <a href="DirectX">DirectX</a>, on April 10, 2008 it was succeeded by GPU2, the second generation of the client. Following the introduction of GPU2, GPU1 was officially retired on June 6. Compared to GPU1, GPU2 was more scientifically reliable and productive, ran on <a href="ATI%20%28brand%29">ATI</a> and <a href="CUDA">CUDA</a>-enabled <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> GPUs, and supported more advanced algorithms, larger proteins, and real-time visualization of the protein simulation. Following this, the third generation of Folding@home's GPU client (GPU3) was released on May 25, 2010. While <a href="Backward%20compatibility">backward compatible</a> with GPU2, GPU3 was more stable, efficient, and flexibile in its scientific abilities, and used OpenMM on top of an <a href="OpenCL">OpenCL</a> framework. Although these GPU3 clients did not natively support the operating systems <a href="Linux">Linux</a> and <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, Linux users with Nvidia graphics cards were able to run them through the <a href="Wine%20%28software%29">Wine</a> software application. GPUs remain Folding@home's most powerful platform in <a href="FLOPS">FLOPS</a>. As of November 2012, GPU clients account for 87% of the entire project's x86 FLOPS throughput.

Native support for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards under Linux was introduced with FahCore 17, which uses OpenCL rather than CUDA.

From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took advantage of the computing power of <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>s. At the time of its inception, its main <a href="stream%20processing">streaming</a> <a href="Cell%20%28microprocessor%29">Cell processor</a> delivered a 20 times speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>. The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to <a href="Amdahl%27s%20law">Amdahl's law</a>, and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost. This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise infeasible computationally.

The PS3 client was developed in a collaborative effort between <a href="Sony">Sony</a> and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March 23, 2007. Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s. On September 18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of <a href="Life%20with%20PlayStation">Life with PlayStation</a> on its launch. In the types of calculations it can perform, at the time of its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed. However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home. The PS3's uniform console environment made <a href="technical%20support">technical support</a> easier and made Folding@home more <a href="user%20friendly">user friendly</a>. The PS3 also had the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.

On November 6, 2012, Sony ended support for the Folding@home PS3 client and other services available under Life with PlayStation. Over its lifetime of five years and seven months, more than 15 million users contributed over 100 million hours of computing to Folding@home, greatly assisting the project with disease research. Following discussions with the Pande lab, Sony decided to terminate the application. Pande considered the PlayStation 3 client a "game changer" for the project.

Folding@home can use the <a href="parallel%20computing">parallel computing</a> abilities of modern multi-core processors. The ability to use several CPU cores simultaneously allows completing the full simulation far faster. Working together, these CPU cores complete single work units proportionately faster than the standard uniprocessor client. This method is scientifically valuable because it enables much longer simulation trajectories to be performed in the same amount of time, and reduces the traditional difficulties of scaling a large simulation to many separate processors. A 2007 publication in the "<a href="Journal%20of%20Molecular%20Biology">Journal of Molecular Biology</a>" relied on multi-core processing to simulate the folding of part of the <a href="villin">villin</a> protein approximately 10 times longer than was possible with a single-processor client, in agreement with experimental folding rates.

In November 2006, first-generation <a href="symmetric%20multiprocessing">symmetric multiprocessing</a> (SMP) clients were publicly released for open beta testing, referred to as SMP1. These clients used <a href="Message%20Passing%20Interface">Message Passing Interface</a> (MPI) communication protocols for parallel processing, as at that time the GROMACS cores were <a href="Thread-safe">not designed</a> to be used with multiple threads. This was the first time a distributed computing project had used MPI. Although the clients performed well in <a href="Unix">Unix</a>-based operating systems such as Linux and macOS, they were troublesome under <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a>. On January 24, 2010, SMP2, the second generation of the SMP clients and the successor to SMP1, was released as an open beta and replaced the complex MPI with a more reliable <a href="Thread%20%28computer%20science%29">thread</a>-based implementation.

SMP2 supports a trial of a special category of "bigadv" work units, designed to simulate proteins that are unusually large and computationally intensive and have a great scientific priority. These units originally required a minimum of eight CPU cores, which was raised to sixteen later, on February 7, 2012. Along with these added hardware requirements over standard SMP2 work units, they require more system resources such as <a href="random-access%20memory">random-access memory</a> (RAM) and <a href="Internet%20bandwidth">Internet bandwidth</a>. In return, users who run these are rewarded with a 20% increase over SMP2's bonus point system. The bigadv category allows Folding@home to run especially demanding simulations for long times that had formerly required use of supercomputing <a href="Computer%20cluster%23Compute%20clusters">clusters</a> and could not be performed anywhere else on Folding@home. Many users with hardware able to run bigadv units have later had their hardware setup deemed ineligible for bigadv work units when CPU core minimums were increased, leaving them only able to run the normal SMP work units. This frustrated many users who invested significant amounts of money into the program only to have their hardware be obsolete for bigadv purposes shortly after. As a result, Pande announced in January 2014 that the bigadv program would end on January 31, 2015.

The V7 client is the seventh and latest generation of the Folding@home client software, and is a full rewrite and unification of the prior clients for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="macOS">macOS</a>, and <a href="Linux">Linux</a> operating systems. It was released on March 22, 2012. Like its predecessors, V7 can run Folding@home in the background at a very low priority, allowing other applications to use CPU resources as they need. It is designed to make the installation, start-up, and operation more user-friendly for novices, and offer greater scientific flexibility to researchers than prior clients. V7 uses <a href="Trac">Trac</a> for <a href="Bug%20tracking%20system">managing its bug tickets</a> so that users can see its development process and provide feedback.

V7 consists of four integrated elements. The user typically interacts with V7's open-source <a href="Graphical%20user%20interface">GUI</a>, named FAHControl. This has Novice, Advanced, and Expert user interface modes, and has the ability to monitor, configure, and control many remote folding clients from one computer. FAHControl directs FAHClient, a <a href="backend%20as%20a%20service">back-end</a> application that in turn manages each FAHSlot (or "slot"). Each slot acts as replacement for the formerly distinct Folding@home v6 uniprocessor, SMP, or GPU computer clients, as it can download, process, and upload work units independently. The FAHViewer function, modeled after the PS3's viewer, displays a real-time 3-D rendering, if available, of the protein currently being processed.

In 2014, a client for the <a href="Google%20Chrome">Google Chrome</a> and <a href="Chromium%20%28web%20browser%29">Chromium</a> web browsers was released, allowing users to run Folding@home in their web browser. The client uses <a href="Google">Google</a>'s <a href="Native%20Client">Native Client</a> (NaCl) feature on Chromium-based web browsers to run the Folding@Home code at near-native speed in a <a href="sandbox%20%28computer%20security%29">sandbox</a> on the user's machine.

In July 2015, a client for <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> mobile phones was released on <a href="Google%20Play">Google Play</a> for devices running <a href="Android%204.4%20KitKat">Android 4.4 KitKat</a> or newer.

<a href="Rosetta%40home">Rosetta@home</a> is a distributed computing project aimed at protein structure prediction and is one of the most accurate <a href="tertiary%20structure">tertiary structure</a> predictors. The conformational states from Rosetta's software can be used to initialize a Markov state model as starting points for Folding@home simulations. Conversely, structure prediction algorithms can be improved from thermodynamic and kinetic models and the sampling aspects of protein folding simulations. As Rosetta only tries to predict the final folded state, and not how folding proceeds, Rosetta@home and Folding@home are complementary and address very different molecular questions.

<a href="Anton%20%28computer%29">Anton</a> is a special-purpose supercomputer built for molecular dynamics simulations. In October 2011, Anton and Folding@home were the two most powerful molecular dynamics systems. Anton is unique in its ability to produce single ultra-long computationally costly molecular trajectories, such as one in 2010 which reached the millisecond range. These long trajectories may be especially helpful for some types of biochemical problems. However, Anton does not use Markov state models (MSM) for analysis. In 2011, the Pande lab constructed a MSM from two 100-<a href="microsecond">µs</a> Anton simulations and found alternative folding pathways that were not visible through Anton's traditional analysis. They concluded that there was little difference between MSMs constructed from a limited number of long trajectories or one assembled from many shorter trajectories. In June 2011 Folding@home began added sampling of an Anton simulation in an effort to better determine how its methods compare to Anton's. However, unlike Folding@home's shorter trajectories, which are more amenable to distributed computing and other parallelizing methods, longer trajectories do not require adaptive sampling to sufficiently sample the protein's <a href="phase%20space">phase space</a>. Due to this, it is possible that a combination of Anton's and Folding@home's simulation methods would provide a more thorough sampling of this space.

Space Seed

"Space Seed" is the twenty-second episode of the of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction</a> television series "". Written by <a href="Gene%20L.%20Coon">Gene L. Coon</a> and <a href="Carey%20Wilber">Carey Wilber</a> and directed by <a href="Marc%20Daniels">Marc Daniels</a>, it first aired on February 16, 1967.

In the episode, the "Enterprise" crew encounter a <a href="sleeper%20ship">sleeper ship</a> holding <a href="selective%20breeding">selectively bred</a> superpeople from Earth's past. Their leader, <a href="Khan%20Noonien%20Singh">Khan Noonien Singh</a> (<a href="Ricardo%20Montalb%C3%A1n">Ricardo Montalbán</a>), attempts to take control of the "Enterprise".

"Space Seed" has been named one of the best episodes of the series by "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" and <a href="IGN">IGN</a>. The 1982 film "" serves as a sequel to this episode. References to "Space Seed" appear in episodes of "", "", and the 2013 film "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Into%20Darkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>".

On <a href="stardate">stardate</a> 3141.9, the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">Federation</a> <a href="starship">starship</a> <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">USS "Enterprise"</a> finds the derelict SS "Botany Bay" adrift in space. A landing party comprising Captain <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a> (<a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a>), Doctor <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a> (<a href="DeForest%20Kelley">DeForest Kelley</a>), Chief Engineer <a href="Montgomery%20Scott">Montgomery Scott</a> (<a href="James%20Doohan">James Doohan</a>), and historian Lieutenant Marla McGivers (<a href="Madlyn%20Rhue">Madlyn Rhue</a>) <a href="Transporter%20%28Star%20Trek%29">beams</a> over to the freighter. The landing party finds a cargo of 84 humans, 72 of whom are alive in <a href="suspended%20animation">suspended animation</a> after nearly 200 years. McGivers identifies the group's leader who begins to revive and is taken back to the "Enterprise" for a medical examination.

Kirk has "Botany Bay" taken in tow by a <a href="tractor%20beam">tractor beam</a>, and "Enterprise" sets course for Starbase 12. In sickbay, the group's leader awakens and attacks McCoy but, impressed by McCoy's bravery, releases the doctor and introduces himself as "Khan" (<a href="Ricardo%20Montalb%C3%A1n">Ricardo Montalbán</a>). Lt. McGivers marvels over Khan, a living relic from the 20th century, her field of interest. First Officer <a href="Spock">Spock</a> (<a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>) discovers that their guest is <a href="Khan%20Noonien%20Singh">Khan Noonien Singh</a> who, along with his people, are products of 20th-century selective breeding designed to create perfect humans. The genetic superhumans instead became warlords and conquered more than a third of the planet during the Eugenics Wars.

Khan is placed under guard in quarters. McGivers is sent to brief him on current events. Taking advantage of McGivers' attraction towards him, Khan tells her he means to rule mankind again and needs her help to take over "Enterprise". Reluctantly, she agrees, beaming Khan to "Botany Bay", where he revives the rest of his people. They return to "Enterprise" and assume control of the ship. Khan throws Kirk into a decompression tank, and threatens to slowly suffocate him unless Kirk's command crew agree to follow Khan. Having a change of heart, McGivers frees Kirk from the chamber. Kirk and Spock vent anesthetic gas throughout the entire ship to disable Khan and his cohorts. Khan escapes the gas and heads to Engineering, where he attempts to destroy "Enterprise", but Kirk confronts him; they fight and Kirk knocks Khan unconscious.

Kirk holds a hearing to decide the fate of Khan and his followers. Kirk exiles them to <a href="Ceti%20Alpha%20V">Ceti Alpha V</a>, a harsh world that he believes would be a perfect place for Khan to "tame". Khan accepts, citing <a href="John%20Milton">Milton</a>'s "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>". Instead of a court-martial for Lt. McGivers, Kirk allows her to go into exile with Khan. Spock notes that it would be interesting to see what Khan makes of Ceti Alpha V in 100 years.

<a href="Carey%20Wilber">Carey Wilber</a> was hired to write a script for an episode of "Star Trek". His idea was based on an episode he wrote for the television series "<a href="Captain%20Video%20and%20His%20Video%20Rangers">Captain Video and His Video Rangers</a>" (1949–1955). His work on that show featured <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient-Greek-era</a> humans transported in suspended animation through space, with the people of the future finding that they have mythological powers. For "Space Seed", Wilber replaced these mythological powers with abilities that were enhanced due to genetic engineering. Wilber had briefly worked with Gene Roddenberry on the television series "<a href="Harbormaster%20%28TV%20series%29">Harbormaster</a>". His science fiction extended beyond "Star Trek": he also wrote scripts for "<a href="Lost%20in%20Space">Lost in Space</a>" and "<a href="The%20Time%20Tunnel">The Time Tunnel</a>" around the same time. The script changed numerous times during preproduction as producer <a href="Bob%20Justman">Bob Justman</a> felt that it would be too expensive to film. Eventually Gene L. Coon and series creator <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> also made alterations.

In Wilber's first proposal for the story that became "Space Seed", dated August 29, 1966 (shortly before the first episode of "Star Trek" aired) the villain was Harold Erickson, an ordinary criminal exiled into space. He sought to free his gang from "Botany Bay", seize "Enterprise", and become a pirate. Parts of the story were inspired by the use of <a href="penal%20colony">penal colonies</a> in the 18th century, and characterizations were based on descriptions from the series' <a href="writer%27s%20bible">writer's bible</a>. As a result, several elements of the draft differed from how the characters behaved in the series; for example, the draft includes a scene where Spock defeats Kirk at chess by cheating. Producer <a href="Gene%20L.%20Coon">Gene L. Coon</a> told Wilber that his work was the best outline he had seen during his time on "Star Trek". Fellow producer <a href="Bob%20Justman">Bob Justman</a> was less enthusiastic; he compared it negatively to "<a href="Flash%20Gordon">Flash Gordon</a>" and "<a href="Buck%20Rogers">Buck Rogers</a>", and felt the concept would be too expensive to film. There were also concerns that an unsolicited script submitted by science fiction author <a href="Philip%20Jos%C3%A9%20Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a> resembled the proposed plot which, as Roddenberry had corresponded with Farmer, might lead to litigation.

NBC executives reviewed the plot for "Space Seed" and approved it, but Justman reassessed the outline, saying that it needed to be heavily revised. In September, Wilber was given a list of suggested changes including asking him to remove any mention of the setting, as the producers did not want to say how far in the future "Star Trek" was set, and to remove the chess scene. Wilber submitted a second draft, but Roddenberry still had problems with basic elements of the script. He did not believe common criminals would be fired into space as a solution and strongly disliked the notion of space pirates. The second draft introduced the idea that Kirk marooned Erickson and his crew on a new planet; this remained in the final version. Wilber was not asked for a third draft; Coon was tasked with the re-write; he submitted it on December 7 and updated it twice over the following five days. Wilber accepted Coon's re-writes, and left the staff after the submission of his second draft as his contractual obligations were complete.

Coon proposed that Erickson should be a rival to Kirk, a genetic superman who had once ruled part of Earth. Roddenberry and Justman were still unhappy with the script, and Roddenberry revised it once more a week before filming was due to begin, after Montalbán had been cast. In this draft the blond Nordic character of Erickson became closer to the version seen on screen. In Roddenberry and Coon's script, the character was renamed Sibahl Khan Noonien. The name Govin Bahadur Singh was suggested by the DeForest Research company, who checked scripts for potential errors on behalf of the production company; the Singh name was suggested in part because it was closer to actual Sikh names. Coon and Roddenberry settled on Khan Noonien Singh; Roddenberry had an old Chinese friend named Noonien Wang that he had lost touch with, and hoped that Wang would see the episode and contact him. In the final draft, Roddenberry listed himself as the primary writer, Coon as co-writer and Wilber was absent, but the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> turned down Roddenberry's request to be credited; Coon received the main credit; Wilber was given co-writer and "story-by" credits. Wilber did not often watch his own work, and nearly thirty years later had never seen "Space Seed". Coon was later credited as Lee Cronin for his part in production of the script.

Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbán was cast as the genetic superman Khan Noonian Singh, having been the first choice for the role. He had been suggested by casting director Joseph D'Agosta, who was not looking to cast an actor of a particular ethnic background due to Roddenberry's vision for the series; Roddenberry wanted to show his perceived 23rd century values by not requiring any specific ethnicities when casting actors in guest roles. Montalbán had previously appeared in a television movie created by Roddenberry, "The Secret Weapon of 117" (also referred to as "The Secret Defense of 117"), which was the writer's first attempt to create <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction on television</a> and aired more than ten years before "Star Trek". Montalbán called his role as Khan "wonderful", saying that "it was well-written, it had an interesting concept and I was delighted it was offered to me". The main cast were enthusiastic about working with Montalbán; DeForest Kelley later said "I enjoyed working with Ricardo the best. I was privileged. He is a marvelous actor."
Madlyn Rhue, who portrayed Lt. Marla McGivers, had previously worked with Montalbán in an episode of "<a href="Bonanza">Bonanza</a>" in 1960 as his on-screen wife; she later appeared with him in a 1982 episode of "<a href="Fantasy%20Island">Fantasy Island</a>". Montalbán and Rhue also appeared in separate episodes of Roddenberry's previous NBC television series, "<a href="The%20Lieutenant">The Lieutenant</a>" (1963–1964). Main cast member <a href="George%20Takei">George Takei</a> did not appear in "Space Seed"; the character of <a href="Hikaru%20Sulu">Hikaru Sulu</a> was replaced by <a href="MaKee%20K.%20Blaisdell">Blaisdell Makee</a> as Lt. Spinelli. It was the first of two appearances in "Star Trek" for Makee, who would return in the episode "" as Lt. Singh. <a href="John%20Winston%20%28actor%29">John Winston</a> appeared for the second time as Lt. Kyle, and would go on to make nine further episodic appearances in that role. Following positive feedback from the producers and the network regarding James Doohan, "Space Seed" was the first episode to feature a more prominent role for his character, Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott.

Filming of "Space Seed" began December 15, 1966, and concluded on December 22 after six days of shooting. Roddenberry, Coon and Wilber's rewrites resulted in a shooting script of nearly 60 pages and 120 scenes. <a href="Marc%20Daniels">Marc Daniels</a> was hired to direct the episode; he had previously worked on "The Lieutenant". The first day's filming coincided with the airing of the episode "<a href="Balance%20of%20Terror">Balance of Terror</a>", and Daniels allowed the cast and crew to go home early to watch it. The other five days ran to schedule, to the extent that there was an early finish on the final day of filming, allowing cast and crew time to return home to watch a repeat of the episode "<a href="What%20Are%20Little%20Girls%20Made%20Of%3F">What Are Little Girls Made Of?</a>" which had replaced "" on that evening's schedule. A scene filmed but later cut from the episode depicted a discussion between McGivers and Angela Martine (<a href="Barbara%20Baldavin">Barbara Baldavin</a>), intended to show that McGivers was looking for a forceful man. Further scenes were trimmed after filming following input from NBC. For example, scenes shot on the "Botany Bay" were cut as executives felt the costumes worn by the newly awakened crew were too revealing.

The character of Khan required five costumes, more than any other guest star in the entire series. This meant that the staff working on costumes had less time to devote to any one costume. Montalbán's athletic physique was such that when his measurements were passed to them, staff thought there had been a mistake. Costume designer <a href="William%20Ware%20Theiss">William Ware Theiss</a> found it challenging to produce the outfits in the time allotted, to make the materials seem suitably futuristic and to fit his own preferences in design. Two of Khan's outfits re-used previous costumes, while three were specifically created for Montalbán. The production built two new sets for the episode: the <a href="decompression%20chamber">decompression chamber</a> in <a href="sickbay">sickbay</a>, and the set on board "Botany Bay". A doorframe from that set was later reused as an overhead unit in McCoy's research lab, which appeared later in the series.

Post production on "Space Seed" began on December 23, 1966, and ran through February 5 the following year. The Westheimer Company produced the majority of effects in the episode, but the scenes of "Enterprise" and "Botany Bay" in space were produced by Film Effects of Hollywood who were not credited on screen for their work. "Botany Bay" utilized a design <a href="Matt%20Jefferies">Matt Jefferies</a> created prior to the USS "Enterprise". It had been previously labeled "antique space freighter", and was built by Film Effects of Hollywood. The creation of the ship miniature caused the episode to go over budget by more than $12,000; "Space Seed" actually cost a total of $197,262 against a budget of $180,000. By this point, the series was nearly $80,000 over budget in total. The "Botany Bay" model was later re-purposed as a freighter for the episode "<a href="The%20Ultimate%20Computer">The Ultimate Computer</a>".

The sound effects team borrowed effects and manipulated them in order to achieve the "painted sound" effect sought by Roddenberry. Although a number of sources were used, they attempted to avoid most science fiction television series as they wanted an authentic sound. The sound archive of the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> was used, although the <a href="photon%20torpedo">photon torpedo</a> sound was created from the 1953 film "<a href="The%20War%20of%20the%20Worlds%20%281953%20film%29">The War of the Worlds</a>". "Space Seed" was awarded the Golden Reel for sound editing on television by the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Sound%20Editors">Motion Picture Sound Editors</a> society.

"Space Seed" was first broadcast in the United States on February 16, 1967, on <a href="NBC">NBC</a>. A 12-city overnight Trendex report compiled by <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a> showed that during the first half-hour, it held second place in the ratings behind "<a href="Bewitched">Bewitched</a>" on <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> with 13.12 million viewers compared to "Bewitched"s 14.44 million. The episode beat "<a href="My%20Three%20Sons">My Three Sons</a>" on <a href="CBS">CBS</a>. During the second half-hour it was pushed into third place in the ratings by the start of the Thursday Night Movie on CBS, the <a href="Western%20%28genre%29">Western</a> film "<a href="One-Eyed%20Jacks">One-Eyed Jacks</a>" starring <a href="Marlon%20Brando">Marlon Brando</a>, which received 35.5 percent of the audience share compared to 28 percent for "Space Seed".

A <a href="High%20Definition%20TV">High Definition</a> remastering of "Space Seed", which introduced new special effects and starship exteriors as well as enhanced music and audio, was shown for the first time on November 18, 2006, in <a href="broadcast%20syndication">broadcast syndication</a>. It was the eleventh remastered episode to be shown. This meant that the episode was made available to over 200 local stations across the United States with the rights to broadcast "Star Trek", and depending on the station it was broadcast either on November 18 or 19.

In 1967, "<a href="The%20Indiana%20Gazette">The Indiana Gazette</a>" described "Space Seed" as "a good piece of science fiction". The "<a href="Kokomo%20Tribune">Kokomo Tribune</a>" called it "imaginative", and also said that the episode was "particularly interesting" for "its commentary on the scientific know-how of the late 1990s".
Later reviewers watched the episodes several decades after broadcast. Zack Handlen of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" gave the episode an 'A' rating, noting its strong characters and the interplay between Kirk and Spock that emphasizes their friendship. Michelle Erica Green called the episode "legendary" in her review for <a href="TrekNation">TrekNation</a>. She thought that Khan made the "perfect foil" for the trio of Kirk, Spock and McCoy and said that the episode was not dulled by later episodes and films based on "Space Seed". In Mark Pickavance's review at <a href="Den%20of%20Geek">Den of Geek</a>, he said that it remained an "obvious choice of great source material" to be followed up in a film.

The review by Eugene Myers and Torrie Atkinson on <a href="Tor%20Books">Tor.com</a> criticized the attraction between McGivers and Khan, saying that it was "really uncomfortable to watch her immediate attraction to him and her easy acceptance of his abusive and <a href="controlling%20behavior">controlling behavior</a>". Both praised the episode, Myers giving it a five out of six, and Atkinson a six out of six rating. Also at Tor.com, in Ryan Britt and Emily Asher-Perrin's list of the ten most under-appreciated elements of "Star Trek", they placed "Space Seed" at number three saying that "As an introductory story to what old school Star Trek was all about, 'Space Seed' is perfect. It presents an original science fiction concept, grapples with notions of human technology and ingenuity creating a monster, and features Captain Kirk beating the crap out of someone with a piece of Styrofoam. What more could you want?"

"<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" named the episode the second best of the series, while <a href="IGN">IGN</a> ranked "Space Seed" as the fourth best, praising the fist fight between Kirk and Khan. It appeared in the top ten episodes listed by "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" and was also included in a list of ten "must see" episodes on "The A.V. Club". Reviewer Zack Handlen said that it "features a terrific performance from guest star Montalbán, gives the franchise one of its greatest villains, and sets the stage for one of best science-fiction adventure movies ever made".

The first adaptation of "Space Seed" was as a re-working into a short story by author <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a> as part of the <a href="novelization">novelization</a> "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28Bantam%20Books%29">Star Trek 2</a>". This book contained seven short stories, each based on an episode of "The Original Series" and was published in 1968. The adaptation of "Space Seed" appeared as the final story in the book. The first home media release of "Space Seed" was on a single-episode VHS cassette in 1982 by <a href="Paramount%20Home%20Video">Paramount Home Video</a>. It was one of the episodes of "The Original Series" published on <a href="Capacitance%20Electronic%20Disc">Capacitance Electronic Disc</a>, alongside "The Changeling", released on November 1, 1982. A <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a> of the episode, alongside "<a href="Return%20of%20the%20Archons">Return of the Archons</a>" was released in 1985. Further releases of all episodes of the series were made on VHS and <a href="Betamax">Betamax</a>. These releases reverted to a single episode tape as in the original 1982 version.

The episode was released on DVD paired with "<a href="A%20Taste%20of%20Armageddon">A Taste of Armageddon</a>" as part of the general release of the series in 2000. There were no additional extras added to that entire series of releases, except the DVD containing "<a href="Turnabout%20Intruder">Turnabout Intruder</a>". "Space Seed" was later released within a DVD box set of the first season in 2004; all three seasons of "The Original Series" were released as full-season box sets that year. The episode was included in the remastered season one release on DVD and <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> in 2009. This release featured <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> remodels of "Enterprise" and other space scenes, including the "Botany Bay". The most recent release is as part of the "Star Trek: Origins" collection on Blu-ray, which was released in 2013.

The events of "Space Seed" are followed up in the 1982 film "". <a href="Harve%20Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> was hired to produce a sequel to "" having never seen the television series; he watched every episode in preparation and latched onto Khan from "Space Seed" as the compelling villain he considered to be lacking from the first film. In resuming the role of Khan, Montalbán worried that fans would see him only as Mr. Roarke from "Fantasy Island" but felt that he managed to recapture the character after re-watching "Space Seed". The film set a record for the opening weekend gross of $14.3 million, and went on to take $78.9 million domestically within the United States, making it the sixth best-selling film of the year.

The movie features errors in continuity when compared to "Space Seed". Because of re-casting, Khan's followers appear not to have aged from their appearance in the episode and Khan recognizes <a href="Pavel%20Chekov">Pavel Chekov</a>—the character did not join "Star Trek" until season two, after this episode took place. This latter error was described in Deborah Cartmell and Imelda Whelehan's book "Adaptations: From Text to Screen, Screen to Text" as the "gaffe notorious throughout "Star Trek" fandom". An explanation was presented in the novelization of "The Wrath of Khan", which stated that Chekov was working on the night shift at the time.

A non-canon novelization by <a href="Greg%20Cox%20%28writer%29">Greg Cox</a> was later released in 2005 to fill in the timeframe between "Space Seed" and the film, titled "". This book expanded on Khan's romance with McGivers, and the author wanted to "give her a spine" as he felt that she was not "the pride of Starfleet, and even less of a feminist role-model" in her appearance in "Space Seed".

Events of both "Space Seed" and "The Wrath of Khan" were also directly referenced in 2013's "<a href="Star%20Trek%20Into%20Darkness">Star Trek Into Darkness</a>", in which <a href="Benedict%20Cumberbatch">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> portrayed Khan. The film took $70.1 million on the opening weekend, and $467.3 million internationally throughout the cinematic release. As part of their line of licensed "Star Trek" comic books, <a href="IDW%20Publishing">IDW Publishing</a> launched a five-part mini-series titled "" which described the early part of Khan's life and how the events in "Star Trek Into Darkness" diverged from those seen in "Space Seed". One of the writers of the film, <a href="Roberto%20Orci">Roberto Orci</a>, was the story consultant on the comic series. This series also explained how Khan changed physically in order to be represented by Cumberbatch in the film. A retro-style film poster for "Space Seed" was created by <a href="Juan%20Ortiz%20%28artist%29">Juan Ortiz</a> in 2013, released around the same as "Star Trek Into Darkness".

The television series "" makes several further references to the events first described in "Space Seed". In "", the survivors of the <a href="Xindi%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Xindi</a> attack on Earth eventually resettle on Ceti Alpha–V. The development of Khan and his followers were said to have been through <a href="selective%20breeding">selective breeding</a> in "Space Seed". American sociologist <a href="William%20Sims%20Bainbridge">William Sims Bainbridge</a> said that this method would have been unable to create genetic supermen in such a short space of time and that today the less implausible method of genetic engineering (directly changing the DNA code) would be used. In fact, subsequent references to the creation of Khan and the other supermen, such as in the "" episode "<a href="Doctor%20Bashir%2C%20I%20Presume">Doctor Bashir, I Presume</a>", substituted genetic engineering.

The Eugenics Wars, first mentioned in "Space Seed", are stated in the "Star Trek Chronology" by <a href="Michael%20Okuda">Michael</a> and <a href="Denise%20Okuda">Denise Okuda</a> as taking place between 1992 and 1996. They considered it fortunate that these events did not come to pass in the real world, and noted that the development of the "Botany Bay" in 1996 as an instance of where ""Star Trek" technological predictions have missed by a significant margin". The war itself has been referenced elsewhere in the "Star Trek" franchise. The first mention of the wars following "Space Seed" was in the "" episode "<a href="The%20Infinite%20Vulcan">The Infinite Vulcan</a>", in which a cloned version of Dr. Stavos Keniclius, a scientist from that era, clones Spock. Later, during the production of "Doctor Bashir, I Presume?", writer <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Echevarria">René Echevarria</a>, seeking a secret past for Doctor <a href="Julian%20Bashir">Julian Bashir</a>, noted that coverage of the issue of eugenics in "Star Trek" had been limited to Khan and his followers. Fellow writer <a href="Ronald%20D.%20Moore">Ronald D. Moore</a> decided to link the background of Bashir to genetic engineering. "<a href="Encounter%20at%20Farpoint">Encounter at Farpoint</a>" and "Star Trek First Contact" confused matters by saying World War III (otherwise known as The Eugenics Wars) had occurred in the 2050s. When Echevarria wrote that the Eugenics Wars took place 200 years before the "Deep Space Nine" episode "<a href="Doctor%20Bashir%2C%20I%20Presume%3F">Doctor Bashir, I Presume?</a>", he took the time interval directly from "The Wrath of Khan", failing to factor in the additional century between the events of the original series (and its associated films).

Novelist Gary Cox first mentioned the events of the Eugenics Wars in his non-canon novel "Assignment: Eternity", which followed up on the events of the episode "" and included the characters of <a href="Gary%20Seven">Gary Seven</a> and Roberta Lincoln. In it, he mentioned that Seven and Lincoln were involved in overthrowing Khan during the Eugenics Wars. He had not intended to explore this any further, but he was prompted to do so by his editor at <a href="Pocket%20Books">Pocket Books</a>. He wrote a story, split into two books, about the specific events of the Eugenics Wars, entitled "Star Trek: The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh". As the Eugenics Wars were already meant to have taken place, he decided to describe them as being a massive conspiracy that was not discovered until generations had passed. He also felt that this approach would make the books consistent with the "" episode "<a href="Future%27s%20End">Future's End</a>" in which the crewmembers travel in time to the same period of Earth's history as the Eugenics Wars, but find no such wars taking place. A further version of the Eugenics Wars was presented in the "Star Trek: Khan" comic book mini-series.

The "Enterprise" episodes "", "<a href="Cold%20Station%2012">Cold Station 12</a>" and "<a href="The%20Augments">The Augments</a>" showed a further group of genetic superpeople produced from embryos produced in the same era as Khan and his crew. This was a deliberate link by the producers of "Enterprise" to both "Space Seed" and "The Wrath of Khan", and was one of several plots during the fourth season of the show to include elements of "Star Trek: The Original Series" in the hope that this would boost ratings.

Anachronox

Anachronox is a third-person <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a> produced by <a href="Tom%20Hall">Tom Hall</a> and the Dallas <a href="Ion%20Storm">Ion Storm</a> games studio. It was released worldwide in June 2001 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. The game is centered on Sylvester "Sly Boots" Bucelli, a down-and-out <a href="private%20investigator">private investigator</a> who looks for work in the slums of Anachronox, a once-abandoned planet near the galaxy's <a href="jumpgate">jumpgate</a> hub. He travels to other planets, amasses an unlikely group of friends, and unravels a mystery that threatens the fate of the universe. The game's <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> story was influenced by <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a>, <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, and unconventional humor. The story features a theme of working through the troubles of one's past, and ends with a major <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>.

The gameplay for "Anachronox" is turn-based; the player controls a party of up to three characters as they explore a 3D environment of futuristic cities, space vessels, and outdoor areas. Inspirations for the game include older role-playing video games such as "<a href="Chrono%20Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>" and the <a href="Final%20Fantasy">"Final Fantasy" series</a>, animator <a href="Chuck%20Jones">Chuck Jones</a> and the novel "<a href="Ender%27s%20Game">Ender's Game</a>". The game was built with a heavily modified version of the <a href="id%20Software">id Software</a>'s <a href="id%20Tech%202">id Tech 2</a>, rewritten chiefly to allow a wider color palette, emotive animations and facial expressions, better lighting, <a href="particle%20effects">particle effects</a>, and camera effects.

The development of "Anachronox" was long and difficult, originally planned for a third-quarter 1998 release. Tom Hall planned to create a sequel with the copious content removed during production. Critics enjoyed the game and awarded it high marks for its design and story. Ion Storm's Dallas offices were closed mere days within the game's release. In 2002, "Anachronox" cinematic director Jake Hughes spliced together gameplay footage and <a href="cutscenes">cutscenes</a> to create a feature-length, award-winning <a href="machinima">machinima</a> film.

"Anachronox" is a turn-based <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> similar in nature to many <a href="History%20of%20Eastern%20role-playing%20video%20games">Japanese role-playing video games</a> like "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>". The player controls a party of up to three characters as they explore a 3D environment (colloquially known as a "field map") of futuristic cities, space vessels, and outdoor areas. Players can swap for new party members, talk to non-player characters, and collect and shop for equipment and items. When players near an interactive character or item, a floating arrow-shaped electronic device called the LifeCursor appears, which lets the player click on the person or item. After a certain point in the story, players can travel by shuttle to other planets, triggering <a href="cutscenes">cutscenes</a> of the shuttle trips. Each playable character has a unique skill, such as lockpicking, which may be used to solve puzzles. Some sequences involve <a href="minigame">minigame</a>s, such as an unnamed mission in which the player pilots a fighter spaceship to destroy enemies with lasers. Certain field maps also feature simple two-dimensional minigames, including the original games Ox and Bugaboo. The protagonist Boots also possesses a camera, which the player can use to take <a href="screenshots">screenshots</a> for their own enjoyment or as part of quest objectives.

Enemy encounters trigger a combat mode. As in "<a href="Chrono%20Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>", enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party and thus are not <a href="random%20encounter">random</a>. Similar to "Final Fantasy"s <a href="Active%20Time%20Battle">Active Time Battle</a>, each character has a meter that gradually fills with time. When the meter is full, characters can physically attack enemies, use MysTech magic, unleash BattleSkill attacks, use items, move to a different position, or use a nearby object to attack, if present. For playable characters and computer-controlled enemies, each attack has their number of <a href="hit%20point">hit point</a>s (a numerically based life bar) get reduced, which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags. Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron-Radiated Glodents (NRG), a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character's life bar. NRG is replenished through certain items. Use of BattleSkills require Bouge, a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is. Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game. Winning battles earns <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s and raises characters' <a href="Experience%20point%23Level-based%20progression">levels</a>, granting them improved statistics. These statistics can be viewed through the status screen, which displays important character information and current quests. Unlike many other RPGs, "Anachronox" displays a character's attributes with qualitative descriptors (such as Poor and Excellent) instead of integers.

The Mysterium Tech (or MysTech) system allows players to use in-game objects collectively known as MysTech, and create new MysTech by using a configuration screen accessed through Elementor Host items. MysTech cannot be used until they are awakened after a certain story event. Eight basic colors of MysTech exist, representing different elements; for example, green represents poison. Players can use MysTech to inflict damage upon enemies, plague them with certain status effects (such as freezing them in place), or heal party members. Casting status effect-MysTech on party members will cure them if afflicted by enemy status spells. MysTech slabs and Elementor Hosts can be found as treasure in the game world or bought from shops. To create MysTech, players place colored bugs (found on small hills in several game locations) in empty slots on an Elementor Host. The color of bugs placed in the function slot determines the color of MysTech, while other slots modify the power and/or range of the spell. Players can add special bugs known as Cobalt Crawlers to make a spell target all enemies instead of one; a Host filled with eight Crawlers unlocks a secret spell. The effect of bugs can be amplified by feeding them petals from Lifeflowers, which can be found scattered throughout the world of "Anachronox". Special types of Hosts with two or three different functions allow players to pick which MysTech function to use in battle.

The game takes place on Anachronox (a portmanteau of "anachronism" and "noxious," meaning "poison from the past"), a small planet floating inside a huge artificial sphere known as Sender One. Husks of futuristic cities exist on artificial <a href="tectonic%20plates">tectonic plates</a>, which constantly shift to connect different parts of the planet. Inhabitants believe that diseased aliens were quarantined there eons ago, resulting in the name Anachronox. Northern Anachronox is clean and upscale, while southern Anachronox is crime-ridden and run-down. Humanity travels to different planets from Sender One, which had been the center of a transportation system for a race of non-humanoids enabling faster-than-light travel. Inbound and outbound traffic stops at Sender Station, an orbiting construct above Sender One with hotels and a red light district. Civilizations conduct business using currency like the one-dollar coin known as a "<a href="loonie">loonie</a>", while several people collect MysTech—shards of rock with markings, believed to be dormant weapons or art pieces created by an extinct alien race. MysTech were first found three-hundred years ago, and are poorly understood, though avidly collected.

Other planets in Sender One include Sunder, Hephaestus, Democratus, and Limbus. The galaxy's scientific community is headquartered on the temperate planet of Sunder, and people are only permitted to go there if they are sufficiently intelligent. Hephaestus is an important religious center. A mostly volcanic planet, Hephaestus hosts a town and temple complex of monks who study MysTech. Democratus is climatically similar to Earth, with regions of desert, snow, forest, and prairie. Several populations of different sentient species exist on the surface, but the planet is ruled by a race of tall, thin humanoids with large craniums who dwell on a large mechanical ring constructed around the planet. This race is obsessed with the ideal of <a href="democracy">democracy</a>, and though they possess incredible scientific and engineering knowledge, they are constantly bogged down by their own ineptitude and the frailties of the democratic process. Limbus is known as the "planet of death", as voyagers never return; its surface is arid and rocky, with sparse vegetation. A planet mentioned but not seen in the game is Krapton, home to superheroes and villains. Most of Krapton's human population has fled, tired of being constantly abducted and saved by warring superpeople.

The protagonist of "Anachronox" is Sylvester "Sly Boots" Bucelli, a human and former private detective on Anachronox. Twenty-nine years old and described as "bold, brash, and overconfident", Boots has gotten himself into trouble and now runs his agency out of rented storage space above a seedy bar. His only friends are PAL-18, his spirited, sarcastic robot assistant since childhood, and Fatima Doohan, his secretary. Fatima was fatally injured and <a href="Mind%20uploading">digitized</a> by Boots onto a <a href="Personal%20digital%20assistant">PDA</a>-analogue "LifeCursor", where she bitterly lives to render assistance. Several allies join Boots over the course of the game; first is 71-year-old Grumpos Matavastros, a "scholar, outdoorsman, eccentric recluse, and renaissance man"—and a very grumpy person. A former curator of the MysTech museum on Anachronox, Grumpos devotes his life to studying the artifacts. Dr. Rho Bowman joins the party on Sunder; she is a brilliant scientist who's been branded a heretic after publication of her book, "MysTech Awake!" The team then gains support from Democratus, an eccentric planet boasting a planetary ring and brilliant technology. Said technology includes having the planet shrink to human height to be part of the team. Two further allies are the <a href="femme%20fatale">femme fatale</a> Stiletto Anyway—a 25-year-old former companion of Boots known for being stealthy and aloof—and Paco "El Puño" Estrella, a washed up superhero who's turned to alcoholism after his comic book series was canceled. Their foes include Detta, a heavyset crime boss/kingpin on planet Anachronox, and several other monsters and shady characters.

Sly Boots lives in a cheap apartment above Rowdy's, a bar in the seedy "Bricks" section of South Anachronox. Grumpos Matavastros commissions Boots to find a piece of MysTech, but Detta accosts them and steals it. Grumpos, Boots, and robot assistant PAL-18 then seek out Dr. Rho Bowman, an expert on MysTech, at an institute for troublesome scientists on Sunder. She undertakes an experiment to activate MysTech, apparently causing the destruction of Sunder. Rho and the others escape the planet on a shuttle, and drift in space for seventeen days until they are brought on board a habitat ring around the planet Democratus. Rho discovers that all MysTech is now active, and can grant powers and spells. Boots pilots a fighter ship to save Democratus from insectoid invaders known as the Virulent Hive. The heroes return to Sender Station's Lounge of Commerce; Democratus joins the party, the High Council having shrunken the planet to human height. While searching for equipment, Boots earns money as an erotic dancer and encounters Stiletto Anyway, an old flame who's become an assassin and plots revenge against Detta. Rho explains that the universe operates on the <a href="big%20bounce">big bounce</a> principle; a universe that forms with a <a href="big%20bang">big bang</a> will eventually suffer a <a href="big%20crunch">big crunch</a>, giving rise to a new big bang. She explains that Sunder was destroyed by an injection of matter from the previous universe, which will hasten the current universe's big crunch. If enough matter is switched between universes, the previous one can escape a big crunch and the current one will cease to exist.

The team heads to Hephaestus, transformed to a tourist destination now that MysTech is active. They realize MysTech functions can be customized through the use of small, colored bugs and a MysTech host. Sly gains audience with the Grand Mysterium, who tells him that in the next universe, species known as "Chaos" and "Order" fought a bitter war. Order enslaved Chaos in the current universe, but Chaos wishes to escape to the previous universe to prevent future ones from existing and thus eradicate Order. The Mysterium tells Sly he must find and seal off the gate to the previous universe, and to journey to Limbus. The team is captured en route by comic supervillain Rictus; Boots meets former superhero Paco in his prison. Rictus flushes them into empty space; the High Council of Democratus restores the planet to its original size to save them.

Scenes of reflection reveal the past on Anachronox. Stiletto had been Sly's young assistant at his upscale agency; he was in love with her, but Fatima was in love with him. Detta abducted Stiletto, spurring Sly's search. Her love unrequited, Fatima went into his office one night to leave a note of resignation. Sly burst in with news of Stiletto's location, and he and Fatima pursued Detta across Anachronox by flying car. Sly lost control, wrecking it and accidentally killing Fatima. Suffering from major depression, Sly ran up debts with Detta to pay for Fatima's revival inside the LifeCursor.

The team regather at Democratus and journey to Limbus, where they meet creatures of the same race as the Grand Mysterium. They repel invaders called the "Dark Servants" from an orbital portal. The leader of Limbus explains that though Chaos is enslaved in the current universe, the Dark Servants (who originate from the current universe) are trying to free them and have found a way into the previous universe, where they initiated the destruction of Sunder. MysTech is a gift from the forces of Order to help the current universe's inhabitants fight Chaos. The team return to Anachronox to find Rowdy, a disguised citizen of Limbus who has been searching for the gate to the previous universe. Rowdy notes that they must destroy the key to the gate, now in the possession of Detta. The team infiltrate his fortress, kill him, and prepare to destroy the key at the gate itself—the fountain spiral of Anachronox. Grumpos seizes it, revealing himself to be a Dark Servant; he escapes with the agents of Chaos into the previous universe. Sly and the others prepare to follow them and save the universe; the game ends as they approach the gate.

<a href="Ion%20Storm">Ion Storm</a> announced "Anachronox" in April 1997, and planned for a third-quarter 1998 release. Tom Hall, veteran designer and one of the founders of Ion Storm, helmed the project and originated most of its story and design. Other founding members of the team were Todd Porter (producer), Jake Hughes (associate producer and director of cinematics), Ben Herrera (artist), Brian Eiserloh (programmer), and David Namaksy (lead mapper). Mapper Larry Herring was hired after being mentored by John Romero and submitting a custom "<a href="Doom%202">Doom 2</a>" map to Tom Hall. Hall first conceived "Anachronox" in his bathroom, prompting him to install a whiteboard and sound-recorder in his shower, as well as several notepads around his house for future ideas; he had conceived the character Sly Boots years earlier in college. He wrote a 460-page design document (completed in May 1997) outlining the universe of "Anachronox", beyond the game's scope; other game design documents of the period, he noted, were usually only 125 pages in size. He then condensed the story, leaving a third beyond the scheduled game. The game's design phase lasted three months. Hall made plans for two <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a>s from the outset of development, owing to the huge story. Developers told "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" the story would be "<a href="Joseph%20Campbell">Campbellian</a>" and feature immense environments. Hall noted in mid-1997, "Not since "<a href="Commander%20Keen">Keen</a>" has a universe been so clear in my head."

Tom Hall announced that "Ananchronox" would feature a "turbulent story with a roller coaster of emotion", and promised it would bring personality and humor to the role-playing genre. Hall aimed to make an emotionally gripping, cinematic experience from the beginning: "I want this game to answer the question, 'Can a computer make you cry?' I want to make the characters so warm and friendly and lovable and identifiable... I want to start them off in fun situations, but as the game goes on, I want the atmosphere to get darker and darker. Friends betray the lead character, other friends die, and you will feel some of what they feel because you have been with these people for 50 hours, and in a sense, lived part of their lives with them." Hall remarked that the characters were facets of his childhood. He later compared the name "Anachronox" (meaning poison from the past) and the internal struggles of each character, caused by turbulent events in their pasts and "psychic poison." Hall aimed to feature high-quality direction and camera-work in "Anachronox", reminiscent of epic cinematic themes in role-playing video games like the "Final Fantasy" franchise. Hall enlisted producer Jake Hughes to direct cut scenes; Hughes had previously worked on several short independent films. Developers used real-time game cutscenes instead of <a href="live-action">live-action</a> cinematics to avoid "[taking] players out of the game." Hall remarked, "All these games switch to cutscenes that look five hundred times better than the game. The secret is not to let the cutscenes kick the game's ass."

Tom Hall chose the "<a href="Quake%20engine">Quake</a>" engine for "Anachronox"; its developer <a href="John%20Carmack">John Carmack</a> took interest in its use for a role-playing game. Ion Storm would soon switch to the <a href="id%20Tech%202">id Tech 2</a> engine, necessitating a transition from December 1997 to March 1998. The team would implement engine support for <a href="32-bit%20color">32-bit color</a>, particle systems, a spline-based camera scriptor, facial deformations, and lip-synching. Facial deformation involved moving the vertices of a character's face, thereby creating emotional expressions and body language. Developers built the first models in <a href="Lightwave">Lightwave</a>; the main characters had polygon counts of 500-700. By the end of 1997, Hall had scripted interaction with 130 non-player characters for 160 planned locations. Hall cited "Chrono Trigger" as a strong influence; previewers drew parallels with the "Final Fantasy" series and "<a href="Ultima%20III">Ultima III</a>". As in "Chrono Trigger", battles were scripted and not caused by random, unavoidable encounters. Hall explained, "if there's a dragon guarding a door, I want the chance to say, 'whoah, look at the time, gotta run', not, 'think I'll check this door. (*roaaar*) Dragon? Where the hell was "that"?!?'" The team expanded the "Final Fantasy"-style combat by allowing actions to be queued in advance. Hall listed some of his inspirations for "Anachronox" in mid-2000: "In movies, some inspirational people are <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Spielberg</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Hitchcock</a>, <a href="George%20Roy%20Hill">George Roy Hill</a>, <a href="Rob%20Reiner">Rob Reiner</a>, and now <a href="Sam%20Mendes">Sam Mendes</a>. Also a big fan of <a href="Chuck%20Jones">Chuck Jones</a>, who directed Warner Brothers cartoons. Novels: "<a href="Gateway%20%28novel%29">Gateway</a>", "<a href="Ender%27s%20Game">Ender's Game</a>", "<a href="Snow%20Crash">Snow Crash</a>", "<a href="Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy">Hitchhiker's</a>", so many more. Games: "Chrono Trigger", "Final Fantasy", LucasArts adventures (Ron Gilbert and Tim Schafer rock), "<a href="Ape%20Escape">Ape Escape</a>" (buy it now), "<a href="Mario%20%28franchise%29">Mario</a>", "Ultima III", "<a href="Wizardry%20I">Wizardry I</a>", oh, I'm sure I'm forgetting some!" Hall also drew dramatic inspiration from a scene in "Chrono Trigger" in which the characters discuss the theme of regret around a campfire.

As production continued, Tom Hall dubbed the game's scripting language "APE" (Anachronox Programming Language). Hall explained, "I call it my new Apple II because it's so much fun to program in and it takes all the drudgery out of it. It's sort of if you mushed together C, Basic and Java in a way—for programming people it's sort of Windows based. It began as a defined dialogue window, but provided variables so that you could position and move a picture. So from there it grew like UNIX with little bits and pieces, and you have things that initialize data to the window, things that constantly update the window, and things that happen after the window, in little code chunks and with that you can do any little thing." Hall wrote and coded the mini-game Bugaboo for "Anachronox" in 15 hours to demonstrate the environment's simplicity. Other tools developed for the game were B.E.D. (a battle editor), ION Radiant (for level design, based on <a href="QERadiant">QERadiant</a>), NoxDrop (for item and character placement), and Planet (a spline-based camera system coded by Joey Liaw). Ion Storm worked with <a href="QuakeEd">QuakeEd</a> developer Robert Duffy to create QERadiant, later adapted to ION Radiant. Hall lauded Planet: "you can control entities on paths, trigger events, manipulate particles, and do just about anything you please. One of the more common team beliefs is that the only true limit to Planet is the person controlling it." Hall aimed to provide several end-user modification tools, such as one to allow gamers to create their own MysTech elements. Other programs would allow implementation of new dialogue, voice-acting, and camera work. Ion Storm developed tutorials and documentation for each tool.

Developers tasked both art and map design personnel with creating levels, ensuring visual quality. Hall implemented a "grow as you play" philosophy, choosing to show certain features and statistics (like "Beat" or the use of MysTech) only after the player enabled their use. Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays—numerical or qualitative (using categories such as "very good" or "bad"). Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games: "One of the things I hate about RPGs is, you've got, like, 'here's this thing and here's that thing' and it's like 'this is 52 and that's 53' I mean, what's the difference? It's like, OK it's 'a point,' and the formula will come up to be like 'two points' and like, sure, that's going to make a difference. So now I have to hit the guy three times..." Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal, and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions. Fatima's name is a pun born from the phrase, "What am I doing?" Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having forgotten what comes next in the current quest or storyline.

Ion Storm contracted <a href="Soundelux%20Design%20Music%20Group">Soundelux Design Music Group</a> to provide music for "Anachronox". The firm hired <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28composer%29">Bill Brown</a> for additional music. Tom Hall was impressed with Brown's work, particularly music for the planet Democratus. Hall worked with musician Ron Jones and a local Dallas band to record the game's two <a href="funk">funk</a> numbers by mid-1998. Tom Hall planned for each character to have their own theme music, and for songs to change via interaction or exploration. He spoke of the planned music, "The Anachronox sound will be industrial, mixed with forties bluesy swing. As you get on later in the game, the music gets scarier, more chaotic, and gets down to hard-core metal." Developers integrated <a href="DirectMusic">DirectMusic</a> support in 1999 to allow dynamic changing of background music. Sound programmer Henrik Jonsson implemented 3D sound and other capabilities using the <a href="Miles%20Sound%20System">Miles Sound System</a>. Developers also planned to use software called Magpie Pro to lip-sync animated mouths to spoken words. The team chose not to record voices for each line of dialogue, as Tom Hall felt certain speech would become repetitive. The <a href="Undermain%20Theatre">Undermain Theatre</a> group of Dallas provided several voices. Tom Hall voiced PAL-18 reportedly because "no one else got it goofy enough".

Ion Storm debuted a trailer for the game at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> 1997. The team worked several long nights and slept in a cardboard fort (named "Fort Nox") in the office to prepare the trailer. A thief stole developers' laptop at the Dallas airport, requiring Ion Storm to upload a new demo for the conference. Hall continued writing and designing; he invented the Brebulan language by creating several phonemes and glyphs of the letter 8 turned on its side. Ben Herrera completed several sketches of characters and worlds by August 1997, and the team hoped to achieve full engine functionality by September 2, Hall's birthday. The game would suffer serious delays in its production.

Ion Storm solicited feedback from fans after demonstrating progress on "Anachronox" at E3 1998, and assured inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Tom Hall touted, "It is going to be very cinematic and about as non-linear as you can get. Some levels will be bigger than anything ever seen in a 3-D environment. We are really pushing the engine for this, with loads of textures." Developers made two demonstrations; the second featured lasers, lens flare, and volumetric fog. The gaming press received "Anachronox" well; one reporter wrote the game was "stunningly beautiful...[with] some of the most superb effects ever seen in a computer game, including rippling water, stunning laser lights and shadow effects". Another wrote that the game would be "graphically spectacular, with detailed characters". Panelists at E3 nominated "Anachronox" in the "Most Promising Game" and "Best RPG" categories for the <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Awards</a>. Ion Storm planned for a 1999 release, and unveiled new screenshots at the 1998 <a href="European%20Computer%20Trade%20Show">European Computer Trade Show</a>. Among the game's maps developed in 1998 were Hephaestus (polished by David Namaksy); Whitendon (<a href="Iikka%20Ker%C3%A4nen">Iikka Keränen</a>); Democratus, "Matrix 0", and certain interiors of Anachronox (Larry Herring); and the city of Limbus (<a href="Digital%20Eel">Rich Carlson</a>). Lead programmer Joey Liaw left Ion Storm to attend Stanford University in mid-1998. That November, several developers at Ion Storm departed to form their own company; among them was David Namaksy, lead level designer for "Anachronox".

As of January 1999, Ion Storm CEO <a href="Todd%20Porter%20%28writer%29">Todd Porter</a> expected the game to ship 2.5 million copies. Ion Storm decided to produce a sequel for "Anachronox" around early 1999, feeling there would otherwise be too much content for one game, requiring prohibitive costs and delays. Team member Brian Eiserloh noted that several art assets had already been created for the sequel. By May 1999, the team had settled on a cast of 450 non-player characters, and planned for a late 1999 or early 2000 release date. Ion Storm launched the "Anachronox" website in early 1999 with a movie-style <a href="trailer%20%28film%29">trailer</a>. Tom Hall featured four "Anachronox" non-player characters in his online tongue-in-cheek spoof of <a href="Kasparov%20versus%20the%20World">Kasparov versus the World</a>. Among the game's maps completed in 1999 were the Bricks slums of Anachronox (Seneca Menard), Ballotine (Josh Jay), Sender Station (Lee Dotson), others parts of Democratus (Matt Sophos), the Casinox area of Anachronox (Brian Patenaude), and the junkyard maze of Anachronox. Tom Hall reported in 1999 that an option was being developed to remove adult themes, later manifested as an option to turn off profanity. Ion Storm demonstrated the game at E3 1999; the team drove an <a href="RV">RV</a> to the event, which suffered a blowout and electrical failure. "Computer Games Magazine" afterward commented that "Anachronox" had "wider roots than a Banyan grove and more promise per square byte than a CD collection of political speeches."

Hall personally invented and scripted Boots's erotic dancing mini-game. He noted, "we're not above degrading our main character." Ion Storm showed off the mini-game at E3 2000, drawing humored reactions. Art director Lee Perry noted in March 2000 that perfecting the battle system was the biggest remaining hurdle for release. Ion Storm promoted a fall 2000 release date in May, and <a href="IGN">IGN</a> reported in July that a <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> port of "Anachronox" was planned for production after the PC version's release. Ion Storm issued a clarification that they were only considering a Dreamcast port. The firm transferred staff who had worked on "Daikatana" to "Anachronox" after the former's release in summer 2000. The team finished the game's control setup in August.

The team began working six-day weeks by late 2000. By 2001, the team was working 12- to 16-hour days and 6- to 7-day weeks. Hall described weekly bug meetings before release: "you see 100 bugs at the start of the week, fix the 80 you can replicate, and then meet the next Monday to address the 200 bugs they found, fix the 160 you can replicate, then meet to discuss the 400 they found...the time in-between is scary. Usually, the programmers find the bug, then stumble out of their cube, 'we were SO lucky to find that' or 'how did that EVER work?' It's like some bizarre divination method that no one is quite sure how it finds things, but no one wants to 'disturb the mojo'." Several Internet rumors that Ion Storm would soon close spread in May 2001. By June 2001, all dialogue had been recorded and Ion Storm was working on balancing, playtesting, and adjusting gameplay; release was set for the next month. "Anachronox" went <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle">gold</a> and shipped to manufacturers in late June.

"Anachronox" was released on June 27, 2001, in North America, June 29 in Europe, and June 30 in Oceania. "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" packaged a <a href="game%20demo">game demo</a> of "Anachronox" with its 100th issue. "The Canberra Times" staged a giveaway of three game copies to coincide with its release in Oceania. By the end of 2001, sales of "Anachronox" in North America had reached 20,480 units, according to <a href="PC%20Data">PC Data</a>. The game was rereleased in Oceania as a budget title in 2004.

Team member Lucas Davis compiled the development tools and documentation for "Anachronox" and released them in August 2001. Four bug-fixing patches exist for "Anachronox". Ion Storm created the first (1.01), which fixed the Windows 2000 buffer overrun crash and implemented other improvements such as taxi-cabs between distant points and enhanced save game functionality. Ion Storm released the first patch (1.01) on July 2, 2001. Joey Liaw set up a <a href="GeoCities">GeoCities</a> website for reporting bugs and technical information after the game's release, and worked on a new patch in his spare time. The second patch (1.02, or build 44) was released in May 2003 and overhauls the save-game system and provides other important stability fixes. The third and fourth patches—1.02 (build 45), released September 2003, and 1.02 (build 46), released April 2004—are fan-made <a href="unofficial%20patch">unofficial patch</a>es and fix most of the remaining bugs. <a href="Fan%20translation%20of%20video%20games">Fans have translated</a> the game into German and released a conversion patch. Level designer Rich Carlson released a scrapped secret level for "Anachronox" in February 2004 after finding it on an old floppy disk.

"Anachronox" earned positive reviews from critics. "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" called it the most original game Ion Storm had produced, while "<a href="The%20Scotsman">The Scotsman</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviewer appreciated its "many original touches". "PC Gamer" featured "Anachronox" four times in its top 100 PC games lists: #16 (2007), #17 (2008), #61 (2010), & #76 (2015). It was also "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"'s Game of the Week. Writer <a href="Jeff%20Green%20%28writer%29">Jeff Green</a> lamented that Ion Storm had shut down after "Anachronox"; he called it "easily the best console-style RPG ever made for the PC."

Reviewers highlighted the gameplay style, branded an unusual mix between <a href="console%20RPG">role-playing video game</a>s and PC <a href="first-person%20shooter">first-person shooter</a>s. Some compared it to the <a href="Final%20Fantasy">"Final Fantasy" series</a> and "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>". "<a href="Evening%20Standard">The Evening Standard</a>" wrote, ""Anachronox" swaps puzzlement for humour while keeping the character interaction, deep storyline and strategic battles that make the Japanese games so good." "Computer Gaming World" felt the game "incorporates the best elements of the adventure and role-playing genres." In contrast, "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" felt the genre-blending resulted in generic gameplay at times. Lyndon Russell of the "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>" praised the basic mechanics, though he found the combat predictable. <a href="Erik%20Wolpaw">Erik Wolpaw</a> praised the battle system's unique focus on movement, but wished characters could wait for a turn rather than perform an action. The puzzle elements, such as those brought by Fatima, were well-received, even considered "indispensable".

The game's aesthetics were strongly praised. One reviewer appreciated the variety of styles in the music; it has been compared to <a href="Yanni">Yanni</a>, <a href="Enya">Enya</a>, <a href="John%20Tesh">John Tesh</a>, and sci-fi scores. Alan Dang contrarily found the music at times "neutral" and generic; Paul Ward found it pleasant but sparse. Numerous critics praised the voice acting and dialogue. The game's cinematic cutscenes were also acclaimed; "Computer and Video Games" noted they were "superbly used for laughs or to create a real sense of dramatic tension", while "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" wrote that "Anachronox" would be remembered as the germination point for blending interactive gaming and cinema. "The Guardian", while also giving praise, found them somewhat predictable. Several reviewers praised the field map and level design of all but the last levels. Earlier ones were said to contain many "little details that bring the game to life" and significant immersion. The later levels were less well received, with one reviewer suspecting that Ion Storm ran out of time to polish the game, as some end-game locations were "hideously ugly, with huge slab-like polygons, dodgy backdrops and pixelated low resolution textures". "The Guardian" felt the lighting was too dark in general, while Kevin Cheung of "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" found the graphics blocky.

Reviewers hailed the story, characters, setting, and dialogue of "Anachronox", citing its science fiction themes and offbeat, quirky humor. "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">The Advertiser</a>" summarized the plot as "a beefy storyline loaded with strong characters, powerful dialogue, outrageous humour, seemingly endless surprises and a wild ride around the galaxy." Elliott Chin singled out the game's humor, which, while divisive of "Computer Gaming World"s staff at first, won it the publication's "Best Use of Humor" 2001 award. Even apart from humor, the dialogue was acclaimed as "so clever, it almost distracts from the game play" and as "very natural and colloquial". David Gordon of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" enjoyed the game for its "dark and ominous" plot and setting, centered on the quest to stop the destruction of the universe. The setting was compared to "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>", <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a>, "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>", "<a href="Total%20Recall%20%281990%20film%29">Total Recall</a>" and the "<a href="Dark%20City%20%281998%20film%29">Dark City</a>" franchise. Reviewers enjoyed the game's odd characters and how the team of "has-beens and rejects" brought new life to the genre, particularly by averting the coming-of-age <a href="clich%C3%A9">cliché</a>. Sly was well-received, described as a "typical downtrodden B-movie private eye", a "<a href="Mickey%20Spillane">Mickey Spillane</a>-style hero" in a cyberpunk setting, and a "space-age <a href="Sam%20Spade">Sam Spade</a>". Several critics complained about the game's slow start on the planet Anachronox, especially its elevator-riding scenes. Reviewer Elliott Chin disagreed, evoking "a superb sense of timing, starting out small and slowly building to the main event", while David Phelan stated that strong character writing would encourage gamers to play beyond the "pedestrian-paced" opening scenes.

Several critics took issue with the game's graphics and outdated id Tech 2 engine; reviewer Stephen Hunt named the game "a muddy affair" due to the "elderly" engine. Some reviewers, however, felt the game's charm made the engine's age irrelevant. Reviewers also encountered several <a href="software%20bug">software bug</a>s and glitches, among them incompatibility with <a href="Windows%202000">Windows 2000</a> and a bug forcing the player to repeat a sequence near the end several times. However, they differed in their opinions of the game as a result of them, ranging from "nearly unplayable" to "a flawed classic." Reviewers also criticized the game's restricted <a href="display%20resolution">display resolution</a> choices; players could only choose from two options at polar ends of hardware requirements.

Before releasing "Anachronox", Ion Storm retextured characters and adapted sequences from the game for "Shiner", a production by the Undermain Theatre. Scenes from the game were used to illustrate the vivid imagination and struggles of a paralyzed woman named Xela. "Anachronox" references the films "<a href="Miller%27s%20Crossing">Miller's Crossing</a>" and "<a href="Barton%20Fink">Barton Fink</a>" through street addresses on planet Anachronox; Tom Hall had studied acting at the <a href="University%20of%20Wisconsin%E2%80%93Madison">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a> and volunteered as an usher for Undermain. Though received well, the game did not prevent the closure of Ion Storm's Dallas office in July 2001; John Romero and Tom Hall departed after its release. The game became "semi-obscure"; Tom Hall explained: "Millions were spent making it, and upon release, $50,000 advertising it." He reflected on the game in 2007:

Cinematic director Jake Hughes independently combined the game's cut-scenes into a two-and-a-half-hour film titled "Anachronox: The Movie", released as 13 <a href="MPEG">MPEG</a> files on <a href="Machinima.com">Machinima.com</a>. The work was considered <a href="machinima">machinima</a>'s first <a href="feature-length">feature-length</a> production (incorrectly: the longer film "<a href="The%20Seal%20of%20Nehahra">The Seal of Nehahra</a>" predates it) and one of its most ambitious projects. Judges at the <a href="2002%20Machinima%20Film%20Festival">2002 Machinima Film Festival</a> (MFF) awarded it Best Picture, Best Writing, and Best Technical Achievement. Machinima.com's editors said of the film, ""Anachronox: The Movie" is a tour de force, one of the finest Machinima films produced to date, and probably the most accomplished Machinima feature to date. Hell, it managed to hold two overworked jury members in a room for two and a half hours before the MFF 2002—what more can we say?" As of 2003, Machinima.com planned to release the film on DVD with extra footage and artwork.

Tom Hall felt the story of "Anachronox" was too large for one game (requiring an estimated 70 hours of gameplay), and planned for two expansion packs in 1998. Each expansion pack would represent another third of the overall story. He confirmed in 1999 that "Anachronox" would be followed by only one sequel; several art assets had already been created for the sequel by mid-2000. Hall speculated in 2000 that further adventures in two new universes may take place after the sequel. Ion Storm's closure nixed plans for a continuation; Hall has unsuccessfully tried to purchase the intellectual property rights to the "Anachronox" universe. He later stated that he did not regret ending "Anachronox" on a cliffhanger, as most characters had resolved their inner turmoil.

Hall noted in 2007 that other team members were willing to come back to help: "We went through such turmoil but stayed for the love of the universe, the game and each other. Former team members often mention that if I ever got the intellectual property back and was going to make "Anachronox 2", just tell them when and where. We have, as we say, 'The Love. Hall remarked in 2010, "If I don't do the game in the next 10 years, I'll just write up the rest of the story and put it on my website for closure, how about that?".

On February 17, 2015, <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a> announced that it will allow developers to create games based on some of their old Eidos IPs via the Square Enix Collective project, including the "Anachronox" IP.

Jo Stafford

Jo Elizabeth Stafford (November 12, 1917July 16, 2008) was an American <a href="traditional%20pop%20music">traditional pop music</a> singer and occasional actress, whose career spanned five decades from the late 1930s to the early 1980s. Admired for the purity of her voice, she originally underwent classical training to become an <a href="opera">opera</a> singer before following a career in popular music, and by 1955 had achieved more worldwide record sales than any other female artist. Her 1952 song "<a href="You%20Belong%20to%20Me%20%281952%20song%29">You Belong to Me</a>" topped the charts in the United States and United Kingdom, the record becoming the first by a female artist to reach number one on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">U.K. Singles Chart</a>.

Born in <a href="Coalinga%2C%20California">Coalinga, California</a>, Stafford made her first musical appearance at age twelve. While still at high school she joined her two older sisters to form a vocal trio named The Stafford Sisters, who found moderate success on radio and in film. In 1938, while the sisters were part of the cast of <a href="Twentieth%20Century%20Fox">Twentieth Century Fox</a>'s production of "<a href="Alexander%27s%20Ragtime%20Band%20%28film%29">Alexander's Ragtime Band</a>", Stafford met the future members of <a href="The%20Pied%20Pipers">The Pied Pipers</a> and became the group's lead singer. Bandleader <a href="Tommy%20Dorsey">Tommy Dorsey</a> hired them in 1939 to perform back-up vocals for his orchestra.

In addition to her recordings with the Pied Pipers, Stafford featured in solo performances for Dorsey. After leaving the group in 1944, she recorded a series of pop standards for <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a> and <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. Many of her recordings were backed by the orchestra of <a href="Paul%20Weston">Paul Weston</a>. She also performed duets with <a href="Gordon%20MacRae">Gordon MacRae</a> and <a href="Frankie%20Laine">Frankie Laine</a>. Her work with the <a href="United%20Service%20Organizations">United Service Organizations</a> (USO) giving concerts for soldiers during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> earned her the nickname "G.I. Jo". Starting in 1945, Stafford was a regular host of the <a href="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a> (NBC) radio series "<a href="The%20Chesterfield%20Supper%20Club">The Chesterfield Supper Club</a>" and later appeared in television specialsincluding two series called "The Jo Stafford Show", in 1954 in the U.S. and in 1961 in the U.K.

Stafford married twice: first in 1937 to musician John Huddleston (the couple divorced in 1943); then in 1952 to Paul Weston, with whom she had two children. She and Weston developed a comedy routine in which they assumed the identity of an incompetent lounge act named <a href="Jonathan%20and%20Darlene%20Edwards">Jonathan and Darlene Edwards</a>, parodying well-known songs. The act proved popular at parties and among the wider public when the couple released an album as the Edwardses in 1957. In 1961, the album "<a href="Jonathan%20and%20Darlene%20Edwards%20in%20Paris">Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris</a>" won Stafford her only <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a> for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Comedy%20Album">Best Comedy Album</a>, and was the first commercially successful parody album. Stafford largely retired as a performer in the mid-1960s, but continued in the music business. She had a brief resurgence in popularity in the late 1970s when she recorded a cover of the <a href="Bee%20Gees">Bee Gees</a> hit, "<a href="Stayin%27%20Alive">Stayin' Alive</a>" as Darlene Edwards. In the 1990s, she began re-releasing some of her material through <a href="Corinthian%20Records">Corinthian Records</a>, a label founded by Weston. She died in 2008 in <a href="Century%20City%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Century City, Los Angeles</a>, and is interred with Weston at <a href="Holy%20Cross%20Cemetery%2C%20Culver%20City">Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City</a>. Her work in radio, television and music is recognized by three stars on the <a href="List%20of%20stars%20on%20the%20Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>.

Jo Elizabeth Stafford was born in <a href="Coalinga%2C%20California">Coalinga, California</a>, in 1917, to Grover Cleveland Stafford and Anna Stafford (née York)a second cousin of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> hero <a href="Alvin%20C.%20York">Sergeant Alvin York</a>. She was the third of four children. Both her parents enjoyed singing and sharing music with their family. Stafford's father hoped for success in the California oil fields when he moved his family from <a href="Gainesboro%2C%20Tennessee">Gainesboro, Tennessee</a>, but worked in a succession of unrelated jobs. Her mother was an accomplished banjo player, playing and singing many of the folk songs which influenced Stafford's later career. Anna insisted that her children should take <a href="piano%20pedagogy">piano lessons</a>, but Jo was the only one among her sisters who took a keen interest in it, and through this she learned to read music.

Stafford's first public singing appearance was in Long Beach, where the family lived when she was twelve. She sang "Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms", a Stafford family sentimental favorite. Her second was far more dramatic. As a student at <a href="Long%20Beach%20Polytechnic%20High%20School">Long Beach Polytechnic High School</a> with the lead in the school musical, she was rehearsing on stage when the <a href="1933%20Long%20Beach%20earthquake">1933 Long Beach earthquake</a> destroyed part of the school. With her mother's encouragement, Stafford originally planned to become an opera singer and studied voice as a child, taking private lessons from Foster Rucker, an announcer on California radio station <a href="KNX%20%28AM%29">KNX</a>. Because of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, she abandoned that idea and joined her older sisters Christine and Pauline in a <a href="popular%20music">popular</a> vocal group The Stafford Sisters. The two older Staffords were already part of a trio with an unrelated third member when the act got a big booking at Long Beach's West Coast Theater. Pauline was too ill to perform, and Jo was drafted in to take her place so they could keep the engagement. She asked her <a href="glee%20club">glee club</a> teacher for a week's absence from school, saying her mother needed her at home, and this was granted. The performance was a success, and Jo became a permanent member of the group.

The Staffords' first radio appearance was on <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a> station <a href="KHJ%20%28AM%29">KHJ</a> as part of "The Happy Go Lucky Hour" when Jo was 16, a role they secured after hopefuls at the audition were asked if they had their own musical accompanist(s). Christine Stafford said that Jo played piano, and the sisters were hired, even though she had not previously given a public piano performance. The Staffords were subsequently heard on KNX's "The Singing Crockett Family of Kentucky", and "California Melodies", a network radio show aired on the <a href="Mutual%20Broadcasting%20System">Mutual Broadcasting System</a>. While Stafford worked on "The Jack Oakie Show" she met John Huddlestona backing singer on the programmeand they were married in October 1937. The couple divorced in 1943.

The sisters found work in the film industry as backup vocalists, and immediately after graduating from high school, Jo worked on film soundtracks. The Stafford Sisters made their first recording,"Let's Get Together and Swing" with <a href="Louis%20Prima">Louis Prima</a>, in 1936. In 1937, Jo worked behind the scenes with <a href="Fred%20Astaire">Fred Astaire</a> on the soundtrack of "<a href="A%20Damsel%20in%20Distress%20%281937%20film%29">A Damsel in Distress</a>", creating the arrangements for the film, and with her sisters she arranged the backing vocals for "<a href="Nice%20Work%20If%20You%20Can%20Get%20It%20%28song%29">Nice Work If You Can Get It</a>". Stafford said that her arrangement had to be adapted because Astaire had difficulty with some of the <a href="syncopation">syncopation</a>. In her words: "The man with the syncopated shoes couldn't do the syncopated notes".
By 1938, the Staffords were involved with Twentieth Century Fox's production of "Alexander's Ragtime Band". The studio brought in many vocal groups to work on the film, including the Four Esquires, the Rhythm Kings and <a href="the%20King%20Sisters">the King Sisters</a>, who began to sing and socialized between takes. The Stafford Sisters, the Four Esquires and the Rhythm Kings became a new vocal group called the Pied Pipers. Stafford later said, "We started singing together just for fun, and these sessions led to the formation of an eight-voice singing group that we christened 'The Pied Pipers. The group consisted of eight members, including StaffordJohn Huddleston, Hal Hooper, Chuck Lowry, Bud Hervey, George Tait, Woody Newbury, and <a href="Dick%20Whittinghill">Dick Whittinghill</a>.

As the Pied Pipers, they worked on local radio and movie soundtracks. When Alyce and Yvonne King threw a party for their boyfriends' visit to Los Angeles, the group was invited to perform. The King Sisters' boyfriends were Tommy Dorsey's arrangers <a href="Axel%20Stordahl">Axel Stordahl</a> and Paul Weston, who became interested in the group. Weston said the group's vocals were unique for its time and that their vocal arrangements were much like those for orchestral instruments.

Weston persuaded Dorsey to audition the group in 1938, and the eight drove together to New York City. Dorsey liked them and signed them for ten weeks. After their second broadcast, the sponsorvisiting from overseasheard the group sing "Hold Tight (Want Some Seafood Mama)". Until this point, the sponsor knew only that he was paying for Dorsey's program and that its ratings were very good; <a href="transcription%20disc">transcription disc</a>s mailed to him by his advertising agency always arrived broken. He thought that the performance was terrible, and pressured the advertising agency representing his brand to fire the group. They stayed in New York for several months, landing one job that paid them $3.60 each, and they recorded some material for <a href="RCA">RCA Victor Records</a>. Weston later said that he and Stordahl felt responsibility for the group, since Weston had arranged their audition with Dorsey. After six months in New York and with no work there for them, the Pied Pipers returned to Los Angeles, where four of their members left the group to seek regular employment. Shortly afterwards, Stafford received a telephone call from Dorsey, who told her he wished to hire the group, but wanted only four of them, including Stafford. After she agreed to the offer the remaining Pied PipersStafford, Huddleston, Lowry and Wilsontraveled to Chicago in 1939. The decision led to success for the group, especially Stafford, who featured in both collective and solo performances with Dorsey's orchestra.

When <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> joined the Dorsey band, the Pied Pipers provided backing vocals for his recordings. Their version of "<a href="I%27ll%20Never%20Smile%20Again">I'll Never Smile Again</a>" topped the Billboard Chart for twelve weeks in 1940 and helped to establish Sinatra as a singer. Stafford, Sinatra, and the Pied Pipers toured extensively with Dorsey during their three years as part of his orchestra, giving concerts at venues across the United States. Stafford made her first solo recording"Little Man with a Candy Cigar"in 1941, after Dorsey agreed to her request to record solo. Her public debut as a soloist with the band occurred at New York's <a href="Hotel%20Astor%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Hotel Astor</a> in May 1942. Bill Davidson of "<a href="Collier%27s%20Weekly">Collier's</a>" magazine reported in 1951 that because Stafford weighed in excess of 180 lb, Dorsey was reluctant to give her a leading vocal role in his orchestra, believing she was not sufficiently glamorous for the part. However, <a href="Peter%20Levinson">Peter Levinson</a>'s 2005 biography of Dorsey offers a different account. Stafford recalls that she was overweight, but Dorsey didn't try hiding her because of it.

In November 1942, the Pied Pipers had a disagreement with Dorsey when he fired Clark Yocuma guitarist and vocalist who had replaced Billy Wilson in the line upwhen he mistakenly gave the bandleader misdirections at a railroad station in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. The remaining three members then quit in an act of solidarity. At the time the number one song in the United States was "<a href="There%20Are%20Such%20Things">There Are Such Things</a>" by Frank Sinatra and the Pied Pipers. Sinatra also left Dorsey that year. Following their departure from the orchestra, the Pied Pipers played a series of <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> dates in the <a href="Eastern%20United%20States">Eastern United States</a>; when they returned to California, they were signed to appear in the 1943 <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Pictures</a> movie "Gals Incorporated". From there, they joined the NBC Radio show "Bob Crosby and Company". As well as working with <a href="Bob%20Crosby">Bob Crosby</a>, they also appeared on radio shows hosted by Sinatra and <a href="Johnny%20Mercer">Johnny Mercer</a>, and were one of the first groups signed to Mercer's new label, <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a>, which was founded in 1942. Westonwho left Dorsey's band in 1940 to work with <a href="Dinah%20Shore">Dinah Shore</a>became music director at Capitol.

While Stafford was still working for Dorsey, Johnny Mercer told her, "Some day I'm going to have my own record company, and you're going to record for me." She subsequently became the first solo artist signed to Capitol after leaving the Pied Pipers in 1944. A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>. Having previously discovered artists such as <a href="Glenn%20Miller">Glenn Miller</a>, <a href="Artie%20Shaw">Artie Shaw</a>, and <a href="Woody%20Herman">Woody Herman</a>, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was <a href="Demobilization">demobilized</a> in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.

The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's <a href="La%20Martinique">La Martinique</a> nightclub. Her performance was well-receivedan article in the July 1945 edition of "Band Leaders" magazine described it as "sensational"but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>"s Nancy Franklin, "I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audienceit's just not me."

Stafford's tenure with the <a href="United%20Service%20Organizations">United Service Organizations</a> (USO) during World War IIwhich often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.led to her acquiring the nickname "G.I. Jo". On returning from the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific theater</a>, a veteran told Stafford that the Japanese would play her records on loudspeakers in an attempt to make the U.S. troops homesick enough to surrender. She replied personally to all the letters she received from servicemen. Stafford was a favorite of many servicemen during both World War II and the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>; her recordings received extensive airplay on the <a href="American%20Forces%20Network">American Forces radio</a> and in some military hospitals at lights-out. Stafford's involvement with servicemen led to an interest in military history and a sound knowledge of it. Years after World War II, Stafford was a guest at a dinner party with a retired naval officer. When the discussion turned to a wartime action off <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a>, the officer tried to correct Stafford, who held to her point. He countered her by saying, "Madame, I was there". A few days after the party, Stafford received a note of apology from him, saying he had re-read his logs and that she was correct.

Beginning on December 11, 1945, Stafford hosted the Tuesday and Thursday broadcasts of NBC musical variety radio program "The Chesterfield Supper Club". On April 5, 1946, the entire cast, including Stafford and <a href="Perry%20Como">Perry Como</a>, participated in the first commercial radio broadcast from an airplane. The initial plan was to use the stand-held microphones used in studios but when these proved to be problematic, the cast switched to hand-held microphones, which because of the plane's cabin pressure became difficult to hold. Three flights were made that day; a rehearsal in the afternoon, then two in the eveningone for the initial 6:00 pm broadcast and another at 10:00 pm for the West Coast broadcast.

Stafford moved from New York to California in November 1946, continuing to host "Chesterfield Supper Club" from Hollywood. In 1948, she restricted her appearances on the show to Tuesdays, and <a href="Peggy%20Lee">Peggy Lee</a> hosted the Thursday broadcasts. Stafford left the show when it was expanded to 30 minutes, making her final appearance on September 2, 1949. She returned to the program in 1954; it ended its run on NBC Radio the following year. During her time with "Chesterfield Supper Club", Stafford revisited some of the folk music she had enjoyed as a child. Weston, her conductor on the programme, suggested using some of the folk music for the show. With her renewed interest in folk tunes came an interest in folklore; Stafford established a contest to award a prize to the best collection of American folklore submitted by a college student. The annual Jo Stafford Prize for American Folklore was handled by the <a href="American%20Folklore%20Society">American Folklore Society</a>, with the first prize of $250 awarded in 1949.

Stafford continued to record. She duetted with Gordon MacRae on a number of songs. In 1948, their version of "Say Something Sweet to Your Sweetheart" sold over a million copies. The following year, they repeated their success with "My Happiness", and Stafford and MacRae recorded "Whispering Hope" together. Stafford began hosting a weekly program on <a href="Radio%20Luxembourg%20%28English%29">Radio Luxembourg</a> in 1950; working unpaid, she recorded the voice portions of the shows in Hollywood. At the time, she was hosting "<a href="Club%20Fifteen">Club Fifteen</a>" with Bob Crosby for <a href="CBS">Columbia Broadcasting System</a> (CBS) radio.

Weston moved from Capitol to <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> and, in 1950, Stafford followed suit. Content and very comfortable working with him, Stafford had had a clause inserted in her contract with Capitol stating that if Weston left that label, she would automatically be released from her obligations to them. When that happened, Capitol wanted Stafford to record eight more songs before December 15, 1950, and she found herself in the unusual situation of simultaneously working for two competing record companies, an instance that was very rare in an industry where musicians were seen as assets. In 1954, Stafford became the second artist after Bing Crosby to sell 25 million records for Columbia. She was presented with a diamond-studded disc to mark the occasion.

In 1950, Stafford began working for <a href="Voice%20of%20America">Voice of America</a> (VOA), the U.S. government broadcaster transmitting programmes overseas to undermine the influence of <a href="communism">communism</a>. She presented a weekly show that aired in <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>, and "Collier's" magazine published an article about the program in its April 21, 1951 issue that discussed her worldwide popularity, including in countries behind the <a href="Iron%20Curtain">Iron Curtain</a>. The article, titled "Jo Stafford: Her Songs Upset Joe Stalin", earned her the wrath of the U.S. Communist "<a href="Daily%20Worker">Daily Worker</a>" newspaper, which published a column critical of Stafford and VOA.

Although Weston and Stafford had known each other since their introduction at the King Sisters' party, they did not become romantically involved until 1945, when Weston traveled to New York to see Stafford perform at La Martinique. They were married in a <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States">Roman Catholic</a> ceremony on February 26, 1952, before which Stafford converted to Catholicism. The wedding was conducted at St Gregory's Catholic Church in Los Angeles by Father Joe Kearney, a former guitarist with the Bob Crosby band who left the music business, trained as a priest and served as head of the Catholic Labor Institute. The couple left for Europe for a combined honeymoon and business trip: Stafford had an engagement at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a>. Stafford and Weston had two children: Tim was born in 1952, and Amy in 1956. Both children followed their parents into the music industry. Tim Weston became an arranger and producer who took charge of Corinthian Records, his father's music label, and Amy Weston became a <a href="session%20singer">session singer</a>, performing with a trio, "Daddy's Money", and singing in commercials.

In the 1950s, Stafford had a string of popular hits with <a href="Frankie%20Laine">Frankie Laine</a>, six of which charted. Their duet of the <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a> song "<a href="Hey%20Good%20Lookin%27%20%28song%29">Hey Good Lookin'</a>" made the top ten in 1951. She had her best-known hits"<a href="Jambalaya%20%28song%29">Jambalaya</a>", "<a href="Shrimp%20Boats">Shrimp Boats</a>", "<a href="Make%20Love%20to%20Me%20%281954%20song%29">Make Love to Me</a>", and "<a href="You%20Belong%20to%20Me%20%281952%20song%29">You Belong to Me</a>"around this time. "You Belong to Me" was Stafford's biggest hit, topping the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the U.K., it was the first song by a female singer to top the chart. The record first appeared on U.S. charts on August 1, 1952, and remained there for 24 weeks. In the U.K., it entered the charts on November 14, 1952, at number 12, reached number one on January 16, 1953, and stayed on the charts for 19 weeks. In a July 1953 interview, Paul Weston said his wife's big hit was really the "B" side of the single "Pretty Boy", which both Weston and Columbia Records believed would be the big seller.

Stafford hosted the 15-minute "<a href="The%20Jo%20Stafford%20Show%20%281954%20TV%20series%29">The Jo Stafford Show</a>" on <a href="CBS-TV">CBS-TV</a> from 1954 to 1955, with Weston as her conductor and music arranger. She appeared on NBC's "<a href="Club%20Oasis">Club Oasis</a>" in 1958, and on the <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC) series "<a href="The%20Pat%20Boone%20Chevy%20Showroom">The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom</a>" in 1959. In the early 1960s, Stafford hosted a series of television specials called "<a href="The%20Jo%20Stafford%20Show%20%281961%20TV%20series%29">The Jo Stafford Show</a>", which were centered around music. The shows were produced in England and featured British and American guests including <a href="Claire%20Bloom">Claire Bloom</a>, <a href="Stanley%20Holloway">Stanley Holloway</a>, <a href="Ella%20Fitzgerald">Ella Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="Mel%20Torm%C3%A9">Mel Tormé</a>, and <a href="Rosemary%20Clooney">Rosemary Clooney</a>.<ref name="Kloss/Milwaukee Journal"></ref>

Both Stafford and Weston returned to Capitol in 1961. During her second stint at Capitol, Stafford also recorded for Sinatra's label <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a>. The albums issued by Reprise were released between 1961 and 1964, and were mostly remakes of songs from her past. Sinatra sold Reprise to <a href="Warner%20Brothers">Warner Brothers</a> in 1963, and they retargeted the label at a teenage audience, letting go many of the original artists who had signed up with Sinatra. In late 1965, both Stafford and Weston signed to <a href="Dot%20Records">Dot Records</a>.
During the 1940s, Stafford briefly performed comedy songs under the name "Cinderella G. Stump" with <a href="Red%20Ingle">Red Ingle</a> and the Natural Seven. In 1947, she recorded a hillbilly-style parody of "<a href="Temptation%20%281933%20song%29">Temptation</a>", pronouncing its title "Tim-tayshun". Stafford created Stump after Weston suggested her for the role when Ingle said his female vocalist was unavailable for the recording session. After meeting Ingle at a recording studio she gave an impromptu performance. The speed of her voice was intentionally increased for the song, giving it the hillbilly sound, and the listening public did not initially know that her voice was on the record. Because it was a lighthearted, impromptu performance and she accepted the standard scale pay, Stafford waived all royalties from the record. Stafford, along with Ingle and Weston, made a personal appearance tour in 1949, and she performed "Temptation" as Cinderella G. Stump. Stafford and Ingle performed the song on network television in 1960 for "<a href="Startime%20%28TV%20series%29">Startime</a>". Stafford recorded a second song with Ingle in 1948. "The Prisoner of Love's Song" was a parody of "<a href="Prisoner%20of%20Love%20%281931%20song%29">Prisoner of Love</a>", and featured in an advertisement for Capitol releases in the January 8, 1949 edition of "Billboard" magazine.

Throughout the 1950s, Stafford and Weston entertained party guests by performing skits in which they impersonated a poor lounge act. Stafford sang off-key in a high pitched voice and Weston played songs on the piano in unconventional rhythms. Weston began his impression of an unskilled pianist in or around 1955, assuming the guise "when things got a little quiet, or when people began taking themselves too seriously at a Hollywood party." He put on an impromptu performance of the act the following year at a Columbia Records sales convention in <a href="Key%20West%2C%20Florida">Key West, Florida</a>, after hearing a particularly bad hotel pianist. The audience was very appreciative of his rendition of "<a href="Stardust%20%28song%29">Stardust</a>", particularly Columbia executives <a href="George%20Avakian">George Avakian</a> and <a href="Irving%20Townsend">Irving Townsend</a>, who encouraged Weston to make an album of such songs. Avakian named Weston's character Jonathan Edwards, for the <a href="Jonathan%20Edwards%20%28theologian%29">18th century Calvinist preacher of the same name</a>, and asked him to record under this alias. Weston worried that he might not be able to find enough material for an entire album, and he asked his wife to join the project. Stafford named her off-key vocalist persona Darlene Edwards.

Stafford's creation of Darlene Edwards had its roots in the novelty songs that <a href="Mitch%20Miller">Mitch Miller</a>, the head of Columbia's <a href="artists%20and%20repertoire">artists and repertoire</a> department, had been selecting for her to sing. These included songs such as "Underneath the Overpass", and because she did not agree with Miller's music choices for her, Stafford and her studio musicians often recorded their own renditions of the music, performing the songs according to their feelings about them. Because she had some unused studio time at a 1957 recording session, as a joke Stafford recorded a track as Darlene Edwards. Those who heard <a href="bootleg%20recording">bootlegs</a> of the recording responded positively, and later that year, Stafford and Weston recorded an album of songs as Jonathan and Darlene, entitled "<a href="The%20Piano%20Artistry%20of%20Jonathan%20Edwards">The Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards</a>".

As a publicity stunt, Weston and Stafford claimed that Jonathan and Darlene Edwards were a New Jersey lounge act which they had discovered, and denied any personal connection. This ruse led to much speculation about the Edwardses' identities. In an article titled "Two Right Hands" in September 1957, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine reported that some people believed the performers were <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Truman">Margaret Truman</a>, but the same piece identified Weston and Stafford as the Edwardses. In 1958, Stafford and Weston appeared as the Edwardses on <a href="Jack%20Benny">Jack Benny</a>'s television program "<a href="Shower%20of%20Stars">Shower of Stars</a>", and in 1960 on "<a href="The%20Garry%20Moore%20Show">The Garry Moore Show</a>". "The Piano Artistry of Jonathan Edwards" was followed up with an album of popular music standards, "Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris", which was released in 1960 and won that year's Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. The <a href="National%20Academy%20of%20Recording%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy</a> issued two awards for the category that year; <a href="Bob%20Newhart">Bob Newhart</a> also received an award for "Spoken Word Comedy" for his album "The Button-Down Mind Strikes Back!" The Grammy was Stafford's only major award.

The couple continued to release comedy albums for several years, and in 1977 released a cover of the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive" as a single, with an Edwards interpretation of <a href="Helen%20Reddy">Helen Reddy</a>'s "<a href="I%20Am%20Woman">I Am Woman</a>" as its "B" side. The same year also saw a brief resurgence in the popularity of Jonathan and Darlene albums when their cover of "<a href="Carioca%20%28dance%29">Carioca</a>" was featured as the opening and closing theme to "<a href="The%20Kentucky%20Fried%20Movie">The Kentucky Fried Movie</a>". Their last release, "<a href="Darlene%20Remembers%20Duke%2C%20Jonathan%20Plays%20Fats">Darlene Remembers Duke, Jonathan Plays Fats</a>", was issued in 1982. To mark the occasion, an interview with Stafford and Westonin which they assumed the persona of the Edwardsesappeared in the December 1982 edition of "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20%28magazine%29">Los Angeles Magazine</a>".

In 1959, Stafford was offered a contract to perform at <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Strip">Las Vegas</a>, but declined it to concentrate on her family life. Because she disliked continuously traveling for television appearances that took her away from her children, and no longer found the music business fun, she went into semi-retirement in the mid-1960s. She retired fully in 1975. Except for the Jonathan and Darlene Edwards material, and re-recording her favorite song "Whispering Hope" with her daughter Amy in 1978, Stafford did not perform again until 1990, at a ceremony honoring Frank Sinatra. The Westons devoted more time to Share Inc.a charity aiding people with developmental disabilitiesin which they had been active for many years. In or around 1983, <a href="Concord%20Records">Concord Records</a> tried to persuade Stafford to change her mind and come out of retirement, but although an album was planned, she did not feel she would be satisfied with the finished product, and the project was shelved.

Stafford won a breach-of-contract lawsuit against her former record label Columbia in the early 1990s. Because of a clause concerning the payment of royalties in her contract, she secured the rights to all of the recordings she made with the company, including those Weston and she made as Jonathan and Darlene Edwards. After the lawsuit was settled, Stafford and her son Tim reactivated Corinthian Records, which Westona devout Christianhad started as a label for religious music in the 1970s, and they began releasing some of her old material.

In 1996, Paul Weston died of natural causes; Stafford continued to operate Corinthian Records. In 2006, she donated the couple's libraryincluding music arrangements, photographs, business correspondence and recordingsto the University of Arizona. Stafford began suffering from congestive heart failure in October 2007, from which she died aged 90 on July 16, 2008. She was buried with her husband at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California.

Stafford was admired by critics and the listening public for the purity of her voice, and was considered one of the most versatile vocalists of her era. Peter Levinson said that she was a <a href="coloratura%20soprano">coloratura soprano</a>, whose operatic training allowed her to sing a natural <a href="falsetto">falsetto</a>. Her style encompassed a number of genres, including big band, ballads, jazz, folk and comedy. The music critic <a href="Terry%20Teachout">Terry Teachout</a> described her as "rhythmically fluid without ever sounding self-consciously 'jazzy' ", while Rosemary Clooney said of her, "The voice says it all: beautiful, pure, straightforward, no artifice, matchless intonation, instantly recognizable. Those things describe the woman too." Writing for the "<a href="New%20York%20Sun">New York Sun</a>", <a href="Will%20Friedwald">Will Friedwald</a> described her 1947 interpretation of "Haunted Heart" as "effective because it's so subtle, because Stafford holds something back and doesn't shove her emotion in the listener's face." Nancy Franklin described Stafford's version of the folk song "He's Gone Away" as "wistful and tender, as if she had picked up a piece of clothing once worn by a loved one and begun singing." Frank Sinatra said, "It was a joy to sit on the bandstand and listen to her". The singer <a href="Judy%20Collins">Judy Collins</a> has cited Stafford's folk recordings as an influence on her own musical career. The country singer <a href="Patsy%20Cline">Patsy Cline</a> was also inspired by Stafford's work.

In their guise of Jonathan and Darlene Edwards, Weston and Stafford earned admiration from their show business peers. The pianist <a href="George%20Shearing">George Shearing</a> was a fan and would play "<a href="Autumn%20in%20New%20York%20%28song%29">Autumn in New York</a>" in the style of Edwards if he knew the couple were in the audience. <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a> also enjoyed their performance. <a href="Art%20Carney">Art Carney</a>who played Ed Norton in the comedy series "<a href="The%20Honeymooners">The Honeymooners</a>"once wrote the Edwardses a fan letter as Norton. However, not everybody appreciated the Edwards act. Mitch Miller blamed the couple's 1962 album "Sing Along With Jonathan and Darlene Edwards" for ending his sing-along albums and television show, while in 2003, Stafford told <a href="Michael%20Feinstein">Michael Feinstein</a> that the Bee Gees had disliked the Edwards' version of "Stayin' Alive".

In 1960, Stafford said there were good and bad points to working closely with Weston. His knowledge of her made it easy for him to arrange her music, but sometimes it caused difficulties. Weston knew Stafford's abilities and would write or arrange elaborate music because he knew she was capable of performing it. She also said she did not believe she could perform in Broadway musicals because she thought her voice was not powerful enough for stage work. In 2003, she recalled that there was often limited rehearsal time before she recorded a song, and how Weston would sometimes slip musical arrangements under the bathroom door as she was in the bath getting ready to go to the studio.

Her work in radio, television and music is recognized by three stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 1952, listeners of Radio Luxembourg voted Stafford their favorite female singer. The New York Fashion Academy named her one of the Best Dressed Women of 1955. "Songbirds" magazine has reported that, by 1955, Stafford had amassed more worldwide record sales than any other female artist, and that she was ranked fifth overall. She was nominated in the Best Female Singer category at the <a href="7th%20Primetime%20Emmy%20Awards">1955 Emmy Awards</a>. She won a Grammy for "Jonathan and Darlene Edwards in Paris", and The Pied Pipers' recording of "I'll Never Smile Again" was inducted into the <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Award">Grammy Hall of Fame</a> in 1982, as was Stafford's version of "You Belong to Me" in 1998. She was inducted into the Big Band Academy of America's Golden Bandstand in April 2007. Stafford and Weston were founding members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.

Stafford's music has been referenced in popular culture. Her recording of "<a href="Blues%20in%20the%20Night">Blues in the Night</a>" features in a scene of <a href="James%20A.%20Michener">James Michener</a>'s novel "<a href="The%20Drifters%20%28novel%29">The Drifters</a>" (1971), while a <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine Corps</a> Sergeant Major in <a href="Walter%20F.%20Murphy">Walter Murphy</a>'s "<a href="The%20Vicar%20of%20Christ%20%28novel%29">The Vicar of Christ</a>" (1979) hears a radio broadcast of her singing "<a href="On%20Top%20of%20Old%20Smoky">On Top of Old Smoky</a>" shortly before a battle in Korea. Commenting on the latter reference for his 1989 book "Singers and the Song"which includes a chapter about Staffordthe author <a href="Gene%20Lees">Gene Lees</a> says it "somehow sets Stafford's place in the American culture. You're getting pretty famous when your name turns up in crossword puzzles; you are woven into a nation's history when you turn up in its fiction."

Stafford was a Democrat, supporting John F. Kennedy for president in 1960. She later performed for President Kennedy at a dinner in his honor given by the Southern California Democratic Committee.

Stafford appeared in films from the 1930s onwards, including "Alexander's Ragtime Band". Her final on-screen appearance was in the Frank Sinatra tribute "Sinatra 75: The Best Is Yet to Come" in 1990. She declined several offers of television work because she was forced to memorize scripts (as she was unable to read the cue cards without her glasses), and the bright studio lights caused her discomfort.

Preity Zinta

Preity Zinta (pronounced ; born 31 January 1975) is an Indian film actress and entrepreneur. She has appeared in <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> films of <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a>, as well as <a href="Telugu%20cinema">Telugu</a>, <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi</a>, and English language films. After graduating with degrees in <a href="English%20literature">English honours</a> and <a href="criminal%20psychology">criminal psychology</a>, Zinta made her acting debut in "<a href="Dil%20Se..">Dil Se..</a>" in 1998, followed by a role in "<a href="Soldier%20%281998%20Indian%20film%29">Soldier</a>" in the same year. These performances earned her a <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Debut">Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut</a>, and she was later recognised for her role as a teenaged single mother in "<a href="Kya%20Kehna">Kya Kehna</a>" (2000). She subsequently established a career with a variety of character types; her film roles along with her screen persona have been credited with contributing to a change in the concept of a <a href="Hindi%20film">Hindi film</a> heroine, and won her <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Preity%20Zinta">several accolades</a>.

Zinta received the <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Preity%20Zinta%23Filmfare_Awards">Filmfare Award for Best Actress</a> in 2003 for her performance in the drama "<a href="Kal%20Ho%20Naa%20Ho">Kal Ho Naa Ho</a>". She went on to play the lead female role in two consecutive annual top-grossing films in India, the science fiction film "<a href="Koi...%20Mil%20Gaya">Koi... Mil Gaya</a>" (2003), which is her biggest commercial success, and the <a href="star-crossed">star-crossed</a> romance "<a href="Veer-Zaara">Veer-Zaara</a>" (2004), which earned her critical acclaim. She was later noted for her portrayal of independent, modern Indian women in "<a href="Salaam%20Namaste">Salaam Namaste</a>" (2005) and "<a href="Kabhi%20Alvida%20Naa%20Kehna">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>" (2006), top-grossing productions in overseas markets. These accomplishments have established her as a leading actress of Hindi cinema. Her first international film role was in the Canadian film "<a href="Heaven%20on%20Earth%20%282008%20film%29">Heaven on Earth</a>", for which she was awarded the <a href="Silver%20Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress</a> at the 2008 <a href="Chicago%20International%20Film%20Festival">Chicago International Film Festival</a>.

In addition to acting, Zinta has written a series of columns for <a href="BBC%20News%20Online">BBC News Online</a> South Asia, she is a social activist, a television presenter, and a regular stage performer. She is the founder of the production company <a href="PZNZ%20Media">PZNZ Media</a>, a co-owner of the <a href="Indian%20Premier%20League">Indian Premier League</a> cricket team <a href="Kings%20XI%20Punjab">Kings XI Punjab</a> since 2008, and the owner of the South-African <a href="T20%20Global%20League">T20 Global League</a> cricket team <a href="Stellenbosch%20Kings">Stellenbosch Kings</a> since 2017. These commitments resulted in several years of hiatus from film work, with the sole exception of her self-produced comeback film, "<a href="Ishkq%20in%20Paris">Ishkq in Paris</a>" (2013), which failed to leave a mark. Zinta is known in the Indian media for publicly speaking her mind, and consequently has sparked the occasional controversy. These controversies include her being the only witness not to retract in court her earlier statements against the <a href="Organised%20crime%20in%20India">Indian mafia</a> during the 2003 <a href="Bharat%20Shah">Bharat Shah</a> case, for which she was awarded the <a href="Godfrey%20Phillips%20National%20Bravery%20Awards">Godfrey Phillips National Bravery Award</a>.

Preity Zinta was born on 31 January 1975 into a Hindu Rajput family from <a href="Rohru">Rohru</a> in <a href="Shimla%20district">Shimla district</a>, Himachal Pradesh. Her father, Durganand Zinta, was an officer in the <a href="Indian%20Army">Indian Army</a>. He died in a car accident when she was 13 years old; the accident also involved her mother, Nilprabha, who was severely injured and consequently remained bedridden for two years. Zinta called the tragic accident and her father's death a significant turning point in her life, which forced her to mature rapidly. She has two brothers; Deepankar and Manish, a year older and a year younger respectively. Deepankar is a commissioned officer in the Indian Army, while Manish lives in California.

Zinta, who describes herself as having been a <a href="tomboy">tomboy</a> as a child, has emphasised her father's military background as having given her a lasting impression on how family life was to be conducted. He asserted the importance of discipline and punctuality to the children. She studied at the <a href="Convent%20of%20Jesus%20and%20Mary">Convent of Jesus and Mary</a> boarding school in Shimla. Although she confesses to loneliness in the boarding school, she noted that it was compensated by her finding a "... perfect set of friends" there. As a student, she developed a love for literature, particularly the works of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a> and poetry. According to Zinta, she enjoyed schoolwork and received good grades; in her free time she played sports, especially basketball.

Upon graduating from the boarding school in <a href="Sanawar">Sanawar</a> (<a href="The%20Lawrence%20School%2C%20Sanawar">The Lawrence School</a>) at age 18, Zinta enrolled at <a href="St.%20Bede%27s%20College%2C%20Shimla">St. Bede's College</a> in Shimla. She graduated from college with an <a href="English%20literature">English honours</a> degree, and then started a graduate programme in psychology. She earned a postgraduate degree in <a href="criminal%20psychology">criminal psychology</a>, but later took up modelling. Zinta's first television commercial was for "Perk chocolates", the result of a chance meeting with a director at a friend's birthday party in 1996. The director persuaded Zinta to audition for the spot, and she was selected. Afterwards, she appeared in other catalogues and commercials, including one for the soap <a href="Liril">Liril</a>.

In 1997, Zinta met <a href="Shekhar%20Kapur">Shekhar Kapur</a> when she accompanied a friend to an audition, and was asked if she would audition too. Upon seeing her audition, Kapur insisted that she become an actress. She was originally scheduled to make her screen debut in Kapur's "Tara Rum Pum Pum" opposite <a href="Hrithik%20Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a>, but the filming was cancelled. Kapur later recommended her for director <a href="Mani%20Ratnam">Mani Ratnam</a>'s "<a href="Dil%20Se..">Dil Se..</a>". Zinta often recalls that when she joined the film industry, her friends teased her that she would typically "wear white saris and dance in the rain", thereby motivating her to play different parts.

Zinta commenced shooting for <a href="Kundan%20Shah">Kundan Shah</a>'s "<a href="Kya%20Kehna">Kya Kehna</a>", whose release was delayed until 2000. The delay of another film, "<a href="Soldier%20%281998%20Indian%20film%29">Soldier</a>", meant that her first release was "<a href="Dil%20Se..">Dil Se..</a>" (1998) opposite <a href="Shahrukh%20Khan">Shahrukh Khan</a> and <a href="Manisha%20Koirala">Manisha Koirala</a>. She was introduced as Preeti Nair, a middle-class Delhi girl and Khan's fiancée. The film was considered an unusual launch for a newcomer, as her role called for only 20 minutes of screen time. However, she was eventually noticed for her role, particularly for the forthright character she played. Her scene with Khan, in which she asked him, "Are you a <a href="Virginity">virgin</a>?", became well-known, and her portrayal earned her a nomination for the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress</a>. She played her first leading role in the action-drama "Soldier" (1998), a commercial hit of the year. She won the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Debut">Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut</a> for her performance in both "Dil Se.." and "Soldier".

Zinta next acted in two <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> films, "<a href="Premante%20Idera">Premante Idera</a>" (1998), opposite <a href="Daggubati%20Venkatesh">Venkatesh</a>; and "<a href="Raja%20Kumarudu">Raja Kumarudu</a>" (1999), opposite <a href="Mahesh%20Babu">Mahesh Babu</a>. She followed with the leading role alongside <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a> in "<a href="Sangharsh%20%281999%20film%29">Sangharsh</a>", a thriller directed by <a href="Tanuja%20Chandra">Tanuja Chandra</a> and written by <a href="Mahesh%20Bhatt">Mahesh Bhatt</a>. Zinta portrayed the character of Reet Oberoi, a <a href="Central%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">CBI</a> officer who falls in love with a captured killer played by Kumar. Having been impressed with Zinta's work in "Dil Se", Chandra approached her for the part after several leading actresses had refused the offer, which Zinta viewed as an opportunity to expand her range. "Sangharsh" was not a box office success, although Zinta's performance received favourable comments by critics. An article published by "<a href="The%20Tribune%20%28Chandigarh%29">The Tribune</a>" upon the film's release described her performance as "an amazing act" in an "intense film", documenting her career path thus far with the observation, "She wowed the audiences with her cameo in "Dil Se", then she zapped the viewers with her sensuality in "Soldier" and now Preity Zinta is all set to shock everybody with her stark performance [in "Sangharsh"]."

Zinta's first role in 2000 was in the drama "<a href="Kya%20Kehna">Kya Kehna</a>", which unexpectedly became a box office success. The film addressed themes of <a href="single%20parent">single parent</a>hood and <a href="teenage%20pregnancy">teenage pregnancy</a>, and gained Zinta wider recognition from the public as well as film critics. Her portrayal of Priya Bakshi, a teenage <a href="single%20mother">single mother</a> who fights social prejudice, earned her several award nominations, including her first nomination for <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> at the <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>. <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> from "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" reported that Zinta belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors that breaks away from character stereotypes.

Later that year, Zinta starred in <a href="Vidhu%20Vinod%20Chopra">Vidhu Vinod Chopra</a>'s drama "<a href="Mission%20Kashmir">Mission Kashmir</a>" alongside <a href="Sanjay%20Dutt">Sanjay Dutt</a> and Hrithik Roshan. Set in the valley of <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> during the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20wars%20and%20conflicts">Indo-Pakistani conflicts</a>, the film dealt with the topic of terrorism and crime. Zinta's role was that of Sufiya Parvez, a TV reporter and Roshan's childhood love. A review in "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" said about her performance, "Preity Zinta is her usual cherubic self and lends colour to the otherwise serious proceedings". It was an economic success, becoming the third-highest-grossing film of the year in India.
In 2001, Zinta earned positive reviews for her role in <a href="Farhan%20Akhtar">Farhan Akhtar</a>'s <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20%28India%29">National Film Award</a>-winning "<a href="Dil%20Chahta%20Hai">Dil Chahta Hai</a>". Depicting the contemporary routine life of Indian affluent youth, it is set in modern-day urban Mumbai and focuses on a major period of transition in the lives of three young friends (<a href="Aamir%20Khan">Aamir Khan</a>, <a href="Saif%20Ali%20Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a> and <a href="Akshaye%20Khanna">Akshaye Khanna</a>). Zinta starred as Aamir Khan's love interest, Shalini. "Dil Chahta Hai" was popular with critics, some of whom noted it broke new ground by introducing a realistic portrayal of Indian youth. The film was a moderate box office success in India; it performed well in the big cities but failed in the rural areas, which was attributed by critics to the urban-oriented lifestyle it presented. <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> wrote of Zinta that she "... is beautiful and vibrant, wavering between endearingly naive and confused".

Three more 2001 releases featured Zinta, including <a href="Abbas-Mustan">Abbas-Mustan</a>'s romantic drama "<a href="Chori%20Chori%20Chupke%20Chupke">Chori Chori Chupke Chupke</a>", which was released after a one-year delay due to <a href="%23Personal%20life">the trial of producer Bharat Shah</a>. This film was one of the first Bollywood films to address the controversial issue of <a href="Surrogate%20mother">surrogate childbirth</a>. Zinta played the role of Madhubala, a <a href="Hooker%20with%20a%20heart%20of%20gold">golden-hearted prostitute</a> hired as a surrogate mother. Initially reluctant to play the part, she eventually accepted it at the directors' persuasion and, to prepare for it, visited several bars and nightclubs at Mumbai's <a href="Red-light%20district">red-light areas</a> to study the lingo and mannerisms of sex-workers. She received a second Best Supporting Actress nomination at the Filmfare Awards for her performance, of which reviewer Sukanya Verma wrote, "Preity Zinta, who clearly has the meatiest part of all, makes the best of it. Her transformation from the cocky and unabashed prostitute to a sensitive and warm person is amazingly believable."

In 2002, Zinta collaborated once again with director <a href="Kundan%20Shah">Kundan Shah</a>, as the protagonist in the family drama "<a href="Dil%20Hai%20Tumhaara">Dil Hai Tumhaara</a>", alongside <a href="Rekha">Rekha</a>, <a href="Mahima%20Chaudhry">Mahima Chaudhry</a> and <a href="Arjun%20Rampal">Arjun Rampal</a>. She played Shalu, an adopted daughter craving love, a role she identified with due to its rebellious nature. Billed as a star vehicle for Zinta, "Dil Hai Tumhaara" did not succeed financially, but her portrayal was uniformly acclaimed by critics, with those critical of the film marking her presence as its main highlight. <a href="Taran%20Adarsh">Taran Adarsh</a> from <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> noted, "... Preity Zinta, in an author-backed role ... steals the show with a sterling performance. Her scenes with Rekha (second half) and <a href="Alok%20Nath">Alok Nath</a> (pre-climax) are simply outstanding. Here's a performance that is sure to win accolades from the junta and critics whole-heartedly."

Zinta was the female lead in India's three highest-grossing films of 2003: "", "<a href="Koi...%20Mil%20Gaya">Koi... Mil Gaya</a>" and "<a href="Kal%20Ho%20Naa%20Ho">Kal Ho Naa Ho</a>". "The Hero", co-starring <a href="Sunny%20Deol">Sunny Deol</a> and <a href="Priyanka%20Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a>, is a patriotic drama about a spy network involving terrorists and an Indian army officer. Zinta played the part of Reshma, a villager who falls in love with the officer and becomes part of this network. The film, involving stunts never seen before in the cinematic history of Bollywood, became the most expensive Hindi film ever produced at the time. Despite being the third highest-grossing film of that year, it failed to recover its production costs at the box office. She next starred in <a href="Honey%20Irani">Honey Irani</a>'s directorial debut, "<a href="Armaan%20%282003%20film%29">Armaan</a>", alongside <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a> and <a href="Anil%20Kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a>. This drama is set in a hospital and follows the travails of its personnel and its principal, Dr. Akash, who struggles arduously to sustain the institution financially. Zinta played Akash's <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenic</a> wife Sonia Kapoor, a role written specially for her and which she liked because it let her "give vent to all [her] frustrations". The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Zinta was particularly praised. <a href="Khalid%20Mohamed">Khalid Mohamed</a> called her a "peppy scene-stealer, achieving her manic mood swings dexterously." For her performance, she received nominations for Best Performance in a Negative Role at different award ceremonies, including Filmfare.

<a href="Rakesh%20Roshan">Rakesh Roshan</a>'s science-fiction film "Koi... Mil Gaya", about a <a href="Developmental%20disability">developmentally disabled</a> young man (played by Hrithik Roshan) coming in contact with an alien, followed. Zinta played the role of Nisha, a young woman whom Roshan befriends and later falls in love with. She received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare for the role. The film was a financial and critical success and became the most popular film of the year, as well as Zinta's highest-grossing film, with a domestic total of . It won the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Movie">Filmfare Award for Best Movie</a>, among others, and went on to spawn two superhero films as sequels—"<a href="Krrish">Krrish</a>" and "<a href="Krrish%203">Krrish 3</a>"—making it the first of the "<a href="Krrish%20%28franchise%29">Krrish</a>" film series, to which Zinta did not proceed.

Zinta's final release of 2003 was "Kal Ho Naa Ho", a tear-jerking romantic drama set in New York City. It was directed by <a href="Nikhil%20Advani">Nikhil Advani</a> and written by <a href="Karan%20Johar">Karan Johar</a>, co-starring <a href="Jaya%20Bachchan">Jaya Bachchan</a>, Shahrukh Khan and Saif Ali Khan. The film was received favourably by critics and became India's second-biggest hit of the year after "Koi... Mil Gaya". It also did well internationally and became India's top-grossing film of the year overseas, earning over worldwide. Zinta played the role of Naina Catherine Kapur, an insecure and angry young <a href="Indian-American">Indian-American</a> woman who falls in love with a man who has a fatal <a href="heart%20disease">heart disease</a>. She won several awards for her performance, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Writing for "<a href="Stardust%20%28magazine%29">Stardust</a>", critic <a href="Ram%20Kamal%20Mukherjee">Ram Kamal Mukherjee</a> asserted that the movie rested "wholly and solely" on Zinta's "astounding performance", further noting her for having "skillfully handled the hues of the complex character." <a href="Derek%20Elley">Derek Elley</a> of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" wrote, "Zinta, who's been carving a growing following the past three years or so, has never been better, definitively moving from juve roles to a charismatic young woman with her sexy, assured Naina."

In 2004 she starred as TV journalist Romila Dutta in Farhan Akhtar's war drama "<a href="Lakshya%20%28film%29">Lakshya</a>", alongside Hrithik Roshan. The film was based on the historical events of the 1999 <a href="Kargil%20War">Kargil War</a>; Zinta's character was modelled after TV journalist <a href="Barkha%20Dutt">Barkha Dutt</a>, the only female reporter who covered the conflict. The film was a critical success, yet her performance received mixed reviews; <a href="Namrata%20Joshi">Namrata Joshi</a> of "<a href="Outlook%20%28magazine%29">Outlook</a>" likened her to "a teenybopper trying to do a TV newsreading skit for her college fest" and Rediff.com concluded, "Zinta has quite a good role and a good deal of footage in the film, and she does a fairly decent job of it without ever being spectacular." Later that year, <a href="Yash%20Chopra">Yash Chopra</a> cast her opposite Shahrukh Khan as the female lead in the love saga "<a href="Veer-Zaara">Veer-Zaara</a>", the top-grossing Hindi film of that year both in India and abroad, with revenues of over worldwide. The film, which relates the love story of an Indian officer, Veer Pratap Singh, and a Pakistani woman, Zaara Haayat Khan, had a strong international release, including a screening at the <a href="Berlin%20Film%20Festival">Berlin Film Festival</a>, and won several Best Movie awards at major Indian award functions. For her portrayal of Zaara, a role which required her to master the fine nuances of the Urdu language, Zinta received her fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. "Variety" hailed her as "the most interesting young actress of her generation," writing that she "is her usual lively self as the willful Zaara." "Veer-Zaara" was Zinta's second highest-grossing film and third major success in two consecutive years. It marked the beginning of her work with <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a>, one of the largest production houses in Bollywood.

In 2005, Zinta appeared in two films. Her first release was the folk comedy "<a href="Khullam%20Khulla%20Pyaar%20Karen">Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen</a>", co-starring <a href="Govinda%20%28actor%29">Govinda</a>, a production that had been delayed since 2002. The film garnered negative reviews and poor box office returns. Zinta's role was small, and was not well received. She next starred opposite Saif Ali Khan in <a href="Siddharth%20Anand">Siddharth Anand</a>'s comedy-drama "<a href="Salaam%20Namaste">Salaam Namaste</a>". Produced by Yash Raj Films, it was the first Indian feature to be filmed entirely in Australia and went on to become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production outside of India, earning internationally. The film tells the story of a contemporary <a href="cohabitation">cohabiting</a> Indian couple and their subsequent struggle with an unexpected pregnancy. Zinta played the female protagonist Ambar Malhotra, a single modern young woman who leaves India to make her own life in Melbourne. "Salaam Namaste" received mostly positive reviews, and Zinta's performance earned her nominations for Best Actress at a number of award ceremonies. Taran Adarsh referred to her as "terrific" and argued that she gave "her most accomplished performance to date". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" noted, "She is cheerleader-homecoming queen-fraternity sweetheart pretty, so even when her characters are being unkind it's hard not to like her."

Zinta received further success in 2006, starring in Karan Johar's drama "<a href="Kabhi%20Alvida%20Naa%20Kehna">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>" with an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Shahrukh Khan, <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a>, <a href="Rani%20Mukerji">Rani Mukerji</a> and <a href="Kirron%20Kher">Kirron Kher</a>. The film became one of the biggest box office hits in India, earning , and grossed over abroad, the biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>" concurred that this was successful: "The lady has not just looked glamorous but she has walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness. Who would have thought that the bubbly girl could so skilfully shed her age-old tag and walk away as the don't-mess-with-me lass. So, all those who are in search of the peppy Preity, well, guys you've dialed the wrong number this time."

Zinta's next release of 2006 was <a href="Shirish%20Kunder">Shirish Kunder</a>'s romantic musical "<a href="Jaan-E-Mann">Jaan-E-Mann</a>", a story set in the United States about two men, played by <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a> and Akshay Kumar, who love the same woman. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and its eventual box office profit was poor. Zinta played the role of Piya, the cynosure of two men. She was mostly criticised for taking a role of minimal importance, though her performance was generally well received. Raja Sen labelled her role an "ornament throughout," but further stated that she "comes vividly alive in the film's last scene, a moment that makes you lament why filmmakers today don't let the babyfaced actress have more fun instead of forcing her to sob copiously. She doesn't have much to do in "Jaan-E-Mann", but looks appropriately attractive." Zinta said that the film was a great relief after the more emotionally intense "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna", as "Jaan-E-Mann" was "easy, happy and much more simple".

In 2007, Zinta portrayed a <a href="British%20Pakistanis">British Pakistani</a> woman, Alvira Khan, in her third project with Yash Raj Films, <a href="Shaad%20Ali">Shaad Ali</a>'s comedy "<a href="Jhoom%20Barabar%20Jhoom">Jhoom Barabar Jhoom</a>", alongside Abhishek Bachchan, <a href="Bobby%20Deol">Bobby Deol</a> and <a href="Lara%20Dutta">Lara Dutta</a>. The film was a critical and commercial failure in India, and several critics panned her performance; "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" described her as "too plastic" and Rediff.com concluded, "From accent to emotion, Preity is plain and simple insufferable in this film."

Following the failure of two of her commercial releases, Zinta began working with <a href="art%20film">art film</a> directors, and turned towards neo-realistic films, known in India as <a href="Parallel%20Cinema">Parallel Cinema</a>. She acted in her first English film, <a href="Rituparno%20Ghosh">Rituparno Ghosh</a>'s "<a href="The%20Last%20Lear">The Last Lear</a>", as a struggling film actress opposite Amitabh Bachchan. The film premiered at the <a href="2007%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2007 Toronto International Film Festival</a>, and was received well. Later reviews in India were approving, with <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> writing, "Preity Zinta gets through her scenes competently, never allowing her cute-as-a-button image to take away from the impact she makes here as a conflicted, mature woman." Initially dismissive of art films, Zinta eventually spoke of her first venture into the genre, confessing, "I did think with art films that they don't pay you, they don't feed you, but I was wrong, and I'm so happy to be here."

Zinta next starred in Samir Karnik's "<a href="Heroes%20%282008%20film%29">Heroes</a>" (2008), a <a href="road%20movie">road movie</a> about two final-year film students who, as a part of their assignment, travel a thousand miles across North India to deliver three un-posted letters written by army personnel who lost their lives during the 1999 Kargil war to their families. The story unfolds the journey of these students in three chapters and follows how they meet and are inspired by the families of the soldiers. Zinta is featured in the first chapter as Salman Khan's war widow, Kuljeet Kaur, a woman who becomes the sole breadwinner of the family and single-handedly raises her son. In preparation for the role, Zinta attended <a href="Anupam%20Kher">Anupam Kher</a>'s acting school, "<a href="Actor%20Prepares%20-%20The%20School%20for%20Actors">Actor Prepares</a>" to learn the dialect and mannerisms of a Punjabi woman. The film was released to a mixed critical reaction, but her performance received rave reviews; Anand Singh of "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" wrote, "Karnik is merely interested in wringing tears the old-fashioned way, and not in starting a debate. He succeeds—mainly because Preity Zinta brings to a role a gravitas and dignity that is seen on the faces of ordinary women—this may be her coming of age as an actress."

By April 2008, Zinta had completed shooting for <a href="Jahnu%20Barua">Jahnu Barua</a>'s drama "<a href="Har%20Pal">Har Pal</a>". In the same year she played the leading role of Chand in <a href="Deepa%20Mehta">Deepa Mehta</a>'s Canadian film "<a href="Heaven%20on%20Earth%20%282008%20film%29">Heaven on Earth</a>", a <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi language</a> mystical drama based on the true story of a young Indian woman who, after an arranged marriage to a <a href="Non-resident%20Indian%20and%20person%20of%20Indian%20origin">non-resident Indian</a> man from Canada, migrates to Toronto and becomes a victim of severe domestic abuse. Expressing her desire for "a new kind of acting challenge", Zinta described Mehta as one director she was longing to work with to fulfill it. To prepare for the part, she read and watched several books and documentaries on domestic violence. As the film was to be shot entirely in Punjabi, a language that was totally alien to her, she learnt it in a crash course of fifty days. She was emotional during the making of the film: "I never knew a character would affect me so deeply. I've become completely withdrawn and introspective... I can't snap out of the character." She eventually called it her most challenging project, as it helped her "shed everything that Preity Zinta was about." "Heaven on Earth" was first screened at several film festivals and, upon release, garnered career-best reviews for Zinta. Her performance earned her the <a href="Silver%20Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Silver Hugo Award for Best Actress</a> at the 2008 <a href="Chicago%20International%20Film%20Festival">Chicago International Film Festival</a>, for "her strong yet subtle performance as a woman struggling to keep her dreams despite brutal realities." Among other awards, she was acknowledged with Best Actress nominations at several award functions in Canada, including the <a href="Genie%20Award">Genie Award</a> by the <a href="Academy%20of%20Canadian%20Cinema%20and%20Television">Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television</a>, and the <a href="Vancouver%20Film%20Critics%20Circle">Vancouver Film Critics Circle</a>.

Following "Heaven on Earth", Zinta took a two-year sabbatical from films, later explaining that she had chosen to focus on her work with <a href="Preity%20Zinta%23Ownership%20of%20IPL%20cricket%20team">her cricket team</a>. In 2011 she launched her own production company, <a href="PZNZ%20Media">PZNZ Media</a>. Two years later and following numerous delays, she starred in her first film under the banner—the <a href="Prem%20Raj">Prem Raj</a>-directed romantic comedy "<a href="Ishkq%20in%20Paris">Ishkq in Paris</a>", which she also co-wrote. An Indo-French collaboration, the film saw Zinta as a half-Indian half-French Parisian woman alongside <a href="Rhehan%20Malliek">Rhehan Malliek</a> and <a href="Isabelle%20Adjani">Isabelle Adjani</a>. Zinta's role required her to learn French and follow a strict diet and fitness regime, for which she hired the services of celebrity trainer <a href="Tracy%20Anderson">Tracy Anderson</a>. Whilst the film bombed at the box office and received mostly negative reviews, Zinta's performance attracted a mixed critical reception. Sonia Chopra of Sify called her "hugely likeable", and added that she is a "good actress, astute producer and ... writer." Shilpa Jamkhandikar from "<a href="Deccan%20Herald">Deccan Herald</a>", critical of both the film and Zinta's work, concluded a scathing review by calling it "a mediocre film, one that was supposed to showcase one of our favourite leading ladies, but instead just shows us what a shadow of her past she's become."

Following a five-year sabbatical, Zinta starred opposite Sunny Deol as an aggressive Varanasi-based wife in Neeraj Pathak's action comedy "<a href="Bhaiaji%20Superhit">Bhaiaji Superhit</a>" (2018). Ajit Duara of "<a href="Open%20%28Indian%20magazine%29">Open</a>" magazine called the film a "rude, sexist, and completely mixed-up farce" and bemoaned that the "once vivacious [Zinta] appears completely disinterested in her surroundings and in her co-actors".

In 2004, Zinta joined a group of South Asian commentators for <a href="BBC%20News%20Online">BBC News Online</a>. She expressed joy at participating in the project, saying, "I am pretty outspoken and have my own view on every subject. So it will be a good platform for me to air my views." Her first column, "The changing face of Bollywood", published in January 2004, discussed the evolution of Bollywood in the past decade. The column became one of the site's ten most read stories of the day. In her second column, "Odds stacked against Indian women", Zinta analysed the <a href="eve%20teasing">eve teasing</a> phenomenon in India, and criticised those who practice it. She wrote, "Incidences like these take away a woman's dignity, her space and her freedom ... why the state is so helpless in protecting the women. Why should women feel unsafe in a country which had an internationally revered woman prime minister?" The column caught the attention of readers worldwide, and she received thousands of e-mails about it. It was applauded particularly by women for its stand against <a href="violence%20against%20women">abuse of Indian women</a>. Her third column, "The darkness that all actors fear", was a more personal column and dealt with her stardom, fans, insecurity and fears as an actor. Her fourth and final column, titled "Facing death in Sri Lanka and Thailand", described her two <a href="%23Personal%20life">near-death experiences</a> in late 2004.

Zinta has taken part in several stage shows and world tours since 2001. Her first world tour, a series of concerts called "Craze 2001", was performed across the US alongside Anil Kapoor, Aamir Khan, <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a> and <a href="Gracy%20Singh">Gracy Singh</a>. The show faced early cancellation due to the <a href="11%20September%202001%20attacks">11 September 2001 attacks</a>, and the team prepared to return to India as soon as possible. However, the shows continued successfully in Canada.
In 2002, she participated in the show "From India With Love" in the UK, along with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Aishwarya Rai. It took place at two outdoor venues, <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>'s <a href="Old%20Trafford">Old Trafford</a> and London's <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>, with over 100,000 spectators. Zinta's largest world tour was in 2004, when she joined a group of stars (Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji, Saif Ali Khan, Arjun Rampal and Priyanka Chopra) in the "Temptation 2004" tour. Showcased in over 22 countries across the world, it became Bollywood's most prominent international concert. In 2006, Zinta was part of the "Heat 2006" world tour, along with Akshay Kumar, Saif Ali Khan, <a href="Sushmita%20Sen">Sushmita Sen</a> and <a href="Celina%20Jaitley">Celina Jaitley</a>. "The Unforgettable Tour" (2008) saw Zinta performing with the <a href="Bachchan%20family">Bachchan family</a> and <a href="Ritesh%20Deshmukh">Ritesh Deshmukh</a> in a 40-day show staged in 11 cities across North America, Europe and the Caribbean. In December 2012, Zinta returned to the stage with the "Temptation Reloaded" concert in <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> (joined by Shah Rukh Khan, Rani Mukerji and <a href="Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</a>).

In 2011, Zinta made her television debut as the host of the show "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records%20%E2%80%93%20Ab%20India%20Todega">Guinness World Records – Ab India Todega</a>" on <a href="Colors%20%28TV%20channel%29">Colors Channel</a>. An Indian version of <a href="Guinness%20Book%20of%20World%20Records">Guinness Book of World Records</a>, the show premiered on 18 March to an audience measurement of 3.3 rating points, which made it occupy the 7th position on the chart of celebrity-driven reality shows on Hindi entertainment channels. In a four-star review for "Hindustan Times", critic Rachana Dubey wrote, "Preity is a riot. She's vivacious and knows exactly when she needs to be serious and when she can crack jokes." Later that year, Zinta started hosting the celebrity-based chat show "<a href="Up%20Close%20%26amp%3B%20Personal%20with%20PZ">Up Close & Personal with PZ</a>", shot at her own penthouse in Mumbai and broadcast on the newly launched channel <a href="UTV%20Software%20Communications">UTV Stars</a>. The first episode aired on 3 September. In 2015, Zinta featured as a talent judge for the <a href="Nach%20Baliye%207">seventh season</a> of the dance reality show "<a href="Nach%20Baliye">Nach Baliye</a>".

During her years in the film industry, Zinta has been involved with different charitable organisations and has particularly supported women's causes in India, for instance protesting against <a href="female%20infanticide">female infanticide</a>. She has also participated in AIDS awareness drives and campaigns to clean up <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>.
In 2005, along with other Bollywood stars, Zinta performed at the "HELP! Telethon Concert" raising money for the victims of the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>. The following year, as an ambassador of the <a href="Godfrey%20Phillips%20National%20Bravery%20Awards">Godfrey Phillips National Bravery Movement</a>, Zinta attended a <a href="blood%20donation">blood donation</a> camp organised by the <a href="Rotary%20Club">Rotary Club</a> of <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> and the Godfrey Phillips Awards. She lent her support to the cause of <a href="women%27s%20empowerment">women's empowerment</a> and promoted blood donation. She said, "Donating blood doesn't kill one but goes on to save somebody's life ... Once blood is donated it becomes universal and might be used by anyone in need, irrespective of community, caste or region. It binds people together."

In 2007, Zinta visited <a href="Hisar%2C%20India">Hisar</a>, Haryana, where she spent a day at the army training base to boost the morale of the <a href="Jawans">jawan</a> troops. The visit was conducted for an <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a> show, "Jai Jawan", on which entertainers and actors visit Indian troops. While there, she also met children with disabilities at a <a href="special%20school">special school</a> maintained by the army. In August, along with Mumbai-based artist Gurcharan Singh, Zinta painted for the cause of <a href="street%20children">street children</a> for the non-governmental organisation "Khushi". In December, she joined the efforts of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Office%20on%20Drugs%20and%20Crime">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime</a> (UNODC) to curb <a href="human%20trafficking%20in%20India">human trafficking in India</a>. She spoke on behalf of awareness against the practice, the need for protection and rehabilitation for those rescued from it, and punishment for perpetrators.

In 2009, on her 34th birthday, Zinta adopted 34 girls from the Mother Miracle orphanage in <a href="Rishikesh">Rishikesh</a> and took the responsibility of financially supporting their education, food and clothing. She expressed her excitement at doing so: "I've adopted 34 girls. I'll be looking after their entire upbringing from education to food, clothes etc. You've no idea how wonderful it feels to hear the excited chatter of all these girls together."

In January 2010, Zinta was appointed the brand ambassador of The Loomba Trust, an organisation that works for the welfare of widows and their children. She said, having lost her father at 13, she could relate to the problems faced by widowed women. Later in the year, she joined the <a href="Joint%20United%20Nations%20Programme%20on%20HIV/AIDS">Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS</a> (UNAIDS) as their <a href="Goodwill%20Ambassador">Goodwill Ambassador</a> in India, to promote public awareness on HIV prevention, treatment and support, with emphasis on women and children, and combat discrimination against it. Speaking of her appointment, Zinta expressed hope to be "the voice for the voiceless" and bring about a "transformation in the minds of people" through collaborative work. In October 2010, Zinta was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the <a href="University%20of%20East%20London">University of East London</a>. It was awarded in honour of both her cultural contribution and her humanitarian work, with the citation describing her as "an international actress, pioneering star of Hindi cinema and devoted humanitarian. Preity has carved a path for women to follow."

Along with <a href="Ness%20Wadia">Ness Wadia</a>, <a href="Mohit%20Burman">Mohit Burman</a> and others, Zinta acquired ownership rights in 2008 for the Mohali-based <a href="Twenty20">Twenty20</a> cricket team of the <a href="Indian%20Premier%20League">Indian Premier League</a> (IPL). The group paid $76 million to acquire the franchise, and had since named the team <a href="Kings%20XI%20Punjab">Kings XI Punjab</a>. Until 2009, Zinta was the only woman to own an IPL team, and was the league's youngest owner. She has been involved with launching ticket sales and promoting the team. She said, "My involvement with the team is total. I am extremely passionate about our team and I do believe that I am the team's good luck factor, so I want to be there for everything." In September 2017 Zinta became the owner of the <a href="Stellenbosch%20Kings">Stellenbosch Kings</a> franchise of South Africa's <a href="T20%20Global%20League">T20 Global League</a>.

Zinta used to visit her native town Shimla when she was not busy shooting. In 2006, she moved into her own home in Mumbai. She does not identify with any particular religion. In an interview with "The Times of India", she comments, "I believe in good deeds, in <a href="karma">karma</a>, I don't believe in going to temples. For me, religion is very personal. It's all about having faith ... We have heard and read that all religions are equal. Now I am increasingly believing in this." She narrowly <a href="Near-death%20experience">escaped death</a> twice in late 2004: first after an explosion at a Temptation concert in <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, Sri Lanka; and second during the <a href="Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake">Indian Ocean earthquake</a>.
Zinta has been the subject of several controversies. In 2003, as a witness in the <a href="Bharat%20Shah">Bharat Shah</a> case, she testified against the <a href="Indian%20mafia">Indian mafia</a>. Bharat Shah, the financer of one of her films, "Chori Chori Chupke Chupke", was arrested in 2000 for having connections with <a href="Chhota%20Shakeel">Chhota Shakeel</a>, a Mumbai underworld boss. Unlike several of her colleagues, Zinta repeated in court her earlier statement that she had received <a href="extortion">extortion</a> threats from the mafia during the shooting of the film. After her testimony, she was given <a href="witness%20protection">witness protection</a> and was forced to stay out of the public eye for two months. Thirteen other witnesses before her, including celebrities Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan, were witnesses in the case but later retracted their earlier statements. Zinta was the only witness who did not become <a href="hostile%20witness">hostile</a> to the prosecution; the nation responded positively to her actions. Consequently, she was the first recipient of <a href="Godfrey%20Phillips%20National%20Bravery%20Awards%23Mind%20of%20steel%20Award">Godfrey's Mind of Steel Award</a> at the annual <a href="Red%20and%20White%20Bravery%20Awards">Red and White Bravery Awards</a>, given to her for the "courageous act" of standing against the Mumbai Underworld. On receiving the award, she said, "To be brave is not to be fearless. It is when you fear and you get over it, then you can be called brave. I am human. It is not that I fear nothing. But getting over a fear is a continuous process and I have been successful so far." Since 2006, Zinta has been the <a href="brand%20ambassador">brand ambassador</a> for the Godfrey Phillips Bravery awards.

<a href="Tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">Tabloids</a> have often linked Zinta romantically with other Bollywood stars, but she has strongly denied any such rumours. In 2000, Zinta began dating model <a href="Marc%20Robinson">Marc Robinson</a>. They separated the following year, and according to Zinta remained on good terms. Asked in "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" about their break-up, she spoke of "Very, very fond memories of the times we were together and I'd like to keep it to that". Zinta dated the <a href="Bombay%20Dyeing">Bombay Dyeing</a> heir, businessman Ness Wadia from February 2005 until May 2009. Their relationship was often reported on by the media, with frequent speculation about an engagement or a break-up. On 13 June 2014, Zinta filed a complaint with the Mumbai police against Ness Wadia alleging he had molested, threatened, and abused her at an <a href="Indian%20Premier%20League%20-%20Season%207%20%282014%29">IPL</a> match at the <a href="Wankhede%20Stadium">Wankhede Stadium</a> in Mumbai on 30 May. Wadia has denied the allegations.

On 29 February 2016, Zinta married her long-time American partner Gene Goodenough at a private ceremony in Los Angeles. Goodenough is Senior Vice-President for Finance at NLine Energy, a US-based hydroelectric power company.

Zinta is particularly known in the Indian media for her straightforward nature and for honestly expressing her forthright opinions in public, be it about her on-screen or off-screen life or raising a voice against social injustice. While she does not believe she is "as tough as people portray [her] to be," she asserts having no qualms about speaking her mind, even if faced with surmounting opposition, as long as she stands "by what's right." These features were noted during the Bharat Shah Case, when she testified against the underworld; following this incident she was often called by journalists "The only man in Bollywood", a label she was unhappy with for its underlying anti-feminist connotations. Film actor Amitabh Bachchan, describing her as "frank and painfully honest," lauded her "drive and guts in a world that can be most cruel to a single girl." Author and columnist <a href="Shobhaa%20De">Shobhaa De</a>, while commending her for lodging a molestation complaint against Ness Wadia in 2014, expressed concern regarding Zinta's repeated quest for justice, believing it could eventually play against her: "India is not terribly kind to strong-willed, outspoken women who are dubbed 'trouble makers' if they dare to raise their voices, especially against men. Zinta is such a woman."

Her characteristic dimple has been cited by the media as her trademark. At the beginning of her career, she was often described by the press as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she had confessed to disliking. According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta's energetic nature extends from her real life into her appearances in films and is an integral part of her technique. In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, "What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop in a tone that is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. She laughs all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too. Preity Zinta is all that and more. All this greatly contributes to her style of acting."

Director Tanuja Chandra, while filming "Sangharsh" in 1998, ascribed Zinta's screen appeal to her lack of acting pretense, commenting, "She doesn't act, she's so real that you just can't look away from her". Reviewing "Chori Chori Chupke Chupke" for "Hindustan Times", <a href="Vinayak%20Chakravorty">Vinayak Chakravorty</a> noted that "there is an admirable zest that Preity pumps into every role she does". Farhan Akhtar, who directed her in two movies, believes she is an actress who "can mould herself—the way she speaks, works and her body language—and adapt herself to roles," while Vidhu Vinod Chopra (director of "Mission Kashmir") credits her with the ability to "make the viewer believe even in the most convoluted situation." In a review of "Salaam Namaste", Australian film critic Jake Wilson observed, "While Preity Zinta isn't the subtlest actress, she's quite a comedienne – for a Hollywood equivalent to her combination of beauty, high-strung emotion and facial gymnastics you might have to go back to <a href="Natalie%20Wood">Natalie Wood</a>." American critic Derek Elley considers her to be "one of Bollywood's best pure actresses."

Following her portrayal of such characters as those in "Sangharsh", "Kya Kehna", "Chori Chori Chupke Chupke", "Salaam Namaste" and "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna", Zinta gained a reputation for playing roles that go against Indian traditional mores and was often recognised for her versatility. Critics attributed her roles in these films as to establishing a new image for leading actresses in Bollywood. Karan Johar cites her as "a new-wave actress" who has the advantage of working at a time when "films portray a woman who knows her mind". In the book "Once Upon a Time in Bollywood", it is stated that Zinta "resists patriarchal constraints through her modern lifestyle and the controversial roles she chooses."

Zinta is one of the best-known celebrities in India; at her career peak she was one of Hindi cinema's most celebrated and highest-paid stars and was acknowledged for having managed a career without any traditional assistance or family relations in the film industry. In 2003, Zinta appeared in the number one spot on Rediff's "Top Bollywood Female Stars". She was ranked second for the following three years. She has been featured frequently on other Rediff lists, including "Bollywood's Most Beautiful Actresses", "Bollywood's Best Dressed Women" and "Women of Many Faces". Between 2006 and 2008 Zinta made three consecutive appearances at the <a href="Cannes%20Film%20Festival">Cannes Film Festival</a>. At first she attended the <a href="2006%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2006 Film Festival</a> along with filmmaker Karan Johar to represent the Hindi film industry and promote "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna", returning in later years as the brand ambassador of <a href="Chopard">Chopard</a>, the maker of luxury watches and jewellery. In September 2006, the UK magazine "<a href="Eastern%20Eye%20%28newspaper%29">Eastern Eye</a>" ranked her among "Asia's Sexiest Women". In 2010, "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine selected her as one of the candidates for its list of <a href="Time%20100">the world's 100 most influential people</a>. She was the only Indian actress nominated for the poll and eventually did not make it to the final list, ranked at 144. This was followed, however, by a marked period of decline in her popularity when she restricted her work in films, which was further decreased with the debacle of her self-produced comeback vehicle.

Among Zinta's film awards are two <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>—<a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Debut">Best Female Debut</a> for "Dil Se.." and "Soldier", and <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> for "Kal Ho Naa Ho".

Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)

The Mass Rapid Transit, or MRT, is a <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> system forming the major component of the <a href="Rail%20transport%20in%20Singapore">railway system</a> in <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, spanning most of the <a href="city-state">city-state</a>. The earliest section of the MRT, between <a href="Toa%20Payoh%20MRT%20station">Toa Payoh</a> and <a href="Yio%20Chu%20Kang%20MRT%20station">Yio Chu Kang</a>, opened on 7 November 1987. The network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Singapore's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the <a href="Transport%20in%20Singapore">public transport system in Singapore</a>, with an average daily ridership of 3.031 million in 2015 (including the <a href="Light%20Rail%20Transit%20%28Singapore%29">Light Rail Transit</a> (LRT)), approximately 78% of the <a href="Bus%20transport%20in%20Singapore">bus network's</a> 3.891 million in the same period.

The MRT network encompasses of route, with <a href="List%20of%20Singapore%20MRT%20stations">119 stations</a> in operation, on <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a>. The fully automated <a href="North%20East%20MRT%20line">North East</a>, <a href="Circle%20MRT%20line">Circle</a> and <a href="Downtown%20MRT%20line">Downtown</a> lines form the longest fully automated metro network in the world. The lines are built by the <a href="Land%20Transport%20Authority">Land Transport Authority</a>, a statutory board of the <a href="Government%20of%20Singapore">Government of Singapore</a>, which allocates operating concessions to the profit-based corporations, <a href="SMRT%20Corporation">SMRT Corporation</a>, and <a href="SBS%20Transit">SBS Transit</a>. These operators also run bus and <a href="Taxicabs%20of%20Singapore">taxi services</a>, thus facilitating full integration of <a href="Transport%20in%20Singapore">public transport services</a>. The MRT is complemented by a small number of local LRT networks in <a href="Bukit%20Panjang">Bukit Panjang</a>, <a href="Sengkang">Sengkang</a>, and <a href="Punggol">Punggol</a> that link MRT stations with <a href="Housing%20and%20Development%20Board">HDB</a> <a href="public%20housing">public</a> <a href="housing%20estate">housing estate</a>s.

The origins of the Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) are derived from a forecast by city planners in 1967 which stated the need for a rail-based urban transport system by 1992. Following a debate on whether a bus-only system would be more cost-effective, then Minister for Communications <a href="Ong%20Teng%20Cheong">Ong Teng Cheong</a>, came to the conclusion that an all-bus system would be inadequate, as it would have to compete for road space in a land-scarce country.

The network was built in stages, with the <a href="North%20South%20MRT%20line">North South line</a> given priority because it passed through the <a href="Central%20Area%2C%20Singapore">Central Area</a> that has a high demand for public transport. The Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC)—later renamed SMRT Corporation—was established on 14 October 1983; it took over the roles and responsibilities (which was the construction and operation the MRT system) of the former provisional Mass Rapid Transit Authority. On 7 November 1987, the first section of the North South line started operations, consisting of five stations over six kilometres. Fifteen more stations were opened later, and the MRT system was officially launched on 12 March 1988 by then Prime Minister <a href="Lee%20Kuan%20Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>. Another 21 stations have been added to the system; the opening of <a href="Boon%20Lay%20MRT%20station">Boon Lay</a> on the East West line on 6 July 1990 marked the completion of the system two years ahead of schedule.

The MRT has since been expanded. The first expansion was in 1996, a S$1.2 billion expansion of the North South line into Woodlands, merging the <a href="Branch%20MRT%20line">branch line</a> into the North South line and joining <a href="Yishun%20MRT%20station">Yishun</a> and <a href="Choa%20Chu%20Kang%20MRT/LRT%20station">Choa Chu Kang</a> stations. The concept of having rail lines that bring people almost directly to their homes led to the introduction of the <a href="Light%20Rail%20Transit%20%28Singapore%29">Light Rail Transit</a> (LRT) lines connecting with the MRT network. On 6 November 1999, the first LRT trains on the <a href="Bukit%20Panjang%20LRT%20Line">Bukit Panjang LRT</a> went into operation. In 2002, the <a href="Changi%20Airport%20MRT%20Station">Changi Airport</a> and <a href="Expo%20MRT%20Station">Expo</a> stations were added to the MRT network. The <a href="North%20East%20MRT%20line">North East line</a>, the first line operated by SBS Transit, opened on 20 June 2003, one of the first fully automated heavy rail lines in the world. On 15 January 2006, after intense two-and-a-half years lobbying by the public, <a href="Buangkok%20MRT%20station">Buangkok station</a> was opened. On 20 June 2011, <a href="Woodleigh%20MRT%20station">Woodleigh station</a> was opened. The <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line%23Boon%20Lay%20Extension%20%28BLE%29">Boon Lay Extension</a> of the East West line, consisting of <a href="Pioneer%20MRT%20station">Pioneer</a> and <a href="Joo%20Koon%20MRT%20station">Joo Koon</a> stations, opened on 28 February 2009. The <a href="Circle%20MRT%20line">Circle line</a> opened in four stages from 28 May 2009 to 14 January 2012. Stage 1 of <a href="Downtown%20MRT%20line">Downtown line</a> opened on 22 December 2013 with its official opening made on 21 December 2013 by Prime Minister <a href="Lee%20Hsien%20Loong">Lee Hsien Loong</a>. Stage 2 opened on 27 December 2015, after being officially opened on 26 December by Prime Minister Lee. The <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line%23Tuas%20West%20Extension%20%28TWE%29">Tuas West Extension</a> of the East West line, consisting of <a href="Gul%20Circle%20MRT%20station">Gul Circle</a>, <a href="Tuas%20Crescent%20MRT%20station">Tuas Crescent</a>, <a href="Tuas%20West%20Road%20MRT%20station">Tuas West Road</a>, and <a href="Tuas%20Link%20MRT%20station">Tuas Link</a> stations, opened on 18 June 2017. Stage 3, the final stage of the Downtown line, opened on 21 October 2017 with its official opening made on 20 October 2017 by Coordinating Minister for Infrastructure and Minister for Transport <a href="Khaw%20Boon%20Wan">Khaw Boon Wan</a>.

The following table lists the Mass Rapid Transit lines that are currently operational:

Except for the partly at-grade <a href="Bishan%20MRT%20station">Bishan MRT station</a> (<a href="North%20South%20MRT%20line">North South line</a>), the entirety of the MRT is elevated or underground. Most below-ground stations are deep and hardened enough to withstand <a href="conventional%20weapon">conventional aerial bomb attacks</a> and to serve as <a href="bomb%20shelter">bomb shelter</a>s. Mobile phone, 3G and 4G service are available in every part of the network. Underground stations and trains are air-conditioned, while above-ground stations have ceiling fans installed.

Every station is equipped with General Ticketing Machines (GTMs), a Passenger Service Centre and <a href="LED%20display">LED</a> or <a href="plasma%20display">plasma display</a>s that show train service information and announcements. All stations are equipped with restrooms and payphones; some restrooms are located at street level. Some stations, especially the major ones, have additional amenities and services, such as <a href="retailing">retail</a> shops and kiosks, supermarkets, convenience stores, automatic teller machines, and self-service automated kiosks for a variety of services. Heavy-duty escalators at stations carry passengers up or down at a rate of 0.75 m/s, 50% faster than conventional escalators.

All stations on the North South line (NSL) & stations constructed before 2001 on the East West line (EWL) initially did not have barrier-free facilities and wider AFC faregates such as lifts, ramps & tactile guidance systems for the elderly and disabled, thus preventing disabled persons from entering the buses or trains, and they rely on cars, taxicabs or vans to get to their destination. Stations along the NSL & EWL undergone their retrofitting programme between 2002 and completed in 2008. All stations are now barrier-free, although works are still ongoing to provide stations with additional barrier-free facilities.

MRT lines operate from 5:30am to 1:00am daily, with the exception of selected periods such as <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a>, <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">Chinese New Year</a>, <a href="Deepavali">Deepavali</a>, <a href="Hari%20Raya">Hari Raya</a>, <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, eves of public holidays, and special occasions such as the <a href="Death%20of%20Lee%20Kuan%20Yew">state funeral of Lee Kuan Yew</a> (2015), when most of the lines stay open throughout the night or extended till later.

The following table lists the rolling stock of the network:

At present, all lines run with fixed-length trains between three and six cars, with the future Thomson–East Coast line using four cars. Since the system's conception in 1987, all train lines have been powered by the 750 volt <a href="direct%20current">DC</a> <a href="third%20rail">third rail</a>, with the exception of the North East Line which is powered by 1500 volt <a href="direct%20current">DC</a> <a href="overhead%20lines">overhead lines</a>. The North South and East West lines use an <a href="automatic%20train%20operation">automatic train operation</a> system similar to <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>'s <a href="Victoria%20line">Victoria line</a>.

No rolling stock has been completely scrapped since service began, with the oldest <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries%20C151">C151</a> trains operating since the inauguration of the MRT System in 1987. Older trains have been renewed over the years under refurbishment schemes to enhance their lifespan as well as to adhere to updated safety and usability codes. 
Refurbished and new trains have improved passenger information systems (<a href="SMRT%20Active%20Route%20Map%20Information%20System">SMRT Active Route Map Information System</a>), more grab poles, wider seats, more space near the doors, spaces for wheelchairs, and <a href="Closed-circuit%20television">CCTV cameras</a>. As a trial run, luggage racks were installed on the <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries%20%26amp%3B%20Nippon%20Sharyo%20C751B">C751B</a> trains to serve travellers on the Changi Airport branch line. The scheme was withdrawn in June 2002 and the luggage racks removed.

All trains are contracted by open tender, with their contract numbers forming the most recognised name of the stock. Official sources occasionally refer to the trains of the North South and East West lines as numbered generation trains, with the <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries%20C151">C151</a> train being the first and the newest <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries%20%26amp%3B%20CRRC%20Sifang%20C151C">C151C</a> train being the sixth.

All Mass Rapid Transit lines are capable of <a href="automatic%20train%20operation">automatic train operation</a> without operator intervention.

The oldest lines, the <a href="North%20South%20MRT%20line">North South line</a> and <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line">East West line</a>, were the only lines running with fixed <a href="block%20signalling">block signalling</a>. The North South Line was upgraded to <a href="moving%20block">moving block</a> <a href="communications-based%20train%20control">CBTC</a> in 2017, and the East West line upgraded in 2018. As of 27 May 2018, all MRT lines use the CBTC Moving Block system in normal daily operations and from 2 January 2019, the old signalling system ceased operations.

All new MRT lines built since the North East line in 2003 were equipped with CBTC from the outset, and have the capability to be <a href="List%20of%20automated%20urban%20metro%20subway%20systems">completely driverless</a> and automated, requiring no onboard staffing. Operations are monitored remotely from the operations control centre of the respective lines. Trains are equipped with <a href="intercom">intercom</a>s to allow passengers to communicate with staff during emergencies.

SMRT Corporation has four train depots: <a href="Bishan%20Depot">Bishan Depot</a> is the central maintenance depot with train overhaul facilities, while <a href="Changi%20Depot">Changi Depot</a> and <a href="Ulu%20Pandan%20Depot">Ulu Pandan Depot</a> inspect and house trains overnight. In March 2012, it was announced the new <a href="Tuas%20Depot">Tuas Depot</a> would be ready in 2016 for the <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line">East West MRT line</a>. The underground <a href="Kim%20Chuan%20Depot">Kim Chuan Depot</a> houses trains for the <a href="Circle%20MRT%20line">Circle line</a> and Downtown line, now jointly managed by the two operators.

SBS Transit has three depots: <a href="Sengkang%20Depot">Sengkang Depot</a> houses trains for the <a href="North%20East%20MRT%20line">North East line</a>, the <a href="Sengkang%20LRT%20line">Sengkang LRT line</a>, and the <a href="Punggol%20LRT%20line">Punggol LRT line</a>. Kim Chuan Depot is currently jointly operated with SMRT for the <a href="Downtown%20MRT%20Line">Downtown line</a>. Major operations were shifted to the main <a href="Gali%20Batu%20Depot">Gali Batu Depot</a> in 2015, although the Kim Chuan Depot will continue to operate on a minor capacity.

In August 2014, plans for the <a href="East%20Coast%20Integrated%20Depot">East Coast Integrated Depot</a>, the world's first four-in-one train and bus depot were announced. It will be built at Tanah Merah beside the original <a href="Changi%20Depot">Changi Depot</a> site to serve the <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line">East West</a>, <a href="Downtown%20MRT%20line">Downtown</a>, and <a href="Thomson%E2%80%93East%20Coast%20MRT%20line">Thomson–East Coast</a> lines. The new 36ha depot can house about 220 trains and 550 buses and integrating the depot for both buses and trains will help save close to , or 60 football fields', of land.

The Main Depot for the <a href="Jurong%20Region%20MRT%20Line">Jurong Region line</a> will be situated at the western perimeter of <a href="Tengah%2C%20Singapore">Tengah</a> and an additional stabling facility near <a href="Peng%20Kang%20Hill%20MRT%20Station">Peng Kang Hill</a> station to support the operations of the JRL. Rolling stock for the Jurong Region Line will be stabled at both facilities. The Tengah depot, which will house the JRL Operations Control Centre and will have a bus depot integrated with it to optimise land use.

The Western Depot for <a href="Cross%20Island%20MRT%20line">Cross Island line</a> will be located at the former site of Raffles Country Club.

Early stages of the MRT's construction paid scant attention to station design, with an emphasis on functionality over aesthetics. This is particularly evident in the first few stages of the <a href="North%20South%20MRT%20line">North South</a> and <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line">East West</a> lines that opened between 1987 and 1988 from <a href="Yio%20Chu%20Kang%20MRT%20station">Yio Chu Kang</a> to <a href="Clementi%20MRT%20station">Clementi</a>. An exception to this was <a href="Orchard%20MRT%20station">Orchard</a>, chosen by its designers to be a "showpiece" of the system and built initially with a domed roof. Architectural themes became more important only in subsequent stages, and resulted in such designs as the cylindrical station shapes on all stations between <a href="Kallang%20MRT%20station">Kallang</a> and <a href="Pasir%20Ris%20MRT%20station">Pasir Ris</a> except <a href="Eunos%20MRT%20station">Eunos</a>, and west of <a href="Boon%20Lay%20MRT%20station">Boon Lay</a>, and the perched roofs at Boon Lay, <a href="Lakeside%20MRT%20station">Lakeside</a>, <a href="Chinese%20Garden%20MRT%20station">Chinese Garden</a>, <a href="Bukit%20Batok%20MRT%20station">Bukit Batok</a>, <a href="Bukit%20Gombak%20MRT%20station">Bukit Gombak</a>, <a href="Choa%20Chu%20Kang%20MRT/LRT%20station">Choa Chu Kang</a>, <a href="Khatib%20MRT%20station">Khatib</a>, <a href="Yishun%20MRT%20station">Yishun</a>, and <a href="Eunos%20MRT%20station">Eunos</a> stations.

Art pieces, where present, are seldom highlighted; they primarily consist of a few paintings or sculptures representing the recent past of Singapore, mounted in major stations. The opening of the <a href="Woodlands%20Extension">Woodlands Extension</a> introduced bolder pieces of artwork, such as a 4,000 kg sculpture in <a href="Woodlands%20MRT%20station">Woodlands</a>. With the opening of the <a href="North%20East%20MRT%20line">North East MRT line</a>, more series of artworks created under a programme called "The Art In Transit" were commissioned by the <a href="Land%20Transport%20Authority">Land Transport Authority</a>. Created by 19 local artists and integrated into the stations' interior architecture, these works aim to promote the appreciation of <a href="public%20art">public art</a> in high-traffic environments. The artwork for each station is designed to suit the station's identity. All stations on the North East, Circle and Downtown lines come under this programme. An art contest was held to implement a similar scheme for the <a href="Circle%20MRT%20line">Circle line</a>.

The <a href="Expo%20MRT%20station">Expo MRT station</a>, located on the <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line%23Changi%20Airport%20Branch">Changi Airport Branch Line (CAL)</a> of the East West Line, is adjacent to the 100,000-square-metre <a href="Singapore%20Expo">Singapore Expo</a> exhibition facility. Designed by <a href="Foster%20and%20Partners">Foster and Partners</a> and completed in January 2001, the station features a large, pillarless, titanium-clad roof in an elliptical shape that sheathes the length of the station platform. This complements a smaller 40-metre reflective stainless-steel disc overlapping the titanium ellipse and visually floats over a glass elevator shaft and the main entrance. The other station with similar architecture is <a href="Dover%20MRT%20station">Dover</a>.

Changi Airport, the easternmost station on the MRT network, has the widest platform in any underground MRT station in Singapore. In 2011, it was rated 10 out of 15 most beautiful subway stops in the world by BootsnAll.

Two <a href="Circle%20MRT%20line">Circle line</a> stations—<a href="Bras%20Basah%20MRT%20station">Bras Basah</a> and <a href="Stadium%20MRT%20station">Stadium</a>—were commissioned through the Marina line Architectural Design Competition, which was jointly organised by the <a href="Land%20Transport%20Authority">Land Transport Authority</a> and the Singapore Institute of Architects. The competition did not require any architectural experience from competitors and is acknowledged by the industry as one of the most impartial competitions held in Singapore to date. The winner of both stations was <a href="WOHA">WOHA</a>. In 2009, "Best Transport Building" was awarded to the designers at <a href="WOHA">WOHA</a> Architects at the World Architecture Festival.

The MRT system relied on its two main lines, the North South and East West lines, for more than a decade until the opening of the North East line in 2003. While plans for these lines as well as those currently under construction were formulated long before, the Land Transport Authority's publication of a White Paper titled ""A World Class Land Transport System"" in 1996 galvanised the government's intentions to greatly expand the system. It called for the expansion of the 67 kilometres of track in 1995 to 360 in 2030. It was expected that daily ridership in 2030 would grow to 6.0 million from the 1.4 million passengers at that time.

On 17 January 2013, the new rail lines and existing line extensions were announced, superior to the announcement of the Land Transport Master Plan 2013.

The following table lists Mass Rapid Transit lines and stations that are currently under testing, construction, or that are in the planning stages:

On 17 January 2013, the <a href="Land%20Transport%20Authority">Land Transport Authority</a> (LTA) announced that feasibility studies were being conducted to build a station between <a href="Sembawang%20MRT%20station">Sembawang</a> and <a href="Yishun%20MRT%20station">Yishun</a> stations. The studies were completed in 2014 and has led to the construction of Canberra station. Shortly later on 1 August 2014, LTA announced that construction will commence in mid-2015 and is expected to be completed in 2019. Construction works for Canberra station commenced on 26 March 2016. The station, which is an <a href="infill%20station">infill station</a> and will have <a href="side%20platform">side platform</a>s, will be built along an operational section of the line between <a href="Sembawang%20MRT%20station">Sembawang</a> and <a href="Yishun%20MRT%20station">Yishun</a> stations. The construction costs S$90 million and will be completed by 2019 to serve upcoming developments near the station. It was then confirmed that the station will open by December 2019.

The 44-kilometre, 36 station fully underground Downtown line, connects the northwestern and eastern regions of Singapore to the new downtown at <a href="Marina%20Bay%2C%20Singapore">Marina Bay</a> in the south and to the <a href="Central%20Business%20District">CBD</a>. Similar to the <a href="Circle%20MRT%20line">Circle line</a>, three-car trainsets run on the <a href="Downtown%20MRT%20line">Downtown line</a> with line capacity projected for 500,000 commuters daily. The Downtown Line commenced operations across 3 stages. Stage 1 from Bugis to Chinatown began operations on 22 December 2013. Stage 2 from Bukit Panjang to Rochor began operations on 27 December 2015. Stage 3 from Fort Canning to Expo began operations on 21 October 2017, and Stage 3e from Expo to Sungei Bedok will begin operations in 2024.

The 43-kilometre, 32 station fully underground Thomson–East Coast line will connect the northern region of Singapore to the south, running parallel to the existing North South Line passing through <a href="Woodlands%2C%20Singapore">Woodlands</a>, <a href="Sin%20Ming">Sin Ming</a>, <a href="Upper%20Thomson%20Road">Upper Thomson</a>, and <a href="Marina%20Bay%2C%20Singapore">Marina Bay</a> before turning east and running through <a href="Tanjong%20Rhu">Tanjong Rhu</a>, <a href="Siglap">Siglap</a>, <a href="Marine%20Parade">Marine Parade</a>, and <a href="Bedok">Bedok</a>. The line will commence operation in five stages, with the first three stages starting from <a href="Woodlands%20North%20MRT%20station">Woodlands North</a> to <a href="Gardens%20by%20the%20Bay%20MRT%20station">Gardens by the Bay</a> commencing operations between 2019 and 2021 respectively, Stage 4 from Tanjong Rhu to Bayshore in 2023 and Stage 5 from Bedok South to Sungei Bedok in 2024. The northern terminus of Woodlands North is also expected to interchange with the <a href="Johor%20Bahru%E2%80%93Singapore%20Rapid%20Transit%20System">Johor Bahru–Singapore Rapid Transit System</a> to provide access to <a href="Johor%20Bahru">Johor Bahru</a> and the future <a href="Iskandar%20Malaysia%20Bus%20Rapid%20Transit">Iskandar Malaysia Bus Rapid Transit</a>. The <a href="Land%20Transport%20Authority">Land Transport Authority</a> announced on 11 August 2017 that the line will be the first new cashless line after the existing lines were converted by 12 December 2018.

In addition to the previously announced alignment of the Thomson–East Coast line, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) is studying whether to extend the TEL from Sungei Bedok station to the future <a href="Changi%20Airport">Changi Airport</a> Terminal 5, and then connecting to the existing <a href="Changi%20Airport%20MRT%20station">Changi Airport MRT station</a> on the East-West Line. With such an extension, there will be a direct connection between Changi Airport and the city. Its length is still being decided. If feasible, this extension will start operating together with the opening of the new Terminal 5.

First proposed as a LRT line when originally announced in 2001, the 20-kilometre Jurong Region Line has since been upgraded to be a medium capacity line after the project was revived in 2013. The new configuration will serve <a href="West%20Coast%2C%20Singapore">West Coast</a>, <a href="Tengah">Tengah</a> and <a href="Choa%20Chu%20Kang">Choa Chu Kang</a> and <a href="Jurong">Jurong</a>. 

Besides the original announced alignment of the line, a West Coast extension to the Circle line from the Jurong Region line is currently under study. It links the West Coast region directly to <a href="Pasir%20Panjang">Pasir Panjang</a>, allowing commuters on the Jurong Region line access to the central area of the city easily. If feasible, the extension would be ready by 2030.

The 50-kilometre Cross Island Line will span the island of Singapore, passing through <a href="Tuas">Tuas</a>, <a href="Jurong">Jurong</a>, <a href="Sin%20Ming">Sin Ming</a>, <a href="Ang%20Mo%20Kio">Ang Mo Kio</a>, <a href="Hougang">Hougang</a>, <a href="Punggol">Punggol</a>, <a href="Pasir%20Ris">Pasir Ris</a>, and <a href="Changi">Changi</a>. The addition of the new line brings commuters with another alternative for East-West travel to the current <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line">East West line</a> and <a href="Circle%20MRT%20line">Circle line</a>, and will play an important role in Singapore's rail network. It will connect to all the other major lines to serve as a key transfer line, complementing the role currently fulfilled by the orbital <a href="Circle%20MRT%20line">Circle line</a>. This line will even have a longer timeframe due to the environmental study aspects, with the completion by 2030.

To be completed by 2025, the 4-kilometre extension will run from <a href="Marina%20Bay%20MRT%20station">Marina Bay</a> through Keppel, ending at <a href="HarbourFront%20MRT%20station">HarbourFront</a>, effectively 'completing the circle' On 29 October 2015, the LTA announced the 3 station locations for the 'Circle Line stage 6'. The stations are <a href="Keppel%20MRT%20station">Keppel</a>, <a href="Cantonment%20MRT%20station">Cantonment</a>, and <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Road%20MRT%20station">Prince Edward Road</a>.

Originally scheduled to be completed by 2030, the 1.6-kilometre extension will run from <a href="Punggol%20MRT/LRT%20station">Punggol</a> through Punggol North including the new Punggol Downtown. The extension is for future residents in Punggol North to have train access to the city centre as well as other parts of <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. On 7 June 2017, it was announced by Second Minister for Transport Ng Chee Meng that the North East line extension will open in 2023 instead, a few years ahead of the expected opening date. The single station extension will span 1.6 km and will serve the future Punggol North area. The station is tentatively named <a href="Punggol%20Coast%20MRT%20station">Punggol Coast</a>. Construction of the extension commenced in the first half of 2018.

Stations are divided into two areas, "paid" and "unpaid", which allow the rail operators to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as "access control gates". These gates, connected to a computer network, can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the initial and destination stations and the duration for each trip. <a href="Ticket%20machine">General Ticketing Machines</a> sell standard tickets that can be used up to 6 times within 30 days from the day of purchase. The machines also allow the customer to buy additional value for stored-value smartcards. Such smartcards require a minimum amount of stored credit.

As the fare system has been integrated by TransitLink, commuters need to pay only one fare and pass through two fare gates (once on entry, once on exit) for an entire journey for most interchange stations, even when transferring between lines operated by different companies. Commuters can choose to extend a trip mid-journey, and pay the difference when they exit their destination station.

Because the rail operators are government-assisted, profit-based corporations, fares on the MRT system are pitched to at least break-even level. The operators collect these fares by selling electronic data-storing tickets, the prices of which are calculated based on the distance between the start and destination stations. These prices increase in fixed stages for standard non-discounted travel. Fares are calculated in increments based on approximate distances between stations, in contrast to the use of fare zones in other subway systems, such as the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>.

Although operated by private companies, the system's fare structure is regulated by the <a href="Public%20Transport%20Council">Public Transport Council</a> (PTC), to which the operators submit requests for changes in fares. Fares are kept affordable by pegging them approximately to distance-related bus fares, thus encouraging commuters to use the network and reduce heavy reliance on the bus system. Fare increases have caused public concern.There were similar expressions of disapproval over the slightly higher fares charged on SBS Transit's <a href="North%20East%20MRT%20line">North East line</a>, a disparity that SBS Transit justified by citing higher costs of operation and maintenance on a completely underground line, as well as lower patronage.

After the opening of Downtown line stage 3, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced that public transport fare rules will be reviewed to allow for transfers across MRT lines at different stations as the rail network is getting denser. At the time, commuters were charged a second time when they made such transfers. He added that the Public Transport Council (PTC) would review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate "fast, seamless" public transport journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines was completed, and a waiver on the boarding fee incurred when making such transfers was announced on 22 March 2018. The scheme was implemented on 29 December of the same year.

The ticketing system uses the EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay <a href="contactless%20smart%20card">contactless smart card</a>s based upon the Symphony for e-Payment (SeP) system for public transit built on the Singapore Standard for Contactless ePurse Application (CEPAS) system. This system allows for up to 4 card issuers in the market. The EZ-Link card was introduced on 13 April 2002 as a replacement for the original TransitLink farecard, while its competitor the NETS FlashPay card entered the smartcard market on 9 October 2009.

A stored value adult EZ-Link or NETS FlashPay branded CEPAS card may be purchased at any TransitLink Ticket Office or Passenger Service Centre. The CEPAS card may be used for the payment of MRT, LRT and bus fares. The CEPAS card may also be used for payment for goods and services at selected merchants, <a href="Electronic%20Road%20Pricing">Electronic Road Pricing</a> tolls, and Electronic Parking System carparks. Additional credit may be purchased via cash, NETS and credit card at various places -

Additional credit may be purchased via cashless payments at various places -

Additional credit may be purchased via cash at various places -

Additional credit of a predetermined value may also be automatically credited into the card when the card value runs low via an automatic recharge service provided by Interbank GIRO or credit card. An Adult Monthly Travel Card for unlimited travel on MRT, LRT, and buses may also be purchased and is non-transferable.

From 4 April onwards, Mastercard users will be able to use their bank cards directly to pay for public transport rides, as announced by LTA under the new SimplyGo account-based system. Users of Visa cards and other travel cards will be able to use the system by the end of the year.

A Standard Ticket <a href="contactless%20smart%20card">contactless smart card</a> for single or return journeys may also be purchased at the GTM for the payment of MRT and LRT fares. A S$0.10 deposit is levied on top of the fare to be paid. The deposit will be automatically refunded through an offset of the fare to be paid for the third journey on the same ticket while an additional discount of S$0.10 will be given for the sixth journey on the same ticket. No refund of the deposit is provided if the card is used for fewer than 3 journeys. The ticket can be used for the purchase of single or return journeys to and from pre-selected stations up to a maximum of six journeys over 30 days. Fares for the Standard Ticket are always higher than those charged for the stored-valued CEPAS (EZ-Link and NETS FlashPay) cards for the same distance traveled. The ticket is retained by the user after each journey and does not need to be returned to any GTM or Passenger Service Centre. Identical to the usage of CEPAS cards, the ticket is tapped onto the faregate reader upon entry and exit.

For tourists, a Singapore Tourist Pass contactless smartcard may be purchased. The card may be bought at selected TransitLink Ticket Offices and Singapore Visitors Centres. The tourists may retrieve their deposit by returning the card to the ticket offices or visitors centres within 5 days from the date of issue.

Operators and authorities state that numerous measures had been taken to ensure the safety of passengers, and SBS Transit publicised the safety precautions on the driverless <a href="North%20East%20MRT%20line">North East line</a> before and after its opening. Safety campaign posters are highly visible in trains and stations, and the operators frequently broadcast <a href="Public%20service%20announcement">safety announcements</a> to passengers and to commuters waiting for trains. <a href="Fire%20safety">Fire safety</a> standards are consistent with the strict guidelines of the US <a href="National%20Fire%20Protection%20Association">National Fire Protection Association</a>.

There were calls for platform screen doors to be installed at above-ground stations after several incidents in which passengers were killed by oncoming trains when they fell onto the railway tracks at above-ground stations. Underground stations already featured platform screen doors since 1987. The authorities initially rejected the proposal by casting doubts over functionality and concerns about the high installation costs, but made an about-turn when the government announced plans to install <a href="automatic%20platform%20gate">half-height platform screen doors</a> on the above-ground stations in January 2008, citing lower costs due to it becoming a more common feature worldwide. They were first installed at <a href="Jurong%20East%20MRT%20station">Jurong East</a>, <a href="Pasir%20Ris%20MRT%20station">Pasir Ris</a>, and <a href="Yishun%20MRT%20station">Yishun</a> stations in 2009 under trials to test their feasibility.
By 14 March 2012, all elevated stations have been retrofitted with the doors and are operational. These doors prevent suicides and unauthorised access to restricted areas. Under the "Rapid Transit Systems Act", acts such as smoking, eating or drinking in stations and trains, the misuse of emergency equipment and trespassing on the railway tracks are illegal, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment.

There were a few major accidents in the history of the MRT that raised safety concerns among the public. On 5 August 1993, two trains <a href="Clementi%20rail%20accident">collided at Clementi station</a> because of an <a href="oil%20spill">oil spill</a>age on the track, which resulted in 132 injuries. During the construction of the Circle line on 20 April 2004, a tunnel being constructed under <a href="Nicoll%20Highway%20collapse">Nicoll Highway collapsed</a> and led to the deaths of four people. On 15 November 2017, at 8:20 a.m., two trains <a href="Joo%20Koon%20rail%20accident">collided</a> at <a href="Joo%20Koon%20MRT%20station">Joo Koon MRT station</a>, injuring 36 passengers and 2 SMRT staff.

Disruptions to the system of late, the cause of which often being cited by a lack of maintenance coupled with increased ridership due to population growth, have also raised concerns among the public.

Beginning with the major train disruptions on the North South Line in 2011, this incident led to a Committee of Inquiry, which uncovered serious shortcomings in SMRT Corporation's maintenance regime. For the December 2011 disruptions, the <a href="Land%20Transport%20Authority">Land Transport Authority</a> (LTA) imposed a maximum punishment of <a href="Singapore%20dollar">S</a>$2 million on <a href="SMRT%20Corporation">SMRT</a> (approximately US$1.526 million) for the two train disruptions along the <a href="North%20South%20MRT%20line">North South line</a> (NSL) on December 15 and 17, 2011. A Committee of Inquiry discovered shortcomings in the maintenance regime and checks, prompting then-CEO <a href="Saw%20Phaik%20Hwa">Saw Phaik Hwa</a> to resign. Since then, every MRT line had since been plagued with disruptions of various degrees of severity.

A much larger power-related incident than the December 2011 event occurred on 7 July 2015, when train services on "both" the <a href="North%20South%20MRT%20line">North South</a> and <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line">East West</a> lines were shut down in both directions following a major power trip. The disruption lasted for more than 3 hours, affecting 250,000 commuters. This was considered the worst disruption to the MRT network since it first began operations in 1987 – surpassing the December 2011 event. Independent experts from Sweden and Japan were hired to conduct investigation into the cause of the disruption. The cause was identified as damage to a <a href="third%20rail">third rail</a> insulator due to a water leak at <a href="Tanjong%20Pagar%20MRT%20station">Tanjong Pagar station</a>. Consequently, a program was implemented to replace insulators liable to similar failure. For the July 2015 disruption, LTA imposed a higher penalty of S$5.4 million on SMRT.

On 22 March 2016, a <a href="Pasir%20Ris%20rail%20accident">fatal accident</a> occurred off <a href="Pasir%20Ris%20MRT%20station">Pasir Ris MRT station</a>. Two of SMRT's track-maintenance trainee staff were lethally run over by an approaching C151 at a signalling box of the station. They were part of a technical team of 15 staff led by a supervisor and were asked to go down to the tracks to investigate an alarm triggered by a possible signalling equipment fault close by Pasir Ris station. The operator said the team had permission to access the tracks, but did not coordinate with a signal unit in the Pasir Ris station control to ensure train captains in the area where the team was exercised caution while pulling into Pasir Ris station. This incident resulted in a 2.5 hour service delay between Tanah Merah and Pasir Ris Stations, affecting at least 10,000 commuters.

While Singaporeans began to notice some issues with the MRT system in terms of overcrowding, the December 2011 disruptions brought the state of public transportation as a whole to national and international prominence. LTA also noted a marked increase in dissatisfaction with public transport with the release of the 2012 Public Transport Customer Satisfaction Survey, and promised government action to deal with issues relating to MRT and LRT disruptions.

The government reviewed the penalties for train disruptions, and made travel free available for all bus services passing MRT stations affected during any train disruptions. Exits were also made free.

To increase satisfaction with the public transport, free morning off-peak travel was introduced while improvements are ongoing.

Despite efforts to step up maintenance efforts, on 7 October 2017, a poorly maintained float and pump system at Bishan station caused a tunnel flood from a torrential rainstorm. It was the worst train disruption since 2011 and the first ever flooding incident in MRT history that lasted almost a day, disrupting services underground. This also resulted in further loss of public confidence and a huge debate among netizens and Singaporeans about the “high rankings” that manage the system, with calls being made for the resignation of Transport Minister <a href="Khaw%20Boon%20Wan">Khaw Boon Wan</a>. Urban transport expert Dr Park Byung Joon has said that the negligence displayed by SMRT in this regard is tantamount to a criminal offence, after an internal investigation found that the maintenance crew of the Bishan Station's pump system had submitted maintenance records for nearly a year without actually carrying out the works.

Security concerns related to crime and terrorism were not high on the agenda of the system's planners at its inception. After the <a href="11%20March%202004%20Madrid%20train%20bombings">Madrid train bombings in 2004</a> and the <a href="Singapore%20embassies%20attack%20plot">foiled plot to bomb the Yishun MRT station in 2001</a>, the operators deployed private, unarmed guards to patrol station platforms and conduct checks on the belongings of commuters, especially those carrying bulky items.

Recorded announcements are frequently made to remind passengers to report suspicious activity and not to leave their belongings unattended. Digital <a href="Closed-circuit%20television">closed-circuit cameras</a> (CCTVs) have been upgraded with recording-capability at all stations and trains operated by SMRT Corporation. Trash bins and mail boxes have been removed from station platforms and concourse levels to station entrances, to eliminate the risk of <a href="Improvised%20explosive%20device">bombs</a> planted in them. Photography without permission was also banned in all MRT stations since the <a href="11%20March%202004%20Madrid%20train%20bombings">Madrid bombings</a>, but it was not in the official statement in any public transport security reviews.

On 14 April 2005 the <a href="Singapore%20Police%20Force">Singapore Police Force</a> announced plans to step up rail security by establishing a specialised security unit for public transport, the unit today is known as the <a href="Public%20Transport%20Security%20Command">Public Transport Security Command</a> or more commonly known as TRANSCOM. These armed officers began overt patrols on the MRT and LRT systems on 15 August 2005, conducting random patrols in pairs in and around rail stations and within trains. They are trained and authorised to use their firearms at their discretion, including deadly force if deemed necessary. On 8 January 2006, a major civil exercise involving over 2,000 personnel from 22 government agencies, codenamed <a href="Exercise%20Northstar%20V">Exercise Northstar V</a>, simulating bombing and chemical attacks at Dhoby Ghaut, Toa Payoh, Raffles Place and Marina Bay MRT stations was conducted. Thirteen stations were closed and about 3,400 commuters were affected during the three-hour exercise.

Security concerns were brought up by the public when two incidents of <a href="vandalism">vandalism</a> at train depots occurred within two years. In both incidents, <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a> on the affected trains was discovered after they entered revenue service.
The first incident, on 17 May 2010, involved a breach in the perimeter fence of <a href="Changi%20Depot">Changi Depot</a> and resulted in the imprisonment and <a href="Caning%20in%20Singapore">caning</a> of a Swiss citizen, and an Interpol arrest warrant for his accomplice. The train involved was set 047/048, a <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries%20C151">C151</a> train. SMRT Corporation received a S$50,000 fine by the Land Transport Authority for the first security breach. Measures were put in place by the Public Transport Security Committee to enhance depot security in light of the first incident, but works were yet to be completed by SMRT Corporation when the second incident, on 17 August 2011, occurred at Bishan Depot.

On 22 November 2012, the <a href="Land%20Transport%20Authority">Land Transport Authority</a> carried out a ground deployment exercise with <a href="SMRT%20Corporation">SMRT</a> to test their incident management plans in the event of a train service disruption. In total, about 135 personnel including representatives from the <a href="Singapore%20Police%20Force">Singapore Police Force</a>'s <a href="Public%20Transport%20Security%20Command">Transport Command</a> (TransCom) and <a href="SBS%20Transit">SBS Transit</a> participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise. Codenamed 'Exercise Greyhound', the exercise went through the scenario of a broken rail on the <a href="East%20West%20MRT%20line">East West line</a> at <a href="Buona%20Vista%20MRT%20station">Buona Vista</a>. SMRT had also activated their Rail Incident Management Plan.

On 22 August 2013, ‘Exercise Greyhound 2013’ was carried out by the Land Transport Authority with SBS Transit to validate the procedures of SBST’s Operations Control Centre (OCC) and the workability of its contingency plans for bus bridging, free bus service and deployment of <a href="Goodwill%20Ambassadors">Goodwill Ambassadors</a> (GAs) during a simulated prolonged train service disruption. About 300 personnel including representatives from LTA, SBST, SMRT, the Singapore Police Force’s Transport Command (TransCom), Traffic Police and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) participated in the exercise. Train service continued as per normal and commuters were not affected by the exercise.

Biddenden Maids

Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst (or Chalkhurst), commonly known as the Biddenden Maids, were a pair of <a href="conjoined%20twins">conjoined twins</a> supposedly born in <a href="Biddenden">Biddenden</a>, Kent, England, in the year 1100. They are said to have been joined at both the shoulder and the hip, and to have lived for 34 years. It is claimed that on their death they bequeathed five plots of land to the village, known as the Bread and Cheese Lands. The income from these lands was used to pay for an annual <a href="%3Awikt%3Adole%23Noun">dole</a> of food and drink to the poor every Easter. Since at least 1775, the dole has included Biddenden cakes, hard <a href="biscuit">biscuit</a>s imprinted with an image of two conjoined women.

Although the annual distribution of food and drink is known to have taken place since at least 1605, no records exist of the story of the sisters prior to 1770. Records of that time say that the names of the sisters were not known, and early drawings of Biddenden cakes do not give names for the sisters; it is not until the early 19th century that the names "Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst" were first used.

<a href="Edward%20Hasted">Edward Hasted</a>, the local historian of Kent, has dismissed the story of the Biddenden Maids as a folk myth, claiming that the image on the cake had originally represented two poor women and that the story of the conjoined twins was "a vulgar tradition" invented to account for it, while influential historian <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28publisher%20born%201802%29">Robert Chambers</a> accepted that the legend could be true but believed it unlikely. Throughout most of the 19th century little research was carried out into the origins of the legend. Despite the doubts among historians, in the 19th century the legend became increasingly popular and the village of Biddenden was thronged with rowdy visitors every Easter. In the late 19th century historians investigated the origins of the legend. It was suggested that the twins had genuinely existed but had been joined at the hip only rather than at both the hip and shoulder, and that they had lived in the 16th rather than the 12th century.

In 1907, the Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, and the resulting income allowed the annual dole to expand considerably, providing the widows and pensioners of Biddenden with cheese, bread and tea at Easter and with cash payments at Christmas. Biddenden cakes continue to be given to the poor of Biddenden each Easter, and are sold as souvenirs to visitors.

According to tradition Mary and Eliza Chulkhurst, or Chalkhurst, were born to relatively wealthy parents in <a href="Biddenden">Biddenden</a>, Kent, in the year 1100. The pair were said to be <a href="Conjoined%20twins">conjoined</a> at both the shoulder and the hip. They grew up conjoined, and are said to have "had frequent quarrels, which sometimes terminated in blows". At the age of 34, Mary Chulkhurst died suddenly. Doctors proposed to separate the still-living Eliza from her sister's body but she refused, saying "as we came together we will also go together", and died six hours afterwards. In their wills, the sisters left five pieces of land in the Biddenden area comprising around in total to the local church, with the income from these lands (claimed to have been 6 <a href="guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> per annum at the time of their death) to provide an annual dole of bread, cheese and beer to the poor every Easter. Henceforward, the lands were to be known as the Bread and Cheese Lands.

The churchwardens of Biddenden continued to maintain the annual dole from the Bread and Cheese Lands. It is recorded that in 1605, the custom that "on that day [Easter] our parson giveth unto the parishoners bread, cheese, cakes and <a href="%3Awikt%3Adiverse">divers</a> barrels of beer, brought in there and drawn" was suspended on account of a visit from <a href="Charles%20Fotherby">Charles Fotherby</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20Archdeacons%20of%20Canterbury">Archdeacon of Canterbury</a>, owing to previous ceremonies having caused "much disorder by reason of some unruly ones, which at such time we cannot restrain with any ease". In 1645, <a href="Rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> William Horner claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were <a href="glebe">glebe</a> (land intended for the use of the parish priest), and attempted to take control of the lands. The case of the Bread and Cheese Lands was brought before the <a href="Committee%20for%20Plundered%20Ministers">Committee for Plundered Ministers</a>, who eventually found in favour of the charity in 1649. Horner brought the case before the <a href="Court%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Court of the Exchequer</a> in 1656 but again without success, and the charity continued to own the lands and to operate the annual Easter dole. Witness statements from these cases mention that the lands had been given by two women "who grew together in their bodies", but do not give any name for the women.

In 1681 the "disorder and indecency" of the annual dole led to the threat of intervention by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. The distribution of the dole ceased to be conducted inside the church; it was moved to the church porch.

By 1770, it is recorded that the annual dole took place immediately after the afternoon Easter service. The annual income from the Bread and Cheese Lands had risen to 20 guineas (about £ in 2019), and a huge quantity of food was distributed each year. By this time as well as the dole of bread, cheese and beer, hard bread rolls known as "Biddenden cakes", moulded into an image of the sisters, were thrown to crowds from the church roof. The Biddenden cakes were flat, hard and made of flour and water, and were described as "not by any means tempting"; one writer in 1860 described one as "a biscuit plaque".

Although it is known that the charity had been in operation as early as 1656, an anonymous article in "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>" in August 1770 is the earliest recorded account of the legend of the Biddenden Maids. This account states that the twins were joined at the hip only, rather than at both the hip and the shoulder, and that they lived to a relatively old age. The article explicitly states that their names were not recorded, and that they were known only as the "Maids of Biddenden". The anonymous author recounts the story of their bequest of the lands to the parish to support the annual dole, and goes on to say that despite the antiquity of the events described, he has no doubt as to their authenticity. As with all accounts of the tradition prior to 1790 the author does not mention their alleged birth in 1100, or the name of Chulkhurst; these details first appeared in a <a href="Street%20literature">broadside</a> published in 1790. "<a href="The%20Antiquarian%20Repertory">The Antiquarian Repertory</a>" of 1775 says that the sisters had lived "as tradition says, two hundred and fifty years ago". Drawings of Biddenden cakes from this period show that they featured an image of two women, possibly conjoined, but no names, dates or ages.

Historian <a href="Edward%20Hasted">Edward Hasted</a>, in the third volume of "The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent" published in 1798, dismissed the legend of the Biddenden Maids. He claimed that the Bread and Cheese Lands were the gift of two women named Preston (although he elsewhere described the lands as having been "given by persons unknown"). Hasted stated that the Biddenden cakes had only begun to be moulded with the imprint of two women in the last 50 years (i.e. since 1748) and that the figures were intended to represent "two poor widows, as the general objects of a charitable benefaction". While he mentioned a legend that the figures represent two conjoined twins who died in their 20s and bequeathed the Bread and Cheese Lands to the parish, he dismissed it as "a vulgar tradition".

Hasted's arguments were largely accepted by influential historian <a href="Robert%20Chambers%20%28journalist%29">Robert Chambers</a>, and the story was generally treated as a folk myth. A letter to the "<a href="British%20Medical%20Journal">British Medical Journal</a>" in 1869 pointed out that surnames were not in use in Kent in the 12th century, and that in older styles of English handwriting the 1 and 5 characters could easily be confused, and suggested a correct birthdate of 1500. The Biddenden Maids were occasionally mentioned in pieces on conjoined twins, particularly after <a href="Chang%20and%20Eng%20Bunker">Chang and Eng Bunker</a> proved that conjoined twins could live to an advanced age and lead relatively normal lives. "<a href="Notes%20and%20Queries">Notes and Queries</a>" magazine called in 1866 for a close examination of Biddenden documents, the editors describing Hasted's conclusions as "very obscure and unsatisfactory" and questioning why the names "Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst" should have been added to the design of cakes granted by a family named Preston, but no significant research into the tradition was carried out.

As the annual dole grew larger the Easter distribution became increasingly popular. In 1808 a broadside featuring a woodcut of the twins and a brief history of their alleged story was sold outside the church at Easter, the first recorded mention of the names "Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst", and clay replicas of Biddenden cakes were sold as souvenirs.

In the 1820s, a new account of the Biddenden Maids was published, which claimed that a gravestone marked with a diagonal line near the rector's pew in Biddenden church was the sisters' burial place. In 1830 it was noted that Biddenden was becoming thronged by visitors every Easter, "attracted from the adjacent towns and villages by the usage, and the wonderful account of its origin, and the day is spent in rude festivity". The large crowds were increasingly disorderly, and churchwardens on occasion had to use their staffs to hold back the mob. As a result, the distribution of the dole was moved from the church to the <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>, but the crowds continued to cause problems. In 1882 Biddenden's rector applied for authority to abandon the ceremony; the Archbishop of Canterbury permitted the distribution of bread, cheese and Biddenden cakes to continue, but abolished the free beer in an effort to combat the problem of unruly crowds.

In 1900, <a href="antiquarian">antiquarian</a> <a href="George%20Clinch">George Clinch</a> investigated the Biddenden Maids in detail. Examining the costumes of the figures on the Biddenden cake moulds, he concluded that the style of dress depicted dated from the reign of <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary I</a> (1553–1558), a date roughly consistent with the "two hundred and fifty years ago" reported in 1775, and concluded that the tradition had originated in the 16th century. He suggested that the "1100" date on Biddenden cakes had originally read "1500", and explained the absence of names on prints of 18th century Biddenden cakes as an engraving error. It is likely that the cake moulds examined by Clinch were not the original moulds, as the designs Clinch examined are strikingly different to the earliest surviving drawings of Biddenden cakes, published in 1775. Writing in the early 1930s, <a href="William%20Coles%20Finch">William Coles Finch</a> explains the confusion over the dates, saying "the old-fashioned numeral five is so frequently taken as a one". He lamented the quality of the Biddenden cake then being produced, compared to that of former years. Coles Finch stated that the villagers considered the then-current cake to be <a href="unleavened%20bread">unleavened bread</a>.

In almost all drawings and Biddenden cake designs, the twins are shown as conjoined at both the hip and the shoulder. Although such a fusion is theoretically possible, in that twins fused at one point may form a secondary fusion elsewhere, no case of a <a href="Viability%20%28fetal%29">viable</a> double fusion has ever been documented.

Clinch believed that the evidence pointed to the twins having existed but that they had lived in the 16th century, rather than the early 12th century as generally claimed. They are not, however, mentioned in any journals or books from the period. This points against their having lived in the 16th century; the case of <a href="Lazarus%20and%20Joannes%20Baptista%20Colloredo">Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo</a> (1617 – after 1646) had prompted great interest in conjoined twins, and conjoined sisters surviving to adulthood in south-east England would have been widely noted.

In 1895, surgeon J. W. Ballantyne considered the case of the Biddenden Maids from a <a href="teratology">teratological</a> perspective. He suggested that they had in fact been <a href="pygopagus">pygopagus</a> (twins joined at the pelvis). Pygopagus twins are known to put their arms around each other's shoulders when walking, and Ballantyne suggested that this accounted for their apparently being joined at the shoulders in drawings. The pygopagus <a href="Millie%20and%20Christine%20McCoy">Millie and Christine McCoy</a> had lived in Britain for a short time before going on to a successful singing career in the United States, and it was known from their case that such twins were capable of surviving to adulthood.

<a href="Jan%20Bondeson">Jan Bondeson</a> (1992 and 2006) proposed that, while the names "Eliza and Mary Chulkhurst" are not recorded in any early documents and are likely to have been a later addition, the existence of the twins and the claimed 1100 year of birth cannot be dismissed. Although mediaeval chronicles are unreliable, he noted multiple reports in the <a href="Chronicon%20Scotorum">Chronicon Scotorum</a>, the <a href="Annals%20of%20the%20Four%20Masters">Annals of the Four Masters</a> and the <a href="Annals%20of%20Clonmacnoise">Annals of Clonmacnoise</a> of a pair of conjoined sisters born in or around 1100, although all three are records of Irish history and none mention Kent as the location. He concluded that the case of Christine McCoy, who survived for eight hours following the death of her polypagus twin Millie, shows that the claimed six hours between the deaths of the Biddenden Maids is plausible, and agreed with Ballantyne's proposal that the idea that the twins were joined at the shoulder is a later misinterpretation of the figures on the Biddenden cake. He also pointed out that although there is no recorded version of the legend prior to 1770, there would have been no possible motive for the villagers of the eighteenth century to fabricate the story.

In 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated with other local charities with similar purposes, to form the Biddenden Consolidated Charity, still functioning as a registered charity. The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribute Biddenden cakes. (During the <a href="Rationing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">food rationing</a> of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.) A <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> <a href="village%20sign">village sign</a> showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village green in the 1920s.

The tradition of the dole continues to the present, and every <a href="Easter%20Monday">Easter Monday</a> tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners through the windows of Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.

Flag of Armenia

The <a href="national%20flag">national</a> flag of <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a>, the Armenian Tricolour, consists of three horizontal bands of equal width, <a href="red">red</a> on the top, <a href="blue">blue</a> in the middle, and <a href="orange%20%28colour%29">orange</a> (also described as "<a href="apricot%20%28color%29">colour of apricot</a>") on the bottom. The Armenian <a href="Supreme%20Soviet">Supreme Soviet</a> adopted the current <a href="flag">flag</a> on 24 August 1990. On 15 June 2006, the Law on the National Flag of Armenia, governing its usage, was passed by the <a href="Azgayin%20Zhoghov">National Assembly of Armenia</a>.

Throughout history, there have been many variations of the Armenian flag. In ancient times, Armenian dynasties were represented by different symbolic animals displayed on their flags. In the twentieth century, various <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> flags represented the <a href="Armenian%20SSR">Armenian SSR</a>.

The meanings of the colors are interpreted in many different ways. For example, red stands for the blood of the 1.5 million Armenians killed in the <a href="Armenian%20Genocide">Armenian Genocide</a>, blue is for the Armenian pure sky, and orange represents the country's courage.

The official definition of the colors, as stated in the Constitution of the Republic of Armenia, is:

In 2012, the Armenian National Institute of Standards (SARM) issued specifications about the construction and colors on the national flag.:

Today's <a href="tricolour%20%28flag%29">tricolor</a> flag bears little resemblance to the earliest Armenian 'flags'. In ancient times, armies went into battle behind carvings mounted on poles. The carvings might represent a dragon, an eagle, a lion or "some mysterious object of the gods". With the advent of Christianity, the Armenian empire adopted many different flags representing various dynasties. The <a href="Artaxiad%20Dynasty">Artaxiad Dynasty</a>'s flag, for instance, consisted of a red cloth displaying two eagles gazing at each other, separated by a flower.

After Armenia was split between the <a href="Persian%20Empire">Persian</a> and the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>s, the idea of an Armenian flag ceased to exist for some time. The <a href="Armenian%20Catholic%20Church">Armenian Catholic</a> <a href="priest">priest</a> Father <a href="Ghevont%20Alishan">Ghevont Alishan</a> created a new flag for Armenia in 1885, after the <a href="Armenian%20Students%20Association%20of%20Paris">Armenian Students Association of Paris</a> requested one for the funeral of the French writer <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>. Alishan's first design was very similar to today's Armenian flag: a horizontal tricolor. However, it looked more like an upside-down variation of the current <a href="flag%20of%20Bulgaria">flag of Bulgaria</a>. The top band was red, symbolizing the first Sunday of Easter (called "Red" Sunday), followed by a green band to represent the "Green" Sunday of Easter, and finally an arbitrary color, white, was chosen to complete the combination. While in <a href="France">France</a>, Alishan also designed a second flag, identified today as the "Nationalist Armenian Flag". It too was a tricolor, but unlike the previous design, this one was a vertical tricolor similar to the <a href="Flag%20of%20France">French flag</a>. Its colors were red, green, and blue, from left to right, representing the rainbow that <a href="Noah">Noah</a> saw after landing on <a href="Mount%20Ararat">Mount Ararat</a>.

In 1828, <a href="Armenians%20in%20the%20Persianate">Persian Armenia</a> was annexed to the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> after the last <a href="Russo-Persian%20War%20%281826-1828%29">Russo-Persian War</a>, and became known as <a href="Russian%20Armenia">Russian Armenia</a>. When the Russian Empire collapsed, Russian Armenia declared its independence and joined the short-lived <a href="Transcaucasian%20Democratic%20Federative%20Republic">Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic</a>, together with <a href="Georgia%20%28country%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>. This unified state hardly lasted a year and was soon dissolved. Since the Republic was short-lived, it did not use any flags or symbols. Nevertheless, some historians consider a horizontal gold, black, and red tricolor, similar to that of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Germany">German flag</a> but arranged differently, to have been the flag of Transcaucasia. The federation was dissolved on May 26, 1918, when Georgia declared its independence as the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Georgia">Democratic Republic of Georgia</a>. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan declared their independence two days later, on May 28, 1918, as the <a href="First%20Republic%20of%20Armenia">First Republic of Armenia</a> and the <a href="Azerbaijan%20Democratic%20Republic">Azerbaijan Democratic Republic</a>, respectively.

After gaining independence, the First Republic of Armenia adopted the modern Armenian tricolor. Upon <a href="Stepan%20Malkhasyants">Stepan Malkhasyants</a>'s appearance in the Armenian National Council, the independent Armenian government selected the colors used during the <a href="House%20of%20Lusignan">Lusignan</a> period: red, blue and yellow. An earlier prototype, which was eventually rejected, was the rainbow flag. This prototype can be seen at the Martiros Saryan House Museum in Yerevan, Armenia. They chose to replace the yellow with orange "because it merged better with the other two colors, presenting a more pleasing composition". The flag of independent Armenia then had a ratio of 2:3, but on August 24, 1990, when the Armenian Supreme Soviet adopted it as the flag of the Republic of Armenia, the ratio was changed to 1:2.

On November 29, 1920 <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s established the <a href="Armenian%20SSR">Armenian SSR</a>. A new flag was introduced and fixed in the Constitution, accepted on February 2, 1922 by the First <a href="Congress%20of%20Soviets">Congress of Soviets</a> of the Armenian SSR. That flag existed only for a month, because on March 12 the Armenian SSR united with the <a href="Georgian%20SSR">Georgian SSR</a> and the <a href="Azerbaijan%20SSR">Azerbaijan SSR</a> under the <a href="Transcaucasian%20SFSR">Transcaucasian SFSR</a> (TSFSR). On December 30, 1922 the Transcaucasian SFSR became one of the four Soviet republics that united to form the <a href="USSR">USSR</a>. The flag of the republic had a <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a> inserted into a star with initials "ЗСФСР" (ZSFSR) written in Russian sans-serif script. These letters stand for "Закавказская Советская Федеративная Социалистическая Республика" ("Zakavkazskaya Sovetskaya Federativnaya Socialisticheskaya Respublika", "Transcaucasian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic"). In 1936, the TSFSR was broken up into its three constituent regions, which were named the Georgian SSR, the Armenian SSR, and the Azerbaijan SSR.

As a <a href="Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">republic of the USSR</a>, the Armenian SSR introduced its first flag in 1936. Very similar to the <a href="flag%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">flag of the Soviet Union</a>, it was red and featured a yellow <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a> in the corner. Underneath that, there were "H-Kh-S-H" initials written in Armenian serif script. These initials, in the <a href="Western%20Armenian%20language">Western Armenian language</a>, stand for "Haygagan Khorhurtayin Sodzialistakan Hanrabedutyun", or the "Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic". In the 1940s, the flag was altered to use the <a href="Eastern%20Armenian%20language">Eastern Armenian language</a> spoken in the Republic. The initials were changed to "H-S-S-R" meaning "Hayastani Sovetakan Sotsialistikakan Respublika" in the Eastern Armenian pronunciation. In 1952, a new flag was introduced. The initials were removed completely and in their place a horizontal blue stripe was added.

In late May 1988, amid rising nationalist tensions from "<a href="glasnost">glasnost</a>" and "<a href="perestroika">perestroika</a>", Armenia's new Communist party leader allowed the banned tricolour of the DRA to fly in <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a> for the first time in over sixty years. A year later, following a <a href="Nagorno-Karabakh">Nagorno-Karabakh</a>-themed mass demonstration where the tricolour was flown, he urged its official recognition. This came on August 24, 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic's sovereignty and renamed the country the Republic of Armenia. At that point, just over a year before Armenia declared its formal independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.

The 2006 law on the National Flag of Armenia states that the flag has to be raised on the following public buildings:

The law requires the lowering of the flag to the midpoint of the flagpole on the days of mourning or during mourning ceremonies. A black ribbon needs to be placed at the top of the flag; the length of the ribbon should be equal to the length of the flag. The flying flag has to be raised in its entirety, clean, and unfaded; moreover, the lower part of the flag should be at least 2.5 m off the ground.

The day of the National Flag of Armenia is marked on 15 June every year. The day is chosen for the reason that the Armenian law on the National Flag of Armenia was passed on 15 June 2006. The day of the Armenian tricolour was celebrated for the first time on 15 June 2010 in <a href="Yerevan">Yerevan</a>.

The daily display of the Armenian flag is encouraged, but legally required only on the following days:


The national flag is also mentioned in the song "<a href="Mer%20Hayrenik">Mer Hayrenik</a>" (Our Fatherland), the <a href="national%20anthem">national anthem</a> of Armenia. Specifically, the second and third stanzas sing about the creation of the national flag:

On June 2, 1992, the self-proclaimed <a href="Republic%20of%20Artsakh">Republic of Artsakh</a>, a "<a href="de%20facto">de facto</a>" <a href="independence">independent</a> <a href="republic">republic</a> in <a href="South%20Caucasus">South Caucasus</a> claimed by <a href="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, adopted a <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Artsakh">flag</a> derived from the flag of Armenia, with only a white pattern added. A white, five-toothed, stepped carpet pattern was added to the flag, beginning at the two verges of the cloth's right side and connecting at a point equal to one-third of the distance from that side. The white pattern symbolizes the current separation of <a href="Republic%20of%20Artsakh">Artsakh</a> from Armenia proper and its aspiration for eventual union with "the Fatherland". This symbolises the <a href="Armenians">Armenian</a> heritage, culture and population of the area and represents Artsakh as being a <a href="exclave">separated region</a> of Armenia by the triangular shape and the zigzag cutting through the flag. The pattern is also similar to the designs used on rugs. The ratio of the flag's breadth to its length is 1:2, same as the Armenian Tricolor.

In addition to the flag of Artsakh, the Armenian flag colors influenced the design of the <a href="Pan-Armenian%20Games">Pan-Armenian Games</a> flag. In the center of the light blue flag are six interlocking rings, derived from the <a href="Olympic%20rings">Olympic rings</a>. The sixth, orange-colored ring, interlocks with the blue and red rings, which symbolize Armenia. Above the rings is a flame in the colors of the Armenian flag.

Flag of Belarus

The <a href="national%20flag">national</a> flag of <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> (, "Sciah Biełarusi"; , "Flag Belorussii") is a red and green flag with a white and red ornament pattern placed at the staff (hoist) end. The current design was introduced in 2012 by the State Committee for Standardization of the Republic of Belarus, and is adapted from a design approved in a <a href="referendum">referendum</a> in May 1995. It is a modification of the <a href="flag%20of%20the%20Byelorussian%20SSR">1951 flag</a> used while the country was a republic of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Changes made to the Soviet-era flag were the removal of symbols of communism (the <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a> and the red star) and the reversal of the colors of the ornament pattern, from white-on-red to red-on-white. Since the 1995 referendum, several flags used by Belarusian government officials and agencies have been modeled on this national flag.

This design replaced the historical <a href="Flag%20of%20Belarus%23White-red-white%20flag">white-red-white flag</a> used by the <a href="Belarusian%20People%27s%20Republic">Belarusian People's Republic</a> of 1918, before <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a> became a <a href="Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet Republic</a>, and again after it regained its independence in 1991. Opposition groups have continued to use this flag, though its display in Belarus has been restricted by the government of Belarus, which claims it was linked with <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> collaboration during the Second World War. The white-red-white flag is used in protests against the government and by the <a href="Belarusian%20diaspora">Belarusian diaspora</a>.

The basic design of the national flag of Belarus was first described in Presidential Decree No.214 of June 7, 1995. The flag is a rectangular cloth consisting of two horizontal stripes: a red upper stripe covering two-thirds of the flag's height, and green lower stripe covering one-third. A vertical red-on-white Belarusian decorative pattern, which occupies one-ninth of the flag's length, is placed against the flagstaff. The flag's ratio of width to length is 1:2.

The flag does not differ significantly from the flag of the Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a> and the red star, and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern. While there is no official interpretation for the colors of the flag, an explanation given by President <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> is that red represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation's forefathers, while green represents life.

In addition to the 1995 decree, "STB 911–2008: National Flag of the Republic of Belarus" was published by the State Committee for Standardization of the Republic of Belarus in 2008. It gives the technical specifications of the national flag, such as the details of the colors and the ornament pattern. The red ornament design on the national flag was, until 2012, the width of the flag, and with the white margin. As of 2012, the red pattern has occupied the whole of the white margin (which stayed at ).

The colors of the national flag are regulated in "STB 911–2008: National Flag of the Republic of Belarus" and are listed in the CIE <a href="Standard%20illuminant">Standard illuminant</a> D65.

A decorative pattern, designed in 1917 by Matrona Markevich, is displayed on the hoist of the flag (as it was previously, on the 1951 flag). The pattern, derived from local plants and flowers, is a traditional type commonly used in Belarus. These patterns are sometimes used in woven garments, most importantly in the traditional "<a href="ruchnik">ruchnik</a>", a woven cloth used for ceremonial events like religious services, funerals, and other more mundane social functions, such as a host offering guests <a href="bread%20and%20salt">bread and salt</a> served on a rushnyk.

The husband of Matrona Markevich was arrested for anti-Soviet propaganda and executed during <a href="Soviet%20repression%20in%20Belarus">Soviet repression in Belarus</a> in 1937, after which the family was <a href="Dekulakization">dekulakized</a>. The original "ruchnik" has not survived and was either confiscated by the NKVD in 1937 or destroyed during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The brother of Matrona Markevich, Mikhail Katsar, head of the ethnography and folklore department at the <a href="Academy%20of%20Sciences%20of%20Belarus">Academy of Sciences of Belarus</a>, was included into the commission that was ordered to create a new flag for the Belarusian SSR in 1951.

A monument to Matrona Markevich was erected in <a href="Sianno">Sianno</a> in 2015.

By law, the Belarusian flag should be flown daily, weather permitting, from the following locations:

The Belarusian flag is also officially flown on the sites of special occasions:

Belarusian diplomats and various government officials (such as the President and the Prime Minister) display the flag on vehicles. The law allows for the flag to be used for special occasions, such as memorial services and family holidays, and it can be used by various groups of people, such as public organizations, companies, and <a href="NGO">NGO</a>s. The regulations were issued in the same decree that defined the Belarusian flag. May 15 has been declared the Day of the National Emblem and Flag of Belarus (, ). The national flag itself has been incorporated into the badge of the <a href="Guards%20unit">guard units</a> in the <a href="Armed%20Forces%20of%20Belarus">Belarusian armed forces</a>. The pole should be three times longer than the width of the flag.

According to the 1995 presidential decree, the national flag is to be used on a staff that is colored gold (ochre). Other parts of the protocol specify the finial (the metal ornament on a flag pole) as diamond-shaped and colored in a yellow metal. In this diamond there is a five-pointed star (similar to that used in <a href="emblem%20of%20Belarus">national emblem</a>). The diamond-pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag-traditions.

The flag of the <a href="Byelorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic</a> was adopted by decree on December 25, 1951. The flag was slightly modified in 1956 when construction details were added for the red star, and golden <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a>. The final specifications of the flag was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and are very similar to the current Belarusian flag. The flag had a length-to-width ratio of one to two (1:2), just like the <a href="flag%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">flag of the Soviet Union</a> (and the other fourteen <a href="Republics%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">union republics</a>). The main portion of the flag was red (representing the <a href="October%20Revolution">Revolution</a>), with the rest being green (representing the Belarusian forests). A pattern of white drawn on red decorated the hoist portion of the flag; this design is often used on Belarusian traditional costumes. In the upper corner of the flag, in the red portion, a gold <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a> was added, with a <a href="red%20star">red star</a> outlined in gold above it. The <a href="hammer">hammer</a> represented the worker, and the <a href="sickle">sickle</a> the <a href="peasant">peasant</a>; according to <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> ideology, these two symbols crossed together symbolized co-operation between the two classes. The red star, a symbol commonly used by <a href="Communism">Communist</a> parties, was said to stand either for the five social groups (workers, youth, peasants, military, and academics), the five known continents, or the five fingers of the worker's hand. The hammer, sickle and star were sometimes not displayed on the reverse of the flag. The purpose for this design was that the Byelorussian SSR, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR, were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as founding members and needed distinct flags for each other. The designer of the flag was Milkahil Gusyev.

Before 1951, several different flags had been in use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during the existence of the <a href="Lithuanian%E2%80%93Byelorussian%20Soviet%20Socialist%20Republic">Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR</a>. After the formation of the <a href="Byelorussian%20SSR">Byelorussian SSR</a>, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established with the passage of the first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which did away with the letters.
The design of the flag used between 19 September 1991 and 5 June 1995 had originally been devised by the <a href="Belarusian%20People%27s%20Republic">Belarusian People's Republic</a> (March to December 1918). The original person behind the design of the flag is believed to have been <a href="Klaudzi%20Duzh-Dusheuski">Klaudzi Duzh-Dusheuski</a> before 1917 and this design is known in Belarusian as the "" (; literally "white-red-white flag"). Red and white have traditionally been used in state heraldry of the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> and the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>. The colours are also based on those of the coat of arms <a href="Pahonia">Pahonia</a> that was a traditional coat of arms of Belarusian lands and had a white horseman on a red background. There are several other theories explaining the flag's origin. One theory speaks of an allusion to the name of the country: <a href="White%20Ruthenia">White Ruthenia</a>.

Between 1921 and 1939 the white-red-white flag was used by the Belarusian national movement in <a href="West%20Belarus">West Belarus</a> (part of the <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Second Polish Republic</a>), both by political organizations like the <a href="Belarusian%20Peasants%27%20and%20Workers%27%20Union">Belarusian Peasants' and Workers' Union</a> or the <a href="Belarusian%20Christian%20Democracy">Belarusian Christian Democracy</a>, and non-political organizations like the <a href="Belarusian%20Schools%20Society">Belarusian Schools Society</a>. The flag was also used by the Belarusian Special Battalion in the army of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Lithuania">Republic of Lithuania</a>. After the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a> and the annexation of modern-day <a href="West%20Belarus">West Belarus</a> in 1939 the flag was forbidden by the Soviet administration in the newly acquired territories as well.
In 1941 the flag was allowed for usage by the Nazi occupation administration, and it appeared on arm patches of Belarusian volunteers in the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a> and <a href="Waffen%20SS">Waffen SS</a> and was used by the <a href="Belarusian%20Central%20Rada">Belarusian Central Rada</a>, the pro-German government of Belarus in 1943–1944. After the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> the flag was used by <a href="Belarusian%20diaspora">Belarusian diaspora</a> in the West and by small groups of anti-Soviet resistance in Belarus itself. In late 1980s the flag was again used as a symbol of <a href="Romantic%20nationalism">national revival</a> and democratic changes in Belarus. By proposal of the <a href="Belarusian%20Popular%20Front">Belarusian Popular Front</a> the flag became state symbol of Belarus upon its regaining of independence in 1991.

After 1995 the white-red-white flag is used as a symbol of the opposition to the regime of <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a>, most notably at the protests after the <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">2006</a> and <a href="Belarusian%20presidential%20election%2C%202010">2010 presidential elections</a> and at mass rallies on <a href="Freedom%20Day%20%28Belarus%29">Freedom Day</a> celebrations as well as <a href="Dziady">Dziady</a> memorial marches. The flag is not officially banned from public usage, but is treated by the authorities as an "unregistered symbol" which means that demonstration of it by political activists or sports fans can lead to arrests and confiscation of the flags. In early 2010, the political activist <a href="Siarhei%20Kavalenka">Siarhei Kavalenka</a> was arrested for placing the white-red-white flag atop a Christmas tree on the central square of <a href="Vitsebsk">Vitsebsk</a>. The court gave Kavalenka three years of suspended sentence which was followed by a second arrest and Kavalenka's several weeks long hunger strike. The hunger strike was interrupted by force-feeding on 16 January 2012.

The referendum that was held to adopt the <a href="National%20symbol">state symbols</a> took place on May 14, 1995. With a voter turnout of 64.7%, the new flag was approved by a majority in the ratio of three to one (75.1% to 24.9%). The other three questions were also passed by the voters. The way of carrying out the referendum as well as the legality of questioning the national symbols on a referendum was heavily criticized by the opposition. Opposition parties claimed that only 48.7% of the entire voting population (75.1% of the 64.7% who showed at the polling stations) supported the adoption of the new flag, but Belarusian law (as in many other countries) states that only a majority of voters is needed to decide on a referendum issue. Upon the results going in favor of <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">President Lukashenko</a>, he proclaimed that the return of the Soviet-style flag brought a sense of youth and pleasant memories to the nation.
Lukashenko had tried to hold a similar referendum before, in 1993, but failed to get parliamentary support. Two months before the May 1995 referendum, Lukashenko proposed a flag design that consisted of two small bars of green and one wide bar of red. While it is not known what became of this suggestion, new designs (called "projects" in Belarus) were suggested a few days later, which were then put up to vote in the 1995 referendum.

Since the introduction of the 1995 flag, several other flags adopted by government agencies or bodies have been modeled on it.

The presidential standard, which has been in use since 1997, was adopted by a decree called "Concerning the Standard of the President of Republic of Belarus". The standard's design is an exact copy of the national flag, with the addition of the <a href="National%20emblem%20of%20Belarus">Belarusian national emblem</a> in gold and red. The standard's ratio of 5:6 differs from that of the national flag, making the standard almost square. It is used at buildings and on vehicles to denote the presence of the president.

In 2001, President Lukashenko issued a decree granting a flag to the Armed Forces of Belarus. The flag, which has a ratio of 1:1.7, has the national ornamental pattern along the length of the hoist side of the flag. On the front of the flag is the Belarusian coat of arms, with the wording УЗБРОЕНЫЯ СІЛЫ ("Armed Forces") arched over it, and РЭСПУБЛІКІ БЕЛАРУСЬ ("of Republic of Belarus") written below; the text of both is in gold. On the reverse of the flag, the center contains the symbol of the armed forces, which is a red star surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel. Above the symbol is the phrase ЗА НАШУ РАДЗІМУ ("For our Motherland"), while below is the full name of the military unit.

Stuyvesant High School

Stuyvesant High School (pronounced ) commonly referred to as Stuy (pronounced ) is a <a href="Specialized%20high%20schools%20in%20New%20York%20City">specialized high school</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, United States. Operated by the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Education">New York City Department of Education</a>, these specialized schools offer <a href="Tuition%20payments">tuition</a>-free accelerated academics to city residents. Stuyvesant is a <a href="university-preparatory%20school">college-preparatory</a> high school.

Stuyvesant was established as an all-boys school in the <a href="East%20Village%2C%20Manhattan">East Village</a> in 1904. An entrance examination was mandated for all applicants starting in 1934, and the school started accepting female students in 1969. Stuyvesant moved to its current location at Battery Park City in 1992 because the school had become too large. The old building now houses several high schools.

Admission to Stuyvesant involves passing the <a href="Specialized%20High%20Schools%20Admissions%20Test">Specialized High Schools Admissions Test</a>. Each November, the 900 to 950 applicants with the highest exam scores out of around 30,000 eighth- and ninth-graders are accepted to Stuyvesant. The school has a wide range of extracurricular activities, including a theater competition called <a href="SING%21">SING!</a> and two student publications. <a href="List%20of%20Stuyvesant%20High%20School%20people">Notable alumni</a> include physicists <a href="Brian%20Greene">Brian Greene</a> and <a href="Lisa%20Randall">Lisa Randall</a>, mathematician <a href="Paul%20Cohen%20%28mathematician%29">Paul Cohen</a>, and genome researcher <a href="Eric%20Lander">Eric Lander</a>.

New York City's Superintendent of Schools, <a href="William%20Henry%20Maxwell">William Henry Maxwell</a>, had first written about the need to construct <a href="Vocational%20education">manual trade school</a>s in New York City in 1887. At the time, <a href="C.%20B.%20J.%20Snyder">C. B. J. Snyder</a> was designing many of the city's public school buildings using multiple architectural styles. The first trade school in the city was <a href="John%20Jay%20Educational%20Campus%20%28Brooklyn%29">Manual Training High School</a> in Brooklyn, which opened in 1893. By 1899, Maxwell was advocating for a manual trade school in Manhattan.

In January 1903, Maxwell and Snyder submitted a report to the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Board%20of%20Education">New York City Board of Education</a> in which they suggested the creation of a trade school in Manhattan. The Board of Education approved the plans in April 1904. They suggested that the school occupy a plot on East 15th Street, west of First Avenue, but that plot did not yet contain a school building, and so the new trade school was initially housed within P.S. 47's former building at 225 East <a href="23rd%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">23rd Street</a>. The Board of Education also wrote that the new trade school would be "designated as the Stuyvesant High School, as being reminiscent of the locality." <a href="Stuyvesant%20Square">Stuyvesant Square</a>, <a href="Stuyvesant%20Street">Stuyvesant Street</a>, and later <a href="Stuyvesant%20Town%E2%80%93Peter%20Cooper%20Village">Stuyvesant Town</a> (which was built in 1947) are all located near the proposed 15th Street school building. All of these locations were named after <a href="Peter%20Stuyvesant">Peter Stuyvesant</a>, the last <a href="Dutch%20Empire">Dutch</a> governor of <a href="New%20Netherland">New Netherland</a>. The appellation was selected in order to avoid confusion with Brooklyn's manual Training High School, Stuyvesant High School opened in September 1904 as Manhattan's first manual trade school for boys. At the time of its opening, the school consisted of 155 students and 12 teachers.

At first, the school provided a core curriculum of "English, Latin, modern languages, history, mathematics, physics, chemistry, [and] music", as well as a physical education program and a more specialized track of "woodworking, metalworking, mechanical drawing, [and] freehand drawing". However, in June 1908, Maxwell announced that the trade school curriculum would be separated from the core curriculum, and a discrete trade school would operate in the Stuyvesant building during the evening. Thereafter, Stuyvesant became renowned for excellence in math and science. In 1909, eighty percent of the school's alumni went to college, compared to other schools, which only sent 25% to 50% of their graduates to college.

By 1919, officials started restricting admission based on scholastic achievement. Stuyvesant implemented a double session plan in 1919 to accommodate the rising number of students: some students would attend in the morning, while others would take classes in the afternoon and early evening. All students studied a full set of courses. These double sessions ran until 1956. The school implemented a system of entrance examinations in 1934. The examination program, developed with the assistance of <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, was expanded in 1938 to include the newly founded <a href="Bronx%20High%20School%20of%20Science">Bronx High School of Science</a>.

In 1956, a team of six students designed and began construction of a <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a>. A low-power test of the device succeeded six years later. A later attempt at full-power operation, however, knocked out the power to the school and surrounding buildings.

In 1967, <a href="Alice%20de%20Rivera">Alice de Rivera</a> filed a lawsuit against the Board of Education, alleging that she had been banned from taking Stuyvesant's entrance exam because of her gender. The lawsuit was decided in the student's favor, and Stuyvesant was required to accept female students. The first female students were accepted in September 1969, when Stuyvesant offered admission to 14 girls and enrolled 12 of them. The next year, 223 female students were accepted to Stuyvesant. By 2015, the last year that enrollment reports are available, females represented 43% of the total student body.

In 1972, the New York State Legislature passed the Hecht–Calandra Act, which designated <a href="Brooklyn%20Technical%20High%20School">Brooklyn Technical High School</a>, Bronx High School of Science, Stuyvesant High School, and the <a href="High%20School%20of%20Music%20%26amp%3B%20Art">High School of Music & Art</a> (now <a href="Fiorello%20H.%20LaGuardia%20High%20School">Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School</a>) as specialized high schools of New York City. The act called for a uniform exam to be administered for admission to Brooklyn Tech, Bronx Science, and Stuyvesant. The exam, named the <a href="Specialized%20High%20Schools%20Admissions%20Test">Specialized High Schools Admissions Test</a> (SHSAT), tested the mathematical and verbal abilities of students who were applying to any of the specialized high schools. The only exception was for applicants to LaGuardia High School, who were accepted by audition rather than examination.

The current school building is away from <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20site">the site</a> of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%281973%E2%80%932001%29">World Trade Center</a>, which was destroyed in the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001</a>. The school was evacuated during the attack. Although the smoke cloud coming from the World Trade Center engulfed the building at one point, there was no structural damage to the building, and there were no reports of physical injuries. Less than an hour after the collapse of the second World Trade Center tower, concern over a bomb threat at the school prompted an evacuation of the surrounding area, as reported live on the "<a href="Today%20%28U.S.%20TV%20program%29">Today</a>" show. When classes resumed on September 21, 2001, students were moved to Brooklyn Technical High School while the Stuyvesant building served as a base of operations for rescue and recovery workers. This caused serious congestion at Brooklyn Tech, and required the students to attend in two shifts, with the Stuyvesant students attending the evening shift. Normal classes resumed nearly a month after the attack, on October 9.
Because Stuyvesant was so close to the World Trade Center site, there were concerns of <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> exposure. The <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">U.S. EPA</a> indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 class president Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.

Nine alumni were killed in the World Trade Center attack. Another alumnus, <a href="Richard%20Ben-Veniste">Richard Ben-Veniste</a> of the class of 1960, was on the <a href="9/11%20Commission">9/11 Commission</a>. On October 2, 2001, the school newspaper, "The Spectator", created a special 24-page full-color 9/11 insert containing student photos, reflections and stories. On November 20, 2001, the magazine was distributed for free to the greater metropolitan area, enclosed within 830,000 copies of "The New York Times". In the months after the attacks, Annie Thoms, an English teacher at Stuyvesant and the theater adviser at the time, suggested that the students take accounts of staff and students' reactions during and after September 11, 2001, and turn them into a series of monologues. Thoms then published these monologues as "With Their Eyes: September 11—The View from a High School at Ground Zero".

During the 2003–2004 school year, Stuyvesant celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding with a full year of activities. Events included a procession from the 15th Street building to the Chambers Street one, a meeting of the <a href="National%20Consortium%20for%20Specialized%20Secondary%20Schools%20of%20Mathematics%2C%20Science%20and%20Technology">National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology</a>, an all-class reunion, and visits and speeches from notable alumni.

In August 1904, the Board of Education authorized Snyder to design a new facility for Stuyvesant High School at 15th Street. The new school would be shaped like the letter "H" in order to maximize the number of windows on the building. The cornerstone for the new building was laid in September 1905. Approximately $1.5 million was spent on constructing the school, including $600,000 for the exterior alone. In 1907, Stuyvesant moved to the new building on 15th Street. The new building had a capacity of 2,600 students, more than double that of the existing school building at 23rd Street. It contained 25 classrooms devoted to skilled industrial trades such as <a href="joinery%20%28woodworking%29">joinery</a>, as well as 53 regular classrooms and a 1,600-seat auditorium.

During the 1950s, the building underwent a $2 million renovation to update its classrooms, shops, libraries, and cafeterias.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, when New York City public schools in general were marked by violence and low grades among their students, Stuyvesant had a reputation for being a top-notch school. However, the school building was deteriorating due to overuse and lack of maintenance. A "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" report stated that the building had "held out into old age with minimal maintenance and benign neglect until its peeling paint, creaking floorboards and antiquated laboratories became an embarrassment." The five-story building could not cater adequately to the several thousand students, leading the New York City Board of Education to make plans to move the school to a new building in <a href="Battery%20Park%20City">Battery Park City</a>, near <a href="lower%20Manhattan">lower Manhattan</a>'s <a href="Financial%20District%2C%20Manhattan">Financial District</a>.

The 15th Street building remains in use as the "Old Stuyvesant Campus", housing three schools: the Institute for Collaborative Education, the <a href="High%20School%20for%20Health%20Professions%20and%20Human%20Services">High School for Health Professions and Human Services</a>, and P.S. 226. In recent years, keynote graduation speakers have included <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="Eric%20Holder">Eric Holder</a> (2001), former President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> (2002), <a href="Secretary-General%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">United Nations Secretary General</a> <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a> (2004), "Late Night" comedian <a href="Conan%20O%27Brien">Conan O'Brien</a> (2006), the founder of "<a href="Humans%20of%20New%20York">Humans of New York</a>," <a href="Brandon%20Stanton">Brandon Stanton</a> (2015), and astrophysicist <a href="Neil%20deGrasse%20Tyson">Neil deGrasse Tyson</a> (2018).

In 1987, New York City Mayor <a href="Ed%20Koch">Ed Koch</a> and New York State Governor <a href="Mario%20Cuomo">Mario Cuomo</a> jointly announced the construction of a new Stuyvesant High School building in Battery Park City. The <a href="Battery%20Park%20City%20Authority">Battery Park City Authority</a> donated of land for the new building. The authority was not required to hire the lowest bidder, which meant that the construction process could be accelerated in return for a higher cost. The building was designed by the architectural firms of <a href="IBI%20Group">Gruzen Samton Steinglass</a> and <a href="Cooper%2C%20Robertson%20%26amp%3B%20Partners">Cooper, Robertson & Partners</a>. The structure's main architect, <a href="Alex%20Cooper">Alexander Cooper</a> of Cooper, Robertson & Partners, had also designed much of Battery Park City.

Stuyvesant's principal at the time, Abraham Baumel, visited the country's most advanced laboratories to gather ideas about what to include in the new Stuyvesant building's 12 laboratory rooms. The new 10-story building also included banks of escalators, glass-walled studios on the roof, and a four-story northern wing with a swimming pool, five gymnasiums, and an auditorium. Construction began in 1989. When it opened in 1992, the building was New York City's first new high school building in ten years. The new Stuyvesant Campus cost $150 million, making it the most expensive high school building ever built in the city at the time. The library has a capacity of 40,000 volumes and overlooks Battery Park City.

Shortly after the building was completed, the $10-million <a href="Tribeca%20Bridge">Tribeca Bridge</a> was built to allow students to enter the building without having to cross the busy West Street. The building was designed to be fully compliant with the <a href="Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201990">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>, and is listed as such by the New York City Department of Education. As a result, the building is one of the 5 additional sites of P721M, a school for students with multiple <a href="disability">disabilities</a> who are between the ages of 15 and 21.

In 1997, the eastern end of the mathematics floor was dedicated to Richard Rothenberg, the math department chairman who had died from a sudden heart attack earlier that year. Sculptor Madeleine Segall-Marx was commissioned to create the Rothenberg Memorial in his honor. She created a mathematics wall entitled "Celebration", consisting of 50 wooden boxes—one for each year of his life—behind a glass wall, featuring mathematical concepts and reflections on Rothenberg.

In 2006, <a href="Robert%20Ira%20Lewy">Robert Ira Lewy</a> of the class of 1960 made a gift worth $1,000,000 to found the Dr. Robert Ira Lewy M.D. Multimedia Center. and donated his personal library in 2007. In late 2010, the school library merged with the <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Library">New York Public Library</a> (NYPL) network in a four-year pilot program, in which all students of the school received a student library card so they could check books out of the school library or any other public library in the NYPL system.

An escalator collapse at Stuyvesant High School on September 13, 2018, injured 10 people, including 8 students.

During construction, the <a href="Battery%20Park%20City%20Authority">Battery Park City Authority</a>, the Percent for Art Program of the City of New York, the Department of Cultural Affairs, and the New York City Board of Education commissioned "Mnemonics", an artwork by public artists <a href="Jones%20and%20Ginzel">Kristin Jones and Andrew Ginzel</a>. Four hundred hollow glass blocks were dispersed randomly from the basement to the tenth floor of the new Stuyvesant High School building. Each block contains relics providing evidence of geographical, natural, cultural and social worlds, from antiquity to the present time.

The blocks are set into the hallway walls and scattered throughout the building. Each block is inscribed with a brief description of its contents or context. The items displayed include a section of the <a href="Great%20Wall%20of%20China">Great Wall of China</a>, fragments of the Mayan <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a>s, leaves from the sacred <a href="Sacred%20fig">Bo tree</a>, water from the <a href="Nile">Nile</a> and <a href="Ganges">Ganges</a> Rivers, a <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a> button, pieces of the 15th Street Stuyvesant building, a report card of a student who studied in the old building, and fragments of monuments from around the world, various chemical compounds, and memorabilia from each of the 88 years' history of the 15th Street building. Empty blocks were also installed so that they could be filled with items chosen by each of the graduating classes up through 2080. The installation received the Award for Excellence in Design from the Art Commission of the City of New York.

The <a href="New%20York%20City%20Subway">New York City Subway</a>'s <a href="Chambers%20Street%20%28IRT%20Broadway%E2%80%93Seventh%20Avenue%20Line%29">Chambers Street</a> station, served by the , is located nearby. Additionally, <a href="New%20York%20City%20Bus">New York City Bus</a>'s and routes stop near Stuyvesant. Students residing a certain distance from the school are provided full-fare or half-fare student <a href="MetroCard%20%28New%20York%20City%29">MetroCards</a> for public transportation at the start of each term, based on how far away the student resides from the school.

Stuyvesant has a total enrollment of over 3,000 students and is open to residents of New York City entering <a href="ninth%20grade">ninth</a> or <a href="tenth%20grade">tenth grade</a>. Enrollment is based solely on performance on the three-hour Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, which is administered annually. Approximately 28,000 students took the test in 2017. The list of schools using the SHSAT has since grown to include eight of New York's nine specialized high schools. The test score necessary for admission to Stuyvesant has consistently been higher than that needed for admission to the other schools using the test. Admission is currently based on an individual's score on the examination and the pre-submitted ranking of Stuyvesant among the other specialized schools. Ninth- and rising tenth–grade students are also eligible to take the test for enrollment, but far fewer students are admitted that way. The test covers math (word problems and computation) and verbal (reading comprehension) skills. Former Mayor <a href="John%20Lindsay">John Lindsay</a> and community activist group <a href="Association%20of%20Community%20Organizations%20for%20Reform%20Now">Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now</a> (ACORN) have argued that the exam may be biased against <a href="African%20American">African</a> and <a href="Hispanic">Hispanic Americans</a>.
For most of the 20th century, the student body at Stuyvesant was heavily <a href="American%20Jews">Jewish</a>. A significant influx of <a href="Asian%20American">Asian</a> students began in the 1970s. In the 2013 academic year, the student body was 72.43% Asian, 21.44% <a href="White%20American">Caucasian</a>, 1.03% <a href="African%20American">African American</a>, 2.34% <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic</a>, and 3% unknown/other. The paucity of Black and Hispanic students at Stuyvesant has often been an issue for some city administrators. In 1971, Mayor <a href="John%20Lindsay">John Lindsay</a> argued that the test was culturally biased against black and Hispanic students and sought to implement an <a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a> program. However, protests by parents forced the plan to be scrapped and led to the passage of the Hecht-Calandra Act, which preserved admissions by examination only. A small number of students judged to be economically disadvantaged and who come within a few points of the cut-off score were given an extra chance to pass the test.

Community activist group ACORN published two reports in 1996, titled "Secret Apartheid" and "Secret Apartheid II". In these reports, ACORN called the SHSAT "permanently suspect" and described it as a "product of an institutional racism", saying that black and Hispanic students did not have access to proper test preparation materials. Along with Schools Chancellor <a href="Rudy%20Crew">Rudy Crew</a>, they began an initiative for more diversity in the city's gifted and specialized schools, in particular demanding that since only a few districts send the majority of Stuyvesant's and Bronx Science's students, the SHSAT be suspended altogether "until the Board of Education can show that the students of each middle school in the system have had access to curricula and instruction that would prepare them for this test regardless of their color or economic status." Students published several editorials in response, and change was averted.

A number of students take preparatory courses offered by private companies such as <a href="The%20Princeton%20Review">The Princeton Review</a> and Kaplan in order to perform better on the SHSAT, often leaving those unable to afford such classes at a disadvantage. To bridge this gap and boost minority admissions, the Board of Education started the Math Science Institute in 1995, a free program to prepare students for the admissions test. Students attend preparatory classes through the program, now known as the Specialized High School Institute (also known as DREAM), at several schools around the city from the summer after sixth grade until the eighth-grade exam. Despite these free programs, black and Hispanic enrollment continues to decline.

The New York City Department of Education reported in 2003 that public per student spending at Stuyvesant is slightly lower than the city average. Stuyvesant also receives private contributions. , fewer than 1% of freshman openings were given to black students.

Stuyvesant students undertake a <a href="university-preparatory%20school">college-preparatory</a> curriculum that mostly includes four years of English, <a href="history">history</a>, and laboratory-based <a href="science">science</a>s. The sciences courses include requisite <a href="biology">biology</a>, <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, and <a href="physics">physics</a> classes. Students also take four years of <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>. Students also take three years of a single foreign language; a semester each of introductory <a href="art">art</a>, <a href="music">music</a>, <a href="health">health</a>, and <a href="technical%20drawing">technical drawing</a>; two semesters of <a href="computer%20science">computer science</a>; and two lab-based technology courses. Several exemptions from technology education exist for seniors. Stuyvesant offers students a broad selection of elective courses. Some of the more unusual offerings include <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, New York City history, Women's Voices, and the mathematics of <a href="financial%20market">financial market</a>s. Most students complete the New York City Regents courses by junior year and take <a href="calculus">calculus</a> during their senior year. However, the school offers math courses through <a href="differential%20equation">differential equation</a>s for the more advanced students. A year of technical drawing was formerly required; students learned how to draft by hand in its first semester and how to draft using a computer in the second. Now, students take a one-semester compacted version of the former drafting course, as well as a semester of introductory computer science. For the class of 2015, the one-semester computer science course was replaced with a two-semester course.
As a specialized high school, Stuyvesant offers a wide range of <a href="Advanced%20Placement">Advanced Placement</a> (AP) courses. These courses focus on math, science, history, English, or foreign languages. This gives students various opportunities to earn college credit. AP computer science students can also take three additional computer programming courses after the completion of the AP course: systems level programming, <a href="computer%20graphics">computer graphics</a>, and software development. In addition, there is a one-year <a href="computer%20network">computer network</a>ing class which can earn students <a href="Cisco%20Career%20Certifications">Cisco Certified Network Associate</a> (CCNA) certification.

Stuyvesant's foreign language offerings include <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="Japanese%20language">Japanese</a>, <a href="Latin%20language">Latin</a>, and <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>. In 2005, the school also started offering courses in <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> after the school's Muslim Student Association had raised funds to support the course. Stuyvesant's <a href="biology">biology</a> and geo-science department offers courses in molecular biology, <a href="human%20physiology">human physiology</a>, <a href="medical%20ethics">medical ethics</a>, medical and veterinary diagnosis, human disease, <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a> and <a href="sociobiology">sociobiology</a>, <a href="Zoology">vertebrate zoology</a>, <a href="laboratory">laboratory</a> techniques, medical human <a href="genetics">genetics</a>, <a href="botany">botany</a>, the molecular basis of cancer, nutrition science, and <a href="psychology">psychology</a>. The chemistry and physics departments include classes in <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>, <a href="physical%20chemistry">physical chemistry</a>, astronomy, <a href="engineering">engineering</a> mechanics, and <a href="electronics">electronics</a>.

Although Stuyvesant is primarily known for its math and science focus, the school also has a comprehensive <a href="humanities">humanities</a> program. The English Department offers students courses in British and classical literature, Shakespearean literature, science fiction, <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a href="existentialism">existentialism</a>, <a href="debate">debate</a>, <a href="acting">acting</a>, <a href="journalism">journalism</a>, <a href="creative%20writing">creative writing</a>, and <a href="poetry">poetry</a>. The Social Studies core requires two years of global history (or one year of global followed by one year of European history), one year of <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States">American history</a>, as well as a semester each of <a href="economics">economics</a> and <a href="government">government</a>. Humanities electives include American <a href="foreign%20policy">foreign policy</a>; <a href="civil%20law%20%28common%20law%29">civil</a> and <a href="criminal%20law">criminal law</a>, <a href="prejudice">prejudice</a> and <a href="persecution">persecution</a>, and <a href="Race%20%28human%20classification%29">race</a>, <a href="ethnic%20group">ethnicity</a> and <a href="gender">gender</a> issues.

In 2004, Stuyvesant entered into an agreement with <a href="City%20College%20of%20New%20York">City College of New York</a> in which the college funds advanced after-school courses that are taken for college credit but taught by Stuyvesant teachers. Some of these courses include physical chemistry, linear algebra, advanced Euclidean geometry, and women's history.

Prior to the <a href="SAT%232005%20changes">2005 revision of the SAT</a>, Stuyvesant graduates had an average score of 1408 out of 1600 (685 in the verbal section of the test, 723 in the math section). In 2010, the average score on the SAT for Stuyvesant students was 2087 out of 2400, while the class of 2013 had an average SAT score of 2096. , Stuyvesant students' average SAT score was 1490 of 1600 points. Stuyvesant also administers more Advanced Placement exams than any other high school in the world, as well as the highest number of students who reach the AP courses' "mastery level". , there are 24 AP classes offered, with a little more than half of all students taking at least one AP class, and about 98% of students pass their AP tests.

Stuyvesant fields 32 <a href="varsity%20team">varsity team</a>s, including the <a href="swimming%20%28sport%29">swimming</a>, <a href="golf">golf</a>, <a href="bowling">bowling</a>, <a href="volleyball">volleyball</a>, <a href="Association%20football">soccer</a>, <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, <a href="gymnastics">gymnastics</a>, <a href="scholastic%20wrestling">wrestling</a>, <a href="fencing">fencing</a>, <a href="baseball">baseball</a>/<a href="softball">softball</a>, <a href="American%20handball">American handball</a>, <a href="tennis">tennis</a>, <a href="Track%20and%20field">track</a>/<a href="Cross%20country%20running">cross country</a>, <a href="cricket">cricket</a>, <a href="High%20school%20football%20in%20North%20America">football</a>, and <a href="lacrosse">lacrosse</a> teams. In addition, Stuyvesant has <a href="ultimate%20%28sport%29">ultimate</a> teams for the boys' varsity, boys' junior varsity, and girls' varsity divisions.

In September 2007, the Stuyvesant football team was given a home field at <a href="Pier%2040%20at%20Hudson%20River%20Park">Pier 40</a>, located north of the school at <a href="Houston%20Street">Houston Street</a> and <a href="West%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">West Street</a>. In 2008, the baseball team was granted use of the pier after construction and delivery of an <a href="artificial%20turf">artificial turf</a> pitching mound that met <a href="Public%20Schools%20Athletic%20League">Public Schools Athletic League</a> specifications. Stuyvesant also has its own swimming pool, but it does not contain its own running track or tennis court. Unlike most American high schools, most sports teams at Stuyvesant are individually known by different <a href="athletic%20nickname">names</a>. Only the football, <a href="Cheerleading">Cheerleading</a>, badminton, girls' ping pong, baseball, girls' handball, girls' bowling, and boys' lacrosse teams retain the traditional Pegleg monikers.

The student body of Stuyvesant is represented by the Stuyvesant Student Union, a <a href="Student%20governments%20in%20the%20United%20States">student government</a>. It comprises a group of students (elected each year for each grade) who serve the student body in two important areas: improving student life by promoting and managing extracurricular activities (clubs and publications), and by organizing out-of-school activity such as city excursions or fundraisers; and providing a voice to the student body in all discussion of school policy with the administration.

Stuyvesant allows students to join clubs, publications, and teams under a system similar to that of many colleges. , the school had 150 student clubs.

"The Spectator" is Stuyvesant's official in-school newspaper, which is published biweekly and is independent from the school. There are over 250 students who help with publication. At the beginning of the fall and spring terms, there are recruitments, but interested students may join at any time.

Founded in 1915, "The Spectator" is one of Stuyvesant's oldest publications. It has a long-standing connection with its older namesake, Columbia University's "<a href="Columbia%20Daily%20Spectator">Columbia Daily Spectator</a>", and has been recognized by the <a href="Columbia%20University%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Journalism">Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism</a>'s <a href="Columbia%20Scholastic%20Press%20Association">Columbia Scholastic Press Association</a>.

"The Voice" was founded in the 1973–1974 academic year as an independent publication only loosely sanctioned by school officials. It had the appearance of a magazine and gained a large readership. "The Voice" attracted a considerable amount of controversy and a <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> lawsuit, after which the administration forced it to go off-campus and to turn commercial in 1975–1976.

In the beginning of the 1975–1976 academic year, "The Voice" decided to publish the results of a confidential random survey measuring the "sexual attitudes, preferences, knowledge and experience" of the students. The administration refused to permit "The Voice" to distribute the questionnaire, and the Board of Education refused to intervene, believing that "irreparable psychological damage" would be occasioned on some of the students receiving it. The editor-in-chief of "The Voice", Jeff Trachtman, brought a First Amendment challenge to this decision in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> in front of <a href="United%20States%20federal%20judge">Judge</a> <a href="Constance%20Baker%20Motley">Constance Baker Motley</a>.

Motley, relying on the relatively recent <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> precedent "<a href="Tinker%20v.%20Des%20Moines%20Independent%20Community%20School%20District">Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District</a>" (holding that "undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression"), ordered the Board of Education to come up with an arrangement permitting the distribution of the survey to the juniors and seniors. However, Motley's ruling was overturned on appeal to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Second%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a>. Judge <a href="J.%20Edward%20Lumbard">J. Edward Lumbard</a>, joined by Judge <a href="Murray%20Gurfein">Murray Gurfein</a> and over an impassioned dissent by Judge <a href="Walter%20R.%20Mansfield">Walter R. Mansfield</a>, held that the distribution of the questionnaires was properly disallowed by the administration since there was basis for the belief that it might "result in significant emotional harm to a number of students throughout the Stuyvesant population." The Supreme Court denied <a href="certiorari">certiorari</a> review.

The annual theater competition known as <a href="SING%21">SING!</a> pits seniors, juniors, and "soph-frosh" (freshmen and sophomores working together) against each other in a contest to put on the best performance. SING! started in 1947 at <a href="Midwood%20High%20School">Midwood High School</a> in Brooklyn and has expanded to many New York City high schools since then. SING! at Stuyvesant started as a small event in 1973, and since then, has grown to a school-wide event; in 2005, nearly 1,000 students participated. The entire production is written, directed, produced, and funded by students. Their involvement ranges from being members of the production's casts, choruses, or costume and tech crews to Irish dance, Step, Bollywood, Hip-Hop, Swing, Ballet, Jazz or Latin dance groups. SING! begins in late January to February and culminates in final performances on three nights in March/April. Scoring is done on each night's performances and the winner is determined by the overall total.

Stuyvesant has produced many <a href="List%20of%20Stuyvesant%20High%20School%20people">notable alumni</a>, including four <a href="List%20of%20Nobel%20laureates">Nobel laureates</a>. "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>" ranked it as one of the best high schools nationwide in their 2017 list of America's best "Gold Medal" public high schools, but only 71st best in its 2017 list of <a href="science%2C%20technology%2C%20engineering%2C%20and%20mathematics">science, technology, engineering, and mathematics</a> schools. According to a September 2002 high school ranking by "<a href="Worth%20%28magazine%29">Worth</a>" magazine, 3.67% of Stuyvesant students went on to attend <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a>, <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton</a>, and <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a> universities, ranking it as the 9th top public high school in the United States and 120th among all schools, public or private. In December 2007, "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" studied the freshman classes at eight selective colleges and reported that Stuyvesant sent 67 students to these schools, comprising 9.9% of its 674 seniors.

Stuyvesant, along with other similar schools, has regularly been excluded from "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>"'s annual list of the Top 100 Public High Schools. The May 8, 2008, issue states the reason as being, "because so many of their students score well above average on the <a href="SAT">SAT</a> and <a href="ACT%20%28test%29">ACT</a>." "U.S. News & World Report", however, included Stuyvesant on its list of "Best High Schools" published in December 2009, ranking 31st. In its 2010 progress report, the New York City Department of Education assigned it an "A", the highest possible grade.

Stuyvesant has contributed to the education of several <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel</a> laureates, winners of the <a href="Fields%20Medal">Fields Medal</a> and the <a href="Wolf%20Prize">Wolf Prize</a>, and other <a href="List%20of%20Stuyvesant%20High%20School%20people">accomplished alumni</a>. In recent years, it has had the second highest number of National Merit Scholarship semi-finalists, behind <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson%20High%20School%20for%20Science%20and%20Technology">Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology</a> in <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria, Virginia</a>. From 2002 to 2010, Stuyvesant has produced 103 semi-finalists and 13 finalists on the <a href="Intel%20Science%20Talent%20Search">Intel Science Talent Search</a>, the second most of any secondary school in the United States behind the Bronx High School of Science. In 2014, Stuyvesant had 11 semifinalists for the Intel Search, the highest number of any school in the U.S.

In the 2010s, exam schools including Stuyvesant have been the subject of studies questioning their effectiveness. A study by <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> and <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a> economists compared two sets of SHSAT test takers, whose scores differed only by a few points. One group of students failed to be accepted into Stuyvesant because they had answered a few questions incorrectly, while the other group was composed of Stuyvesant students who had the minimum number of correct test answers that were necessary for an acceptance offer. These economists found that there was no discernible difference in the two groups' average SAT and AP scores, and there were high overlaps into the colleges to which both groups were accepted.

Notable scientists among Stuyvesant alumni include mathematician <a href="Paul%20Cohen%20%28mathematician%29">Paul Cohen</a> (1950), string theorist <a href="Brian%20Greene">Brian Greene</a> (1980), physicist <a href="Lisa%20Randall">Lisa Randall</a> (1980), and genomic researcher <a href="Eric%20Lander">Eric Lander</a> (1974).

Mary Toft

Mary Toft (née Denyer; c. 1701–1763), also spelled Tofts, was an English woman from <a href="Godalming">Godalming</a>, Surrey, who in 1726 became the subject of considerable controversy when she tricked doctors into believing that she had given birth to <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s.

In 1726 Toft became pregnant, but following her reported fascination with the sighting of a rabbit, she miscarried. Her claim to have given birth to various animal parts prompted the arrival of John Howard, a local surgeon, who investigated the matter. He delivered several pieces of animal flesh and duly notified other prominent physicians, which brought the case to the attention of <a href="Nathaniel%20St.%20Andr%C3%A9">Nathaniel St. André</a>, surgeon to the <a href="Royal%20Household">Royal Household</a> of King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a>. St. André concluded that Toft's case was genuine but the king also sent surgeon Cyriacus Ahlers, who remained skeptical. By then quite famous, Toft was brought to London where she was studied in detail, where under intense scrutiny and producing no more rabbits she confessed to the hoax, and was subsequently imprisoned as a fraud.

The resultant public mockery created panic within the medical profession and ruined the careers of several prominent surgeons. The affair was satirised on many occasions, not least by the pictorial satirist and social critic <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>, who was notably critical of the medical profession's gullibility. Toft was eventually released without charge and returned home.

The story first came to the public's attention in late October 1726, when reports began to reach London. An account appeared in the "<a href="Mist%27s%20Weekly%20Journal">Mist's Weekly Journal</a>", on 19 November 1726:

The 'poor Woman', Mary Toft, was twenty-four or twenty-five years old. She was baptised Mary Denyer on 21 February 1703, the daughter of John and Jane Denyer. In 1720 she married Joshua Toft, a <a href="journeyman">journeyman</a> clothier and together the couple had three children, Mary, Anne and James. As an 18th-century English peasant, circumstances dictated that when in 1726 Toft again became pregnant, she continue working in the fields. She complained of painful complications early in the pregnancy and in early August <a href="wikt%3Aegest">egested</a> several pieces of flesh, one "as big as my arm". This may have been the result of an abnormality of the developing <a href="placenta">placenta</a>, which would have caused the embryo to stop developing and blood clots and flesh to be ejected. Toft went into <a href="Childbirth">labour</a> on 27 September. Her neighbour was called and watched as she produced several animal parts. This neighbour then showed the pieces to her mother and to her mother-in-law, Ann Toft, who by chance was a <a href="Midwifery">midwife</a>. Ann Toft sent the flesh to John Howard, a <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a>-based man-midwife of thirty years' experience.

Initially, Howard dismissed the notion that Toft had given birth to animal parts, but the next day, despite his reservations, he went to see her. Ann Toft showed him more pieces of the previous night's exertions, but on examining Mary, he found nothing. When Mary again went into labour, appearing to give birth to several more animal parts, Howard returned to continue his investigations. According to a contemporary account of 9 November, over the next few days he <a href="Childbirth">delivered</a> "three legs of a Cat of a Tabby Colour, and one leg of a Rabbet: the guts were as a Cat's and in them were three pieces of the Back-Bone of an Eel ... The cat's feet supposed were formed in her imagination from a cat she was fond of that slept on the bed at night." Toft seemingly became ill once more and over the next few days delivered more pieces of rabbit.

As the story became more widely known, on 4 November Henry Davenant, a member of the court of King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a>, went to see for himself what was happening. He examined the samples Howard had collected and returned to London, ostensibly a believer. Howard had Toft moved to <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a>, where he offered to deliver rabbits in the presence of anyone who doubted her story. Some of the letters he wrote to Davenant to notify him of any progress in the case came to the attention of <a href="Nathaniel%20St.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BAndr%C3%A9">Nathaniel St. André</a>, since 1723 a <a href="Swiss%20people">Swiss</a> surgeon to the <a href="Royal%20Household">Royal Household</a>. St. André would ultimately detail the contents of one of these letters in his pamphlet, "A short narrative of an extraordinary delivery of rabbets" (1727):

By the middle of November the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">British Royal Family</a> were so interested in the story that they sent St. André and <a href="Samuel%20Molyneux">Samuel Molyneux</a>, secretary to the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>, to investigate. Apparently, they were not disappointed; arriving on 15 November they were taken by Howard to see Toft, who within hours delivered a rabbit's torso. St. André's account details his examination of the rabbit. To check if it had breathed air, he placed a piece of its lung in water to see if it would float—which it did. St. André then performed a medical examination on Toft, and concluded that the rabbits were bred in her <a href="Fallopian%20tube">Fallopian tube</a>s. In the doctors' absence, Toft later that day reportedly delivered the torso of another rabbit, which the two also examined. They again returned that evening to find Toft again displaying violent <a href="contraction%20%28childbirth%29">contractions</a>. A further medical examination followed, and St. André delivered some rabbit skin, followed a few minutes later by a rabbit's head. Both men inspected the egested pieces of flesh, noting that some resembled the body parts of a cat.

Fascinated, the king then sent surgeon <a href="Cyriacus%20Ahlers">Cyriacus Ahlers</a> to Guildford. Ahlers arrived on 20 November and found Toft exhibiting no signs of pregnancy. He may have already suspected the affair was a hoax and observed that Toft seemed to press her knees and thighs together, as if to prevent something from "dropping down". He thought Howard's behaviour just as suspicious, as the man-midwife would not let him help deliver the rabbits—although Ahlers was not a man-midwife and in an earlier attempt had apparently put Toft through considerable pain. Convinced the affair was a hoax, he lied, telling those involved that he believed Toft's story, before making his excuses and returning to London, taking specimens of the rabbits with him. Upon closer study, he reportedly found evidence of them having been cut with a man-made instrument, and noted pieces of straw and grain in their droppings.

On 21 November Ahlers reported his findings to the king and later to "several Persons of Note and Distinction". Howard wrote to Ahlers the next day, asking for the return of his specimens. Ahlers' suspicions began to worry both Howard and St. André, and apparently the king, as two days later St. André and a colleague were ordered back to Guildford. Upon their arrival they met Howard, who told St. André that Toft had given birth to two more rabbits. She delivered several portions of what was presumed to be a placenta but she was by then quite ill, and suffering from a constant pain in the right side of her abdomen. In a pre-emptive move against Ahlers, St. André collected <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a>s from several witnesses, which in effect cast doubt on Ahlers' honesty, and on 26 November gave an anatomical demonstration before the king to support Toft's story. According to his pamphlet, neither St. André nor Molyneux suspected any fraudulent activity.

St. André was ordered by the king to travel back to Guildford and to bring Toft to London, so that further investigations could be carried out. He was accompanied by <a href="Richard%20Manningham">Richard Manningham</a>, a well-known <a href="obstetrician">obstetrician</a> who was <a href="knight">knight</a>ed in 1721, and the second son of <a href="Thomas%20Manningham">Thomas Manningham</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a>. He examined Toft and found the right side of her abdomen slightly enlarged. Manningham also delivered what he thought was a hog's bladder—although St. André and Howard disagreed with his identification—but became suspicious as it smelled of <a href="urine">urine</a>. Nevertheless, those involved agreed to say nothing in public and on their return to London on 29 November lodged Toft in Lacey's <a href="Bagnio">Bagnio</a>, in Leicester Fields.

Printed in the early days of newspapers, the story became a national sensation, although some publications were skeptical, the "<a href="Norwich%20Gazette">Norwich Gazette</a>" viewing the affair simply as female gossip. Rabbit stew and <a href="Jugging">jugged</a> hare disappeared from the dinner table, while as unlikely as the story sounded, many physicians felt compelled to see Toft for themselves. The political writer <a href="John%20Hervey%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Hervey">John Hervey</a> later told his friend Henry Fox that:
Under St. André's strict control, Toft was studied by a number of eminent physicians and surgeons, including <a href="John%20Maubray">John Maubray</a>. In "The Female Physician" Maubray had proposed women could give birth to a creature he named a <a href="sooterkin">sooterkin</a>. He was a proponent of <a href="maternal%20impression">maternal impression</a>, a widely held belief that conception and pregnancy could be influenced by what the mother dreamt, or saw, and warned pregnant women that over-familiarity with household pets could cause their children to resemble those pets. He was reportedly happy to attend Toft, pleased that her case appeared to vindicate his theories, but man-midwife <a href="James%20Douglas%20%28physician%29">James Douglas</a>, like Manningham, presumed that the affair was a hoax and despite St. André's repeated invitations, kept his distance. Douglas was one of the country's most respected anatomists and a well-known man-midwife, whereas St. André was often considered to be a member of the court only because of his ability to speak the king's native German. St. André therefore desperately wanted the two to attend Toft; after <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a>'s accession to the throne the <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20faction%29">Whig</a>s had become the dominant political faction, and Manningham and Douglas's Whig affiliations and medical knowledge might have elevated his status as both doctor and philosopher. Douglas thought that a woman giving birth to rabbits was as likely as a rabbit giving birth to a human child, but despite his scepticism he went to see her. When Manningham informed him of the suspected hog's bladder, and after he examined Toft, he refused to engage St. André on the matter:

Under constant supervision, Toft went into labour several times, to no avail.

The hoax was uncovered on 4 December. <a href="Thomas%20Onslow%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Onslow">Thomas Onslow, 2nd Baron Onslow</a>, had begun an investigation of his own and discovered that for the past month Toft's husband, Joshua, had been buying young rabbits. Convinced he had enough evidence to proceed, in a letter to physician Sir <a href="Hans%20Sloane">Hans Sloane</a> he wrote that the affair had "almost alarmed England" and that he would soon publish his findings. The same day, Thomas Howard, a <a href="Porter%20%28carrier%29">porter</a> at the bagnio, confessed to <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> Sir <a href="Thomas%20Clarges">Thomas Clarges</a> that he had been bribed by Toft's sister-in-law, Margaret, to sneak a rabbit into Toft's chamber. When arrested and questioned Mary denied the accusation, while Margaret, under Douglas's interrogation, claimed that she had obtained the rabbit for eating only.

Manningham examined Toft and thought something remained in the cavity of her uterus, and so he successfully persuaded Clarges to allow her to remain at the bagnio. Douglas, who had by then visited Toft, questioned her on three or four occasions, each time for several hours. After several days of this Manningham threatened to perform a painful operation on her, and on 7 December, in the presence of Manningham, Douglas, <a href="John%20Montagu%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Montagu">John Montagu</a> and <a href="Frederick%20Calvert%2C%206th%20Baron%20Baltimore">Frederick Calvert</a>, Toft finally confessed. Following her miscarriage and while her <a href="cervix">cervix</a> permitted access, an accomplice had inserted into her womb the claws and body of a cat, and the head of a rabbit. They had also invented a story in which Toft claimed that during her pregnancy and while working in a field, she had been startled by a rabbit, and had since become obsessed with rabbits. For later <a href="parturition">parturition</a>s, animal parts had been inserted into her vagina.

Pressured again by Manningham and Douglas (it was the latter who took her confession), she made a further admission on 8 December and another on 9 December, before being sent to <a href="Tothill%20Fields%20Bridewell">Tothill Fields Bridewell</a>, charged on a statute of <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III</a> as a "vile cheat and imposter". In her earlier, unpublished confessions, she blamed the entire affair on a range of other participants, from her mother-in-law to John Howard. She also claimed that a travelling woman told her how to insert the rabbits into her body, and how such a scheme would ensure that she would "never want as long as I liv'd". The "<a href="British%20Journal">British Journal</a>" reported that on 7 January 1727 she appeared at the <a href="Quarter%20Sessions">Courts of Quarter Sessions</a> at <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, charged "for being an abominable cheat and imposter in pretending to be delivered of several monstrous births". Margaret Toft had remained staunch, and refused to comment further. "Mist's Weekly Journal" of 24 December 1726 reported that "the nurse has been examined as to the person's concerned with her, but either was kept in the dark as to the imposition, or is not willing to disclose what she knows; for nothing can be got from her; so that her resolution shocks others."

Following the hoax, the medical profession's gullibility became the target of a great deal of public mockery. <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a> published "Cunicularii, or The Wise Men of Godliman in Consultation" (1726), which portrays Toft in the throes of <a href="Childbirth">labour</a>, surrounded by the tale's chief participants. Figure "F" is Toft, "E" is her husband. "A" is St. André, and "D" is Howard. In Dennis Todd's "Three Characters in Hogarth's Cunicularii and Some Implications" the author concludes that figure "G" is Mary Toft's sister-in-law, Margaret Toft. Toft's confession of 7 December demonstrates her insistence that her sister-in-law played no part in the hoax, but Manningham's 1726 "An Exact Diary of what was observ'd during a Close Attendance upon Mary Toft, the pretended Rabbet-Breeder of Godalming in Surrey" offers eyewitness testimony of her complicity. Hogarth's print was not the only image that ridiculed the affair—<a href="George%20Vertue">George Vertue</a> published "The Surrey-Wonder", and "The Doctors in Labour, or a New Wim-Wam in Guildford (12 plates)", a broadsheet published in 1727 which satirises St. André, was also popular at the time.

The timing of Toft's confession proved awkward for St. André, who on 3 December had published his forty-page pamphlet "A Short Narrative of an Extraordinary Delivery of Rabbets". On this document the surgeon had staked his reputation, and although it offers a more empirical account of the Toft case than earlier more fanciful publications about reproduction in general, ultimately it was derided. Ahlers, his scepticism justified, published "Some observations concerning the woman of Godlyman in Surrey", which details his account of events and his suspicion of the complicity of both St. André and Howard.

St. André recanted his views on 9 December 1726. In 1729, following the death of Samuel Molyneux from poisoning, he married Molyneux's widow, Elizabeth. This did little to impress his peers. Molyneux's cousin accused him of the poisoning, a charge that St. André defended by suing for <a href="defamation">defamation</a>, but the careers of St. André and his wife were permanently damaged. Elizabeth lost her attendance on <a href="Caroline%20of%20Ansbach">Queen Caroline</a>, and St. André was publicly humiliated at court. Living on Elizabeth's considerable wealth, they retired to the country, where St. André died in 1776, aged 96. Manningham, desperate to exculpate himself, published a diary of his observations of Mary Toft, together with an account of her confession of the fraud, on 12 December. In it he suggested that Douglas had been fooled by Toft, and concerned with his image Douglas replied by publishing his own account. Using the pseudonym 'Lover of Truth and Learning', in 1727 Douglas also published "The Sooterkin Dissected". A letter to Maubray, Douglas was scathingly critical of his Sooterkin theory, calling it "a mere fiction of your [Maubray's] brain". The damage done to the medical profession was such that several doctors not connected with the tale felt compelled to print statements that they had not believed Toft's story. On 7 January 1727 John Howard and Toft appeared before the <a href="Bench%20%28law%29">bench</a>, where Howard was fined £800 (£ today). He returned to Surrey and continued his practice, and died in 1755.

Crowds reportedly mobbed Tothill Fields Bridewell for months, hoping to catch a glimpse of the now infamous Toft. By this time she had become quite ill, and while incarcerated had her portrait drawn by John Laguerre. She was ultimately discharged on 8 April 1727, as it was unclear as to what charge should have been made against her. The Toft family made no profit from the affair, and Mary Toft returned to Surrey. In February 1728 (recorded as 1727 <a href="Old%20Style">Old Style</a>), she gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth, noted in the Godalming parish register as her "first child after her pretended Rabett-breeding." Little is known of Toft's later life. She briefly reappeared in 1740 when she was imprisoned for receiving stolen goods. She died in 1763, and her obituary ran in London newspapers alongside those of aristocrats. She was buried in Godalming on 13 January 1763.
The case was cited by <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a>'s opponents as symbolising the age, which they perceived as greedy, corrupt and deceitful. One author, writing to the Prince of Wales's mistress, suggested the story was a political portent of the approaching death of the prince's father. On 7 January 1727 "<a href="Nathaniel%20Mist">Mist's Weekly Journal</a>" satirised the matter, making several allusions to political change, and comparing the affair to the events of 1641 when Parliament began its revolution against <a href="Charles%20I%20of%20England">King Charles I</a>. The scandal provided the writers of <a href="Grub%20Street">Grub Street</a> with enough material to produce pamphlets, <a href="Squib%20%28linguistics%29">squibs</a>, broadsides and ballads for several months. With publications such as "St. André's Miscarriage" (1727) and "The anatomist dissected: or the man-midwife finely brought to bed" (1727) satirists scorned the objectivity of men-midwives, and critics of Toft's attendants questioned their integrity, undermining their profession with sexual puns and allusions. The case raised questions about England's status as an "enlightened" nation—<a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> used the case in his brief essay "Singularités de la nature" to describe how the Protestant English were still influenced by an ignorant Church.

Toft did not escape the ire of the satirists, who concentrated mainly on sexual innuendo. Some took advantage of a common 18th-century word for a rabbit track—prick—and others were scatological in nature. However, "Much Ado about Nothing; or, A Plain Refutation of All that Has Been Written or Said Concerning the Rabbit-Woman of Godalming" (1727) is one of the more cutting satires on Toft. The document supposes to be the confession of 'Merry Tuft', "... in her own Stile and Spelling". Poking fun at her illiteracy, it makes a number of obscene suggestions hinting at her promiscuity—"I wos a Wuman as had grate nattural parts, and a large Capassiti, and kapible of being kunserned in depe Kuntrivansis." The document also ridicules several of the physicians involved in the affair, and reflects the general view portrayed by the satirists that Toft was a weak woman and the least complicit of "the offenders" (regardless of her guilt). The notion contrasts with that expressed of her before the hoax was revealed and may indicate an overall strategy to disempower Toft completely. This is reflected in one of the most notable satires of the affair, <a href="Alexander%20Pope">Alexander Pope</a> and <a href="William%20Pulteney%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Bath">William Pulteney</a>'s anonymous satirical ballad "The Discovery; or, The Squire Turn'd Ferret". Published in 1726 and aimed at Samuel Molyneux, it rhymes "hare" with "hair", and "coney" with "cunny". The ballad opens with the following verse:

The Turk

The Turk, also known as the Mechanical Turk or Automaton Chess Player (, "chess Turk"; ), was a fake chess-playing <a href="artificial%20intelligence">machine</a> constructed in the late 18th century. From 1770 until its destruction by fire in 1854 it was exhibited by various owners as an <a href="automaton">automaton</a>, though it was eventually revealed to be an elaborate <a href="hoax">hoax</a>. Constructed and unveiled in 1770 by <a href="Wolfgang%20von%20Kempelen">Wolfgang von Kempelen</a> (Hungarian: Kempelen Farkas; 1734–1804) to impress the Empress <a href="Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Austria">Maria Theresa of Austria</a>, the mechanism appeared to be able to play a strong game of chess against a human opponent, as well as perform the <a href="knight%27s%20tour">knight's tour</a>, a puzzle that requires the player to move a <a href="knight%20%28chess%29">knight</a> to occupy every square of a chessboard exactly once.

The Turk was in fact a mechanical <a href="Magic%20%28illusion%29">illusion</a> that allowed a human chess master hiding inside to operate the machine. With a skilled operator, the Turk won most of the games played during its demonstrations around <a href="Europe">Europe</a> and the Americas for nearly 84 years, playing and defeating many challengers including statesmen such as <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>. The device was later purchased in 1804 and exhibited by <a href="Johann%20Nepomuk%20M%C3%A4lzel">Johann Nepomuk Mälzel</a>. The chess masters who secretly operated it included <a href="Johann%20Baptist%20Allgaier">Johann Allgaier</a>, <a href="Hyacinthe%20Henri%20Boncourt">Boncourt</a>, <a href="Aaron%20Alexandre">Aaron Alexandre</a>, <a href="William%20Lewis%20%28chess%20player%29">William Lewis</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mouret">Jacques Mouret</a>, and <a href="William%20Schlumberger">William Schlumberger</a>, but the operators within the mechanism during Kempelen's original tour remain a mystery.

Kempelen was inspired to build the Turk following his attendance at the court of Maria Theresa of Austria at <a href="Sch%C3%B6nbrunn%20Palace">Schönbrunn Palace</a>, where <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pelletier">François Pelletier</a> was performing an illusion act. An exchange afterward resulted in Kempelen promising to return to the Palace with an invention that would top the illusions.
The result of the challenge was the Automaton Chess-player, known in modern times as the Turk. The machine consisted of a life-sized <a href="mannequin">model</a> of a human head and torso, with a black beard and grey eyes, and dressed in <a href="Ottoman%20clothing">Ottoman robes</a> and a <a href="turban">turban</a> – "the traditional costume", according to journalist and author <a href="Tom%20Standage">Tom Standage</a>, "of an <a href="The%20Orient">oriental</a> <a href="magician%20%28fantasy%29">sorcerer</a>". Its left arm held a long Ottoman smoking pipe while at rest, while its right lay on the top of a large cabinet that measured about three-and-a-half <a href="foot%20%28length%29">feet</a> (110 cm) long, two feet (60 cm) wide, and two-and-a-half feet (75 cm) high. Placed on the top of the cabinet was a chessboard, which measured eighteen inches square. The front of the cabinet consisted of three doors, an opening, and a drawer, which could be opened to reveal a red and white <a href="ivory">ivory</a> chess set.

The interior of the machine was very complicated and designed to mislead those who observed it. When opened on the left, the front doors of the cabinet exposed a number of gears and cogs similar to <a href="clockwork">clockwork</a>. The section was designed so that if the back doors of the cabinet were open at the same time one could see through the machine. The other side of the cabinet did not house machinery; instead it contained a red cushion and some removable parts, as well as <a href="brass">brass</a> structures. This area was also designed to provide a clear line of vision through the machine. Underneath the robes of the Ottoman model, two other doors were hidden. These also exposed clockwork machinery and provided a similarly unobstructed view through the machine. The design allowed the presenter of the machine to open every available door to the public, to maintain the illusion.

Neither the clockwork visible to the left side of the machine nor the drawer that housed the chess set extended fully to the rear of the cabinet; they instead went only one third of the way. A sliding seat was also installed, allowing the operator inside to slide from place to place and thus evade observation as the presenter opened various doors. The sliding of the seat caused dummy machinery to slide into its place to further conceal the person inside the cabinet.

The chessboard on the top of the cabinet was thin enough to allow for a magnetic linkage. Each piece in the chess set had a small, strong magnet attached to its base, and when they were placed on the board the pieces would attract a magnet attached to a string under their specific places on the board. This allowed the operator inside the machine to see which pieces moved where on the chess board. The bottom of the chessboard had corresponding numbers, 1–64, allowing the operator to see which places on the board were affected by a player's move. The internal magnets were positioned in a way that outside magnetic forces did not influence them, and Kempelen would often allow a large magnet to sit at the side of the board in an attempt to show that the machine was not influenced by magnetism.

As a further means of misdirection, the Turk came with a small wooden coffin-like box that the presenter would place on the top of the cabinet. While <a href="Johann%20Nepomuk%20M%C3%A4lzel">Johann Nepomuk Mälzel</a>, a later owner of the machine, did not use the box, Kempelen often peered into the box during play, suggesting that the box controlled some aspect of the machine. The box was believed by some to have supernatural power; <a href="Karl%20Gottlieb%20von%20Windisch">Karl Gottlieb von Windisch</a> wrote in his 1784 book "Inanimate Reason" that "[o]ne old lady, in particular, who had not forgotten the tales she had been told in her youth … went and hid herself in a window seat, as distant as she could from the "evil spirit," which she firmly believed <a href="spiritual%20possession">possessed</a> the machine".

The interior also contained a <a href="perforated%20hardboard">pegboard</a> chess board connected to a <a href="pantograph">pantograph</a>-style series of levers that controlled the model's left arm. The metal pointer on the pantograph moved over the interior chessboard, and would simultaneously move the arm of the Turk over the chessboard on the cabinet. The range of motion allowed the operator to move the Turk's arm up and down, and turning the lever would open and close the Turk's hand, allowing it to grasp the pieces on the board. All of this was made visible to the operator by using a simple candle, which had a ventilation system through the model. Other parts of the machinery allowed for a clockwork-type sound to be played when the Turk made a move, further adding to the machinery illusion, and for the Turk to make various facial expressions. A <a href="Speech%20synthesis%23History">voice box</a> was added following the Turk's acquisition by Mälzel, allowing the machine to say "Échec!" (French for "<a href="check%20%28chess%29">check</a>") during matches.

An operator inside the machine also had tools to assist in communicating with the presenter outside. Two brass discs equipped with numbers were positioned opposite each other on the inside and outside of the cabinet. A rod could rotate the discs to the desired number, which acted as a code between the two.

The Turk made its debut in 1770 at <a href="Sch%C3%B6nbrunn%20Palace">Schönbrunn Palace</a>, about six months after Pelletier's act. Kempelen addressed the court, presenting what he had built, and began the demonstration of the machine and its parts. With every showing of the Turk, Kempelen began by opening the doors and drawers of the cabinet, allowing members of the audience to inspect the machine. Following this display, Kempelen would announce that the machine was ready for a challenger.

Kempelen would inform the player that the Turk would use the <a href="Rules%20of%20chess%23Initial%20setup">white pieces</a> and have the first move. Between moves the Turk kept its left arm on the cushion. The Turk could nod twice if it threatened its opponent's <a href="queen%20%28chess%29">queen</a>, and three times upon placing the <a href="king%20%28chess%29">king</a> in check. If an opponent made an illegal move, the Turk would shake its head, move the piece back and make its own move, thus forcing a forfeit of its opponent's move. <a href="Louis%20Dutens">Louis Dutens</a>, a traveller who observed a showing of the Turk, attempted to trick the machine "by giving the Queen the move of a Knight, but my mechanic opponent was not to be so imposed upon; he took up my Queen and replaced her in the square from which I had moved her". Kempelen made it a point to traverse the room during the match, and invited observers to bring magnets, irons, and <a href="lodestone">lodestone</a>s to the cabinet to test whether the machine was run by a form of magnetism or weights. The first person to play against the Turk was <a href="Count%20Ludwig%20von%20Cobenzl">Count Ludwig von Cobenzl</a>, an Austrian <a href="courtier">courtier</a> at the palace. Along with other challengers that day, he was quickly defeated, with observers of the match stating that the machine played aggressively, and typically beat its opponents within thirty minutes.

Another part of the machine's exhibition was the completion of the <a href="knight%27s%20tour">knight's tour</a>, a famed chess puzzle. The puzzle requires the player to move a knight around a chessboard, touching each square once along the way. While most experienced chess players of the time still struggled with the puzzle, the Turk was capable of completing the tour without any difficulty from any starting point via a pegboard used by the operator with a mapping of the puzzle laid out.

The Turk also had the ability to converse with spectators using a letter board. The operator, whose identity during the period when Kempelen presented the machine at Schönbrunn Palace is unknown, was able to do this in English, French, and German. <a href="Carl%20Hindenburg">Carl Friedrich Hindenburg</a>, a university mathematician, kept a record of the conversations during the Turk's time in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a> and published it in 1789 as "Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung" (or "On the Chessplayer of Mr. von Kempelen And Its Replica"). Topics of questions put to and answered by the Turk included its age, marital status, and its secret workings.

Following word of its debut, interest in the machine grew across Europe. Kempelen, however, was more interested in his other projects and avoided exhibiting the Turk, often lying about the machine's repair status to prospective challengers. Von Windisch wrote at one point that Kempelen "refused the entreaties of his friends, and a crowd of curious persons from all countries, the satisfaction of seeing this far-famed machine". In the decade following its debut at Schönbrunn Palace the Turk only played one opponent, Sir <a href="Robert%20Murray%20Keith">Robert Murray Keith</a>, a <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> noble, and Kempelen went as far as dismantling the Turk entirely following the match. Kempelen was quoted as referring to the invention as a "mere <a href="%3Awikt%3Abagatelle">bagatelle</a>", as he was not pleased with its popularity and would rather continue work on <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>s and machines that replicated human speech.

In 1781, Kempelen was ordered by <a href="Joseph%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Emperor Joseph II</a> to reconstruct the Turk and deliver it to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> for a state visit from Grand Duke <a href="Paul%20I%20of%20Russia">Paul of Russia</a> and his wife. The appearance was so successful that Grand Duke Paul suggested a tour of Europe for the Turk, a request to which Kempelen reluctantly agreed.
The Turk began its European tour in 1783, beginning with an appearance in <a href="France">France</a> in April. A stop at <a href="Palace%20of%20Versailles">Versailles</a> preceded an exhibition in Paris, where the Turk lost a match to <a href="Charles%20Godefroy%20de%20La%20Tour%20d%27Auvergne">Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne</a>, the . Upon arrival in Paris in May 1783, it was displayed to the public and played a variety of opponents, including a lawyer named Mr. Bernard who was a second <a href="Chess%23Titles%20and%20rankings">rank</a> in chess ability. Following the sessions at Versailles, demands increased for a match with <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Andr%C3%A9%20Danican%20Philidor">François-André Danican Philidor</a>, who was considered the best chess player of his time. Moving to the <a href="Caf%C3%A9%20de%20la%20R%C3%A9gence">Café de la Régence</a>, the machine played many of the most skilled players, often losing (e.g. against <a href="Bernard%20%28chess%20player%29">Bernard</a> and <a href="Verdoni%20%28chess%20player%29">Verdoni</a>), until securing a match with Philidor at the <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Académie des Sciences</a>. While Philidor won his match with the Turk, Philidor's son noted that his father called it "his most fatiguing game of chess ever!" The Turk's final game in Paris was against <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, who was serving as ambassador to France from the United States. Franklin reportedly enjoyed the game with the Turk and was interested in the machine for the rest of his life, keeping a copy of <a href="Philip%20Thicknesse">Philip Thicknesse</a>'s book "The Speaking Figure and the Automaton Chess Player, Exposed and Detected" in his personal library.

Following his tour of Paris, Kempelen moved the Turk to <a href="London">London</a>, where it was exhibited daily for five <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s. Thicknesse, known in his time as a <a href="skepticism">skeptic</a>, sought out the Turk in an attempt to expose the inner workings of the machine. While he respected Kempelen as "a very ingenious man", he asserted that the Turk was an elaborate hoax with a small child inside the machine, describing the machine as "a complicated piece of clockwork ... which is nothing more, than one, of many other ingenious devices, to misguide and delude the observers".

After a year in London, Kempelen and the Turk travelled to Leipzig, stopping in various European cities along the way. From Leipzig, it went to <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a>, where <a href="Joseph%20Friedrich%20Freiherr%20von%20Racknitz">Joseph Friedrich Freiherr von Racknitz</a> viewed the Turk and published his findings in "Über den Schachspieler des Herrn von Kempelen und dessen Nachbildung", along with illustrations showing his beliefs about how the machine operated. It then moved to <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a>, after which Kempelen is said to have accepted an invitation to the <a href="Sanssouci">Sanssouci</a> palace in <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a> of <a href="Frederick%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick the Great</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Prussia">King of Prussia</a>. The story goes that Frederick enjoyed the Turk so much that he paid a large sum of money to Kempelen in exchange for the Turk's secrets. Frederick never gave the secret away, but was reportedly disappointed to learn how the machine worked. This story is almost certainly apocryphal; there is no evidence of the Turk's encounter with Frederick, the first mention of which comes in the early 19th century, by which time the Turk was also incorrectly said to have played against <a href="George%20III">George III</a> of England. It seems most likely that the machine stayed dormant at Schönbrunn Palace for over two decades, although Kempelen attempted unsuccessfully to sell it in his final years. Kempelen died at the age of 70 on 26 March 1804.

Following the death of Kempelen, the Turk remained unexhibited until 1805 when Kempelen's son decided to sell it to Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a>n musician with an interest in various machines and devices. Mälzel, whose successes included patenting a form of <a href="metronome">metronome</a>, had tried to purchase the Turk once before, before Kempelen's death. The original attempt had failed, owing to Kempelen's asking price of 20,000 <a href="franc">franc</a>s; Kempelen's son sold the machine to Mälzel for half this sum.

Upon acquiring the Turk, Mälzel had to learn its secrets and make some repairs to get it back in working order. His stated goal was to make explaining the Turk a greater challenge. While the completion of this goal took ten years, the Turk still made appearances, most notably with Napoleon Bonaparte.

In 1809, <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon I of France</a> arrived at <a href="Sch%C3%B6nbrunn%20Palace">Schönbrunn Palace</a> to play the Turk. According to an eyewitness report, Mälzel took responsibility for the construction of the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (<a href="Johann%20Baptist%20Allgaier">Johann Baptist Allgaier</a>) saluted Napoleon before the start of the match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet on the board, and playing a match with a <a href="shawl">shawl</a> around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.

In 1811, Mälzel brought the Turk to <a href="Milan">Milan</a> for a performance with <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Beauharnais">Eugène de Beauharnais</a>, the Prince of Venice and Viceroy of Italy. Beauharnais enjoyed the machine so much that he offered to purchase it from Mälzel. After some serious bargaining, Beauharnais acquired the Turk for 30,000 francs – three times what Mälzel had paid – and kept it for four years. In 1815, Mälzel returned to Beauharnais in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> and asked to buy the Turk back. Two versions of how much he had to pay exist, eventually working out an agreement. One version appeared in the France Letter "Palamede". The complete story does not make a lot of sense since Mälzel visited Paris again, and he also could import his "Conflagration of Moscow".

Following the repurchase, Mälzel brought the Turk back to Paris where he made acquaintances of many of the leading chess players at Café de la Régence. Mälzel stayed in France with the machine until 1818, when he moved to London and held a number of performances with the Turk and many of his other machines. In London, Mälzel and his act received a large amount of press, and he continued improving the machine, ultimately installing a voice box so the machine could say "Échec!" when placing a player in check.

In 1819, Mälzel took the Turk on a tour of the United Kingdom. There were several new developments in the act, such as allowing the opponent the first move and eliminating the king's bishop's <a href="pawn%20%28chess%29">pawn</a> from the Turk's pieces. This <a href="Chess%20handicap%23Other%20forms%20of%20handicap">pawn handicap</a> created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by <a href="Jacques%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mouret">Mouret</a> at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two <a href="stalemate">stalemate</a>s.

The appearances of the Turk were profitable for Mälzel, and he continued by taking it and his other machines to the United States. In 1826, he opened an exhibition in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> that slowly grew in popularity, giving rise to many newspaper stories and anonymous threats of exposure of the secret. Mälzel's problem was finding a proper operator for the machine, having trained an unknown woman in France before coming to the United States. He ended up recalling a former operator, <a href="William%20Schlumberger">William Schlumberger</a>, from <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a> in Europe to come to America and work for him again once Mälzel was able to provide the money for Schlumberger's transport.

Upon Schlumberger's arrival, the Turk debuted in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, Mälzel spinning a story that the New York chess players could not handle full games and that the Boston players were much better opponents. This was a success for many weeks, and the tour moved to <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia</a> for three months. Following Philadelphia, the Turk moved to <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, where it played for a number of months, including losing a match against <a href="Charles%20Carroll%20of%20Carrollton">Charles Carroll</a>, a signer of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>. The exhibition in Baltimore brought news that two brothers had constructed their own machine, the <a href="Walker%20Chess-player">Walker Chess-player</a>. Mälzel viewed the competing machine and attempted to buy it, but the offer was declined and the duplicate machine toured for a number of years, never receiving the fame that Mälzel's machine did and eventually falling into obscurity.

Mälzel continued with exhibitions around the United States until 1828, when he took some time off and visited Europe, returning in 1829. Throughout the 1830s, he continued to tour the United States, exhibiting the machine as far west as the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and visiting <a href="Canada">Canada</a>. In <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, the Turk was observed by <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, who was writing for the "<a href="Southern%20Literary%20Messenger">Southern Literary Messenger</a>". Poe's essay "<a href="Maelzel%27s%20Chess%20Player">Maelzel's Chess Player</a>" was published in April 1836 and is the most famous essay on the Turk, even though many of Poe's hypotheses were incorrect (such as that a chess-playing machine must always win).

Mälzel eventually took the Turk on his second tour to <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. In Cuba, Schlumberger died of <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>, leaving Mälzel without an operator for his machine. Dejected, Mälzel died at sea in 1838 at the age of 66 during his return trip, leaving his machinery with the ship captain.

Upon the return of the ship on which Mälzel died, his various machines, including the Turk, fell into the hands of a friend of Mälzel's, the businessman John Ohl. He attempted to auction off the Turk, but owing to low bidding ultimately bought it himself for $400. Only when <a href="John%20Kearsley%20Mitchell">John Kearsley Mitchell</a> from Philadelphia, Edgar Allan Poe's personal physician and an admirer of the Turk, approached Ohl did the Turk change hands again. Mitchell formed a restoration club and went about the business of repairing the Turk for public appearances, completing the restoration in 1840.

As interest in the Turk outgrew its location, Mitchell and his club chose to donate the machine to the <a href="Peale%20Museum">Chinese Museum</a> of <a href="Charles%20Willson%20Peale">Charles Willson Peale</a>. While the Turk still occasionally gave performances, it was eventually relegated to the corners of the museum and forgotten about until 5 July 1854, when a fire that started at the National Theater in Philadelphia reached the Museum and destroyed the Turk. Mitchell believed he had heard "through the struggling flames ... the last words of our departed friend, the sternly whispered, oft repeated syllables, 'echec! echec!!

<a href="John%20Gaughan">John Gaughan</a>, an American manufacturer of equipment for magicians based in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, spent $120,000 building his own version of Kempelen's machine over a five-year period from 1984. The machine uses the original chessboard, which was stored separately from the original Turk and was not destroyed in the fire. The first public display of Gaughan's Turk was in November 1989 at a history of <a href="magic%20%28illusion%29">magic</a> conference. The machine was presented much as Kempelen presented the original, except that the opponent was replaced by a <a href="computer%20chess">computer running a chess program</a>.

While many books and articles were written during the Turk's life about how it worked, most were inaccurate, drawing incorrect inferences from external observation.

It was not until Dr. Silas Mitchell's series of articles for "<a href="The%20Chess%20Monthly">The Chess Monthly</a>" that the secret was fully revealed. Mitchell, son of the final private owner of the Turk, wrote that "no secret was ever kept as the Turk's has been. Guessed at, in part, many times, no one of the several explanations ... ever solved this amusing puzzle". As the Turk was lost to fire at the time of this publication, Silas Mitchell felt that there were "no longer any reasons for concealing from the amateurs of chess, the solution to this ancient enigma".

The most important biographical history about the Chess-player and Mälzel was presented in "The Book of the First American Chess Congress", published by <a href="Daniel%20Willard%20Fiske">Daniel Willard Fiske</a> in 1857. The account, "The Automaton Chess-Player in America," was written by Professor George Allen of Philadelphia, in the form of a letter to William Lewis, one of the former operators of the chess automaton.

In 1859, a letter published in the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Sunday%20Dispatch">Philadelphia Sunday Dispatch</a>" by William F. Kummer, who worked as an operator under John Mitchell, revealed another piece of the secret: a candle inside the cabinet. A series of tubes led from the lamp to the turban of the Turk for ventilation. The smoke rising from the turban would be disguised by the smoke coming from the other <a href="candelabra">candelabra</a> in the area where the game was played.

Later in 1859, an uncredited article appeared in "<a href="Littell%27s%20Living%20Age">Littell's Living Age</a>" that purported to be the story of the Turk from French magician <a href="Jean%20Eug%C3%A8ne%20Robert-Houdin">Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin</a>. This was rife with errors ranging from dates of events to a story of a Polish officer whose legs were amputated, but ended up being rescued by Kempelen and smuggled back to <a href="Russia">Russia</a> inside the machine.

A new article about the Turk did not turn up until 1899, when "<a href="The%20American%20Chess%20Magazine">The American Chess Magazine</a>" published an account of the Turk's match with Napoleon Bonaparte. The story was basically a review of previous accounts, and a substantive published account would not appear until 1947, when "<a href="Chess%20Review">Chess Review</a>" published articles by Kenneth Harkness and Jack Straley Battell that amounted to a comprehensive history and description of the Turk, complete with new diagrams that synthesized information from previous publications. Another article written in 1960 for "<a href="American%20Heritage%20%28magazine%29">American Heritage</a>" by Ernest Wittenberg provided new diagrams describing how the operator sat inside the cabinet.

In Henry A. Davidson's 1945 publication "A Short History of Chess", significant weight is given to Poe's essay which erroneously suggested that the player sat inside the Turk figure, rather than on a moving seat inside the cabinet. A similar error would occur in Alex G. Bell's 1978 book "The Machine Plays Chess", which falsely asserted that "the operator was a trained boy (or very small adult) who followed the directions of the chess player who was hidden elsewhere on stage or in the theater…"

More books were published about the Turk toward the end of the 20th century. Along with Bell's book, Charles Michael Carroll's "The Great Chess Automaton" (1975) focused more on the studies of the Turk. Bradley Ewart's "Chess: Man vs. Machine" (1980) discussed the Turk as well as other purported chess-playing automatons.

It was not until the creation of <a href="IBM%20Deep%20Blue">Deep Blue</a>, <a href="IBM">IBM</a>'s attempt at a computer that could challenge the world's best players, that interest increased again, and two more books were published: Gerald M. Levitt's "The Turk, Chess Automaton" (2000), and Tom Standage's "The Turk: The Life and Times of the Famous Eighteenth-Century Chess-Playing Machine", published in 2002. The Turk was used as a personification of Deep Blue in the 2003 documentary "".

Owing to the Turk's popularity and mystery, its construction inspired a number of inventions and imitations, including <a href="Ajeeb">Ajeeb</a>, or "The Egyptian", an American imitation built by Charles Hopper that <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> played in 1885, and <a href="Mephisto%20%28automaton%29">Mephisto</a>, the self-described "most famous" machine, of which little is known. The first imitation was made while Mälzel was in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>. Created by the Brothers Walker, the "American Chess Player" made its debut in May 1827 in New York. <a href="El%20Ajedrecista">El Ajedrecista</a> was built in 1912 by <a href="Leonardo%20Torres%20y%20Quevedo">Leonardo Torres y Quevedo</a> as a chess-playing automaton and made its public debut during the Paris World Fair of 1914. Capable of playing rook and king versus king endgames using electromagnets, it was the first true chess-playing automaton, and a precursor of sorts to <a href="Deep%20Blue%20%28chess%20computer%29">Deep Blue</a>.

The Turk was visited in London by Rev. <a href="Edmund%20Cartwright">Edmund Cartwright</a> in 1784. He was so intrigued by the Turk that he would later question whether "it is more difficult to construct a machine that shall weave than one which shall make all the variety of moves required in that complicated game". Cartwright would patent the <a href="prototype">prototype</a> for a <a href="power%20loom">power loom</a> within the year. <a href="Charles%20Wheatstone">Sir Charles Wheatstone</a>, an inventor, saw a later appearance of the Turk while it was owned by Mälzel. He also saw some of Mälzel's speaking machines, and Mälzel later presented a demonstration of the speaking machines to the researcher and his teenage son. <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a> obtained a copy of a book by <a href="Wolfgang%20von%20Kempelen">Wolfgang von Kempelen</a> on speaking machines after being inspired by seeing a similar machine built by Wheatstone; Bell went on to <a href="Invention%20of%20the%20telephone">file the first successful patent for the telephone</a>.

A play, "The Automaton Chess Player", was presented in New York City in 1845. The advertising, as well as an article that appeared in "The Illustrated London News", claimed that the play featured Kempelen's Turk, but it was in fact a copy of the Turk created by J. Walker, who had earlier presented the Walker Chess-player.

<a href="Raymond%20Bernard">Raymond Bernard's</a> silent feature film "<a href="The%20Chess%20Player">The Chess Player</a>" ("The Chess Player", France 1927) weaves elements from the real story of the Turk into an adventure tale set in the aftermath of the first of the <a href="Partitions%20of%20Poland">Partitions of Poland</a> in 1772. The film's "Baron von Kempelen" helps a dashing young Polish nationalist on the run from the occupying Russians, who also happens to be an expert chess player, by hiding him inside a chess playing automaton called the Turk, closely based on the real Kempelen model. Just as they are about to escape over the border, the Baron is summoned to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> to present the Turk to the empress <a href="Catherine%20the%20Great">Catherine II</a>. In an echo of the Napoleon incident, Catherine attempts to cheat the Turk, who wipes all the pieces from the board in response.

The Turk has also inspired works of literary fiction. In 1849, just a few years before the Turk was destroyed, <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> published a tale "Von Kempelen and His Discovery". <a href="Ambrose%20Bierce">Ambrose Bierce</a>'s short story "<a href="Moxon%27s%20Master">Moxon's Master</a>", published in 1909, is a morbid tale about a chess-playing automaton that resembles the Turk. In 1938, <a href="John%20Dickson%20Carr">John Dickson Carr</a> published "<a href="The%20Crooked%20Hinge">The Crooked Hinge</a>", a <a href="locked-room%20mystery">locked-room mystery</a> in his line of <a href="Gideon%20Fell">Dr. Gideon Fell</a> detective novels. Among the puzzles presented included an automaton that operates in a way that is unexplainable to the characters. <a href="Gene%20Wolfe">Gene Wolfe</a>'s 1977 <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> short story "The Marvellous Brass Chessplaying Automaton" also features a device very similar to the Turk. <a href="Robert%20L%C3%B6hr">Robert Loehr's</a> 2007 novel "The Chess Machine" (published in the UK as "The Secrets of the Chess Machine") focuses on the man inside the machine. <a href="F.%20Gwynplaine%20MacIntyre">F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre</a>'s 2007 story "The Clockwork Horror" reconstructs Edgar Allan Poe's original encounter with Mälzel's chess-player, and also establishes (from contemporary advertisements in a Richmond newspaper) precisely when and where this encounter took place.

<a href="Walter%20Benjamin">Walter Benjamin</a> alludes to the Mechanical Turk in the first thesis of his "<a href="Theses%20on%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20History">Theses on the Philosophy of History</a>" ("Über den Begriff der Geschichte"), written in 1940.

In 2005, <a href="Amazon%20%28company%29">Amazon.com</a> launched the <a href="Amazon%20Mechanical%20Turk">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>. The <a href="World%20Wide%20Web">Web-based</a> <a href="Application%20software">software application</a> coordinates <a href="computer%20programming">programming</a> tasks with human intelligence, inspired in part by the way Kempelen's Turk operated. The program is designed to have humans perform tasks with which computers struggle, such as color comparisons.

Final Fantasy XI

Final Fantasy XI, also known as Final Fantasy XI Online, is a <a href="massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a> (MMORPG), developed and published by <a href="Square%20%28company%29">Square</a> (later <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a>) as part of the "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" series. Designed and produced by <a href="Hiromichi%20Tanaka">Hiromichi Tanaka</a>, it was released in Japan on May 16, 2002, for <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>-based <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s in November of that year. The game was the first MMORPG to offer <a href="cross-platform%20play">cross-platform play</a> between PlayStation 2 and personal computer. It was also the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>'s first MMORPG. All versions of the game require a monthly subscription to play.

The story is set in the <a href="fantasy%20world">fantasy world</a> of Vana'diel, where player-created <a href="Avatar%20%28computing%29">avatars</a> can both compete and cooperate in a variety of objectives to develop an assortment of jobs, skills, and earn in-game item rewards. Players can undertake an array of quests and progress through the in-game hierarchy and through the major plot of the game. Since its debut in 2002, five expansion packs have been released along with six add-on scenarios. Each expansion pack and add-on brings a new major storyline to the "Final Fantasy XI" world, along with numerous areas, quests, events and item rewards.

In 2015, Square Enix released the final main scenario for "Final Fantasy XI" titled "Rhapsodies of Vana'diel". "Final Fantasy XI" became the final active server on the PlayStation 2 online service. The servers for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 versions were ultimately shut down on March 31, 2016. A mobile client for the game is under development by Square Enix in collaboration with Korean developer <a href="Nexon">Nexon</a>. A spinoff mobile game, "Final Fantasy Grandmasters" was released on September 30, 2015.

"Final Fantasy XI" is a <a href="massively%20multiplayer%20online%20role-playing%20game">massively multiplayer online role-playing game</a> (MMORPG), and differs from <a href="List%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%20media">previous titles in the series</a> in several ways. Unlike the predefined main characters of previous "Final Fantasy" titles, players are able to customize their characters in limited ways, including selecting from one of five races and choosing their gender, facial style, hair color, body size, job, and nation allegiance. Also diverging from previous games in the series, the game takes place in a fully <a href="three-dimensional%20space">three-dimensional landscape</a> with enemies freely roaming in it, allowing battles to occur in real time as opposed to the <a href="random%20encounter">random encounter</a>s used in previous games - a trend continued in every numbered "Final Fantasy" title since.

There are currently 16 public <a href="game%20server">game worlds</a> available for play, down from 32 at the game's height, with approximately 15,000 to 20,000 players in each. A private Test Server was opened to eligible players to aid in feedback of updates in development for the game in mid-2011. The servers are named after summoned monsters from previous "Final Fantasy" titles, such as Ifrit and Diabolos. Players have the ability to move between servers, though Square-Enix charges a "world transfer" fee to do so. There are no region-specific or system-specific servers, and unlike most online games, players of different languages play in the same world and can interact through automatic language translation from a library of translated phrases. The game servers are run by Square-Enix as part of their <a href="PlayOnline">PlayOnline</a> network.

Players have the option of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and <a href="game%20controller">controller</a> to play "Final Fantasy XI". While by default, a player using a PlayStation 2 or an Xbox 360 uses a virtual/in-game keyboard option, the player is able to use an external keyboard that is USB compatible for communication within the game. The <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">heads-up display</a> in "Final Fantasy XI" consists of a log window, menus, and several game information elements. The log window at the bottom of the screen displays system messages, battle messages, and text input by other players. Players may choose to filter what appears in the log window. "Menus" allow the player to access different commands, status windows, and configuration options. The "action command menu" appears just above the log window and gives the player several options to interact with the game world. Several menu options are available through the use of keyboard shortcuts, as well.

Story related gameplay in "Final Fantasy XI" consists of two major components: missions, through which the main storyline of the game is told, and <a href="quest%20%28video%20gaming%29">quests</a>, which do not advance the main storyline, but fill out the game's fantasy world. Completing missions allows a player to advance in rank, which grants access to new areas, several privileges, and various other storylines. At first, a player may only complete missions for his home nation, though they are able to change allegiances later on, allowing access to other nations' storylines. Quests may be undertaken for their various rewards, or to acquire "fame," which allows a character to become well-known and respected by NPCs; a higher fame rating will open up new interactions and quests with NPCs. At release, over one hundred quests were available to play and each expansion pack has added its own set of missions and quests. Players obtain in-game money known as <a href="Gil%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29%23gil">gil</a> by completing missions, quests and defeating Beastmen, though unlike previous "Final Fantasy" games, these monsters drop only small amounts. Gil can then be exchanged amongst players for goods through the Auction House, or be used to purchase items and rewards from NPCs.
Unlike some MMORPGs, there is very little focus on <a href="player%20versus%20player">player versus player</a> (PvP) combat, instead the game revolves around <a href="player%20versus%20environment">player versus environment</a> (PvE). There are numerous PvE activities and events for players to partake in, including <a href="Instance%20dungeon">instanced</a> activities and shared spaces activities. Some instanced events include Dynamis, Salvage, Assault and Nyzul Isle, which involve anywhere between 6 and 64 players. These battle grounds give players a series of objectives to overcome or complete and enemies to defeat, generally within a certain time frame. Popular shared spaces activities include hunting <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">Notorious Monsters</a>, fiends that rarely appear and drop precious loot.

The only way to attack other players in PvP is to enter one of two competition activities known as "Conflict". The first form of competition, called Ballista, involves players competing to score points by throwing petras into a castle-like structure known as a Rook. The second form is known as "Brenner", and features a capture the flag type system.

From time to time special seasonal festivals and events are held. They last only for a set period of time and offer a variety of fun or useful rewards. Many events have changed over time, adding new features and eliminating old ones. These events are geared towards any level, often restricting players to level 1, so that veterans and novice players alike can join in together. Events celebrated are often thematically based on real life equivalents, for example: Valentione's Day in place of <a href="Valentine%27s%20Day">Valentine's Day</a>, the Egg Hunt Egg-stravaganza in place of <a href="Easter">Easter</a>, and the Starlight Celebration in place of <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>.

Battles in "Final Fantasy XI" take place in the world in which players move around, a first in the series, where battle had previously taken place in a separate screen via <a href="random%20encounter">random encounter</a>s. The surprise of the random encounter system is achieved via aggressive monsters, who will attack players based on different factors such as sight and sound. This format would continue in future "Final Fantasy" games. Monsters within the game operate under a system of "claim" and "<a href="wikt%3Aenmity">enmity</a>". A monster is claimed the moment a player performs any offensive action upon it, whether physical, magical or ability related. With some exceptions, once a monster is claimed it can only be attacked by players in the party or alliance of the player that claimed it. A monster will focus its attention on whoever has built up the most enmity. Players have several means at their disposal, including spells, abilities and items, to build up enmity or shed it to their advantage in battle - a factor that features heavily in group, or "party" play.

To defeat more powerful monsters and gain <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s efficiently, players can join a party. A regular party has room for six members. Like in many other games, a well-balanced party will consist of several archetypes- namely a healer, a tank (the party member with high defense that will be the main target of the monster), and the damage dealer. The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties, as players try to keep the monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks. A well-balanced team working together is the only way to defeat many of the game's enemies.

A party can expand into an alliance, with up to three parties combined, with a total of 18 players. Alliances are necessary to complete more difficult challenges: including missions, quests, nation or territory driven events, and defeating notorious monsters. Much of end-game play consists of alliance forces overcoming these higher level challenges and can even allow several alliances to enter into specific instances owned by a group of players (e.g. Dynamis instances entry is controlled by an hourglass item).

"Final Fantasy XI"s incarnation of <a href="Limit%20Break">Limit Break</a>s are "Weapon Skills". Physical damage given and received fills a Tactical Points (TP) bar, to a maximum of 3000. Any amount above 1000 is able to be used up by being channelled into a weapon skill. These skills vary in effect depending on job class, what weapon is equipped, how full the TP bar is, and how proficient the player is with the weapon. If partying with other players, one may use these weapon skills in succession in order to create a "Skillchain". A skillchain creates additional damage after a series of weapon skills are used. Building on this even further, magic used on a skillchain at the right time will receive a boost to its damage; this is called a "Magic Burst". In order to create the best possible skillchains and magic bursts, players must work together, focusing on each other's actions and timing.

"Final Fantasy XI" uses the concept of changing Jobs in a similar fashion to "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20III">Final Fantasy III</a>", and currently has twenty-two Jobs as of the latest expansion pack in 2013. There are six "standard Jobs" available to choose from at the start of the game. After one standard Job has reached Level 30, the "extra Jobs" are accessible upon completing certain quests. Players are able to change their jobs any time from inside their house or by speaking with a Nomad Moogle. In June 2010, the long-standing level limit of 75 was incrementally increased to the higher level cap of 99, finishing in the December 2011 version update.

Jobs have a combination of unique "job traits", "job abilities", and magic spells, giving them a specific role within group play due to their area of expertise. Job traits are passive abilities that are always in effect, while job abilities must be activated by the player in order to come into effect. They last a limited time and have a "cooldown" period before they can be used again. Magic spells are available to certain jobs, and in addition to a cooldown period, they often consume <a href="Magic%20point">MP</a> or some form of item in order to be cast, while at the same time requiring the user to stand still. Additionally, each job has a special one-hour ability that performs an extraordinary function.

The unique system of "Final Fantasy XI"s job system is the "Support Job". This system allows a player to augment their character with abilities, traits, and spells from another chosen job, at half the level of their current job. For instance, a Level 20 Warrior setting Ninja as their support job would allow them to use all Ninja abilities, traits, and spells up to that of a level 10 Ninja, while still primarily being a Level 20 Warrior. The support job system allows for job-merges never before seen in the "Final Fantasy" series. However, there are some exceptions to the system. One-hour abilities and other abilities deemed signature to a particular job (such as Call Wyvern for Dragoons) are restricted to being used only on the main job.

In addition to completing quests and missions, players can participate in several side-<a href="minigame">minigame</a>s and other activities. One such minigame is fishing, where players can measure their strength against the fish they attempt to catch. Another is clamming, where players collect as many fish or sea creatures as possible without going over their bucket's size limit. Gardening allows players to raise plants in their residence, or "<a href="Moogle">Mog</a> House" as it is known in the game. The raising and breeding of <a href="Chocobo">Chocobo</a>s was a long-requested activity enabled in the summer 2006 update. Chocobo racing began in March 2007, which allowed for the racing of player-raised Chocobos against <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s (NPCs). Winning racers can earn "Chocobucks", which can be used to buy, for example, items that assist Chocobo breeding.

An important part of the game is the accumulation of items, especially rare ones, which allow players to create powerful weapons, armour and food. There are many ways to obtain items, such as harvesting, excavating, logging, mining, defeating monsters, and digging by using Chocobos. Square Enix attempted to increase the opportunity for players to find rare items in order to equalize the game and stop the practice of "gil selling", or exchanging real money for in-game items. The item auction system was shut down temporarily once due to some players exploiting the system. Items can be created by consuming elemental crystals (obtained by fighting monsters) with other ingredients in a process called "synthesis". Recipe results can vary widely based on the player's skill, the quality of the player's equipment worn, and the ingredients used. There is large speculation (though nothing evidently documented yet) about the moon phase, direction the player is facing, in-game day (every day of the week is assigned an element), and even time of day the synthesis is performed to either increase or reduce the results of the recipe.

"Final Fantasy XI" has a largely player-based economy, with a heavy reliance on <a href="auction%20house">auction house</a>s in each of the major cities of Vana'diel. There are certain economic controls in place mainly in the form of fees for putting items up for auction. Transportation, auction house, item storage, and fees do not go to players; these <a href="gold%20sink">gil sinks</a> effectively remove money from the economy to prevent <a href="inflation">inflation</a>. The city of Jeuno used to levy a tax on bazaar purchases inside the city, but it was removed in a patch in the December 2008 version update.

Square Enix has stated that the trade of items for real currency is officially a violation of the <a href="Terms%20of%20Service">Terms of Service</a> for "Final Fantasy XI". In early 2006, Square Enix discovered that a group of players had found a way to generate game currency and exchange it for real currency, which, in turn, drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300 billion gil was removed from circulation. In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce. Since 2006, Square Enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation of the terms, some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.

The setting of "Final Fantasy XI" is the world of Vana'diel, a rich world with diverse climates, ranging from northern glaciers and southern deserts, to ethereal realms and sky landmasses. Vana'diel is divided into a number of regions, which are subdivided into areas known as "zones". These zones are available for exploration and consist of outdoor areas, dungeons, cities, and towns. Players are able to explore a portion of Vana'diel, including the Middle Lands, Near East, and with the release of "Seekers of Adoulin", the near west. Six city states exist in the available lands, The Republic of Bastok, The Kingdom of San d'Oria, The Federation of Windurst, The Grand Duchy of Jeuno, The Empire of Aht Urhgan and the Sacred City of Adoulin. While most areas are accessible by walking, various modes of transportation, ranging from the classic "Final Fantasy" <a href="Chocobo">Chocobo</a> and <a href="Gameplay%20of%20Final%20Fantasy%23Airships%20and%20transport">airships</a> to special spells, facilitate movement across the game world.

Ancient lore states that Vana'diel was created as a playground for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient <a href="Crystal%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Crystal</a>. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast to the bottom of the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and the envy of the Mithra. He created the <a href="Final%20Fantasy%20bestiary%20%28A-E%29%23Monsters">Beastmen</a>, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several "Final Fantasy XI" expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.

The events of the game are set 20 years after the Crystal War, a devastating war where the Middle Land nations of Bastok, San d'Oria and Windurst fought and defeated the Shadow Lord and his army of Beastmen. Players deal with the aftermath of this conflict in the original story, and may travel back in time to aid in the war effort with the expansion pack "Wings of the Goddess". Several <a href="Parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">parallel worlds</a> are available, such as Dynamis and Abyssea, in which the beastmen won the Crystal War and conquered the land.

"Final Fantasy XI" features five playable races known as the "Enlightened Races":





In addition to the playable races, there are two other non-playable Enlightened Races, known as the Zilart and the Kuluu. These ancient races were thought extinct, and are the focus of the first two-game expansions. There is also a large supporting cast of NPCs involved in quests, missions and the game's storylines. The game features several typical <a href="Monsters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy">"Final Fantasy" fiends</a>, including Goblins, Sahagins and Tonberries. Several of these races are known as Beastmen, a distinction made between fiends who possess higher than average intelligence, exhibiting self-awareness, emotions, culture, and religion. The complex relationship, bigoted views, and reasons of conflict between the Enlightened Races and Beastmen is a plot point throughout the game.

"Final Fantasy XI" is represented in the "<a href="Dissidia%20Final%20Fantasy">Dissidia</a>" game series by Shantotto, a female Tarutaru Black Mage from the Windurst storyline, voiced by famed voice actress <a href="Megumi%20Hayashibara">Megumi Hayashibara</a> in the Japanese version and <a href="Candi%20Milo">Candi Milo</a> in English version. The game's <a href="Dissidia%20012%20Final%20Fantasy">prequel</a> adds Prishe, a female Elvaan from Tavnazia, who is the main character in the "Chains of Promathia" expansion pack.

The storyline is primarily followed with missions through the governing nations that exist in the base game as well as each expansion that the player is affiliated with. Nation or governing body affiliation is relatively simple, sometimes requiring prerequisite quests being completed and have several stages of progression to achieve higher recognition and reward throughout each story. Some missions are even required to be completed to further progress into the start of the additional storylines of each expansion or specific areas.

Players begin the game as residents of one of the three main countries: San d'Oria, Bastok, and Windurst, and must help band the nations together against the resurrected Shadow Lord.

The expansion "Rise of the Zilart" reveals that the Crystal War and the resurrection of the Shadow Lord had been masterminded by the Zilart princes Eald'Narche and Kam'lanaut, who survived the extinction of their race. The two Zilarts plan to become Gods by opening the path to <a href="paradise">paradise</a>, and the player is charged with thwarting their plans.

"Chains of Promathia" revolves around an Elvaan girl named Prishe and the dead Twilight God Promathia, who had originally cursed the Zilart race, and the attempts of various factions to either complete or stop his resurrection. The wyrmking <a href="Bahamut">Bahamut</a> is involved in these events, and intends to destroy Vana'diel to prevent Promathia from absorbing the life of the world.

"Treasures of Aht Urhgan" concerns the Empire of Aht Urhgan which opens up to the nations of midlands after years of self-imposed isolation. As a new and powerful nation, it is of concern to the nation of the player, who is sent as a representative. The player then becomes embroiled in the intrigues of the Empress's court and the growing fears of war and darkness coming to Aht Urhgan.

"Wings of the Goddess" primarily occurs in the era of the Crystal War, 20 years in the past from the main "Final Fantasy XI" setting. The player discovers and crosses mysterious <a href="time%20portal">time portal</a>s alongside the Hume/Elvaan mix Lilisette, and are led to help the Regal Feline <a href="Cat%20S%C3%ACth">Cait Sith</a> reduce the suffering of the era. However, Lilisette and her partner encounter Lilith, an alternate timeline version of herself who wishes to keep the war going to maintain her time while negating Lilisette's.

"Seekers of Adoulin" concerns the western continent archipelago of Adoulin, and the Sacred City of Adoulin. The city was a focal point for colonization 200 years before the present game, but when colonization efforts failed in the main continent of Ulbuka, the nation fell in population and shifted to trade as a focus. Now colonization has begun once again, and players are free to explore the region.

"Rhapsodies of Vana'diel" concerns the conclusion of the "Final Fantasy XI" storyline with the threat posed by the Cloud of Darkness and an alternate timeline version of the player.

The idea to develop "Final Fantasy XI" as an online game was conceived by <a href="Hironobu%20Sakaguchi">Hironobu Sakaguchi</a> when establishing <a href="Square%20Pictures">Square Pictures</a> headquarters in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. Impressed by western MMORPGs that he discovered there, such as "<a href="EverQuest">EverQuest</a>", Sakaguchi convinced <a href="Square%20Co.">Square</a> to begin the development of their own MMORPG and suggested that it be based on the "Final Fantasy" series. The team responsible for "<a href="Chrono%20Cross">Chrono Cross</a>" was assigned to the development of "Final Fantasy XI" after the English <a href="language%20localisation">localization</a> of the former title. Development began in November 1999. The game was the first developed under Square's new philosophy to develop for "all platforms and media". <a href="Hiromichi%20Tanaka">Hiromichi Tanaka</a>, the producer of the game, has stated "Final Fantasy XI" is heavily influenced by "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20III">Final Fantasy III</a>", especially in its battle and magic systems. According to Tanaka, Square put in "Final Fantasy XI" what they could not put in the first "Final Fantasy" titles due to technical limitations, thus making "Final Fantasy XI" the "most [representative] "Final Fantasy" of all the episodes". The game was developed and ran on the <a href="Nvidia">Nvidia</a> <a href="GeForce%204%20Series">GeForce 4 Ti</a> <a href="graphics%20processing%20unit">GPU</a>, which the President of Square <a href="Yoichi%20Wada">Yoichi Wada</a> described as the most powerful graphics processor available at the time. The game cost two to three billion yen (~$17–25 million) to create along with the <a href="PlayOnline">PlayOnline</a> Network Service and was assumed to become profitable over a five-year timespan. By creating a unified game world instead of different ones <a href="balkanization">balkanized</a> by language, development costs were cut 66%. Since recurring <a href="monsters%20of%20Final%20Fantasy">monsters of the series</a> are known by different names in the Japanese and English versions of the other installments, it was decided for "Final Fantasy XI" to use both Japanese and English names for different varieties of the same monsters.
It was originally announced that there would be a simultaneous release on the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> as well as concurrent Japanese and American release, but this was later changed. There was also discussion of an <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> release, but it was abandoned mainly because of its small 8 GB hard drive. Originally announced in January 2000 at the Yokohama Millennium Conference, there was a great deal of negative press. There were questions raised about naming the game the eleventh in the series, since it was not clear whether the game would have a structured story, which it ended up having, and the title of "Final Fantasy Online" was suggested. Following an August 2001 <a href="beta%20test">beta test</a> in Japan, a public Japanese beta test was done in December 2001.

Following its PC release, "Final Fantasy XI" was listed as one of <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s most anticipated PlayStation 2 games of 2004.
<a href="Sony">Sony</a> launched a multimillion-dollar ad campaign to promote "Final Fantasy XI" along with the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> hard drive add-on which the game required. Having been released on the PlayStation 2 as well as the personal computer, it became the first <a href="cross-platform">cross-platform</a> MMORPG ever created. On June 14, 2002, the game server was down for four hours for maintenance to the database servers, bug fixes on the text interface, and a new patch for the game client. This is thought to be the first patch ever released for a console game. Other early issues included complaints by American players that experienced Japanese players had already completed all the quests. Square Enix responded by adding new servers in order to have game worlds with fewer expert players.

"Final Fantasy XI" is one of the first cross-console video games, and has continued to update its software to allow the game to run on new consoles. On 8 March 2007, a patch was released to enable gameplay in French and German. Square Enix noted that <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s use of "<a href="Friend%20Code">friend codes</a>" was the primary reason "Final Fantasy XI" was not brought to the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>. In December 2006, the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> versions of PlayOnline and "Final Fantasy XI" were able to install and run on the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>. The "Vana'diel Collection 2008" discs for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> had installation issues on the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>, causing them to be unusable at first since they weren't on Sony's list of HDD compatible titles in the <a href="firmware">firmware</a> the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> had at the time. This problem was fixed on December 18, 2007 when Sony released <a href="firmware">firmware</a> update 2.10 for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>. This allowed all backwards compatible models—20GB model #CECHB01, 60GB model #CECHA01 and 80GB model #CECHE01—to play FFXI. After working with <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> to resolve "Final Fantasy XI"s incompatibility issues with <a href="Windows%20Vista">Windows Vista</a>, Square Enix released a downloadable version of the PlayOnline client which is compatible with the operating system, although small bugs have appeared.

On September 1, 2010, <a href="Akihiko%20Matsui">Akihiko Matsui</a> became the director of "Final Fantasy XI". Only three months later, on December 10, 2010, Matsui left the "Final Fantasy XI" team to work as "Lead Combat System Designer" on Square Enix's new MMO, "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIV%20%282010%20video%20game%29">Final Fantasy XIV</a>". His replacement as director of "Final Fantasy XI" is Mizuki Ito. On July 13, 2011, information from a <a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a> interview with former "Final Fantasy XI" producer <a href="Hiromichi%20Tanaka">Hiromichi Tanaka</a> revealed that <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a> is looking into the possibility of porting "Final Fantasy XI" to <a href="Sony">Sony</a> <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>. On June 24, 2012, at the end of VanaFest 2012, a festival in Yokohama, Japan to celebrate 2012's tenth anniversary of the Japanese launch of "Final Fantasy XI", <a href="Hiromichi%20Tanaka">Hiromichi Tanaka</a> announced that, due to health reasons, he was stepping down as producer of the game and leaving Square-Enix. <a href="Akihiko%20Matsui">Akihiko Matsui</a> has been selected to replace him.

In 2006, between 200,000 and 300,000 active players logged in per day, with 500,000 total active players and around 150,000 online at any one time. In April 2009, Square Enix announced that the total number of active characters exceeded 2 million for the first time. In June 2012, Square Enix president <a href="Yoichi%20Wada">Yoichi Wada</a> announced that "Final Fantasy XI" had become the most profitable title in the "Final Fantasy" series.

The music of "Final Fantasy XI" was scored by <a href="Naoshi%20Mizuta">Naoshi Mizuta</a>, <a href="Kumi%20Tanioka">Kumi Tanioka</a>, and <a href="Nobuo%20Uematsu">Nobuo Uematsu</a>. Composer <a href="Yasunori%20Mitsuda">Yasunori Mitsuda</a> was also asked to contribute, but at the time he was unable to do so, as he was scoring the music for "<a href="Xenosaga">Xenosaga</a>". The game's five expansion packs since were scored by Mizuta alone, after Tanioka left to pursue other projects and Uematsu left Square Enix. The opening of the game features choral music with lyrics in <a href="Esperanto">Esperanto</a>. According to Uematsu, the choice of language was meant to symbolize the developers' hope that their online game could contribute to cross-cultural communication and cooperation. He also noted the increased difficulty of scoring a game for which there was no linear plotline, a major change from the previous "Final Fantasy" games. It was the first game in the series for which he composed while he was no longer a Square Enix employee. New music has been employed for special events, such as a holiday score titled "Jeuno -Starlight Celebration-" which can be heard in the city of Jeuno each mid-to-late December since 2004.

The game's music has been released in CD form several times and has been featured in "Final Fantasy" concerts. Some of the game's music has been released on <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>, such as the vocal "Distant Worlds", which was released on the Japanese iTunes store on September 13, 2005, having been put in the game in a July 2005 patch. A compilation CD box was released on March 28, 2007, titled "Final Fantasy XI Original Soundtrack Premium Box", which included the four original soundtracks from "Final Fantasy XI" and its three expansion sets, as well as the previously unreleased tracks from the game and the unreleased "Final Fantasy XI Piano Collections". <a href="Dear%20Friends%20-Music%20from%20Final%20Fantasy-">Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy-</a>, a 2004–2005 concert series, featured "Ronfaure" from "Final Fantasy XI". A ten-track album of music inspired by "Final Fantasy XI" entitled "Music from the Other Side of Vana'diel" was released by <a href="Star%20onions">The Star Onions</a> on August 24, 2005.

"Final Fantasy XI" has additions released every few years. Expansion packs add new story, jobs, zones, quests, and content to the game, while add-ons are smaller in scale, adding a smaller selection of the aforementioned items. All of the expansions and add-ons have been released on <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a>, with the exception of "Seekers of Adoulin", which did not see a PlayStation 2 release outside Japan.

"Final Fantasy XI" received positive reviews from critics. Aggregating review websites <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> and <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> gave the PlayStation 2 version 85% based on 57 reviews and 85/100 based on 49 reviews, the PC version 82% based on 44 reviews and 85/100 based on 25 reviews the Xbox 360 version 69% based on 32 reviews and 66/100 based on 25 reviews. "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" rated the game 38 out of 40. "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games Magazine</a>" noted that it was one of the most welcoming MMORPGs despite the cumbersome initial registration and setup. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> called it a well done but unoriginal game and also noted that North American players were forced to play with already much more experienced Japanese players who had already completed the game's various quests. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> criticized it at release for having an unconventional control system, a lengthy installation, and having no player versus player (PvP) aspects. Other elements receiving criticism include the EXP grind, which involves constant battles to access different parts of the game, and overcrowded camp sites. The expansions have been mostly positively received, with praise for the amount of content added, but increasing signs that the graphics of the game are becoming outdated. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> review of the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> release was similar, noting that it was a large amount of game content, but had a protracted setup process and elements of the game design that require a large time investment. It has also been noted that this game is the first to move in a wildly different direction while remaining in the main numbering line, as opposed to the Tactics and Crystal Chronicles games which became their own side series.

The user base for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> version was truncated initially because of limited sales of the PlayStation 2's hard drive and network adapters that were needed for the game. The Japanese release of "Rise of the Zilart" was the number one selling game when it debuted in 2003 with 90,000 copies sold in the first week. The "Treasures of Aht Urhgan", released three years later, sold over 103,000 copies for the PlayStation 2 in Japan during 2006. In the United States, "Final Fantasy XI"s computer version sold 340,000 copies ($15.5 million) by August 2006, after its release in October 2003. It was the country's 51st best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. The "Final Fantasy XI All-in-One Pack" was number 36 and "Wings of the Goddess" was number 40 on the top 50 best-selling <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> games in Japan as of December 2007. For the April–September 2004 financial period, Square Enix saw online gaming, particularly "Final Fantasy XI", sales increase by 101 percent and operating profit increase by 230.9 percent. Revenues held steady from subscription services in the summer of 2006; in the fall, however, Square acknowledged that online subscription revenues were "unsatisfactory", despite the steady performance of Final Fantasy XI. In December 2003, Square Enix president <a href="Yoichi%20Wada">Yoichi Wada</a> announced that there were over 200,000 subscribers to "Final Fantasy XI", allowing the company to break even and start making a profit. There were between 200,000 and 300,000 active players daily in 2006. As of August 14, 2006 the Xbox 360 version was the sixth most played game on <a href="Xbox%20Live">Xbox Live</a>. In June 2012, Square Enix president <a href="Yoichi%20Wada">Yoichi Wada</a> announced that "Final Fantasy XI" had become the most profitable title in the "Final Fantasy" series. While many MMOs have switched to some form of free-to-play model, the base monthly subscription price point for "Final Fantasy XI" has remained the same since its debut in 2002.

"Final Fantasy XI" was awarded the grand prize from the Japan's Consumer Entertainment Software Association (CESA) for 2002–2003 along with "<a href="Taiko%20no%20Tatsujin">Taiko no Tatsujin</a>". It has also received <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s 2003 PC MMORPG Game of the Year Award and IGN's Game of the Month for March 2004, citing the game's huge customization and its successful cross-platform and cross-language game world. "Final Fantasy XI" was referenced in the online game "<a href="Everybody%27s%20Golf%20%28series%29">Minna no Golf Online</a>" in the form of a "Final Fantasy XI"-themed lobby. At 2009's Electronic Entertainment Expo, Square Enix revealed "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20XIV%20%282010%20video%20game%29">Final Fantasy XIV</a> Online", which was Square Enix's next MMORPG.

The game has spawned several written adaptations and related merchandise. Starting in 2003, a series of "Final Fantasy XI" novels was written by Miyabi Hasegawa and released in Japanese, German, and French. Additionally, in 2004, "Adventure Log", a <a href="webcomic">webcomic</a> by <a href="Scott%20Ramsoomair">Scott Ramsoomair</a>, was commissioned by Square Enix starting in 2007. "Final Fantasy XI" <a href="PlayOnline">PlayOnline</a> <a href="Visa%20%28company%29">Visa</a> and <a href="MasterCard">MasterCard</a> credit cards were available in Japan, with features including no annual fees as long as cardholders remain PlayOnline subscribers and various other rewards.

Daniel Lambert

Daniel Lambert ( 1770 – 1809) was a <a href="Prison">gaol</a> keeper and <a href="Animal%20husbandry">animal breeder</a> from <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, England, famous for his unusually large size. After serving four years as an apprentice at an <a href="engraving">engraving</a> and <a href="die%20casting">die casting</a> works in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, he returned to Leicester around 1788 and succeeded his father as keeper of Leicester's gaol. He was a keen sportsman and extremely strong; on one occasion he fought a bear in the streets of Leicester. He was an expert in <a href="sporting%20animals">sporting animals</a>, widely respected for his expertise with dogs, horses and <a href="Cockfight">fighting cocks</a>.

At the time of Lambert's return to Leicester, his weight began to increase steadily, even though he was athletically active and, by his own account, abstained from drinking alcohol and did not eat unusual amounts of food. In 1805, Lambert's gaol closed. By this time, he weighed , and had become the heaviest authenticated person up to that point in <a href="recorded%20history">recorded history</a>. Unemployable and sensitive about his bulk, Lambert became a recluse.

In 1806, poverty forced Lambert to put himself on exhibition to raise money. In , he took up residence in London, charging spectators to enter his apartments to meet him. Visitors were impressed by his intelligence and personality, and visiting him became highly fashionable. After some months on public display, Lambert grew tired of exhibiting himself, and in , he returned, wealthy, to Leicester, where he bred sporting dogs and regularly attended sporting events. Between 1806 and 1809, he made a further series of short fundraising tours.

In June 1809, he died suddenly in <a href="Stamford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Stamford</a>. At the time of his death, he weighed , and his coffin required of wood. Despite the coffin being built with wheels to allow easy transport, and a sloping approach being dug to the grave, it took 20 men almost half an hour to drag his casket into the trench, in a newly opened <a href="burial%20ground">burial ground</a> to the rear of <a href="St%20Martin%27s%20Church%2C%20Stamford">St Martin's Church</a>. While others have since overtaken Daniel Lambert's record as the <a href="List%20of%20the%20heaviest%20people">heaviest person in history</a>, he remains a popular character in Leicester, and in 2009 was described by the "<a href="Leicester%20Mercury">Leicester Mercury</a>" as "one of the city's most cherished icons".

Daniel Lambert was born at his parents' house in Blue Boar Lane, <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, on 13 March 1770. His father, also named Daniel Lambert, had been the <a href="fox%20hunting">huntsman</a> to <a href="Harry%20Grey%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Stamford">Harry Grey, 4th Earl of Stamford</a>, and at the time of his son's birth was the keeper of Leicester's gaol. The eldest of four children, Daniel Lambert had two sisters, and a brother who died young.

At the age of eight he was a keen swimmer, and for much of his life he taught local children to swim. Lambert's paternal uncle—like his father—also worked with animals, but as a professional <a href="gamekeeper">gamekeeper</a>; his maternal grandfather was a breeder of champion <a href="fighting%20cock">fighting cock</a>s. Lambert grew up with a strong interest in field sports, and was particularly fond of <a href="otter">otter</a> hunting, fishing, <a href="Shooting%20sports">shooting</a> and <a href="horse%20racing">horse racing</a>. From his early teens, Lambert was a keen sportsman and by his late teens he was considered an expert in the breeding of <a href="hunting%20dog">hunting dog</a>s.

In 1784, he was apprenticed to Messrs Taylor & Co, an engraving and <a href="die%20casting">die casting</a> works in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> owned by a Mr Benjamin Patrick. The engraved buckles and buttons in which Patrick's factory specialised became unfashionable, however, and the business went into decline. In 1788, Lambert returned to Leicester, to serve as his father's assistant at the gaol (some sources date Lambert's return to Leicester to 1791, following the destruction of the building housing Messrs Taylor & Co in the <a href="Priestley%20Riots">Priestley Riots</a> of ). His father retired soon afterwards and Lambert succeeded him as gaol keeper. The younger Daniel Lambert was a much-respected gaoler; he befriended many of the prisoners, and made every effort to help them when they went to trial.

Although by his own account Lambert did not eat unusually large amounts of food, at about the time of his return to Leicester his weight began to increase steadily, and by 1793, he weighed . Concerned for his fitness, in his spare time he devoted himself to exercise, building his strength to the point where he was able to easily carry . On one occasion, while he was watching a <a href="dancing%20bear">dancing bear</a> on display in Blue Boar Lane, his dog slipped loose and bit it. The bear knocked the dog to the ground, and Lambert asked its keeper to restrain it so he could retrieve his wounded animal, but the keeper removed the bear's muzzle so it could attack the dog. Lambert reportedly struck the bear with a pole and with his left hand, punched its head, knocking it to the ground to allow the dog to escape.

Despite his increasingly large girth, Lambert remained fit and active, once walking seven miles (11 km) from <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a> to the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a> "with much less apparent fatigue than several middle-sized men who were of the party". Although not particularly agile, he was not significantly restricted by his bulk, and was able to stand on one leg and kick the other to a height of . He continued to teach swimming in Leicester, and was able to stay afloat with two grown men sitting on his back. He disliked changing his clothes, and each morning habitually wore the clothes he had worn the day before, regardless of whether they were still wet; by Lambert's own account he suffered no colds or other ill effects from this behaviour.

By 1801, Lambert's weight had increased to about , and, as his bulk meant neither he nor his horse were able to keep up with the hunt, he was forced to give up hunting. He continued to maintain an interest in field sports, keeping a pack of 30 <a href="terrier">terrier</a>s. By this time, although he retained his solid reputation as a gaoler, serious concerns were being raised about his fitness for the post. Traditional gaols were falling out of favour and being replaced with <a href="forced%20labour">forced labour</a> institutions, and in 1805, the old Bridewell gaol was closed. Lambert was left without a job, but was granted an <a href="Annuity%20%28European%20financial%20arrangements%29">annuity</a> of £50 (about £ as of ) a year by the Leicester magistrates, in recognition of his excellent service as gaol keeper.

Lambert's girth was then enormous; six men of normal size could fit together inside his waistcoat, and each of his stockings was the size of a sack. His £50 annuity did not adequately cover his living costs, and his size prevented him from working. He became a virtual recluse. Stories of his bulk had by then begun to spread, and travellers visiting Leicester would use various pretexts to visit his home. One such visitor asked Lambert's servant to allow him entry as he wished to ask Lambert's advice about fighting cocks; Lambert leaned out of the window and told the servant to "tell the gentleman that I am a <a href="Cock%20throwing">shy cock</a>". On another occasion, he admitted into his house a <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> man who sought his advice about a mare's pedigree; on realising the man was visiting only to look at him, Lambert told him that the horse in question was "by Impertinence out of Curiosity".

Sensitive about his weight, Daniel Lambert refused to allow himself to be weighed, but sometime around 1805, some friends persuaded him to come with them to a <a href="cockfight">cock fight</a> in <a href="Loughborough">Loughborough</a>. Once he had squeezed his way into their carriage, the rest of the party drove the carriage onto a large scale and jumped out. After deducting the weight of the (previously weighed) empty carriage, they calculated that Lambert's weight was now , and that he had thus overtaken <a href="Edward%20Bright">Edward Bright</a>, the "Fat Man of Maldon", as the heaviest authenticated person in recorded history.

Despite his shyness, Lambert badly needed to earn money, and saw no alternative to putting himself on display, and charging his spectators. On 4 April 1806, he boarded a specially built carriage and travelled from Leicester to his new home at 53 <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>, then near the western edge of London. For five hours each day, he welcomed visitors into his home, charging each a <a href="shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shilling</a> (about £ as of ).

Lambert shared his interests and knowledge of sports, dogs and animal husbandry with London's middle and upper classes, and it soon became highly fashionable to visit him, or become his friend. Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20 visits, paying the admission fee on each occasion. During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be gawped or sneered at. His business venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400 paying visitors per day. His home was described as having the air of a fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and not simply as a spectacle. He insisted on maintaining amongst his visitors an atmosphere of civility and all men entering his rooms were obliged to remove their hats. One visitor refused to remove his "even if the King were present" but Lambert replied that "Then by G——, Sir, you must instantly quit this room, as I do not consider it a mark of respect due to myself, but to the ladies and gentlemen who honor me with their company."

Lambert's popularity inspired an imitator in "Master Wybrants, Mr. Lambert in miniature", exhibited a short distance away in Sackville Street. A handbill described Wybrants as "Master Wybrants the Modern Hercules, who at the age of 4 Months weighed 39 pounds, measured 2 feet round the Body 15 Inches round the thigh and 8 Inches round the Arm, to be seen at the corner of Sackville Street Piccadilly".

People would travel long distances to see him (on one occasion, a party of 14 travelled to London from <a href="Guernsey">Guernsey</a>), and many would spend hours speaking with him on animal breeding. A life-sized waxwork of Lambert was displayed in London, where it became extremely popular. Daniel Lambert soon became a popular subject with cartoonists, who often depicted him as <a href="John%20Bull">John Bull</a>. He mixed well with the upper classes, and on one occasion met <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a>. The King's and Lambert's reactions to this meeting are not recorded.

Lambert soon came to the attention of the medical profession, and shortly after his arrival in London, the "Medical and Physical Journal" published an article about him. They confirmed that he weighed , and measured his height as . A thorough medical examination found that his bodily functions worked correctly, and that he breathed freely. Lambert was described as active and mentally alert, well-read, and with an excellent memory. He was fond of singing, and had a normal speaking voice which showed no signs of pressure on the lungs. Doctors found <a href="tumefaction">tumefaction</a> of his feet, legs and thighs, and accumulation of fat within the abdomen, but other than scaly and thickened skin on his legs caused by previous attacks of <a href="erysipelas">erysipelas</a>, he had no health problems. Lambert told the doctors that he ate normal quantities of ordinary food. He claimed that since about 1795 he had drunk nothing but water, and that even while young, and a regular party-goer, he did not join his fellow revellers in drinking. Lambert estimated that he was able to walk about a quarter of a mile (400 m) without difficulty. He slept regularly for no more than eight hours per night, always with his window open, and was never heard to snore; on waking he was always fully alert within five minutes, and he never napped during the day.

It is impossible to be certain about what caused Daniel Lambert's extreme weight, but it is considered unlikely to have been caused by an <a href="endocrine">endocrine</a> (glandular) or genetic disorder. Other than his weight gain, he showed no symptoms of a thyroid disorder, and none of his many portraits show the <a href="moon%20face">moon face</a> of a patient with <a href="Cushing%27s%20syndrome">Cushing's syndrome</a>. Patients with <a href="Bardet%E2%80%93Biedl%20syndrome">Bardet–Biedl syndrome</a> and <a href="Prader%E2%80%93Willi%20syndrome">Prader–Willi syndrome</a>, genetic syndromes which can lead to obesity in patients, also suffer from <a href="learning%20disability">learning disabilities</a> and muscular weakness, but all those who knew Lambert agreed that he was highly intelligent, was extremely strong physically, and, except for erysipelas and venous insufficiency (<a href="varicose%20veins">varicose veins</a>) in his legs, did not suffer from any health problems. One contemporary commentator remarked that "Mr. Lambert scarcely knows what it is to be ailing or indisposed". Lambert's only recorded psychological problem was an occasional "depression of the spirits", during his time in London. Although he had an aunt and uncle who were overweight, his parents and surviving siblings remained of normal build throughout their lives.

Consequently, it is likely that Lambert's weight gain was caused not by a physical disorder but by a combination of overeating and a lack of exercise. Although heavily built in his teens, he began to gain weight only when he took up the relatively sedentary job of prison keeper. A biography of Lambert published during his lifetime recounted that "it was within a year of this appointment that his bulk received the greatest and most rapid encrease". Although he claimed to eat little, and to abstain from alcohol, it is likely that a man with his lifestyle and position in society would have eaten large amounts of meat, and drunk beer at social events.

After some months in London, Lambert was visited by <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Boruw%C5%82aski">Józef Boruwłaski</a>, a dwarf then in his seventies. Born in 1739 to a poor family in rural <a href="Pokuttya">Pokuttya</a>, Boruwłaski was generally considered to be the last of Europe's <a href="court%20dwarf">court dwarf</a>s. He was introduced to the Empress <a href="Maria%20Theresa">Maria Theresa</a> in 1754, and after a short time residing with deposed Polish king <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Leszczy%C5%84ski">Stanisław Leszczyński</a>, he exhibited himself around Europe, thus becoming a wealthy man. At age 60, he retired to <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a>, where he became such a popular figure that the City of Durham paid him to live there and he became one of its most prominent citizens. Boruwłaski had a superb memory, and recalled that Lambert, while still employed by Patrick's die casting works and before he grew fat, had paid to see him in Birmingham. Boruwłaski remarked "I have seen this face twenty years before at Birmingham, but certainly it be another body". He had been told that Lambert's bulk was a hoax, and he therefore felt his leg to prove to himself that it was not. The two men compared their respective outfits, and calculated that one of Lambert's sleeves would provide enough cloth to make an entire coat for Boruwłaski. Lambert enquired after Boruwłaski's wife, Isalina Barbutan, whereupon the latter replied "No, she is dead, and I am not very sorry, for when I affront her, she put me on the mantle-shelf for punishment."

The meeting of Lambert and Boruwłaski, the largest and smallest men in the country, was the subject of enormous public interest; one newspaper reported that "It was "<a href="Sir%20John%20Falstaff">Sir John Falstaff</a>" and "<a href="Tom%20Thumb">Tom Thumb</a>", which must have afforded a "double" treat to the curious". Boruwłaski lived to see his 98th year, despite the prediction of the money-lender who sold him his annuity that his small stature would make him prone to illness.

Although generally respected by London society, the longer Lambert remained there, the more irritable he became. Shy and self-conscious, he was annoyed at repeatedly being asked about the size of his clothes. In answer to one request, to a woman who enquired as to the cost of his coat, he replied "I cannot pretend to charge my memory with the price, but I can put you into a method of obtaining the information you want. If you think proper to make me a present of a new coat, you will then know exactly what it costs". Another interested spectator claimed that since his entrance fee was paying for Lambert's clothing, he had the right to know about it; Lambert replied "Sir, if I knew what part of my next coat your shilling would pay for, I can assure you I would cut out the piece". Lambert calculated in 1806 that a full suit of clothes cost him £20, about £ as of .

Lambert had the acumen to refuse the management offers of various impresarios and agents, and by , he had returned to Leicester as a wealthy man. He returned to his favourite pastimes, breeding sporting dogs and fighting cocks. A terrier bitch, for which he was offered 100 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> (about £ as of ), was said to be the finest in England. He refused to sell the dog, which became his lifetime companion. He began again to attend sporting events, as a report on the <a href="Leicester%20Racecourse">Leicester Races</a> of September 1806 noted that "Among the distinguished characters upon the turf we were glad to see our old friend, Mr. Daniel Lambert, in apparent high health and spirits". Although too heavy to follow hunts on horseback, he used a portion of the money earned in London to build up a pack of <a href="greyhound">greyhound</a>s, watching from his carriage as they <a href="hare%20coursing">coursed hares</a> in the Leicestershire countryside.

In December 1806, Lambert went on a brief fundraising tour, and exhibited himself in Birmingham and <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a>. Early the next year he returned to London, and stayed in the fashionable <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a>. There he fell ill; his physician Dr Heaviside felt that his illness might have been caused by the polluted London air, and Lambert returned to Leicester. He recovered, and later in 1807, made a series of tours of England.
In summer 1808, Lambert briefly returned to the capital, where he sold a pair of <a href="spaniel">spaniel</a>s for 75 guineas (about £ as of ) at <a href="Tattersalls">Tattersalls</a>. Later that year, he exhibited himself in <a href="York">York</a>. In , he set off on another tour of <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, to conclude in <a href="Stamford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Stamford</a> during the Stamford Races. One account suggests that this tour was intended to be his last, as he was then sufficiently wealthy to retire. While on the tour, Lambert was weighed in Ipswich; his weight was . No longer able to use stairs, he took lodgings on the ground floor of the Waggon & Horses inn at 47 High Street, Stamford on 20 June.

Following his arrival at Stamford, Lambert sent a message to the "<a href="Stamford%20Mercury">Stamford Mercury</a>", ordering advertisements and handbills. Stating that <a href="wikt%3Aif_the_mountain_won%2527t_come_to_Muhammad">"as the Mountain could not wait upon Mahomet, Mahomet would go to the mountain"</a>, he asked the printer to visit him at the Waggon & Horses, to discuss his printing requirements. That evening, Lambert was in bed and admitted to feeling tired, but nonetheless he was able to discuss his requirements with the printer, and was anxious that the handbills be delivered on time.

On the morning of 21 June, Lambert woke at his usual time and appeared in good health. As he began to shave, he complained of breathing difficulties. Ten minutes later, he collapsed and died.

There was no autopsy, and the cause of Lambert's death is unknown. While many sources say that he died of a fatty degeneration of the heart or of stress on his heart caused by his bulk, his behaviour in the period leading to his death does not match that of someone suffering from <a href="cardiac%20insufficiency">cardiac insufficiency</a>; witnesses agree that on the morning of his death he appeared well, before he became short of breath and collapsed. <a href="Jan%20Bondeson">Bondeson</a> (2006) speculates that the most consistent explanation of his death, given his symptoms and medical history, is that he had a sudden <a href="pulmonary%20embolism">pulmonary embolism</a>.

Lambert's corpse rapidly began to <a href="putrefy">putrefy</a>. There was no question of his body being returned to Leicester, and so on 22 June, it was placed inside an <a href="elm">elm</a> coffin, 6 feet 4 inches long, 4 feet 4 inches wide and 2 feet 4 inches deep (193 cm × 132 cm × 71 cm), built on wheels to allow it to be moved. The coffin was so large that to wheel it out of the inn and to the newly opened <a href="burial%20ground">burial ground</a> at the rear of <a href="St%20Martin%27s%20Church%2C%20Stamford">St Martin's Church</a>, the window and wall of his apartment were demolished. A suitably sized grave had been dug, with a sloping approach to avoid the need to lower the coffin from above, but on 23 June, it nonetheless took almost half an hour for twenty men to pull Lambert's enormous coffin into the grave.
Lambert's friends paid for a large gravestone, inscribed:In Remembrance of that Prodigy in Nature.<br>DANIEL LAMBERT.<br>a Native of Leicester:<br>who was possessed of an exalted and convivial Mind<br>and in personal Greatness had no Competitor<br>"He measured three Feet one Inch round the Leg"<br>"nine Feet four Inches round the Body"<br>"and weighed"<br>"Fifty two Stone eleven Pounds!"<br>He departed this Life on the 21st of <br>Aged 39 years<br>"As a Testimony of Respect this Stone is erected by his Friends in Leicester"

In late 1809, <a href="John%20Drakard">John Drakard</a> released "The life of that wonderful and extraordinary heavy man, the late Danl. Lambert, from his birth to the moment of his dissolution, with an account of men noted for their corpulency, and other interesting matter", the first full biography of Lambert to be released after his death. Lambert's position as the heaviest person in recorded history was soon overtaken by the American <a href="Mills%20Darden">Mills Darden</a> (1799–1857), but Lambert had by now become a cult figure, and virtually every item connected with him was preserved for posterity. His clothes and possessions were sold at auction to collectors, and many of them are preserved in museums today.

Across England, many public houses and inns were renamed after Daniel Lambert, particularly in Leicester and Stamford. The Daniel Lambert public house at 12 <a href="Ludgate%20Hill">Ludgate Hill</a>, near the entrance to <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> in London, was well known, and had a large portrait of Daniel Lambert and Lambert's walking stick on display in the lobby. James Dixon, owner of the Ram Jam Inn in Stamford, bought the suit of clothes Lambert had been wearing when he died and put it on display, renaming the inn the Daniel Lambert.
The term "Daniel Lambert" entered common use in English speech and writing, to refer to any fat man. His name continued in this use long after the details of his life had been largely forgotten; in 1852, <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> remarked that "Lambert's name is known better than his history". Dickens's "<a href="Nicholas%20Nickleby">Nicholas Nickleby</a>" compares the obese <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a> to Lambert, and <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a> used the term in "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28novel%29">Vanity Fair</a>" to refer to the obese Joseph Sedley, and in "<a href="The%20Luck%20of%20Barry%20Lyndon">The Luck of Barry Lyndon</a>" to refer to the fat servant Tim. As time progressed, "Daniel Lambert" came to mean anything exceptionally large; <a href="Herbert%20Spencer">Herbert Spencer</a>'s "The Study of Sociology" used the phrase "a Daniel Lambert of learning", while <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a> referred sarcastically to <a href="Oliver%20Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> as "this big swollen Gambler and gluttonous hapless 'spiritual Daniel Lambert'". In 1874, "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", in reviewing the newly translated French comedy "La Fiammina" by <a href="Mario%20Uchard">Mario Uchard</a> in which a character is named "Daniel Lambert", noted that the name is "always associated in the English mind with the notion of obesity", and in 1907, almost 100 years after Lambert's death, the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Chambord">Château de Chambord</a> was referred to as "the Daniel Lambert among châteaux". Nellie Lambert Ensall, at the time the heaviest woman in Britain, claimed in 1910 to be Daniel Lambert's great-granddaughter, but her claim is likely to be untrue; Lambert was unmarried and is unlikely to have had any children.

In 1838, the "<a href="English%20Annual">English Annual</a>" published a series of poems, purportedly written by Lambert and found amongst his papers at the Waggon and Horses after his death. No source published during Lambert's lifetime mentions his having any interest in poetry or in any reading matter other than periodicals on field sports, and it is unclear why his papers should have been with him in Stamford at his death, rather than at his home in Leicester. The discoverer of the poems is credited only as "Omega". It is likely that the poems are a hoax.

<a href="P.%20T.%20Barnum">P. T. Barnum</a> and the tall <a href="General%20Tom%20Thumb">General Tom Thumb</a> (Charles Sherwood Stratton) visited Stamford in 1846 and donated one of Thumb's costumes to Dixon to be displayed alongside Lambert's. General Tom Thumb visited Stamford again in 1859 and was tied up inside one of Lambert's stockings. In 1866, General Tom Thumb, with his equally short wife <a href="Lavinia%20Warren">Lavinia Warren</a> (Mercy Lavinia Warren Bump), her sister <a href="Minnie%20Warren">Minnie Warren</a> (Huldah Pierce Warren Bump) and Barnum's other celebrated dwarf <a href="Commodore%20Nutt">Commodore Nutt</a> (George Washington Morrison Nutt) visited Stamford. All four were able to pass through the knee of Lambert's breeches together. In 1866, Lambert's and Tom Thumb's clothes were sold to the Old London Tavern in Stamford; they were later in the possession of <a href="Stamford%20Museum">Stamford Museum</a>. (In , it was announced that the Stamford Museum would close in , with its collection transferred to Stamford Library.)

The 1806 waxwork of Lambert was exported to the United States and was on show in <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven, Connecticut</a>, by 1813. By 1828, the effigy was displayed in the <a href="Washington%20Gardens%20%28Boston%29">Boston Vauxhall Gardens</a> dressed in a complete set of Lambert's clothes. It was later bought by P. T. Barnum and displayed at <a href="Barnum%27s%20American%20Museum">Barnum's American Museum</a> in New York, but the museum was destroyed by fire in 1865 and, although workmen endeavoured to save the waxwork, it melted in the heat and was destroyed.

Lambert is still a popular character in Leicester, described in 2009 by the "<a href="Leicester%20Mercury">Leicester Mercury</a>" as "one of the city's most cherished icons"; several local public houses and businesses are named after him. <a href="Sue%20Townsend">Sue Townsend</a>'s play "The Ghost of Daniel Lambert", in which Lambert's ghost watches disapprovingly over the 1960s demolition and redevelopment of Leicester's historic town centre, premiered at Leicester's <a href="Haymarket%20Theatre%20%28Leicester%29">Haymarket Theatre</a> in 1981. Lambert is also a popular figure in Stamford, and local football team <a href="Stamford%20A.F.C.">Stamford A.F.C.</a> are nicknamed "The Daniels", after him.

A set of Lambert's clothes, together with his armchair, walking stick, riding crop and prayer book, are on permanent display at the <a href="Newarke%20Houses%20Museum">Newarke Houses Museum</a> in Leicester. <a href="Stamford%20Museum">Stamford Museum</a> exhibited a tailor's dummy, dressed with Daniel Lambert's clothes as if they are being made up for him, plus his hat and a portrait. The Daniel Lambert pub in Ludgate Hill no longer exists, and the memorabilia formerly displayed there are now on permanent display at the <a href="George%20Hotel%2C%20Stamford">George Hotel</a> in Stamford. The Daniel Lambert pub in Stamford has also closed.

In 2009, on the 200th anniversary of his death, Leicester celebrated Daniel Lambert Day, and over 800 people attended an event in his name at Newarke Houses Museum.

Like the preceding cruisers upon which her design was based, "Dresden" was armed with ten <a href="10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">SK L/40 guns</a> guns and two <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s.

"Dresden" spent much of her career overseas. After commissioning, she visited the United States in 1909 during the <a href="Hudson-Fulton%20Celebration">Hudson-Fulton Celebration</a>, before returning to Germany to serve in the reconnaissance force of the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> for three years. In 1913, she was assigned to the Mediterranean Division. She was then sent to the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean</a> to protect German nationals during the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a>. In mid-1914, she carried the former dictator <a href="Victoriano%20Huerta">Victoriano Huerta</a> to Jamaica, where the British had granted him asylum. She was due to return to Germany in July 1914, but was prevented by the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> from doing so. At the onset of hostilities, "Dresden" operated as a <a href="commerce%20raider">commerce raider</a> in South American waters in the Atlantic, then moved to the Pacific Ocean in September and joined <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Spee">Maximilian von Spee</a>'s <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">East Asia Squadron</a>.

"Dresden" saw action in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coronel">Battle of Coronel</a> in November, where she engaged the British cruiser , and at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">Battle of the Falkland Islands</a> in December, where she was the only German warship to escape destruction. She eluded her British pursuers for several more months, until she put into <a href="Robinson%20Crusoe%20Island">Robinson Crusoe Island</a> in March 1915. Her engines were worn out and she had almost no coal left for her boilers, so the ship's captain contacted the local Chilean authorities to have "Dresden" interned. She was trapped by British cruisers, including her old opponent "Glasgow". The British violated Chilean neutrality and opened fire on the ship in the <a href="Battle%20of%20M%C3%A1s%20a%20Tierra">Battle of Más a Tierra</a>. The Germans <a href="scuttling">scuttled</a> "Dresden" and the majority of the crew escaped to be interned in Chile for the duration of the war. The wreck remains in the harbor; several artifacts, including her bell and compass, have been returned to Germany.

"Dresden" was <a href="length%20overall">long overall</a> with a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of and a <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draft</a> of forward. She displaced at full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, designed to give for a top speed of . The engines were powered by twelve coal-fired <a href="water-tube%20boiler">water-tube boiler</a>s. "Dresden" carried up to of coal, which gave her a range of at . She had a crew of 18 officers and 343 enlisted men.

The ship was armed with ten <a href="10.5%20cm%20SK%20L/40%20naval%20gun">10.5 cm SK L/40 guns</a> in single mounts. Two were placed side by side forward on the <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a>, six were located amidships, three on either side, and two were placed side by side aft. The guns could engage targets out to . They were supplied with 1,500 rounds of ammunition, for 150 shells per gun. The secondary battery comprised <a href="5.2%20cm%20SK%20L/55%20naval%20gun">eight SK L/55 guns</a>, with 4,000 rounds of ammunition. She was also equipped with two <a href="torpedo%20tube">torpedo tube</a>s with four <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es, mounted on the deck. The ship was protected by an armored deck that was up to thick. The <a href="conning%20tower">conning tower</a> had thick sides, and the guns were protected by thick shields.

"Dresden" was ordered under the contract name "<a href="Ersatz">Ersatz</a>" . She was laid down at the <a href="Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss">Blohm & Voss</a> shipyard in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> in 1906 and <a href="Ceremonial%20ship%20launching">launched</a> on 5 October 1907. The <a href="Oberb%C3%BCrgermeister">Oberbürgermeister</a> of <a href="Dresden">her namesake city</a>, <a href="Otto%20Beutler">Otto Beutler</a>, christened the ship. <a href="Fitting-out">Fitting-out</a> work then commenced, and "Dresden" was commissioned into the <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a> on 14 November 1908. Following her commissioning, "Dresden" began her <a href="sea%20trials">sea trials</a>. On 28 November she accidentally collided with and sank the Swedish <a href="galeas">galeas</a> "Cäcilie" outside <a href="Kiel">Kiel</a>. "Dresden"s starboard propeller shaft was shoved in , and she required six months of repair work. She resumed sea trials in 1909, but a turbine accident necessitated further repairs, which lasted until September.

Although "Dresden" had not completed the required testing, her trials were declared over on 7 September, as she had been ordered to visit the United States. The purpose of the voyage was to represent Germany at the <a href="Hudson-Fulton%20Celebration">Hudson-Fulton Celebration</a> in New York; "Dresden" was joined by the <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a>s and and the light cruiser . "Dresden" left <a href="Wilhelmshaven">Wilhelmshaven</a> on 11 September and stopped in <a href="Newport%2C%20Wales">Newport</a>, where she met the rest of the ships of the squadron. The ships arrived in New York on 24 September, remained there until 9 October, and arrived back in Germany on 22 October.
"Dresden" then joined the reconnaissance force for the High Seas Fleet; the following two years consisted of the peacetime routine of squadron exercises, training cruises, and annual fleet exercises. On 16 February 1910, she collided with the light cruiser . The collision caused significant damage to "Dresden", though no one on either vessel was injured. She made it back to Kiel for repairs, which lasted eight days. "Dresden" visited Hamburg on 13–17 May that year. From 14 to 20 April 1912, she was temporarily transferred to the Training Squadron, along with the <a href="armored%20cruiser">armored cruiser</a> and the light cruiser . For the year 1911–12, "Dresden" won the Kaiser's Schießpreis (Shooting Prize) for excellent gunnery amongst the light cruisers of the High Seas Fleet. From September 1912 through September 1913, she was commanded by "<a href="Fregattenkapit%C3%A4n">Fregattenkapitän</a>" (Frigate Captain) <a href="Fritz%20L%C3%BCdecke">Fritz Lüdecke</a>, who would command the ship again during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

On 6 April 1913, she and the cruiser were sent from Kiel to the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>, where she joined the "<a href="Mediterranean%20Division">Mittelmeer-Division</a>" (Mediterranean Division), centered on the <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> and commanded by "<a href="Konteradmiral">Konteradmiral</a>" (Rear Admiral) <a href="Konrad%20Trummler">Konrad Trummler</a>. The ships cruised the eastern Mediterranean for several months, and in late August, "Dresden" was ordered to return to Germany. After arriving in Kiel on 23 September, she was taken into the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Werft%20Kiel">"Kaiserliche Werft"</a> (Imperial Shipyard) for an overhaul that lasted until the end of December. She was scheduled to return to the Mediterranean Division, but the "<a href="Admiralstab">Admiralstab</a>" (Admiralty Staff) reassigned "Dresden" to the North American station to protect German interests in the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a>. The cruiser "Bremen", then in North American waters, was also due to return to Germany, but her intended replacement, , had not yet entered service. On 27 December 1913, "Dresden" departed Germany and arrived off <a href="Veracruz%20%28city%29">Vera Cruz</a> on 21 January 1914, under the command of "Fregattenkapitän" <a href="Erich%20K%C3%B6hler%20%28officer%29">Erich Köhler</a>. The United States had already sent a squadron of warships to the city, as had several other countries.
The "Admiralstab" ordered "Hertha", which had been on a training cruise for <a href="naval%20cadet">naval cadet</a>s, to join "Dresden" off Mexico. "Bremen" was also recalled to reinforce the German naval contingent; after arriving, she was tasked with transferring European nationals to German <a href="Hamburg%20America%20Line">HAPAG</a> liners. "Dresden" and the British cruiser rescued 900 American citizens trapped in a hotel in Vera Cruz and transferred them to American warships. The German consul in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> requested additional forces, and so "Dresden" provided a landing party of a <a href="Maat%20%28military%29">"maat"</a> (Junior Petty Officer) and ten sailors, armed with two <a href="MG%2008">MG 08</a> <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s. On 15 April 1914, "Dresden" steamed to <a href="Tampico">Tampico</a> on Mexico's Caribbean coast. That month, the German-flagged merchant ship arrived in Mexico, carrying a load of small arms for the regime of Mexican dictator <a href="Victoriano%20Huerta">Victoriano Huerta</a>. The United States had put an arms embargo into effect in an attempt to reduce the violence of the civil war. The US Navy <a href="Ypiranga%20incident">intercepted "Ypiranga"</a> on 21 April. "Dresden" arrived, confiscated the merchantman, and pressed her into naval service to transport German refugees out of Mexico. Despite the American embargo, the Germans delivered the weapons and ammunition to the Mexican government on 28 May.

On 20 July, after the Huerta regime was toppled, "Dresden" carried Huerta, his vice president, <a href="Aureliano%20Blanquet">Aureliano Blanquet</a>, and their families to <a href="Kingston%2C%20Jamaica">Kingston, Jamaica</a>, where Britain had granted them asylum. Upon arriving in Kingston on the 25th, Köhler learned of the rising political tensions in Europe during the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a> that followed the <a href="assassination%20of%20Archduke%20Franz%20Ferdinand">assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand</a>. By this time, the ship was in need of a refit in Germany, and met with her replacement, "Karlsruhe", in <a href="Port-au-Prince">Port-au-Prince</a>, Haiti, the following day. Lüdecke, who had arrived in command of "Karlsruhe", traded places with Köhler aboard "Dresden". The "Admiralstab" initially ordered "Dresden" to return to Germany for overhaul, but the heightened threat of war by the 31st led the staff to countermand the order, instead instructing Lüdecke to prepare to conduct <a href="commerce%20raiding">"Handelskrieg"</a> (trade war) in the Atlantic.

After receiving the order to remain in the Atlantic, Lüdecke turned his ship south while maintaining radio silence to prevent hostile warships from discovering his vessel. On the night of 4–5 August, he received a radio report informing him of Britain's declaration of war on Germany. He chose the South Atlantic as "Dresden"s operational area, and steamed to the Brazilian coast. Off the mouth of the <a href="Amazon%20River">Amazon River</a>, he stopped a British merchant ship on 6 August. The ship, , whose captain professed to know nothing of Britain's entry into the war, was permitted to proceed unmolested in accordance with the rules set forth in the <a href="Hague%20Conventions%20of%201899%20and%201907">Hague Convention of 1907</a>. "Dresden" rendezvoused with the German <a href="collier%20%28ship%20type%29">collier</a> , a converted <a href="HSDG">HSDG</a> vessel. The cruiser moved to the <a href="Rocas%20Atoll">Rocas Atoll</a> on the 12th, along with the HAPAG steamers , , and . After departing the atoll, en route to <a href="Trinidade">Trinidade</a>, "Dresden" caught the British steamer ; Lüdecke took off the ship's crew and then sank the merchantman. "Dresden" captured the British collier on 24 August and sank her after evacuating her crew. After arriving in Trinidade, she rendezvoused with the <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a> and several steamers.

On 26 August, while steaming off the mouth of the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Río de la Plata</a>, she caught two more British steamers, but the poor condition of "Dresden"s engines curtailed further operations. On 5 September, "Dresden" put into <a href="Hoste%20Island">Hoste Island</a> for engine maintenance until the 16th. While the ship was there, the HAPAG steamer arrived from <a href="Punta%20Arenas">Punta Arenas</a> with news of the war, and the heavy merchant traffic off the western coast of South America. Lüdecke decided to steam there, and on 18 September "Dresden" passed the <a href="Strait%20of%20Magellan">Strait of Magellan</a>. While en route, "Dresden" encountered the French steamer ; Lüdecke refrained from attacking the transport ship, since she had fled into neutral waters. After steaming up the Chilean coast, she stopped in the <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Islands">Juan Fernández Islands</a>, where she made radio contact with the light cruiser , which was operating on the Pacific coast of South America. "Dresden" saw no further success against British shipping, and on 12 October, she joined "<a href="Vizeadmiral">Vizeadmiral</a>" (Vice Admiral) <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Spee">Maximilian von Spee</a>'s <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">East Asia Squadron</a>, which had crossed the Pacific and was coaling at <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>. The following day, Lüdecke was promoted to "<a href="Kapit%C3%A4n%20zur%20See">Kapitän zur See</a>" (Captain at Sea).

On 18 October, "Dresden" and the East Asia Squadron, centered on the armored cruisers and , departed Easter Island for the South American coast. They arrived at <a href="Alejandro%20Selkirk%20Island">Más a Fuera</a> island on 26 October. The following evening, the German cruisers escorted the <a href="auxiliary%20cruiser">auxiliary cruiser</a> and the merchant ships and to Chile. The flotilla arrived off <a href="Valparaiso">Valparaiso</a> on 30 October, and the following evening, Spee received intelligence that a British cruiser was at the Chilean port of <a href="Coronel%2C%20Chile">Coronel</a>. Spee decided that his squadron should ambush the cruiser——when it was forced to leave port due to Chile's neutral status, which required belligerent warships to leave after twenty-four hours. Spee did not realize that "Glasgow" was in the company of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Christopher%20Craddock">Christopher Craddock</a>'s <a href="4th%20Cruiser%20Squadron">4th Cruiser Squadron</a>, which also included the armored cruisers and and the auxiliary cruiser .

Early on the morning of 1 November, Spee took his squadron out of Valparaiso, steaming at south toward Coronel. At around 16:00, "Leipzig" spotted the smoke column from the leading British cruiser. By 16:25, the other two ships had been spotted. The two squadrons slowly closed the distance, until the Germans opened fire at 18:34, at a range of . The German ships engaged their opposite numbers, with "Dresden" firing on "Otranto". After "Dresden"s third salvo, "Otranto" turned away; the Germans claimed a hit that caused a fire, though "Otranto" reported taking no damage. Following "Otranto"s departure, "Dresden" shifted her fire to "Glasgow", which was also targeted by "Leipzig". The two German cruisers hit their British opponent five times.

At around 19:30, Spee ordered "Dresden" and "Leipzig" to launch a torpedo attack against the damaged British armored cruisers. "Dresden" increased speed to position herself off the British bows, and briefly spotted "Glasgow" as she was withdrawing, but the British cruiser disappeared in the haze and gathering darkness. "Dresden" then encountered "Leipzig"; both ships initially thought the other was hostile. "Dresden"s crew was loading a torpedo when the two ships confirmed each other's identity. By 22:00, "Dresden" and the other two light cruisers were deployed in a line that searched unsuccessfully for the British cruisers. "Dresden" had emerged from the battle completely unscathed.

On 3 November, Spee took "Scharnhorst", "Gneisenau", and "Nürnberg" back to Valparaiso for provisioning and to consult with the "Admiralstab". Neutrality laws permitted only three belligerent warships in a port at a given time. "Dresden" and "Leipzig" remained with the squadron's colliers in Más a Fuera. Spee returned to Más a Fuera on 6 November, and detached "Dresden" and "Leipzig" for a visit to Valparaiso, where they also restocked their supplies. The two cruisers arrived on 12 November, left the following day, and met the rest of the squadron at sea on 18 November. Three days later, the squadron anchored in <a href="St.%20Quentin%20Bay">St. Quentin Bay</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Penas">Gulf of Penas</a>, where they coaled. The Royal Navy had deployed Vice Admiral <a href="Doveton%20Sturdee">Doveton Sturdee</a>'s pair of battlecruisers, and , to hunt down the German squadron. They left Britain on 11 November, and arrived in the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a> on 7 December. There, they joined the armored cruisers , , and , and the light cruisers "Glasgow" and .

On 26 November, the German East Asia Squadron left St. Quentin Bay, bound for the Atlantic. On 2 December, they caught the Canadian sailing ship "Drummuir", which was carrying of high-grade Cardiff coal. The following morning, the Germans anchored off <a href="Picton%20Island">Picton Island</a>, where they unloaded the coal from "Drummuir" into their own auxiliaries. On the morning of 6 December, Spee held a council aboard "Scharnhorst" to discuss their next moves. With the support of the captains of "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau", he successfully argued for an attack on the Falklands to destroy the British wireless station and coal stocks there. Lüdecke and the captains of "Leipzig" and "Nürnberg" all opposed the plan, and were in favor of bypassing the Falklands and proceeding to the <a href="La%20Plata">La Plata</a> area to continue to raid British shipping.

On the afternoon of 6 December, the German ships departed Picton Island, bound for the Falklands. On 7 December, they rounded <a href="Tierra%20del%20Fuego">Tierra del Fuego</a> and turned north into the Atlantic. They arrived off the Falklands at around 02:00; three hours later, Spee detached "Gneisenau" and "Nürnberg" to land a party ashore. By 08:30, the ships were approaching <a href="Port%20Stanley">Port Stanley</a>, when they noticed thick columns of smoke rising from the harbor. After closing to the harbor entrance, they quickly realized they were confronted by a much more powerful squadron, which was just getting up steam. Spee immediately broke off the operation and turned east to flee before the British ships could catch his squadron. By 10:45, "Gneisenau" and "Nürnberg" had rejoined the fleet, and the German auxiliaries were detached to seek shelter in the maze of islands off <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>.

The British ships set off in pursuit, and by 12:50, Sturdee's two battlecruisers had overtaken the Germans. A minute later, he gave the order to open fire at the trailing German ship, "Leipzig". Spee ordered the three small cruisers to try to escape to the south, while he turned back with "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" in an attempt to hold off the British squadron. Sturdee had foreseen this possibility, and so had ordered his armored and light cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers. The battlecruisers quickly overwhelmed Spee's armored cruisers, and destroyed them with heavy loss of life. "Dresden", with her turbine engines, was able to outpace her pursuers, and was the only German warship to escape destruction. Lüdecke decided to take his ship into the islands off South America to keep a steady supply of coal available.

On 9 December, she passed back around Cape Horn to return to the Pacific. That day, she anchored in <a href="Sholl%20Bay">Sholl Bay</a>, with only 160 t (160 long tons; 180 short tons) of coal aboard. "<a href="Oberleutnant%20zur%20See">Oberleutnant zur See</a>" (lieutenant at sea) <a href="Wilhelm%20Canaris">Wilhelm Canaris</a> convinced the Chilean naval representative for the region to permit "Dresden" to remain in the area for an extra twenty-four hours so enough coal could be taken aboard to reach Punta Arenas. She arrived there on 12 December, and received of coal from a German steamer. The "Admiralstab" hoped that "Dresden" would be able to break through to the Atlantic and return to Germany, but the poor condition of her engines precluded this. Lüdecke instead decided to attempt to cross the Pacific via Easter Island, the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>, and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> and raid commerce in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. "Dresden" took on another of coal on 19 January. On 14 February, "Dresden" left the islands off the South American coast for the South Pacific. On 27 February, the cruiser captured the British <a href="barque">barque</a> "Conway Castle" south of <a href="Robinson%20Crusoe%20Island">Más a Tierra</a>. From December to February, the German liner had supplied "Dresden" and had accompanied her northward to a final coaling at Juan Fernández Islands just before the cruiser was sunk.

On 8 March, "Dresden" was drifting in dense fog when lookouts spotted "Kent", which also had her engines off, about away. Both ships immediately raised steam, and "Dresden" escaped after a five-hour chase. The strenuous effort depleted her coal stocks and overtaxed her engines. Lüdecke decided that his ship was no longer operational, and determined to have his ship interned to preserve it. The following morning, she put into Más a Fuera, dropping anchor in Cumberland Bay at 8:30. The following day, Lüdecke received by wireless the Kaiser's permission to let "Dresden" be interned, and so Lüdecke informed the local Chilean official of his intention to do so.

On the morning of 14 March, "Kent" and "Glasgow" approached Cumberland Bay; their appearance was relayed back to "Dresden" by one of her <a href="Pinnace%20%28ship%27s%20boat%29">pinnaces</a>, which had been sent to patrol the entrance to the bay. "Dresden" was unable to maneuver, owing to her fuel shortage, and Lüdecke signaled that his ship was no longer a combatant. The British disregarded this message, as well as a Chilean vessel that approached them as they entered the bay. "Glasgow" opened fire, in violation of Chile's neutrality; Britain had already informed Chile that British warships would disregard international law if they located "Dresden" in Chilean territorial waters. Shortly thereafter, "Kent" joined in the bombardment as well. The German gunners fired off three shots in response, but the guns were quickly knocked out by British gunfire.

Lüdecke sent the signal "Am sending negotiator" to the British warships, and dispatched Canaris in a pinnace; "Glasgow" continued to bombard the defenseless cruiser. In another attempt to stop the attack, Lüdecke raised the <a href="White%20flag%23Flag%20of%20temporary%20truce%20in%20order%20to%20parley%20.28negotiate.29">white flag</a>, which prompted "Glasgow" to cease fire. Canaris came aboard to speak with Captain <a href="John%20Luce%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">John Luce</a>; the former strongly protested the latter's violation of Chile's neutrality. Luce simply replied that he had his orders, and demanded an unconditional surrender. Canaris explained that "Dresden" had already been interned by Chile, and thereafter returned to his ship, which had in the meantime been prepared for scuttling.

At 10:45, the scuttling charge detonated in the bow and exploded the forward ammunition magazines. The bow was badly mangled; in about half an hour, the ship had taken on enough water to sink. As it struck the sea floor, the bow was torn from the rest of the ship, which rolled over to starboard. As the rest of the hull settled below the waves, a second scuttling charge exploded in the ship's engine rooms.

Most of the ship's crew managed to escape; only eight men were killed in the attack, with another twenty-nine wounded. The British auxiliary cruiser took fifteen severely wounded men to Valparaiso; four of them died. The destruction of his ship had left Lüdecke in shock, and so Canaris took responsibility for the fate of the ship's crew. They remained on the island for five days until two Chilean warships brought a German passenger ship to take the men to <a href="Quiriquina%20Island">Quiriquina Island</a>, where they were interned for the duration of the war. Canaris escaped from the internment camp on 5 August 1915 and reached Germany exactly two months later. On 31 March 1917, a small group of men escaped on the Chilean barque "Tinto"; the voyage back to Germany lasted 120 days. The rest of the crew did not return to Germany until 1920.

The wreck lies at a depth of . In 2002, the first survey of the wreck was done by a team led by <a href="James%20P.%20Delgado">James P. Delgado</a> for the "<a href="Sea%20Hunters">Sea Hunters</a>" documentary produced by the <a href="National%20Underwater%20and%20Marine%20Agency">National Underwater and Marine Agency</a>. The team included the archaeologist Dr. <a href="Willi%20Kramer">Willi Kramer</a>, the first German to visit the wreck since she sank 88 years before. "Dresden" lies on her starboard side pointed north, toward the beach. The wreck is heavily damaged; much of the upper works, including the bridge, the masts, the funnels, and many of the guns have been torn from the ship. The bow has been cut off by the scuttling charges detonated by the ship's crew, and sits upright on the sea floor. The stern is also badly damaged, with the main deck blasted away and many shell holes in the ship's side. Some of the damage to the aft of the ship appears to have been done by an undocumented salvage operation before Delgado's survey. According to German records, "Dresden" was carrying gold coins from their colony at <a href="Tsingtau">Tsingtau</a>; Delgado speculated that this salvage work was an attempt to retrieve these.

In 1965, the ship's compass and several flags were recovered and returned to Germany, where they are held at the German <a href="Naval%20Academy%20M%C3%BCrwik">Naval Academy Mürwik</a> in <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>-<a href="M%C3%BCrwik">Mürwik</a>. In 2006, Chilean and German divers found and recovered "Dresden"s <a href="Ship%27s%20bell">bell</a>, which is now in Germany. <a href="CS%20Forester">CS Forester</a>'s novel "<a href="Brown%20on%20Resolution">Brown on Resolution</a>", and two subsequent movies, were inspired by the "Dresden"s escape and subsequent destruction.

Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay

<a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> Hastings Lionel Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay (21 June 1887 – 17 December 1965), nicknamed Pug, was a <a href="British%20Indian%20Army">British Indian Army</a> officer and diplomat, remembered primarily for his role as <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>'s chief military assistant during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and his service as the first <a href="Secretary%20General%20of%20NATO">Secretary General of NATO</a> from 1952 to 1957.

Ismay was born in <a href="Nainital">Nainital</a>, India, in 1887, and educated in the United Kingdom at the <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse School</a> and <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>. After Sandhurst, he joined the <a href="Indian%20Army%20%281895%E2%80%931947%29">Indian Army</a> as an officer of the <a href="11th%20Prince%20Albert%20Victor%27s%20Own%20Cavalry%20%28Frontier%20Force%29">21st Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry</a>. During the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, he served with the <a href="Somaliland%20Camel%20Corps">Camel Corps</a> in <a href="British%20Somaliland">British Somaliland</a>, where he joined in the British fight against the "Mad Mullah", <a href="Mohammed%20Abdullah%20Hassan">Mohammed Abdullah Hassan</a>. In 1925, Ismay became an Assistant Secretary of the <a href="Committee%20of%20Imperial%20Defence">Committee of Imperial Defence</a> (CID). After being promoted to the rank of <a href="colonel">colonel</a>, he served as the <a href="Military%20Secretary%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">military secretary</a> for <a href="Lord%20Willingdon">Lord Willingdon</a>, the <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy of India</a>, then returned to the CID as Deputy Secretary in 1936.

On 1 August 1938, shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War, Ismay became the Committee's Secretary and began planning for the impending war. In May 1940, when Winston Churchill became <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</a>, he selected Ismay as his chief military assistant and <a href="staff%20officer">staff officer</a>. In that capacity, Ismay served as the principal link between Churchill and the <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a>. Ismay also accompanied Churchill to many of the <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20conferences">Allied war conferences</a>. For Ismay's advice and aid, "Churchill owed more, and admitted that he owed more" to him "than to anybody else, military or civilian, in the whole of the war."

After the end of the war, Ismay remained in the army for another year, and helped to reorganise the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a>. He then retired from the military and served as <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten of Burma</a>'s Chief of Staff in India, helping to oversee its <a href="partition%20of%20India">partition</a>. From 1948 to 1951, he served as chairman of the council of the <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a>, helping to organise and promote the event. Then, in 1951, when Churchill again became Prime Minister, he appointed Ismay <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Commonwealth%20Relations">Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations</a>. Ismay accepted the position, but resigned after only six months to become the first <a href="Secretary%20General%20of%20NATO">Secretary General of NATO</a> in 1952. He served in this role until 1957, and helped establish and define the position. After retiring from NATO, Ismay wrote his memoirs, "The Memoirs of General Lord Ismay", served on a variety of corporate boards, and co-chaired the Ismay–Jacob Committee, which reorganised the Ministry of Defence once again. He died on 17 December 1965, at his home <a href="Wormington%20Grange">Wormington Grange</a>, <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>.

Ismay was born in <a href="Nainital">Nainital</a>, India, on 21 June 1887. His father, Sir <a href="Stanley%20Ismay">Stanley Ismay</a>, was a member of the <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy</a>'s Legislative Council, and his mother, Beatrice Ellen, was the daughter of an Army colonel. Ismay began his education in Britain at the <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse School</a>, and his parents hoped that after completing his education there he would attend <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">Cambridge</a> and enter the civil service.

Ismay, however, "had a sneaking desire to be a cavalry soldier", and after doing poorly on his final examinations at Charterhouse, he was not eligible to attend Cambridge. As a result, he entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>, in 1904. Ismay would later write: "Sandhurst never meant nearly so much to me as Charterhouse had", but he enjoyed his time at the school and studied alongside many men who went on to become important military officers, including <a href="Lord%20Gort">Lord Gort</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Ludlow-Hewitt">Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt</a> and <a href="Cyril%20Newall">Cyril Newall</a>.

After completing the course at Sandhurst, Ismay was placed fourth overall in its examinations and was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Army%20%281895%E2%80%931947%29">Indian Army</a>. Ismay was then attached to the <a href="Gloucestershire%20Regiment">Gloucestershire Regiment</a> of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> in <a href="Ambala">Ambala</a>, where he served a one year mandatory apprenticeship. After leaving the regiment, Ismay did not immediately find a place in the Indian cavalry, so he spent nine months floating among positions with various British and Indian units.

In 1907, Ismay found a permanent position in the Indian cavalry, joining the <a href="11th%20Prince%20Albert%20Victor%27s%20Own%20Cavalry%20%28Frontier%20Force%29">21st Prince Albert Victor's Own Cavalry</a>, based at <a href="Risalpur">Risalpur</a>. Ismay thoroughly enjoyed his time with the regiment, describing it as "blissful." In 1908, he saw his first action with the regiment, when it was sent into Afghanistan, pursuing <a href="Mohmand">Mohmand</a> raiders who had taken several Hindu women as hostages. Immediately after Ismay's regiment returned from action, he was hospitalised in <a href="Peshawar">Peshawar</a> due to <a href="heat%20stroke">heat stroke</a>, but he recovered quickly and, along with the rest of his regiment, received the <a href="India%20General%20Service%20Medal%20%281909%29">India General Service Medal</a>.

In 1910, after a reorganisation of the Indian Army, Ismay's regiment moved from Risalpur to <a href="Jhelum%20%28city%29">Jhelum</a>, further from the frontier. Shortly thereafter, Ismay was appointed the <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> of his regiment, a position which he held for four years, during which time he also read voraciously and developed a great admiration for <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, whom he sought to emulate.

In early 1914, just before Ismay's appointment as adjutant was set to expire, he met C.A.L Howard, another British officer serving in India, who told him about an opportunity to serve with the <a href="King%27s%20African%20Rifles">King's African Rifles</a> in <a href="British%20Somaliland">British Somaliland</a>. Ismay decided that this was "just the sort of job that [he] wanted," and applied immediately. Due to his reputation "as a thorough and dependable officer of sound judgement," Ismay was appointed second in command of the <a href="Somaliland%20Camel%20Corps">Somaliland Camel Corps</a>, a cavalry unit led by <a href="Thomas%20Cubitt%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Thomas Cubitt</a>.
Ismay left India for Somaliland in late July 1914, and arrived on 9 August, shortly after the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in Europe. Like other officers in Somaliland, Ismay was "unhappy at being left out of the great war" and repeatedly asked for a transfer to the European front. In the end, however, Ismay's superiors decided that he was "so indispensable that, despite his longing for action in Europe, he was retained in Somaliland until 1920."

In Somaliland, the Camel Corps and other British soldiers were ordered to subdue an uprising by <a href="Mohammed%20Abdullah%20Hassan">Mohammed Abdullah Hassan</a>, known by the British as the "Mad Mullah", who had been fighting against them for more than twenty years. Ismay's commander, <a href="Thomas%20Cubitt%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Thomas Cubitt</a>, was determined to end the rebellion forcefully and quickly, so on 17 November 1914, he launched a major assault against Hassan's fortress at <a href="Shimber%20Berris">Shimber Berris</a>. In the attack, Ismay fought closely alongside <a href="Adrian%20Carton%20de%20Wiart">Adrian Carton de Wiart</a>, later an important British officer in both World Wars. Not long after the attack on Shimber Berris, however, the Camel Corps received orders from London "forbidding all offensive operations in Somaliland", due to the misfortunes of the Army elsewhere. As a result of this order, British operations were limited for the duration of the First World War, and Ismay's unit undertook no further major offensives.

Despite limited British activity, a few operations combined with the effort of local forces led to "a drastic weakening" of Hassan's forces by 1918. Thus, after the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">armistice</a> ending the First World War, the government sent <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major General</a> <a href="Arthur%20Hoskins">Arthur Hoskins</a> to take control of the forces in Somaliland and defeat Hassan conclusively in battle. After Hoskins arrived, his initial plan for dealing with Hassan focussed on the use of the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, so Ismay and the Camel Corps were consigned to a minor role. Hoskins's plans, however, were found "overscaled and far too costly", so they were shelved throughout most of 1918 and 1919.

In October 1919, plans for Hoskins's operation were finally approved, and on 21 January 1920, <a href="1920%20conflict%20between%20British%20forces%20and%20Somaliland%20dervishes">the attack against Hassan</a> commenced. After several days of bombing, Ismay was ordered to lead an assault by the Camel Corps against Hassan's fortress at <a href="Jid%20Ali">Jid Ali</a>. On , Ismay's forces first attempted the attack and were repulsed by strong resistance. That night, however, Hassan and his forces fled Jid Ali to take refuge in the countryside. Ismay was assigned to track down and capture Hassan, but he "had no idea of where he was", and was forced to begin a large search. Ismay pursued Hassan for nearly two weeks, and managed to capture many members of his family and people close to him, including seven of his sons. Nonetheless, Hassan himself managed to evade Ismay and on , the effort to capture him was called off. Though Hassan was never captured, his power was broken, and he died in December 1920 of influenza. For his service in the effort against Hassan, Ismay received the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> and was twice <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>.

In April 1920, Ismay left Somaliland for England. While en route, he received word that he had been nominated for a place at the Indian Army's <a href="Command%20and%20Staff%20College">Staff College</a> in <a href="Quetta">Quetta</a>. Depressed by the loss of life and destruction of the First World War, Ismay turned down the nomination, and "was even seriously thinking of resigning [his] commission" in the Army. After arriving in London, Ismay was given twelve months of medical leave, and decided to stay in the army. He then attempted to reclaim his seat at the Staff College, but was told that it had already been given to someone else.

While on medical leave, Ismay met Laura Kathleen Clegg, with whom he quickly fell in love. The two were engaged only three weeks after meeting. After four months, however, Ismay was proclaimed fit for duty, despite his remaining eight months of leave, and ordered back to India, where he rejoined his old regiment. His time back in India was relatively quiet, as there was "no serious fighting" in the area of his regiment at the time. In February 1921, Ismay took the qualifying exam for the Staff College in <a href="Rawalpindi">Rawalpindi</a>, and passed, earning himself a seat for the next year.

In April, Ismay returned to London on leave, and married Clegg, with whom he eventually had three daughters. Ismay remained in London until February 1922, when he entered the Staff College at Quetta. Ismay excelled at the Staff College, and its commandant called him "one of the two best, if not the best, of the students who have passed through my hands." In his final thesis at the Staff College, Ismay correctly predicted that the next European war would be a <a href="total%20war">total war</a>, but he incorrectly predicted that cavalry would continue to play a role in future warfare.

After the Staff College, Ismay became Deputy Assistant <a href="Quartermaster%20General">Quartermaster General</a> of the Indian Army. In that position, he worked closely with <a href="Claude%20Auchinleck">Claude Auchinleck</a>, beginning a long-standing personal and professional relationship between the two. Ismay found that his work as Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General "was a valuable experience", but did not enjoy it.

In 1924, <a href="Air%20Vice-Marshal">Air Vice-Marshal</a> <a href="Philip%20Game">Philip Game</a> suggested to Ismay that he apply for a seat at the <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>. Although Ismay "had no desire to learn to be a pilot", he was happy for the opportunity to return to England, and went to study at the college. After completing the programme, he was approached about the possibility of serving as an Assistant Secretary of the <a href="Committee%20of%20Imperial%20Defence">Committee of Imperial Defence</a> (CID) under <a href="Maurice%20Hankey">Maurice Hankey</a>. Ismay gladly accepted the position, starting work in December 1925. In the six months between finishing the Staff College and beginning at the CID, Ismay returned to India and held a staff position at the headquarters of the Indian Army in <a href="Shimla">Simla</a>.

As Assistant Secretary, Ismay directed several of the CID's subcommittees, including those for Censorship and War Emergency Legislation, Principal Supply Officers, and Co-ordination of Departmental Action. As the Secretary of the Committee for the Co-ordination of Departmental Action, Ismay "was responsible for seeing that all plans and preparations made by Government Departments or sub-committees of the CID to meet the eventuality of war, were incorporated under appropriate headings in a document known as the War Book." This task ended up consuming most of Ismay's time as Assistant Secretary, and gave him "exceptional insight into the ways of <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>."

While serving as Assistant Secretary, Ismay made important friends and gained the backing of Hankey, by whom he was "greatly valued". Largely through Hankey's influence, Ismay was nominated as a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in the Civil Division, an honour which he received in 1931.

In December 1930, after five years, Ismay left his position at the CID. He was promoted <a href="colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">colonel</a> and hoped to take command of the <a href="12th%20Cavalry%20%28Frontier%20Force%29">12th Cavalry</a>. Instead, he became the military secretary for <a href="Lord%20Willingdon">Lord Willingdon</a>, the newly appointed <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy of India</a>.

In this role, Ismay served as the "unofficial link" between Willingdon and the Indian Army. He also led Willingdon's personal staff, and organised his many trips throughout India. Ismay was also responsible for Willingdon's safety, and took precautions after he was threatened by assassins. In December 1932, Ismay was informed that his service with Willingdon was over and that he was expected to take up a position in the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> during the next year.

At the War Office, Ismay served as an intelligence officer with responsibility for the Middle East, Far East, the Americas, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> and the <a href="Baltic%20States">Baltic States</a>. Ismay enjoyed his work, and wrote that "intelligence is perhaps the most interesting of all Staff work." During his three years in the position, Ismay worked directly under Sir <a href="John%20Dill">John Dill</a>, who would later serve as the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Imperial%20General%20Staff">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a>.

In 1936, Maurice Hankey became determined to "bring Ismay in as his deputy and eventual successor" at the CID. Hoping that the appointment would "strengthen the organization of the CID" and enhance its influence, Hankey offered Ismay the position of Deputy Secretary. Although the appointment meant that Ismay would probably never command troops again, he viewed it as an important opportunity and "accepted with scarcely a moment's hesitation." A week thereafter, Ismay received a letter offering him the command of a cavalry <a href="brigade">brigade</a> in India, but declined, solidifying his choice to remain a staff officer.

As Deputy Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, Ismay had broad responsibilities, and was "concerned with every aspect of planning and preparation for a war which seemed imminent." Ismay dealt extensively with a variety of matters and focussed much of his attention on the preparation of <a href="anti-aircraft">anti-aircraft</a> defences and co-ordination among the military services. As the crisis in Europe escalated, however, Hankey announced his intention to retire in June 1938. Hankey hoped that one person, preferably Ismay, would inherit all of the positions he had occupied, including Secretary of the CID, clerk of the <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>, and Secretary to the Cabinet, but the Prime Minister, <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>, decided that the positions should be split and assigned to different people.

In the end, Ismay was named only to the position of Secretary of the Committee of Imperial Defence, effective 1 August 1938. Ismay assumed the position scarcely more than a year before the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, and the war totally dominated his time in office. Soon after Ismay took office, Hitler initiated a <a href="German%20occupation%20of%20Czechoslovakia">crisis over the Sudetenland</a>. While Chamberlain was at the <a href="Munich%20Conference">Munich Conference</a> attempting to resolve the crisis, Ismay ordered the digging of trenches in London as protection against air attacks, should war occur. Ismay later said that he thought Britain should have gone to war at Munich instead of waiting, but said nothing at the time. As it became increasingly clear that war was inevitable in 1939, Ismay also prepared for a "smooth, simple and practically instantaneous" transition from the Committee of Imperial Defence to the <a href="War%20Cabinet">War Cabinet</a>, or whatever other wartime authority the government might choose.

With the outbreak of the Second World War, the CID was immediately absorbed into the War Cabinet as Ismay had planned. In the midst of the turmoil, Ismay was promoted to <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a>, and began to work closely with Chamberlain, accompanying him on a visit to France in December 1939. Ismay disagreed with several Allied strategic choices, including the decision to try to stop the German advance in Belgium, but kept his doubts to himself.

In April 1940, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> took control of the Military Co-ordination Committee, charged with overseeing all of the military services. He selected Ismay as his chief staff officer, which also gave Ismay the additional responsibility of serving on the <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a>. While serving under Churchill had been a life-long dream for Ismay, he was initially sceptical about the duties of his new position, which seemed unclear and poorly defined.

On 10 May, after the beginning of the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a>, Chamberlain resigned, and Churchill became both Prime Minister and Minister of Defence. Ismay, who later called Churchill "the greatest War Prime Minister in our history", was "thrilled" by this development, and continued to act as Churchill's chief staff officer and military adviser. According to Churchill, the two developed a close "personal and official connection [that] was preserved unbroken and unweakened" throughout the war. As part of this relationship, not long after Churchill became Prime Minister, he arranged for Ismay to be appointed <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a> in June 1940. From the very moment he became Prime Minister, Churchill "relied heavily on General Pug Ismay," who provided a crucial bridge to the military establishment. Ismay served as the "principal assistant to Mr. Churchill in his capacity as Minister of Defence", continued to serve as the Secretary of the Imperial Defence Chiefs of Staff Committee, and became Deputy Secretary of the War Cabinet. Ismay was crucial to running the war effort, as he was able to effectively link the military and civilian leadership. <a href="Jock%20Colville">Jock Colville</a>, Churchill's private secretary, wrote that Ismay had the "tact, patience, and skill in promoting compromise" needed to keep the war running smoothly." Ismay had the additional advantage of being admired by the Service Chiefs for his long and distinguished record as a soldier.

In his role, Ismay handled "nearly all military messages" from Churchill to the Service Chiefs. Ismay also gave Churchill advice on military matters, and often "begged him to be reasonable" when he contemplated foolish actions, believing that Churchill's greatest fault was his "impetuous nature and impatience with opposition." When the Chiefs of Staff found Churchill's demands unfeasible, Ismay took the role of "converting the Prime Minister" to their viewpoint.

As Churchill's chief military adviser, Ismay frequently attended wartime conferences and meetings of the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> and accompanied other British leaders, such as Foreign Minister <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, on their travels. Ismay's travel to the conferences began in 1941, when he went with <a href="Lord%20Beaverbrook">Lord Beaverbrook</a> to the <a href="Moscow%20Conference%20%281941%29">first Moscow Conference</a>. Because English participation in the conference was a secret, Ismay faked influenza to explain his absence from London while it was taking place. The Conference was also the first time that Ismay worked closely with the Americans, whom he found "quite congenial."

Ismay would continue to work closely with the Americans throughout the remainder of the war, and he accompanied Churchill on his 1942 trip to the United States. Shortly after their return, US General <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> arrived in Britain to command the American forces. He established close relations with Ismay, who liked him greatly, and assisted him in co-ordinating with both British forces and the Cabinet. Eisenhower thought highly of Ismay, remembering him for his "stalwart support", and noting, "He was one of those men whose great ability condemned him throughout the war to a staff position. Consequently his name may be forgotten; but the contributions he made to the winning of the war were equal to those of many whose names became household words." Not long after Eisenhower arrived, on 16 August 1942, Ismay was promoted to the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a>. Around the same time, his good relations with the Americans were recognised by others in the government. Thus, in November 1942, when <a href="Eleanor%20Roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a> visited Britain, Lady Ismay was chosen to host her for one night of her stay.

In January 1943, Ismay accompanied Churchill to the <a href="Casablanca%20Conference">Casablanca Conference</a>. Ismay attended nearly all of the proceedings of the Conference, and helped work towards consensus where the Americans and British disagreed on issues. Ismay was also appointed to the committee which wrote the formal report of the conference. After the conference, Ismay visited the American headquarters in <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> to meet with Eisenhower, and helped resolve some differences of opinion between Eisenhower and his British colleagues.

After Casablanca, Ismay accompanied Churchill to the <a href="Washington%20Conference%20%281943%29">third Washington Conference</a> in May 1943. At the conference, Ismay first met the American Admiral <a href="William%20D.%20Leahy">William D. Leahy</a>, who is often described as his American counterpart. The two developed a friendly relationship, and Leahy wrote in his memoirs: "General Sir Hastings Ismay became my favorite, perhaps because his position closely paralleled my own".

After the Washington Conference came the <a href="Quebec%20Conference%2C%201943">Quebec Conference</a> in August 1943. Once again, Ismay attended along with Churchill. The Quebec Conference was the first time that the Allied leaders discussed the full details of <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Operation Overlord</a>, so Ismay spent much of his time explaining details of the operation to Churchill and other leaders. During the conference, Ismay also observed that <a href="Dudley%20Pound">Dudley Pound</a> "had had a breakdown". He took the information to Churchill who demanded Pound's resignation a week later.

Shortly after returning from Quebec, Ismay participated in his next conference, travelling with Anthony Eden to the <a href="Moscow%20Conference%20%281943%29">Moscow Conference</a> in October and November, where he served as Eden's top military adviser. At the conference, Ismay handled all of the Soviet questions about the planning for Operation Overlord, and met <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a> personally for the first time. After the conference, Ismay wrote that he "was optimistic about [sic] post-war relations with Russia", showing his belief that the meeting had gone well.

Only four days after returning from the Moscow Conference, Ismay left England again for the <a href="Cairo%20Conference%20%281943%29">Cairo Conference</a> and <a href="Teheran%20Conference">Teheran Conference</a> with Churchill. One major source of conflict at the Cairo Conference was an American proposal to appoint an overall commander for the <a href="strategic%20bombing">strategic bombing</a> of Germany. Ismay and the British were strongly opposed, and Ismay wrote a long paper against the idea, which became the basis of British policy on the subject. At Teheran, Ismay helped to argue the case for Operation Overlord, but immediately after the conference he developed <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a> and returned to England by ship, scrapping his other plans for the trip.

In the first several months of 1944, Ismay spent almost all of his time planning for the <a href="Normandy%20Landings">Normandy Landings</a>. As part of the planning, Ismay personally coordinated the plans for <a href="Operation%20Bodyguard">Operation Bodyguard</a> and <a href="Operation%20Fortitude">Operation Fortitude</a>, which were designed to deceive the Germans about the planned Normandy landings. In March, <a href="Duncan%20Sandys">Duncan Sandys</a>, Churchill's son-in-law, told Ismay that <a href="Basil%20Liddell%20Hart">Basil Liddell Hart</a>, a noted strategist and historian, had somehow discovered the secret plans for the Normandy landings. This development had the potential to compromise the entire operation, so Ismay personally interviewed Liddell Hart, who claimed to have simply "worked it all out for himself" without any access to secret information. After their interview, Ismay directed the matter to the <a href="MI5">MI5</a>, who never found evidence of wrongdoing, although it is suspected that Liddell Hart may in fact have received information from military planners.

On 20 May 1944, less than a month before the Normandy Landings were scheduled to take place, Ismay was promoted to the rank of full <a href="general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">general</a>. After the successful D-Day landings, King <a href="George%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVI">George VI</a> decided to visit the troops in Normandy, and selected Ismay to accompany him on the visit. In September, Ismay accompanied Churchill to the <a href="Second%20Quebec%20Conference">Second Quebec Conference</a>. Ismay also accompanied Churchill on his visits to Moscow and Paris in late 1944.

In February 1945, Ismay attended the <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Yalta Conference</a>. He found the conference different from the previous ones where "the military element had been the prima donna, occupying the centre of the stage." Instead, at Yalta, political issues took precedence, leaving Ismay and other military advisers "waiting for calls that never came".

On <a href="VE%20Day">VE Day</a>, Ismay found it "quite impossible to be completely happy about the future," due to the lingering Japanese threat, and the rising threat of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Nonetheless, he was happy to be one of only three men to hold the same high government position throughout the war in Europe, along with <a href="Edward%20Bridges%2C%201st%20Baron%20Bridges">Edward Bridges, 1st Baron Bridges</a> and the King.

After VE Day, Ismay accompanied Churchill to the <a href="Potsdam%20Conference">Potsdam Conference</a>. Like Yalta, the conference focussed primarily on political issues, so there was little for Ismay to do. After <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> defeated Churchill in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 election</a>, becoming Prime Minister, Ismay kept his position, working with Attlee at the conference, but remained loyal to Churchill. Ismay and Churchill remained friends for the remainder of their lives, and Ismay even helped Churchill write his memoirs, reviewing and commenting on each chapter of his manuscript.

Shortly after the Potsdam Conference, the war in Asia ended on <a href="VJ%20Day">VJ Day</a>. After this victory, Ismay "would have liked to retire at once", but at Attlee's request he remained in the military for another year. Before continuing work, however, Ismay travelled to New York on 6 September, for a six-week vacation; he received a warm welcome.

Over the next year, Ismay worked largely on the issue of reform for the Ministry of Defence. From December 1945 to February 1946, Ismay worked with a small committee to draft the "Statement Relating to Defence", which formed the basis of reforms implemented by Attlee later that year. For his role, Ismay became known as the "'chief architect' of <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%281947%E2%80%931964%29">the post-war Ministry of Defence</a>."

During the year following the war, Ismay received many honours for his service. In August 1945, as part of <a href="1945%20Prime%20Minister%27s%20Resignation%20Honours">Churchill's resignation honours</a>, he was appointed to the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">Order of the Companions of Honour</a>, an honour rarely bestowed on soldiers. The next January, he received the <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> from the United States. He was promoted <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath</a> in June. Finally, he was named the Chairman of the Council of the <a href="Royal%20National%20Institute%20for%20the%20Blind">Royal National Institute for the Blind</a>.

In November 1946, Ismay announced his intention to retire. Attlee accepted his retirement, effective on 31 December 1946. Immediately after retiring, in the 1947 New Year Honours, Ismay was created a <a href="baron">baron</a> taking the title Baron Ismay, of Wormington in the County of Gloucester. He accepted the barony and took his seat in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> in February.

Shortly after Ismay's retirement, <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten of Burma</a> was appointed as the last British <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy of India</a> and Ismay offered to serve as his chief of staff. Thus, in March 1947, Ismay left with Mountbatten for India to help preside over its transition to independence. After arriving in India, Ismay soon came to the conclusion that the situation there was dire, heading for civil war, and told Mountbatten that "India was a ship on fire in mid-ocean with ammunition in her hold."
When Ismay and Mountbatten arrived, they were committed to preserving a unified India, but Ismay soon realised "that the Moslem League would not agree to any plan which did not provide for the creation of Pakistan as an independent sovereign state." In April, after several unsuccessful meetings with <a href="Muhammad%20Ali%20Jinnah">Muhammad Ali Jinnah</a>, Mountbatten came to the same conclusion and began drawing up plans for the partition. Over the next month Mountbatten finalised his partition plan, and on , he sent Ismay back to London to present it to the British government. Ismay presented the plan to the Prime Minister and Cabinet, casting partition as a <a href="Hobson%27s%20choice">Hobson's choice</a>. Ismay stayed in England for the next month, and helped to alter the plan based on the cabinet's suggestions, before returning to India on .

Once the partition plan had been accepted, Ismay worked on implementing the details. In particular, Ismay dealt with the issue of dividing the Indian Army. Based on his own experiences and love of the Indian Army, Ismay did his "utmost to persuade" the leaders of the new Indian and Pakistani states not to separate the army immediately. His efforts failed due to the opposition of Jinnah.

Ismay also travelled to <a href="Kashmir">Kashmir</a> to ask <a href="Hari%20Singh">Hari Singh</a> to hold an immediate referendum over whether his territory would join India or Pakistan. Once again, Ismay was unsuccessful and Singh "changed the subject" each time that Ismay tried to discuss the referendum. Throughout the period immediately following independence, Ismay also tried to ensure that stories printed in the Indian and Pakistani press about the partition were accurate, but once again he was largely unsuccessful.

The situation in India continued to deteriorate throughout the summer and autumn of 1947. Nevertheless, Ismay and Mountbatten had agreed that Ismay would remain in his position for only three to four months after partition. In December 1947, he left India to return to England. Shortly after his return, Ismay served briefly on the British delegation to the United Nations to deal with the Kashmir issue. Ismay played only a limited role, as the Pakistanis suspected him of pro-Indian sympathies.

Shortly after Ismay returned from the United Nations, Prime Minister Attlee asked him to become the Chairman of the Council of the <a href="Festival%20of%20Britain">Festival of Britain</a>, scheduled to take place in 1951. Ismay accepted the offer, and on 10 March 1948, he officially took the position of chairman. The appointment was largely symbolic, and Ismay "was at least partly appointed to forestall potential criticism by his friend Winston Churchill." The Council, however, wielded "slight, but not insignificant influence" and Ismay took his duties seriously.

Ismay helped to ensure that the festival would be truly national in character, rather than just confined to London. As such, in June 1949, he called together all of the mayors in Britain to discuss the festival; this was the first meeting of all British mayors since 1916. Ismay also publicly defended the large cost of the festival, and emphasised its historic nature, saying, "We are consciously and deliberately determined to make history." Once the festival opened, Ismay hosted various notable guests, including <a href="Margaret%20Truman">Margaret Truman</a>, the daughter of US President <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a>.

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201951">1951 general election</a> held shortly after the conclusion of the Festival of Britain, Churchill's <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> once again won a majority in Parliament, making Churchill Prime Minister for a second time. The day after the election, Churchill asked Ismay to become the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Commonwealth%20Relations">Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations</a> in his cabinet. Ismay "was overjoyed at the prospect of serving under Churchill again" and accepted the post immediately. Although not a politician, Ismay was well-suited for the position because of his close relationships with the leaders of the commonwealth countries, largely the result of his work during the war.

As a result of his military background and experience, Ismay became "more closely involved in defence matters than is usual for a Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations," and often served as de facto Minister of Defence and serving as temporary Minister of Defence until the permanent appointee, <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Harold Alexander</a>, was able to take office. Through his close involvement in defence matters, Ismay began to be involved with the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organization">North Atlantic Treaty Organization</a>. In January 1952, he accompanied Churchill to a meeting in Ottawa about the alliance, and in February 1952 he attended the NATO Lisbon Conference as the British Ministry of Defence representative. When leaving the conference, Ismay remarked to <a href="Alfred%20Gruenther">Alfred Gruenther</a>, "this is the first that I have seen of NATO, and thank heaven it's the last."

At the Lisbon Conference, the members of NATO agreed to appoint a <a href="Secretary%20General%20of%20NATO">Secretary General</a> who would direct the organisation's staff and serve as Vice-Chairman of the <a href="Atlantic%20Council">Atlantic Council</a>. The position was initially offered to Sir <a href="Oliver%20Franks">Oliver Franks</a>, but he declined. As such, the allies scrambled to find someone else to take the position. Two weeks later, the countries agreed to ask Ismay to become Secretary General at the suggestion of Churchill and <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>.

Eden asked Ismay to accept the position, but his response "was an immediate and emphatic negative," as he saw NATO as an overly bureaucratic and inefficient organisation and complained that the position of Secretary General was "divided and ill-defined." Churchill then personally asked Ismay to accept the position, telling him that "NATO provided the best, if not the only, hope of peace in our time." After further urging, Ismay reluctantly agreed to take the job. On , the Atlantic Council officially passed a resolution appointing Ismay Secretary General, and he started work on .

Ismay's appointment to the position was well-received, enjoying the unanimous support of all the NATO members. The press and public also responded favourably. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" wrote: "of all the candidates whose names have been mentioned, Lord Ismay would seem to have the strongest qualifications for the post." "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" applauded his "vast experience in military planning, strategy, and administration," and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" wrote that Ismay would bring NATO "great authority, experience and energy and a personal charm that can dissolve difficulties."

As the first Secretary General, Ismay was "assuming an entirely new role in the history of international organizations," and as such he helped to define the position itself. While Ismay "deemed it wise not to step too boldly in a political role" in disputes among the members, he asserted himself strongly on issues relevant to the organisation of NATO. From the very beginning of his time in office, Ismay worked to empower the permanent representatives to NATO, and emphasised that they had the same legal authority to make decisions as the NATO foreign ministers.

Ismay was also a proponent of NATO expansion, saying that NATO "must grow until the whole free world gets under one umbrella."
However, before <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> was even put in place, he opposed the request to join NATO made by the USSR in 1954 

As Secretary General, Ismay also worked to encourage closer political co-ordination among the members of the alliance. During the <a href="Suez%20Crisis">Suez Crisis</a> he offered his good offices to help resolve issues among members of the alliance. Ismay also offered to help mediate disputes over <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a>.

In December 1956, Ismay decided to retire from NATO. He told the press that "he was not giving up his position for personal reasons, but because he felt it needed a fresh hand and a fresh brain." <a href="Paul-Henri%20Spaak">Paul-Henri Spaak</a> was immediately chosen as his successor, but Ismay remained in office until May 1957, when he left with "the affection and respect" of all the NATO members. While Secretary General, Ismay is also credited as having been the first person to say that the purpose of the alliance was "to keep the Russians out, the Americans in, and the Germans down," a saying that has since become a common way to quickly describe the alliance.

Immediately after leaving NATO, Ismay was honoured by <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> with an appointment to the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Order of the Garter</a>. His youngest daughter Mary had married George Seymour, equerry to <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20the%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother</a>, and their daughter Katharine is a god-daughter of <a href="Princess%20Margaret%2C%20Countess%20of%20Snowdon">Princess Margaret</a>.

He was appointed to boards of several corporations including the <a href="Ashanti%20Goldfields%20Corporation">Ashanti Goldfields Corporation</a>. Ismay also began writing his memoirs, "The Memoirs of General Lord Ismay", which were published in 1960 by <a href="Viking%20Press">Viking Press</a>. In his memoirs, Ismay focussed principally on his Second World War service, and as such, one reviewer called them "a most significant addition to the literature of the Second World War."

In 1963, Ismay was asked to again assist in a review of the organisation of the British military along with Sir <a href="Ian%20Jacob">Ian Jacob</a>. Although Ismay was ill throughout most of the review and did relatively little of the work, "his influence was strong", and the final product of the review largely reflected his opinions. In the end, the Ismay–Jacob Report recommended strengthening the central power of the Ministry of Defence substantially, and in 1964, Parliament implemented its recommendations.

Ismay died on 17 December 1965 at his home <a href="Wormington%20Grange">Wormington Grange</a>, Gloucestershire, at the age of 78. As he had no male heir, his title became extinct. His <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">Garter banner</a>, which hung in <a href="St.%20George%27s%20Chapel%2C%20Windsor%20Castle">St. George's Chapel in Windsor</a> during his lifetime, is now on display in the nave of <a href="Tewkesbury%20Abbey">Tewkesbury Abbey</a>.

Wii

The Wii ( ; known unofficially as the Nintendo Wii) is a <a href="home%20video%20game%20console">home video game console</a> released by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> on November 19, 2006. As a <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28seventh%20generation%29">seventh-generation</a> console, the Wii competed with <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony</a>'s <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>. Nintendo states that its console targets a broader demographic than that of the two others. , the Wii led its generation over the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in worldwide sales, with more than 101 million units sold; in December 2009, the console broke the sales record for a single month in the United States.

The Wii introduced the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a> <a href="Game%20controller">controller</a>, which can be used as a handheld <a href="pointing%20device">pointing device</a> and which <a href="accelerometer">detects movement</a> in <a href="three-dimensional%20space">three dimensions</a>. The console runs games supplied on <a href="Nintendo%20optical%20disc">Wii optical discs</a>. It also supported the now discontinued <a href="WiiConnect24">WiiConnect24</a> service, which enabled Wii to receive messages and updates over the <a href="Internet">Internet</a> while in <a href="Sleep%20mode">standby mode</a>. Like other seventh-generation consoles it supported a service, called "<a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a>", that downloaded <a href="Video%20game%20console%20emulator">emulated</a> games from past Nintendo consoles, support for online video streaming such as <a href="BBC%20iPlayer">BBC iPlayer</a>, and other services provided by Nintendo over the Internet. Internet services were withdrawn; since 31 January 2019 only re-download of games, system software update, and transfer of data between Wii and Wii U continued to be available, to be withdrawn at an unspecified future date. <a href="Wii%20Shop%20Channel%23Wii%20Points">Wii Points</a> could no longer be purchased after March 2018, and could not be used and were permanently lost from 31 January 2019.

The Wii succeeded the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>; early models are fully <a href="Backward%20compatibility">backward-compatible</a> with all GameCube games and most accessories. Nintendo first spoke of the console at the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3 2004</a> <a href="News%20conference">press conference</a> and later unveiled it at <a href="History%20of%20the%20Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3 2005</a>. Nintendo CEO <a href="Satoru%20Iwata">Satoru Iwata</a> revealed a prototype of the controller at the September 2005 <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a>. At <a href="History%20of%20the%20Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3 2006</a>, the console won the first of several awards. By December 8, 2006, it had completed <a href="Wii%20launch">its launch</a> in the four key markets.

Later models are no longer compatible with Nintendo GameCube. In late 2011, Nintendo released a reconfigured model, the "<a href="%23Family%20Edition">Wii Family Edition</a>", which was not released in Japan. The <a href="%23Wii%20Mini">Wii Mini</a>, Nintendo's first major console redesign since the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System%20%28Model%20SNS-101%29">compact SNES</a>, succeeded the standard Wii model and was released first in Canada on December 7, 2012. The Wii Mini can only play <a href="Nintendo%20optical%20disc">Wii optical discs</a>, as it has neither GameCube compatibility nor any <a href="Computer%20network">networking</a> capabilities; this model was not released in Japan, Australia, or New Zealand. The Wii's successor, the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a>, was released on November 18, 2012. On October 20, 2013, Nintendo confirmed it had discontinued production of the Wii in Japan and Europe.

The console was conceived in 2001, as the <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> was first released. According to an interview with Nintendo game designer <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, the concept involved focusing on a new form of player interaction. "The consensus was that power isn't everything for a console. Too many powerful consoles can't coexist. It's like having only ferocious <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s. They might fight and hasten their own extinction."

In 2003, game <a href="game%20engine">engineers</a> and <a href="Game%20designer">designers</a> were brought together to develop the concept further. By 2005 the controller interface had taken form, but a public showing at that year's <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) was canceled. Miyamoto stated that the company "had some troubleshooting to do. So we decided not to reveal the controller and instead we displayed just the console." Nintendo president <a href="Satoru%20Iwata">Satoru Iwata</a> later unveiled and demonstrated the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a> at the September <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a>.

The <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> is said to have influenced the Wii's design. Designer Ken'ichiro Ashida noted, "We had the DS on our minds as we worked on the Wii. We thought about copying the DS's touch-panel interface and even came up with a prototype." The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also stated, "[...] if the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board." In June 2011 Nintendo unveiled the prototype of its successor to the Wii, to be known as the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a>.

The console was known by the code name "Revolution" from May 11, 2004 when its codename was announced at Nintendo's 2004 pre-Electronics Entertainment Expo press conference in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a> until April 27, 2006, immediately before <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a>. Before the Wii's codename was announced, the media referred to the console as "GCNext" or Gamecube Next and "N5" or Nintendo's fifth major home console.

Nintendo's spelling of "Wii" (with two lower-case "i" characters) is intended to resemble two people standing side-by-side (representing players gathering together) and to represent the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. One reason the company has given for this name choice since the announcement is:

Some <a href="video%20game%20developer">video game developer</a>s and members of the press stated that they preferred "Revolution" over "Wii". "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" expressed a fear "that the name would convey a continued sense of 'kidiness' to the console." The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> reported the day after the name was announced that "a long list of puerile jokes, based on the name," had appeared on the Internet.

Nintendo of America's Vice President of Corporate Affairs Perrin Kaplan defended the choice of "Wii" over "Revolution" and responded to critics of the name, stating "Live with it, sleep with it, eat with it, move along with it and hopefully they'll arrive at the same place." Nintendo of America's president <a href="Reggie%20Fils-Aime">Reggie Fils-Aime</a> acknowledged the initial reaction and further explained the change:

The Nintendo Style Guide refers to the console as "simply Wii, not Nintendo Wii", making it the first home console Nintendo has marketed outside Japan without the company name in its trademark. The Wii's successor, the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a>, was also marketed without Nintendo in its name, although its successor, the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, brought back the Nintendo name in marketing.

On September 14, 2006 Nintendo announced release information for Japan, <a href="North%20America">North</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a>, <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and <a href="Europe">Europe</a> including dates, prices, and projected unit-distribution figures. It was announced that the majority of the 2006 shipments would be allotted to the Americas, and 33 titles would be available at its launch. The Wii was launched in the United States on November 19, 2006 for $249.99, and was later launched in the United Kingdom on December 8, 2006 for £179. The United Kingdom experienced a widespread shortage of Wii units in many High-Street and online stores, and was unable to fulfill all pre-orders at its release. The Wii was launched in <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> on April 26, 2008, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a> on July 12, 2008, and <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> on December 12, 2009.

Nintendo has hoped to <a href="target%20market">target</a> a wider <a href="demographic%20profile">demographic</a> with its console than that of others in the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28seventh%20generation%29">seventh generation</a>. At a press conference for the then-upcoming <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> game "" in December 2006, Satoru Iwata insisted "We're not thinking about fighting <a href="Sony">Sony</a>, but about how many people we can get to play games. The thing we're thinking about most is not portable systems, consoles, and so forth, but that we want to get new people playing games." This is reflected in Nintendo's series of <a href="television%20advertisement">television advertisement</a>s in North America (directed by <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> winner <a href="Stephen%20Gaghan">Stephen Gaghan</a>) and its Internet ads. The advertising slogans were ""Wii would like to play"" and ""Experience a new way to play""; the ads began November 15, 2006, and had a total budget of over <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>200 million for the year. The productions were Nintendo's first broad-based advertising strategy and included a two-minute <a href="video%20clip">video clip</a> showing an assortment of people enjoying the Wii system: urban apartment-dwellers, ranchers, grandparents, and parents with their children. The music in the ads was from the song "Kodo (Inside the Sun Remix)" by the <a href="Yoshida%20Brothers">Yoshida Brothers</a>. The marketing campaign was successful; <a href="pensioner">pensioner</a>s as old as 103 were reported to be playing the Wii in the United Kingdom. A report by the British newspaper "<a href="The%20People">The People</a>" also stated that <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> of the United Kingdom has used the console.

Retail copies of games are supplied on proprietary, <a href="DVD">DVD</a>-type <a href="Nintendo%20optical%20disc">Wii optical discs</a>, which are packaged in <a href="keep%20case">keep case</a>s with instructions. In Europe, the boxes have a triangle at the bottom corner of the paper sleeve-insert side. The triangle is color-coded to identify the region for which the title is intended and which manual languages are included. The console supports <a href="regional%20lockout">regional lockout</a>: software available in a region can be only played on that region's hardware.

New games in Nintendo's flagship franchises (including "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>", "<a href="Mario%20%28franchise%29">Super Mario</a>", "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28video%20game%20series%29">Pokémon</a>", and "<a href="Metroid">Metroid</a>") have been released, in addition to many original titles and third-party-developed games. Nintendo has received third-party support from companies such as <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>, <a href="Sega">Sega</a>, <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a>, <a href="Activision%20Blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a>, with more games being developed for Wii than for the PlayStation 3 or Xbox 360. Nintendo also launched the <a href="New%20Play%20Control%21">New Play Control!</a> line, a selection of enhanced GameCube games for the Wii featuring updated controls.

The <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> service allows Wii owners to play games originally released for the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>, <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>, <a href="Sega">Sega</a>'s <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Genesis/Mega Drive</a> and <a href="Sega%20Master%20System">Sega Mark III/Sega Master System</a>, <a href="NEC">NEC</a>'s <a href="TurboGrafx-16">TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine</a>, <a href="SNK%20Playmore">SNK</a>'s <a href="Neo%20Geo%20%28system%29">Neo Geo console</a>, <a href="Commodore%2064">Commodore 64</a> and <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a>s. Virtual Console games were distributed over broadband Internet via the former <a href="Wii%20Shop%20Channel">Wii Shop Channel</a>, and are saved to the Wii internal flash memory or to a removable <a href="Secure%20Digital">SD card</a>. Once downloaded, Virtual Console games can be accessed from the <a href="Wii%20Menu">Wii Menu</a> (as individual channels) or from an SD card via the SD Card Menu. There is also the <a href="Wii%20homebrew">Wii Homebrew</a> Channel, which can be installed by exploiting the Wii, allowing the user to run <a href="unauthorized">unauthorized</a> applications built from <a href="User-generated%20content">user-generated</a> code.

The game development suite <a href="Unity%20%28game%20engine%29">Unity</a> can be used to create official Wii games; however, the developer must be authorized by Nintendo to develop games for the console. Games must also be accepted by Nintendo to be sold.

920.66 million Wii games had been sold worldwide , and <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20Wii%20video%20games">104 titles</a> had surpassed the million-unit mark by March 2011. The most successful game ("<a href="Wii%20Sports">Wii Sports</a>", which comes bundled with the console in most regions) sold 82.86 million copies worldwide by September 30, 2018, surpassing "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>" as the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games">best-selling video game</a> of all time in 2009. However, as of July 2018, <a href="Tetris">Tetris</a> is the best selling video game of all time, having sold 170 million copies both physical and digital as of July 2010. The best-selling unbundled game, "<a href="Mario%20Kart%20Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a>", had sold 37.14 million units worldwide by September 30, 2018.

Twenty-one games were announced for launch day in North and South America, with another twelve announced for release later in 2006. "<a href="Wii%20Sports">Wii Sports</a>" was included with the console bundle in all regions except Japan and South Korea. In contrast to the price of $60 quoted for many seventh-generation games in the US, Wii titles cost (at most) $50 at major US <a href="Retail">retail stores</a>.

Key:

"" was promoted as a launch title, but its release was eventually postponed until August 27, 2007 in North America. <a href="Satoru%20Iwata">Satoru Iwata</a> also initially wished for "<a href="Super%20Smash%20Bros.%20Brawl">Super Smash Bros. Brawl</a>" to be released at launch.

The Wii was Nintendo's smallest home console at the time (the current smallest is hybrid home-portable console Nintendo Switch, when in portable mode); it measures 44 <a href="millimetre">mm</a> (1.73 <a href="inch">in</a>) wide, 157 mm (6.18 in) tall and 215.4 mm (8.48 in) deep in its vertical orientation, slightly larger than three <a href="keep%20case">DVD cases</a> stacked together. The included stand measures 55.4 mm (2.18 in) wide, 44 mm (1.73 in) tall and 225.6 mm (8.88 in) deep. The system weighs 1.2 <a href="kilogram">kg</a> (2.7 <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">lb</a>), making it the lightest of the three major <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28seventh%20generation%29">seventh-generation</a> consoles. The Wii may stand horizontally or vertically. The prefix for the numbering scheme of the system and its parts and accessories is "RVL-" for its <a href="code%20name">code name</a>, "Revolution".

The front of the console features an illuminated slot-loading optical media drive which accepts only 12 cm <a href="Wii%20Optical%20Disc">Wii Optical Disc</a>s and 8 cm <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube%20Game%20Disc">Nintendo GameCube Game Disc</a>s. (Units sold in South Korea and later revisions do not support GameCube discs.) The blue light in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console is turned on, and pulses when new data is received through <a href="WiiConnect24">WiiConnect24</a>. After the update (including System Menu 3.0), the disc-slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc-slot light remains off during game play or when using other features. Two <a href="Universal%20Serial%20Bus">USB</a> ports are located on the back of the console. An SD-card slot is located behind the SD-card slot cover on the front of the console, where an SD-card can be inserted.

The <a href="Wii%20launch">Wii launch</a> package includes the console; a stand to allow the console to be placed vertically; a round, clear stabilizer for the main stand; a <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a>; a <a href="Wii%20Nunchuk">Nunchuk</a> attachment; a <a href="Sensor%20Bar">Sensor Bar</a>; a removable stand for the bar; an external <a href="power%20supply">power adapter</a>; two <a href="AA%20battery">AA batteries</a>; a <a href="composite%20video">composite AV cable</a> with <a href="RCA%20connector">RCA connector</a>s; a <a href="SCART">SCART</a> adapter in European countries (<a href="component%20video">component video</a> and other types of cables are available separately); operation documentation and (in Europe and the Americas) a copy of the game "<a href="Wii%20Sports">Wii Sports</a>".

The disc reader of the Wii does not play <a href="DVD-Video">DVD-Video</a>, <a href="DVD-Audio">DVD-Audio</a> or <a href="Compact%20Disc">Compact Disc</a>s. A 2006 announcement stated that a new version of the Wii (capable of DVD-Video playback) would be released in 2007; however, Nintendo delayed its release to focus on meeting demand for the original console. Nintendo's initial announcement stated that it "requires more than a firmware upgrade" to implement, and the capability could not be made available as an upgrade option for the existing Wii; the delay later became a cancellation when production of the Wii was discontinued in 2013. However, despite the assertion, third parties have used <a href="Wii%20homebrew">Wii homebrew</a> to add DVD playback to unmodified Wii units. The Wii also can be <a href="Hacker%20%28hobbyist%29">hacked</a> to enable an owner to use the console for activities unintended by the manufacturer. <a href="List%20of%20Wii%20drivechips">Several brands</a> of <a href="modchip">modchip</a>s are available for the Wii.

Although Nintendo showed the console and the Wii Remote in white, black, silver, lime-green and red before it was released, it was only available in white for its first two-and-a-half years of sales. Black consoles were available in Japan in August 2009, in Europe in November 2009 and in North America on May 9, 2010. A red Wii system bundle was available in Japan on November 11, 2010, commemorating the 25th anniversary of "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>" The European version of the limited-edition red Wii bundle was released on October 29, 2010, which includes the original "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20%28video%20game%29">Donkey Kong</a>" game preloaded onto the console, "<a href="New%20Super%20Mario%20Bros.%20Wii">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a>" and "Wii Sports". The bundle also features the Wii Remote Plus, with integrated Wii Motion Plus technology. The red Wii bundle was released in North America on November 7, 2010 with "New Super Mario Bros. Wii", Wii Sports and the Wii Remote Plus.

On July 11, 2007, Nintendo unveiled the <a href="Wii%20Balance%20Board">Wii Balance Board</a> at <a href="History%20of%20E3%232007%20%28July%2011%E2%80%9313%29">E3 2007</a> with "<a href="Wii%20Fit">Wii Fit</a>". It is a wireless <a href="balance%20board">balance board</a> accessory for the Wii, with multiple pressure sensors used to measure the user's <a href="center%20of%20mass">center of balance</a>. <a href="Namco%20Bandai%20Games">Namco Bandai</a> produced a mat controller (a simpler, less-sophisticated competitor to the balance board).

The Wii Remote is the primary <a href="game%20controller">controller</a> for the console. It uses a combination of built-in <a href="accelerometer">accelerometer</a>s and <a href="infrared">infrared</a> detection to sense its position in <a href="three-dimensional%20space">3D</a> space when pointed at the <a href="light-emitting%20diode">LEDs</a> in the <a href="Sensor%20Bar">Sensor Bar</a>. This design allows users to control the game with physical gestures as well as button-presses. The controller connects to the console using <a href="Bluetooth">Bluetooth</a> with an approximate range, and features <a href="Haptic%20technology%23Computer%20and%20video%20games">rumble</a> and an internal speaker. An attachable <a href="Wii%20Remote%23Strap">wrist strap</a> can be used to prevent the player from unintentionally dropping (or throwing) the Wii Remote. Nintendo has since offered a stronger strap and the <a href="Wii%20Remote%20Jacket">Wii Remote Jacket</a> to provide extra grip and protection.

Accessories can be connected to a Wii Remote through a <a href="Proprietary%20hardware">proprietary</a> port at the base of the controller, such as the bundled <a href="Wii%20Nunchuk">Nunchuk</a> — a handheld unit with an accelerometer, <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a>, and two trigger buttons.An expansion accessory known as <a href="Wii%20MotionPlus">Wii MotionPlus</a> augments the Wii Remote's existing sensors with <a href="gyroscope">gyroscope</a>s to allow for finer motion detection; the MotionPlus functionality was later incorporated into a revision of the controller known as Wii Remote Plus. At <a href="E3%202009">E3 2009</a>, Nintendo also presented a "<a href="Heart%20rate%20monitor">Vitality Sensor</a>" accessory that could be used to measure a player's pulse. In a 2013 Q&A, Satoru Iwata revealed that the Vitality Sensor had been shelved, as internal testing found that the device did not work with all users, and its use cases were too narrow.

The Classic Controller is another extension for Wii Remote and is more similar to classic gamepads. Players can use it with older games from the Virtual Console in addition to games designed for the Wii.

The Wii console contains 512 <a href="megabyte">megabyte</a>s of internal non-removable <a href="flash%20memory">flash memory</a>, and features an SD card slot for external storage. An SD card can be used for uploading photos and backing up <a href="saved%20game">saved game</a> data and downloaded <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> and <a href="WiiWare">WiiWare</a> games. To use the SD slot for transferring game saves, an <a href="patch%20%28computing%29">update</a> must be installed. Installation may be initiated from the Wii options menu through an Internet connection, or by inserting a game disc containing the update. Virtual Console data cannot be restored to any system except the unit of origin. An SD card can also be used to create customized in-game music from stored <a href="MP3">MP3</a> files (as first shown in "<a href="Excite%20Truck">Excite Truck</a>") and music for the slide-show feature of the <a href="Photo%20Channel">Photo Channel</a>. Version 1.1 of the Photo Channel removed MP3 playback in favor of <a href="Advanced%20Audio%20Coding">AAC</a> support.

At the Nintendo Fall Press Conference in October 2008, Satoru Iwata announced that Wii owners would have the option to download WiiWare and Virtual Console content directly onto an SD card. The option would offer an alternative to "address the console's insufficient memory storage". The announcement stated that it would be available in Japan in spring 2009; Nintendo made the update available on March 25. In addition to the previously announced feature, the update also allows users to play games directly from an SD card. The update also added support for <a href="Secure%20Digital">SDHC</a> cards with up to 32 GB of storage.

Nintendo has released few technical details regarding the Wii system, but some key facts have leaked through the press. Although none of these reports has been officially confirmed, they generally indicate that the console is an extension (or advancement) of the <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> architecture. Specifically, the analyses report that the Wii is roughly 1.5 to 2 times as powerful as its predecessor. Based on specifications, the Wii has been called the least powerful of the major home consoles of its generation.

The first Wii system software update (via WiiConnect24) caused a small number of launch units to become <a href="Brick%20%28electronics%29">completely unusable</a>. This forced users to either send their units to <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> for repairs (if they wished to retain their saved data) or exchange them for free replacements.

With the release of dual-layer Wii Optical Discs, Nintendo of America stated that some Wii systems may have difficulty reading the high-density software (due to a contaminated laser lens). Nintendo offers retail lens-cleaning kits and free console repairs for owners who experience this issue.

The Wii Remote can lose track of the Wii system it has been set to, requiring that it be reset and resynchronized. Nintendo's support website provides instructions for this process and troubleshooting related issues.

The console has a number of internal features made available from its hardware and <a href="firmware">firmware</a> components. The hardware allows for extendability (via expansion ports), while the firmware (and some software) can receive periodic updates via the <a href="WiiConnect24">WiiConnect24</a> service.

The Wii Menu interface is designed to emulate <a href="television%20channel">television channel</a>s. Separate channels are graphically displayed in a grid, and are navigated using the pointer capability of the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a>. Except for the Disc Channel, it is possible to change the arrangement by holding down the A and B buttons to "grab" channels and move them around. There are six primary channels: the Disc Channel, Mii Channel, Photo Channel, Wii Shop Channel, Forecast Channel and News Channel. The latter two were initially unavailable at launch, but were later activated in updates. The Wii + Internet Video Channel was pre-installed on all Wii consoles starting in October 2008. Additional channels are available for download from the <a href="Wii%20Shop%20Channel">Wii Shop Channel</a> through <a href="WiiWare">WiiWare</a>, and appear with each <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> title; these include the <a href="Everybody%20Votes%20Channel">Everybody Votes Channel</a>, <a href="Internet%20Channel">Internet Channel</a>, <a href="Check%20Mii%20Out%20Channel">Check Mii Out Channel</a> and the <a href="Nintendo%20Channel">Nintendo Channel</a>.

Wii consoles with the original design are <a href="backward%20compatibility">backward-compatible</a> with all <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> software, Nintendo GameCube Memory Cards and controllers. Software compatibility is achieved by the slot-loading drive's ability to accept <a href="Nintendo%20optical%20disc">Nintendo GameCube Game Discs</a>. However, redesigned "Family Edition" Wiis and the Wii Mini are not backward-compatible.

A Wii console running a GameCube disc is restricted to GameCube functionality, and a GameCube controller is required to play GameCube titles. A Nintendo GameCube Memory Card is also necessary to save game progress and content, since the Wii internal flash memory will not save GameCube games. Also, backward compatibility is limited in some areas. For example, online and LAN-enabled features for Nintendo GameCube titles are unavailable on the Wii, since the console lacks serial ports for the <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube%20Broadband%20Adapter%20and%20Modem%20Adapter">Nintendo GameCube Broadband Adapter and Modem Adapter</a>.

The Wii system supports wireless connectivity with the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a> without any additional accessories. This connectivity allows the player to use the Nintendo DS microphone and <a href="touchscreen">touchscreen</a> as inputs for Wii games. The first game utilizing Nintendo DS-Wii connectivity is "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20Battle%20Revolution">Pokémon Battle Revolution</a>". Players with either the <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20Diamond%20and%20Pearl">"Pokémon Diamond" or "Pearl"</a> Nintendo DS games are able to play battles using the Nintendo DS as a controller. "", released on both Nintendo DS and Wii, features connectivity in which both games can advance simultaneously. Nintendo later released the <a href="Nintendo%20Channel">Nintendo Channel</a>, which allows Wii owners to download <a href="game%20demo">game demo</a>s or additional data to their Nintendo DS in a process similar to that of a <a href="DS%20Download%20Station">DS Download Station</a>. The console is also able to expand Nintendo DS games.

The Wii console connects to the Internet through its built-in <a href="IEEE%20802.11%23802.11b">802.11b</a>/<a href="IEEE%20802.11%23802.11g">g</a> Wi-Fi or through a USB-to-Ethernet adapter; either method allows players to access the <a href="Nintendo%20Wi-Fi%20Connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> service. The service has several features for the console, including <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a>, <a href="WiiConnect24">WiiConnect24</a>, the <a href="Internet%20Channel">Internet Channel</a>, the <a href="Forecast%20Channel">Forecast Channel</a>, the <a href="Everybody%20Votes%20Channel">Everybody Votes Channel</a>, the <a href="News%20Channel%20%28Wii%29">News Channel</a> and the <a href="Mii">Check Mii Out Channel</a>. The Wii can also communicate (and connect) with other Wii systems through a self-generated wireless <a href="local%20area%20network">LAN</a>, enabling local wireless multi-playing on different television sets. "<a href="Battalion%20Wars%202">Battalion Wars 2</a>" first demonstrated this feature for non-split screen multi-playing between two (or more) televisions.

On April 9, 2008, the BBC announced that its online <a href="BBC%20iPlayer">BBC iPlayer</a> would be available on the Wii via the <a href="Internet%20Channel">Internet Channel</a> browser; however, some users experienced difficulty with the service. On November 18, 2009, BBC iPlayer on the Wii was launched as the BBC iPlayer Channel, a free downloadable channel from the <a href="Wii%20Shop%20Channel">Wii Shop Channel</a>; however, the service was discontinued in early 2017.

<a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> was released as a downloadable channel for the Wii on October 18, 2010 in Canada and the United States. A survey conducted by <a href="Nielsen%20Holdings">Nielson</a> revealed that 25% of Netflix subscribers used the Netflix Channel on the Wii as of July 2011.

<a href="Hulu">Hulu</a> announced in October 2011 that they would be releasing their <a href="streaming%20service">streaming service</a>, Hulu Plus, on the Wii and the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>. Hulu Plus was released on February 16, 2012 as a downloadable channel for the Wii.

<a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> was released as a downloadable channel for the Wii on December 15, 2012 in the United States. The YouTube Channel for the Wii was discontinued on June 28, 2017 as part of YouTube's plan to phase out availability on older devices.

<a href="Prime%20Video">Prime Video</a>, <a href="Amazon%20%28company%29">Amazon</a>'s streaming service, was released on January 14, 2013 as a downloadable channel for the Wii.

<a href="Crunchyroll">Crunchyroll</a>, an <a href="anime">anime</a> streaming service, was released on October 15, 2015 as a downloadable channel for the Wii.

In 2018, Netflix announced that Nintendo would shut down support for video streaming services on the Wii on January 30, 2019, including Netflix.

The console features <a href="parental%20controls">parental controls</a>, which can be used to prohibit younger users from playing games with content unsuitable for their age level. When one attempts to play a Wii or <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> game, it reads the content rating encoded in the game data; if this rating is greater than the system's set age level, the game will not load without a password. Parental controls may also restrict Internet access, which blocks the <a href="Internet%20Channel">Internet Channel</a> and system-update features. Since the console is restricted to <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a> functionality when playing Nintendo GameCube Game Discs, GameCube software is unaffected by Wii parental-control settings.

European units primarily use the <a href="Pan%20European%20Game%20Information">PEGI</a> rating system, while North American units use the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">ESRB</a> rating system. The Wii supports the rating systems of many countries, including <a href="Computer%20Entertainment%20Rating%20Organization">CERO</a> in Japan, the <a href="Unterhaltungssoftware%20Selbstkontrolle">USK</a> in Germany, the <a href="Pan%20European%20Game%20Information">PEGI</a> and <a href="British%20Board%20of%20Film%20Classification">BBFC</a> in the United Kingdom, the <a href="Australian%20Classification%20Board">ACB</a> in Australia and the <a href="Office%20of%20Film%20and%20Literature%20Classification%20%28New%20Zealand%29">OFLC</a> in New Zealand. Homebrew developers have reverse-engineered the function which Nintendo uses to recover lost parental-control passwords, creating a simple script to obtain parental-control reset codes.

The Wii has received generally positive reviews. The system was well received after its exhibition at <a href="History%20of%20the%20Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3 2006</a>. At the event, Nintendo's console won the <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Awards</a> for Best of Show and Best Hardware. In the December 2006 issue of "<a href="Popular%20Science">Popular Science</a>", the console was named a Grand Award Winner in home entertainment. <a href="Spike%20%28TV%20channel%29">Spike TV</a>'s Video Games Award cited the Wii's breakthrough technology. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> chose the console as having the best hardware in its "Best and Worst 2006" awards. The system was also chosen as one of "<a href="PCWorld%20%28magazine%29">PC World</a>" magazine's 20 Most Innovative Products of the Year. The console received a Golden Joystick for Innovation of the Year 2007 at the <a href="Golden%20Joystick%20Award">Golden Joystick Award</a>s. In the category of Engineering & Technology for Creation and Implementation of Video Games and Platforms, Nintendo was awarded an Emmy Award for Game Controller Innovation by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences. In 2009, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> named the Wii the 10th greatest console of all time (out of 25).

The Wii's success caught third-party developers by surprise, leading to apologies for the quality of their early games. In an interview with German news magazine "<a href="Der%20Spiegel">Der Spiegel</a>", <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>'s Yves Guillemot and Alain Corre admitted that they made a mistake in rushing out their launch titles, promising to take future projects more seriously. <a href="Take-Two%20Interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>, which released few games for the <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>, changed its stance towards Nintendo by placing a higher priority on the Wii.

At the same time, criticism of the Wii Remote and Wii hardware specifications had surfaced. Former GameSpot editor and Giantbomb.com founder <a href="Jeff%20Gerstmann">Jeff Gerstmann</a> stated that the controller's speaker produces low-quality sound, while <a href="Factor%205">Factor 5</a> President Julian Eggebrecht criticized the hardware audio as substandard for a console of its generation. UK-based developer <a href="Crytek%20UK">Free Radical Design</a> stated that the Wii hardware lacks the power necessary to run the software it scheduled for release on other seventh-generation consoles. Online connectivity of the Wii was also criticized; <a href="Matt%20Casamassina">Matt Casamassina</a> of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> compared it to the "entirely unintuitive" service provided for the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">Nintendo DS</a>.

Game designer and "<a href="The%20Sims">The Sims</a>" creator <a href="Will%20Wright%20%28game%20designer%29">Will Wright</a> shared his thoughts on the Wii in the context of the seventh console generation: "The only next gen system I've seen is the Wii – the PS3 and the Xbox 360 feel like better versions of the last, but pretty much the same game with incremental improvement. But the Wii feels like a major jump – not that the graphics are more powerful, but that it hits a completely different demographic."

The Wii is seen as more physically demanding than other game consoles.
Some Wii players have experienced a form of <a href="tennis%20elbow">tennis elbow</a>, known as "Wiiitis". A study published in the "<a href="BMJ">British Medical Journal</a>" stated that Wii players use more energy than they do playing sedentary computer games. While this energy increase may be beneficial to weight management, it was not an adequate replacement for regular exercise. A case study published in the American Physical Therapy Association's journal, "Physical Therapy", focused on use of the Wii for rehabilitation in a teenager with <a href="cerebral%20palsy">cerebral palsy</a>. It is believed to be the first published research demonstrating physical-therapy benefits from use of the gaming system. Researchers say the system complements traditional techniques through use of simultaneous <a href="gaming%20rehabilitation">gaming rehabilitation</a> efforts. In May 2010 the <a href="American%20Heart%20Association">American Heart Association</a> (AHA) endorsed the Wii to encourage <a href="Sedentary%20lifestyle">sedentary people</a> to take the first step toward fitness. The AHA heart icon covers the console and two of its more-active games, <a href="Wii%20Fit%20Plus">Wii Fit Plus</a> and <a href="Wii%20Sports%20Resort">Wii Sports Resort</a>.

By 2008, two years after the Wii's release, Nintendo acknowledged several limitations and challenges with the system (such as the perception that the system catered primarily to a "<a href="Casual%20game">casual</a>" audience and was unpopular among "<a href="Core%20gamer">core</a>" gamers). Game designer <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> admitted that the lack of support for <a href="high%20definition%20television">high definition</a> video output on the Wii and its limited network infrastructure also contributed to the system being regarded separately from its competitors' systems, the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>. Miyamoto originally defended Nintendo's decision to not include HD graphics in the Wii, stating that the number of HDTV's in people's homes at the time was "really not that high, yet. Of course I think five years down the road it would be pretty much a given that Nintendo would create an HD system, but right now the predominant television set in the world is a non-HD set." Miyamoto said in an interview with Japanese magazine <a href="4Gamer.net">4Gamer</a> in 2013 that he regretted not giving the Wii HD graphics.

An executive for Frontline Studios stated that major publishers were wary of releasing exclusive titles for the Wii, due to the perception that third-party companies were not strongly supported by consumers. In his <a href="blog">blog</a>, <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> editor Jeremy Parish stated that Nintendo was the biggest disappointment for him in 2007. Commenting on the lack of quality third-party support, he stated that "the Wii landscape is bleak. Worse than it was on N64. Worse than on GameCube...the resulting third-party content is overwhelmingly bargain-bin trash." "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" and "Forbes" noted that the Wii had few successful third-party titles compared to its rivals (due, in part, to its weaker hardware). Third-party developers often skipped the Wii instead of making games for all three consoles simultaneously ("blockbusters like the "<a href="Call%20of%20Duty">Call of Duty</a>" franchise either never arrive on Nintendo hardware or show up in neutered form"). "Forbes" observed that of the most successful games of 2011 (", <a href="Mass%20Effect%203">Mass Effect 3</a>, <a href="Portal%202">Portal 2</a>, <a href="L.A.%20Noire">L.A. Noire</a>, <a href="Battlefield%203">Battlefield 3</a>, "), although all were released for PC, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3, only "Modern Warfare 3" received a Wii version which was also the least positively received port of the game. The lack of third-party games may be exacerbated in the future, as Nintendo faces the "dilemma of having fallen out of sync with its rivals in the console cycle"; Microsoft and Sony would design their consoles to be more powerful than the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a>. Strong third-party titles are seen as a key sign of a gaming console's health.

"<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>", in suggesting why Nintendo posted a record loss of $926 million for the initial six months of its 2011–2012 fiscal year, blamed the Wii's design for being "short-sighted". The Wii initially enjoyed phenomenal success because it was inexpensive (due to its being less sophisticated than its competitors) and introduced a "gaming gimmick". However, this approach meant that the Wii's hardware soon became outdated and could not keep up long-term (in contrast to more-advanced rivals such as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, which were expected to continue doing well in 2012–2013) "as both user desires and surrounding technologies evolved" later in the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28seventh%20generation%29">generation</a>. Furthermore, price cuts and the introduction of motion-sensor controllers for the Xbox 360 and PS3 nullified advantages once held by the Wii. "The Globe" suggested that there were other reasons for Nintendo's poor financial performance, including a strong yen and a tepid reception to the Nintendo 3DS handheld as mobile gaming became popular on smartphones and tablets, such as the <a href="iPad">iPad</a>.

, the Wii has sold 101.63 million consoles worldwide.

Since its launch, monthly sales numbers of the console were generally higher than its competitors around the globe. On November 28, 2006, Nintendo reported that it had sold over 600,000 consoles in the first eight days of launch in the Americas, making it Nintendo's largest console launch until the release of the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> in 2017. Japan initially received 400,000 Wii consoles, and sold an estimated 372,000 units in two days, with Wii Sports and Wii Play being the best-selling games. Nintendo announced on December 13, 2006 that the Wii had sold 325,000 units across Europe in its first two days of availability and had sold 33,000 units in Australia in its first six days of availability, making it the fastest selling console across the entire European continent and the largest launch of a video game system in Australia. By the end of 2006, the Wii had sold 3.19 million units worldwide.

According to the <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>, the Wii sold more units in the United States than the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> combined in the first half of 2007. This lead was even larger in the Japanese market, where it led in total sales (having outsold both consoles by factors of 2:1 to 6:1 nearly every week from its launch to November 2007). In Australia the Wii broke the record set by the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and became the fastest-selling game console in Australian history, selling 32,901 units within the first four days of the console's release. It also broke the 360's Australian record for the quickest amount of time to sell 100,000 units, reaching the milestone within six months and two weeks. The Wii became the fastest selling console in the United Kingdom at the time, selling 1 million units in just 38 weeks after launch.

On September 12, 2007, the "<a href="Financial%20Times">Financial Times</a>" reported that the Wii had surpassed the Xbox 360 (released a year earlier) and had become market leader in home-console sales for the seventh generation, based on sales figures from <a href="Enterbrain">Enterbrain</a>, NPD Group and <a href="GfK">GfK</a>. This was the first time a Nintendo console led its generation in sales since the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>.

On July 11, 2007, Nintendo warned that the Wii would remain in short supply throughout that calendar year. In December, <a href="Reggie%20Fils-Aim%C3%A9">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> revealed that Nintendo was producing approximately 1.8 million Wii consoles each month. Some UK stores still had a shortage of consoles in March 2007, demand still outpaced supply in the United States in June 2007, and the console was "selling out almost as quickly as it hits retail shelves" in Canada in April 2008. In October 2008 Nintendo announced that between October and December the Wii would have its North American supplies increased considerably from 2007 levels, while producing 2.4 million Wii units a month worldwide (compared to 1.6 million per month in 2007).

In the United States the Wii had sold 10.9 million units by July 1, 2008, making it the leader in seventh generation home console sales according to the NPD Group (and surpassing the Xbox 360).

In Japan the Wii surpassed the number of <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> units sold by January 2008; it sold 7,526,821 units by December 2008, according to Enterbrain. According to the NPD Group the Wii surpassed the Xbox 360 to become the best-selling "next-generation" home video-game console in Canada (with 813,000 units sold by April 1, 2008), and was the best-selling home console for 13 of the previous 17 months. According to the NPD Group the Wii had sold a total of 1,060,000 units in Canada by August 2008, making it the first seventh generation home console to surpass the million-unit mark in that country. In the United Kingdom the Wii lead in seventh generation home-console sales with 4.9 million units sold , according to GfK <a href="Chart-Track">Chart-Track</a>. On March 25, 2009 at the <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a>, <a href="Satoru%20Iwata">Satoru Iwata</a> said that worldwide shipments of Wii had reached 50 million. According to <a href="GfK">GfK Australia</a>, the Wii had sold over 500,000 units in Australia within 84 weeks of its release, beating the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> and the <a href="Nintendo%20DS">DS</a> as the fastest system to accumulate 500,000 sales in that country.

While Microsoft and Sony have experienced losses producing their consoles in the hopes of making a long-term profit on software sales, Nintendo reportedly has optimized production costs to obtain a significant profit margin with each Wii unit sold. On September 17, 2007 the "Financial Times" reported that the direct profit per Wii sold may vary, from $13 in Japan to $49 in the United States and $79 in Europe. On December 2, 2008, "<a href="Forbes">Forbes</a>" reported that Nintendo made a $6 operating profit per Wii unit sold.

On September 23, 2009, Nintendo announced its first price reductions for the console. Nintendo sold more than three million Wii consoles in the U.S. in December 2009 (setting a regional record for the month and ending nine months of declining sales), due to the price cut and software releases such as "New Super Mario Bros. Wii". On January 31, 2010 the Wii became the best-selling home video-game console produced by Nintendo, with sales of over 67 million units (surpassing those of the original <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a>).

In 2010, sales of the Wii began to decline, falling by 21 percent from the previous year. The Wii continued to decline in 2011, with Nintendo's quarterly revenue dropping by 41 percent. Despite a slowdown in sales, Nintendo reported that on Black Friday in 2011, over 500,000 Wii consoles were sold, making it the most successful Black Friday in the Wii's history. Wii sales declined even further in 2012, having decreased by half from 2011. The Wii Mini sold 35,700 units in its first two months of availability in Canada after being released on December 7, 2012.

The Wii surpassed 100 million units sold on June 30, 2013, selling 210,000 units between March and June 2013.

There were lawsuits concerning the Wii console, Wii Remote, and other accessories.

Lonestar Inventions, L.P., a <a href="Texas">Texas</a>-based company, sued Nintendo in June 2006, claiming that the company copied one of Lonestar's patented <a href="capacitor">capacitor</a> designs and used it in the Wii console. The two companies agreed to dismiss all claims by July 20, 2009, alongside a settlement made between Lonestar and AMD, which provided Nintendo's microprocessor <a href="technology">technology</a>; whether the Lonestar-Nintendo dismissal included any out-of-court settlement terms was not clear.

Anascape Ltd, a <a href="Texas">Texas</a>-based firm, filed a lawsuit in the Summer of 2006 against Nintendo for patent infringement regarding the vibrational feedback used by Nintendo's controllers. A July 2008 verdict banned Nintendo from selling the <a href="Classic%20Controller">Classic Controller</a> in the United States, in addition to the GameCube and Wavebird controllers. Following an appeal to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Federal%20Circuit">U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit</a>, on April 22, 2010 the Federal Circuit Court ruled in Nintendo's favor.

<a href="Interlink%20Electronics">Interlink Electronics</a> Inc. filed a patent-infringement lawsuit against Nintendo in December 2006 over the pointing functionality of the Wii Remote, claiming "loss of reasonable royalties, reduced sales and/or lost profits as a result of the infringing activities" of Nintendo. The lawsuit was dismissed by Interlink in March 2007.

In August 2008 <a href="Hillcrest%20Labs">Hillcrest Laboratories</a> Inc. filed a complaint against Nintendo with the <a href="United%20States%20International%20Trade%20Commission">U.S International Trade Commission</a>, alleging that the Wii Remote infringed on three of its patents. A fourth Hillcrest patent (for graphical interfaces displayed on television screens) was also allegedly violated. Hillcrest sought a ban on Wii consoles imported to the U.S. On August 24, 2009 Nintendo and Hillcrest reached a settlement, although the terms were not publicly disclosed.

In November 2008, Motiva LLC filed a lawsuit against Nintendo in the U.S. International Trade Commission claiming that the Wii violated two of its patents for tracking body movement and position. The USITC ruled in favour of Nintendo in January 2013, claiming that "Motiva's litigation was targeted at financial gains, not at encouraging adoption of Motiva’s patented technology,” and that “There is simply no reasonable likelihood that, after successful litigation against Nintendo, Motiva’s patented technology would have been licensed by partners who would have incorporated it.” The USITC also determined that Nintendo did not violate any of Motiva's patents.

In September 2011, ThinkOptics Inc. filed a lawsuit against Nintendo in <a href="U.S.%20District%20Court%20of%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Texas">United States District Court of the Eastern District of Texas</a> over their controller, the Wavit Remote, claiming that the Wii violated its patent for a "handheld vision based absolute pointing system", a "Handheld Device for Handheld Vision Based Absolute Pointing System", and a "Handheld Vision Based Absolute Pointing System", which make up the basis for the Wavit Remote. They also said that the Wii U infringes on their patents as well and claims that Nintendo was aware of the fact that the Wii allegedly violates ThinkOptics' patents. The lawsuit sought an <a href="injunction">injunction</a> against violating products, <a href="Royalty%20payment">royalties</a>, <a href="attorney%27s%20fee">attorney's fee</a>s, and damages for lost profits. The lawsuit was dismissed by ThinkOptics in August 2014.

Starting in December 2012, iLife Technologies Inc. sued several large companies over patent infringement over a set of patents they held related to "systems and methods for evaluating movement of a body relative to an environment", principally aimed at the medical field; Nintendo was sued by iLife in December 2013 for the Wii Remote's infringement on their patents, with the lawsuit seeking $144 million in damages, based on a $4 fine for the 36 million Wii and Wii U units it had sold to date. A jury trial was heard in August 2017, and the jury ruled in favor of iLife Technologies and Nintendo was forced to pay in damages. While Nintendo appealed this decision, the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals">United States Court of Appeals</a> upheld the jury's decision in December 2017.

The wrist strap of the Wii Remote has also been an issue.

In mid-December 2006, the law firm Green Welling LLP filed a <a href="class%20action">class action</a> lawsuit against Nintendo for its "defective wrist straps". A few days later, Nintendo issued a <a href="product%20recall">product recall</a> for the wrist straps and issued a new version of the strap with an improved securing mechanism for the wrist, leading to the lawsuit being dropped sometime thereafter.

A second class-action lawsuit was filed by a mother in Colorado in December 2008, claiming the updated wrist straps were still ineffective. This suit was dismissed by September 2010, finding for Nintendo that the wrist straps were not knowingly faulty under Colorado consumer protection laws.

In 2000, the term "<a href="Weemote">Weemote</a>" was trademarked by <a href="Miami">Miami</a> based TV remote manufacturer <a href="Fobis%20Technologies">Fobis Technologies</a> and was later used as the name of their remote designed for young children. While spelled differently, "Weemote" is pronounced the same as "Wiimote", the unofficial term for the Wii Remote. Sales of the Weemote, which totalled less than one million as of 2008 had fallen due to confusion with the Wiimote. Fobis Technologies claims "Wiimote" to be <a href="trademark%20infringement">trademark infringement</a>, but Nintendo does not officially use this term, although many retailers do. Fobis sent up to 100 <a href="cease%20and%20desist">cease and desist</a> letters to retailers, and offered to sell Nintendo the trademark; Nintendo declined, responding that it "does not use and does not plan to use the Weemote trademark".

The trademark application for the Wii was filed in 2006, but it was not registered by the US government until July 2010.

The trademark application for the Wii Remote was initially rejected by the <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">United States Patent and Trademark Office</a> after the trademark was filed in March 2008. The USPTO said that the word "<a href="Remote%20control">remote</a>" is commonly used, and therefore should not be trademarked. The USPTO said they would accept Nintendo's trademark filing if the company disclaimed exclusive rights to the word "remote" in the term and if the word “remote” would always follow the word “Wii” in marketing and manuals; the “Wii Remote” trademark was accepted in July 2012.

The Wii Family Edition is identical to the original model, but is designed to sit horizontally (the vertical feet are still present; however, the front labels are rotated and a stand is no longer included) and removes the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> controller and memory card ports, although the casing under the top cover still has the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> controller and memory card ports holes with no ports and no slots. For this reason, the Family Edition variant is incompatible with GameCube games and accessories. The console was announced on August 17, 2011 and was released in the United States on October 23, 2011 and Europe on November 4, 2011.
The Wii Family Edition was made available in Europe, bundled with a <a href="Wii%20Remote%20Plus">Wii Remote Plus</a>, "<a href="Wii%20Party">Wii Party</a>" and "<a href="Wii%20Sports">Wii Sports</a>". The console launched in white, but later a black Wii Family Edition bundled with "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" and the official soundtrack CD of "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>" was released on October 23, 2011 and a blue Wii Family Edition was released to coincide with <a href="Black%20Friday%20%28shopping%29">Black Friday</a> and the release of "<a href="Mario%20%26amp%3B%20Sonic%20at%20the%20London%202012%20Olympic%20Games">Mario & Sonic at the London 2012 Olympic Games</a>" on November 18, 2011. In late 2012, Nintendo released a version of the North America black edition, including "<a href="Wii%20Sports">Wii Sports</a>" and "<a href="Wii%20Sports%20Resort">Wii Sports Resort</a>" games on a single disc instead of the "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" game and the "Super Mario Galaxy" soundtrack.

The Wii Mini (stylized as Wii mini) is a smaller, redesigned Wii with a top-loading disc drive. It was announced on November 27, 2012 and released on December 7, 2012 in Canada with a MSRP of <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>99.99. The system was later released in Europe on March 22, 2013, and in the United States on November 17, 2013. It was not released in Japan, Australia or New Zealand. This console lacks <a href="YPbPr"></a> (<a href="component%20video">component video</a>/<a href="D-Terminal">D-Terminal</a>), <a href="S-Video">S-Video</a>, <a href="RGBS">RGB</a> <a href="SCART">SCART</a> output, <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> compatibility, online connectivity, the <a href="SD%20card">SD card</a> slot and <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> support, and has only one <a href="USB">USB</a> port unlike the previous models' two. The initial release omitted a <a href="pack-in%20game">pack-in game</a>, but "<a href="Mario%20Kart%20Wii">Mario Kart Wii</a>" was included at no extra charge beginning on September 18, 2013 in Canada, and from launch in the United States. Nintendo uses this console and the <a href="Nintendo%20Selects">Nintendo Selects</a> game series to promote low-cost gaming. The Wii Mini is styled in matte black with a red border, and includes a red <a href="Wii%20Remote%20Plus">Wii Remote Plus</a> and Nunchuk. A <a href="composite%20video">composite video</a>/audio cable, wired sensor bar and power adapter are also included.

Nintendo announced the successor to the Wii, <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a>, at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202011">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011</a>. The Wii U features a controller with an embedded touch screen and output <a href="1080p">1080p</a> <a href="high-definition%20video">high-definition</a> graphics; it is fully backward-compatible with Wii games and peripherals for the Wii. The Wii remote, Nunchuk controller and balance board are compatible with Wii U games which include support for them. The Wii U was released on November 18, 2012 in North America, November 30, 2012 in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, December 8, 2012 in Japan and November 26, 2013 in <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>. The Wii U was discontinued worldwide on January 31, 2017.

Operation Flavius

Operation Flavius (also referred to as the "Gibraltar killings") was a controversial military operation in which three unarmed members of the <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA) were shot dead by the British <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (SAS) in <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> on 6 March 1988. The three—<a href="Se%C3%A1n%20Savage">Seán Savage</a>, <a href="Daniel%20McCann">Daniel McCann</a>, and <a href="Mair%C3%A9ad%20Farrell">Mairéad Farrell</a> (all members of the outlawed <a href="Provisional%20IRA%20Belfast%20Brigade">Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade</a> ) —were believed to be mounting a <a href="car%20bomb">car bomb</a> attack on British military personnel in Gibraltar. Plain-clothed SAS soldiers approached them in the forecourt of a petrol station, then opened fire, killing them. All three were found to be unarmed, and no bomb was discovered in Savage's car, leading to accusations that the British government had conspired to murder them. An inquest in Gibraltar ruled that the SAS had acted lawfully, while the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> held that, although there had been no conspiracy, the planning and control of the operation was so flawed as to make the use of lethal force almost inevitable. The deaths were the first in a chain of violent events in a fourteen-day period. On 16 March, the <a href="Milltown%20Cemetery%20attack">funeral of the three IRA members was attacked</a> by a <a href="Ulster%20loyalism">loyalist</a> wielding pistols and grenades, leaving three mourners dead. Then, at the funeral of one of the mourners, the IRA <a href="Corporals%20killings">shot two undercover British soldiers</a> who had driven into the procession.

From late 1987, the British authorities were aware that the IRA was planning to detonate a bomb at the <a href="Guard%20Mounting">changing of the guard</a> ceremony outside the governor's residence in the <a href="British%20Overseas%20Territories">British Dependent Territory</a> of Gibraltar. When Savage, McCann and Farrell—known IRA members—travelled to Spain in preparation for the attack, they were tracked at the request of the British government. On the day of the shootings, Savage was seen parking a white Renault in the car park used as the assembly area for the parade; McCann and Farrell were seen crossing the border shortly afterwards.

After a military bomb-disposal officer reported that Savage's car should be treated as a suspected bomb, the police handed over control of the operation to the SAS. As soldiers were moving into position to intercept the trio, Savage split from McCann and Farrell and began running south. Two soldiers pursued Savage while two approached McCann and Farrell; as they did so, the pair were said to make threatening movements, as a result of which the soldiers opened fire, shooting them multiple times. As soldiers caught up with Savage, he was alleged to have turned around to face them while reaching into his jacket; he was also shot multiple times. All three were subsequently found to be unarmed, and Savage's car was found to contain no explosives; enquiries resulting from keys found on Farrell led authorities to a second car, containing a large quantity of explosives, in a car park in Spain. Almost two months after the shootings, the documentary "<a href="Death%20on%20the%20Rock">Death on the Rock</a>" was broadcast on British television. Using reconstructions and eyewitness accounts, it presented the possibility that the three IRA members had been unlawfully killed. The documentary proved extremely controversial; several British newspapers described it as "trial by television".

The inquest into the deaths began in September 1988. It heard from British and Gibraltar authorities that the IRA team had been tracked to <a href="M%C3%A1laga%20Airport">Málaga Airport</a>, where they were lost by the Spanish police, and that the three did not re-emerge until Savage was sighted parking his car in Gibraltar. The soldiers each testified that they had opened fire in the belief that the suspected bombers were reaching for weapons or a remote detonator. Among the civilians who gave evidence were the eyewitnesses discovered by "Death on the Rock", who gave accounts of seeing the three shot without warning, with their hands up, or while they were on the ground. Kenneth Asquez, who told the documentary that he had seen a soldier fire at Savage repeatedly while the latter was on the ground, retracted his statement at the inquest, claiming that he had been pressured into giving it. On 30 September, the inquest jury returned a verdict of "<a href="lawful%20killing">lawful killing</a>". Dissatisfied, the families took the case to the European Court of Human Rights. Delivering its judgement in 1995, the court found that the operation had been in violation of Article 2 of the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> as the authorities' failure to arrest the suspects at the border, combined with the information given to the soldiers, rendered the use of lethal force almost inevitable. The decision is cited as a landmark case in the use of force by the state.

The <a href="Provisional%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> (IRA), now inactive, is a terrorist organisation which aimed to establish a <a href="united%20Ireland">united Ireland</a> and end the British administration of <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> through the use of force. The organisation was the result of a 1969 split within the previous <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281922%E2%80%9369%29">Irish Republican Army</a>, also known as "the IRA" (the other resulting group, known as the <a href="Official%20Irish%20Republican%20Army">Official IRA</a>, ceased military activity during the 1970s). During its campaign, the IRA killed civilians, members of the armed forces, police, judiciary and prison service, including off-duty and retired members, and bombed businesses and military targets in both Northern Ireland and England, with the aim of making Northern Ireland ungovernable. Daniel McCann, Seán Savage, and Mairéad Farrell were, according to journalist <a href="Brendan%20O%27Brien%20%28journalist%29">Brendan O'Brien</a>, "three of the IRA's most senior activists". Savage was an explosives expert and McCann was "a high-ranking intelligence operative"; both McCann and Farrell had previously served prison sentences for offences relating to explosives.

The <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (formally 22 Special Air Service Regiment, or 22 SAS) is a regiment of the British Army and part of the United Kingdom's <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a>. The SAS was sporadically assigned to operations in Northern Ireland in the early stages of the British Army's deployment in the province, during which they were confined to <a href="County%20Armagh%23The%20Troubles">South Armagh</a>. The first large-scale deployment of SAS soldiers in the Troubles was in 1976, when the regiment's D Squadron was committed. The SAS soon began to specialise in covert, intelligence-based operations against the IRA, using more aggressive tactics than regular army and police units operating in Northern Ireland.

From late 1987, the British authorities were aware that the IRA was planning an attack in Gibraltar and launched Operation Flavius. The intelligence appeared to be confirmed in November 1987, when several known IRA members were detected travelling from Belfast to Spain under false identities. <a href="MI5">MI5</a>—the British Security Service—and the Spanish authorities became aware that an IRA <a href="active%20service%20unit">active service unit</a> was operating from the <a href="Costa%20del%20Sol">Costa del Sol</a> and the members of the unit were placed under surveillance. After a known IRA member was sighted at the <a href="guard%20mounting">changing of the guard</a> ceremony at "<a href="The%20Convent%20%28Gibraltar%29">the Convent</a>" (the governor's residence) in Gibraltar, the British and Gibraltarian authorities began to suspect that the IRA was planning to attack the British soldiers with a car bomb as they assembled for the ceremony in a nearby car park. In an attempt to confirm the IRA's intended target, the government of Gibraltar suspended the ceremony in December 1987, citing a need to repaint the guardhouse. They believed their suspicions were confirmed when the IRA member re-appeared at the ceremony when it resumed in February 1988, and the Gibraltar authorities requested special assistance from the British government.

In the weeks after the resumption of the changing of the guard ceremony, the three IRA members who were to carry out the attack—Seán Savage, Daniel McCann, and Mairéad Farrell—travelled to <a href="M%C3%A1laga">Málaga</a> ( along the coast from Gibraltar), where they each rented a car. Their activities were monitored and by early March, the British authorities were convinced that an IRA attack was imminent; a special projects team from the SAS was despatched to the territory, apparently with the personal approval of Prime Minister <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>. Before the operation, the SAS practised arrest techniques, while the Gibraltar authorities searched for a suitable place to hold the would-be bombers after their arrest. The plan was that the SAS would assist the <a href="Gibraltar%20Police">Gibraltar Police</a> in arresting the IRA members—identified by MI5 officers who had been in Gibraltar for several weeks—if they were seen parking a car in Gibraltar and then attempting to leave the territory.

According to the official account of the operation, Savage entered Gibraltar undetected in a white <a href="Renault%205">Renault 5</a> at 12:45 (<a href="Central%20European%20Time">CET</a>; UTC+1) on 6 March 1988. An MI5 officer recognised him and he was followed, but he was not positively identified for almost an hour and a half, during which time he parked the vehicle in the car park used as the assembly area for the changing of the guard. At 14:30, McCann and Farrell were observed crossing the frontier from Spain and were also followed. They met Savage in the car park at around 14:50 and a few minutes later the three began walking through the town. After the three left the car park, "Soldier G", a bomb-disposal officer, was ordered to examine Savage's car; he returned after a few minutes and reported that the vehicle should be treated as a suspect car bomb. This soldier's suspicion was conveyed as certainty to Soldiers "A", "B", "C", and "D", who were ordered into positions to intercept Savage, McCann, and Farrell as they walked north towards the Spanish border. "Soldier G"'s information convinced Gibraltar Police Commissioner <a href="Joseph%20Canepa">Joseph Canepa</a>, who was controlling the operation, to order the arrest of the three suspects. To that end, he signed over control of the operation to "Soldier F", the senior SAS officer, at 15:40. Two minutes after receiving control, "Soldier F" ordered Soldiers "A", "B", "C", and "D" to apprehend the IRA operatives, by which time they were walking north on <a href="Winston%20Churchill%20Avenue">Winston Churchill Avenue</a> towards the airport and the border. As the soldiers approached, the suspects appeared to realise that they were being followed. Savage split from the group and began heading south, brushing against "Soldier A" as he did so; "A" and "B" decided to continue approaching McCann and Farrell, leaving Savage to Soldiers "C" and "D".
At the same time as the police handed control over to the SAS, they began making arrangements for the IRA terrorists once they were in custody, including finding a police vehicle in which to transport the prisoners. A patrol car containing Inspector Luis Revagliatte and three other uniformed officers, apparently on routine patrol and with no knowledge of Operation Flavius, was ordered to return to police headquarters as a matter of urgency. The police car was stuck in heavy traffic travelling north on Smith Dorrien Avenue, close to the roundabout where it meets Winston Churchill Avenue. The official account states that at this point, Revagliatte's driver activated the siren on the police car in order to expedite the journey back to headquarters, intending to approach the roundabout from the wrong side of the road and turn the vehicle around. The siren apparently startled McCann and Farrell, just as Soldiers "A" and "B" were about to challenge them, outside the Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. "Soldier A" stated at the inquest that Farrell looked back at him and appeared to realise who "A" was; "A" testified that he was drawing his pistol and intended to shout a challenge to her, but "events overtook the warning": that McCann's right arm "moved aggressively across the front of his body", leading "A" to believe that McCann was reaching for a remote detonator. "A" shot McCann once in the back; "A" went on to tell the inquest that he believed Farrell then reached for her handbag, and that he believed Farrell may also have been reaching for a remote detonator. "A" also shot Farrell once in the back, before returning to McCann—he shot McCann a further three times (once in the body and twice in the head). "Soldier B" testified that he reached similar conclusions to "A", and shot Farrell twice, then McCann once or twice, then returned to Farrell, shooting her a further three times. Soldiers "C" and "D" testified at the inquest that they were moving to apprehend Savage, who was by now south of the petrol station, as gunfire began behind them. "Soldier C" testified that Savage turned around while simultaneously reaching towards his jacket pocket at the same time as "C" shouted "Stop!"; "C" stated that he believed Savage was reaching for a remote detonator, at which point he opened fire. "Soldier C" shot Savage six times, while "Soldier D" fired nine times. All three IRA members died. One of the soldiers' bullets, believed to have passed through Farrell, grazed a passer-by.

Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers donned berets to identify themselves. Gibraltar Police officers, including Inspector Revagliatte and his men, began to arrive at the scene almost immediately. At 16:05, only 25 minutes after assuming control, the SAS commander handed control of the operation back to the Gibraltar Police in a document stating:A military assault force completed the military option in respect of the terrorist ASU in Gibraltar and returns control to the civil power. Shortly after the shootings, soldiers and police officers evacuated buildings in the vicinity of the Convent, while bomb-disposal experts got to work; four hours later, the authorities announced that a car bomb had been defused, after which Savage's white Renault was towed from the car park by an army truck. The SAS personnel, meanwhile, left Gibraltar on a Royal Air Force aircraft.

When the bodies were searched, a set of car keys was found on Farrell. Spanish and British authorities conducted enquiries to trace the vehicle, which—two days after the shootings—led them to a red Ford Fiesta in a car park in <a href="Marbella">Marbella</a> ( from Gibraltar). The car contained a large quantity of <a href="Semtex">Semtex</a> surrounded by 200 rounds of ammunition, along with four detonators and two timers.

Within minutes of the military operation ending, the British <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> (MoD) issued a press release, stating that "a suspected car bomb has been found in Gibraltar, and three suspects have been shot dead by the civilian police". That evening, both the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and the <a href="ITN">ITN</a> (Independent Television News) reported that the IRA team had been involved in a "shootout" with the authorities. The following morning, <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> reported that the alleged bomb was "packed with bits of metal and shrapnel", and later carried a statement from <a href="Ian%20Stewart%2C%20Baron%20Stewartby">Ian Stewart</a>, <a href="Minister%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Armed%20Forces">Minister of State for the Armed Forces</a>, that "military personnel were involved. A car bomb was found, which has been defused". Each of the eleven British daily newspapers reported the alleged finding of the car bomb, of which eight quoted its size as . The IRA issued a statement later on 7 March to the effect that McCann, Savage, and Farrell were "on active service" in Gibraltar and had "access to and control over " of Semtex.

According to one case study of the killings, the events "provide an opportunity to examine the ideological functioning of the news media within [the Troubles]". The British broadsheet newspapers all exhibited what the authors called "ideological closure" by marginalising the IRA and extolling the SAS. Each of the broadsheets focused, for example, on the alleged bomb and the potential devastation it could have caused without questioning the government's version of events.

At 15:30 (GMT) on 7 March, the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">foreign secretary</a>, <a href="Sir%20Geoffrey%20Howe">Sir Geoffrey Howe</a>, made a statement to the House of Commons:

Shortly before 1:00 p.m. yesterday, afternoon [Savage] brought a white Renault car into Gibraltar and was seen to park it in the area where the guard mounting ceremony assembles. Before leaving the car, he was seen to spend some time making adjustments in the vehicle

An hour and a half later, [McCann and Farrell] were seen to enter Gibraltar on foot and shortly before 3:00 p.m., joined [Savage] in the town. Their presence and actions near the parked Renault car gave rise to strong suspicions that it contained a bomb, which appeared to be corroborated by a rapid technical examination of the car.

About 3:30 p.m., all three left the scene and started to walk back towards the border. On their way to the border, they were challenged by the security forces. When challenged, they made movements which led the military personnel, operating in support of the Gibraltar Police, to conclude that their own lives and the lives of others were under threat. In light of this response, they [the IRA members] were shot. Those killed were subsequently found not to have been carrying arms.

The parked Renault car was subsequently dealt with by a military bomb-disposal team. It has now been established that it did not contain an explosive device.

Press coverage in the following days, after Howe's statement that no bomb had been found, continued to focus on the act planned by the IRA; several newspapers reported a search for a fourth member of the team. Reports of the discovery of the bomb in Marbella appeared to vindicate the government's version of events and justify the killings. Several MPs made statements critical of the operation, while a group of <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> MPs tabled a condemnatory motion in the House of Commons.

The IRA notified the McCann, Savage, and Farrell families of the deaths on the evening of 6 March. In Belfast, Joe Austin, a senior local member of <a href="Sinn%20F%C3%A9in">Sinn Féin</a>, was assigned the task of recovering the bodies for burial. On 9 March, he and Terence Farrell (one of Mairéad Farrell's brothers) travelled to Gibraltar to identify the bodies. Austin negotiated a charter aircraft to collect the corpses from Gibraltar and fly them to Dublin on 14 March. In 2017 it emerged that <a href="Charles%20Haughey">Charles Haughey</a> had secretly requested that the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> fly the bodies direct to Belfast, bypassing the Republic of which he was <a href="Taoiseach">Taoiseach</a>. Two thousand people waited to meet the coffins in Dublin, which were then driven north to Belfast. At the <a href="Republic%20of%20Ireland%E2%80%93United%20Kingdom%20border">Northern Ireland border</a>, the Northern Irish authorities met the procession with a large number of police and military vehicles, and insisted on intervals between the hearses, causing tensions between police and members of the procession and leading to accusations that the police rammed Savage's hearse. The animosity between mourners and police continued until the procession split to allow the hearses to travel to the respective family homes. 

British soldiers and police flooded the neighbourhoods where McCann, Farrell and Savage had lived, to try to prevent public displays of sympathy for the dead. Later that evening, a local IRA member, Kevin McCracken, was shot and allegedly then beaten to death by a group of soldiers he had been attempting to shoot at. "<a href="Republican%20News">Republican News</a>" wrote that soldiers "had saturated the area in an attempt to intimidate the family of Volunteer Sean Savage, whose body lay in the family home a few streets away". 

The joint funeral of McCann, Farrell and Savage took place on 16 March at <a href="Milltown%20Cemetery">Milltown Cemetery</a> in Belfast. The police—<a href="Royal%20Ulster%20Constabulary">Royal Ulster Constabulary</a> (RUC)—agreed to maintain a minimal presence at the funeral in exchange for guarantees from the families that there would be no salute by masked gunmen. This agreement was leaked to <a href="Michael%20Stone%20%28loyalist%29">Michael Stone</a>, who described himself as a "freelance <a href="Ulster%20loyalism">Loyalist</a> paramilitary". During the burial, Stone threw hand grenades at the gathered mourners and began shooting with an automatic pistol, injuring 60 people. After initial confusion, several of the mourners began to pursue Stone, throwing rocks and shouting abuse. Stone continued shooting and throwing grenades at his pursuers, killing three of them. He was eventually captured by members of the crowd, who had chased him onto a road and began beating him until the RUC arrived to extract and arrest him.

The funeral of Caoimhín Mac Brádaigh, also known as Kevin Brady, the third and last of the Milltown attack victims to be buried, was scheduled for 19 March. As his cortège proceeded along Andersontown Road, a car driven by two undercover British Army corporals, David Howes and Derek Wood, sped past stewards and drove into the path of the cortège. The corporals attempted to reverse, but were blocked by vehicles from the cortège and a hostile crowd surrounded their car. As members of the crowd began to break into the vehicle, one of the corporals drew and fired a pistol, which momentarily subdued the crowd, before both men were dragged from the car, beaten and disarmed. A local priest intervened to stop the beating, but was pulled away when a military identity card was found, raising speculation that the corporals were SAS members. The two were bundled into a taxi, driven to waste ground by IRA members and beaten further. Six men were seen leaving the vehicle. Another IRA man arrived with a pistol taken from one of the soldiers, with which he repeatedly shot the corporals before handing the weapon to another man, who shot the corporals' bodies multiple times. Margaret Thatcher described the corporals' killings as the "single most horrifying event in Northern Ireland" during her premiership.

The corporals' shootings sparked the largest criminal investigation in Northern Ireland's history, which created fresh tension in Belfast as republicans saw what they believed was a disparity in the efforts the RUC expended in investigating the corporals' murders compared with those of republican civilians. Over four years, more than 200 people were arrested in connection with the killings, of whom 41 were charged with a variety of offences. The first of the so-named "Casement Trials" concluded quickly; two men were found guilty of murder and given life sentences in the face of overwhelming evidence. Of the trials that followed, many proved much more controversial, although all convictions relied on evidence that satisfied the burden of proof required in Northern Irewland courts..

On 28 April 1988, almost two months after the Gibraltar shootings, <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> broadcast an episode of its current affairs series "<a href="This%20Week%20%28ITV%20TV%20series%29">This Week</a>", produced by <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a>, entitled "Death on the Rock". "This Week" sent three journalists to investigate the circumstances surrounding the shootings from both Spain and Gibraltar. Using eyewitness accounts, and with the cooperation of the Spanish authorities, the documentary reconstructed the events leading up to the shootings; the Spanish police assisted in the reconstruction of the surveillance operation mounted against the IRA members as they travelled around Spain in the weeks before 6 March, and the journalists hired a helicopter to film the route. In Gibraltar, they located several new eyewitnesses to the shootings, who each said they had seen McCann, Savage, and Farrell shot without warning or shot after they had fallen to the ground; most agreed to be filmed and provided signed statements. One witness, Kenneth Asquez, provided two near-identical statements through intermediaries, but refused to meet with the journalists or sign either statement. After failing to persuade Asquez to sign his statement, the journalists eventually incorporated his account of seeing Savage shot while on the ground into the programme.

For technical advice, the journalists engaged Lieutenant Colonel <a href="George%20Styles">George Styles</a> GC, a retired British Army officer who was regarded as an expert in explosives and ballistics. Styles believed that it would have been obvious to the authorities that Savage's car was unlikely to contain a bomb as the weight would have been obvious on the vehicle's springs; he also expressed his opinion that a remote detonator could not have reached the car park from the scenes of the shootings given the number of buildings and other obstacles between the locations. As the government refused to comment on the shootings until the inquest, the documentary concluded by putting its evidence to a leading human rights lawyer, who expressed his belief that a judicial inquiry was necessary to establish the facts surrounding the shootings.

The documentary attracted considerable controversy. On 26 April, two days before the programme was scheduled for broadcast, Sir Geoffrey Howe telephoned the chairman of the <a href="Independent%20Broadcasting%20Authority">Independent Broadcasting Authority</a> (IBA) to request that the authority delay the broadcast until after the inquest on the grounds that it risked prejudicing the proceedings. After viewing the programme and taking legal advice, the IBA decided on the morning of 28 April that "Death on the Rock" should be broadcast as scheduled, and Howe was informed of the decision. Howe made further representation to the IBA that the documentary would be in <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt</a> of the inquest; after taking further legal advice, the IBA upheld its decision to allow the broadcast. The programme was broadcast at 21:00 (GMT) on 28 April. The following morning, the British <a href="tabloid%20journalism">tabloid</a> newspapers lambasted the programme, describing it as a "slur" on the SAS and "trial by television", while several criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. Over the following weeks, newspapers repeatedly printed stories about the documentary's witnesses, in particular Carmen Proetta, who gave an account of seeing McCann and Farrell shot without warning by soldiers who arrived in a Gibraltar Police car. Proetta subsequently sued several newspapers for libel and won substantial damages. "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" conducted its own investigation and reported that "Death on the Rock" had misrepresented the views of its witnesses; the witnesses involved later complained to other newspapers that "The Sunday Times" had distorted their comments.

Unusually for Gibraltar, there was a long delay between the shootings and the setting of a date for the inquest (the usual method for investigating sudden or controversial deaths in parts of the United Kingdom and its territories); eight weeks after the shootings, the coroner, Felix Pizzarello, announced that the inquest would begin on 27 June. Two weeks later (unknown to Pizzarello), Margaret Thatcher's press secretary announced that the inquest had been indefinitely postponed. The inquest began on 6 September. Pizzarello presided over the proceedings, while eleven jurors evaluated the evidence; representing the Gibraltar government was Eric Thislewaite, the Gibraltar attorney general. The interested parties were represented by <a href="John%20Laws%20%28judge%29">John Laws</a>, <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">QC</a> (for the British government), Michael Hucker (for the SAS personnel), and Patrick McGrory (for the families of McCann, Farrell, and Savage). Inquests are non-adversarial proceedings aimed at investigating the circumstances of a death; the investigation is conducted by the coroner, while the representatives of interested parties can cross-examine witnesses. Where the death occurred through the deliberate action of another person, the jury can return a verdict of "lawful killing", ""un"lawful killing", or an "<a href="open%20verdict">open verdict</a>"; though inquests cannot apportion blame, in the case of a verdict of unlawful killing the authorities will consider whether any prosecutions should be brought. There was initially doubt as to whether the SAS personnel involved in the shootings would appear at the inquest. Inquests have no powers to compel witnesses to appear if the witness is outside the court's jurisdiction, although the soldiers apparently volunteered after Pizzarello declared that the inquest would be "meaningless" without their evidence. The soldiers and MI5 officers gave their evidence anonymously and from behind a screen. As the inquest began, observers including <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> expressed concern that McGrory was at a disadvantage, as all of the other lawyers were privy to the evidence of the SAS and MI5 personnel before it was given. The cost of the transcript for each day's proceedings was increased ten-fold the day before the inquest began.

In total, the inquest heard evidence from 79 witnesses, including the Gibraltar Police officers, MI5 personnel, and SAS soldiers involved in the operation, along with technical experts and civilian eyewitnesses.

The first witnesses to testify were the Gibraltar Police officers involved in the operation and its aftermath. Following them, on 7 September, was "Mr O", the senior MI5 officer in charge of Operation Flavius. "O" told the inquest that, in January 1988, Belgian authorities found a car being used by IRA operatives in Brussels. In the car were found a quantity of Semtex, detonators, and equipment for a radio detonation device, which, "O" told the coroner, led MI5 to the conclusion that the IRA might use a similar device for the planned attack in Gibraltar. MI5 further believed that the IRA had been unlikely to use a "blocking car" (an empty vehicle used to hold a parking space until the bombers bring in the vehicle containing the explosives) as this entailed the added risk of multiple border crossings. Finally, "O" told the coroner that McCann, Savage, and Farrell had been observed by Spanish authorities arriving at Málaga Airport, after which he claimed the trio had been lost, and that the British and Gibraltarian authorities did not detect them crossing the border.

Joseph Canepa, commissioner of the Gibraltar Police, was the next senior figure to testify. He told the inquest that (contrary to McGrory's assertions) there had been no conspiracy to kill McCann, Savage, and Farrell. Canepa told the coroner that, upon learning of the IRA plot from MI5, he set up an advisory committee, which consisted of MI5 officials, senior military officers, and the commissioner himself; as events developed, the committee decided that the Gibraltar Police was not adequately equipped to counter the IRA threat, and Canepa requested assistance from London. The commissioner gave assurances that he had been in command of the operation against the IRA at all times, except for the 25 minutes during which he signed over control to the military. In his cross-examination, McGrory queried the level of control the commissioner had over the operation; he extracted from Canepa that the commissioner had not requested assistance from the SAS specifically. Canepa agreed with "O" that the Spanish police had lost track of the IRA team, and that Savage's arrival in Gibraltar took the authorities by surprise. Although a police officer was stationed in an observation post at the border with instructions for alerting other officers to the arrival of the IRA team, Canepa told the inquest that the officer had been looking for the three IRA members arriving at once. When pressed, he told McGrory he was "unsure" whether or not the officer had the details of the false passports the trio were travelling under. Two days after Canepa's testimony concluded, Detective Constable Charles Huart, the Gibraltar Police officer in the observation post at the border on 6 March, appeared. When cross-examined, Huart denied knowing the pseudonyms under which the IRA team were travelling. On cross-examination, Huart acknowledged having been provided with the pseudonyms at a briefing the night before the shootings. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Joseph Ullger, head of the Gibraltar Police Special Branch, offered a different account when he gave evidence the following day. He told the coroner that the Spanish border guards had let Savage through out of carelessness, while the regular border officials on the Gibraltar side had not been told to look for the IRA team.

"Soldier F", a British Army colonel who was in command of the SAS detachment involved in Operation Flavius, took the stand on 12 September. "F" was followed the next day by "Soldier E", a junior SAS officer who was directly responsible for the soldiers who carried out the shootings. After the officers, the inquest heard from Soldiers "A", "B", "C", and "D", the SAS soldiers who shot McCann, Savage, and Farrell. The SAS personnel all told the coroner that they had been briefed to expect the would-be bombers to be in possession of a remote detonator, and that they had been told that Savage's car definitely contained a bomb. Each soldier testified that the IRA team made movements which the soldiers believed to be threatening, and this prompted the soldiers to open fire. McGrory asked about the SAS's policy on lethal force during cross-examination; he asked "D" about allegations that Savage was shot while on the ground, something "D" strenuously denied. McGrory asked "D" if he had intended to continue shooting Savage until he was dead, to which "D" replied in the affirmative.

Several Gibraltar Police officers, including Special Branch officers, gave evidence about the aftermath of the shootings and the subsequent police investigation. Immediately after the shootings, the soldiers' shell casings were removed from the scene (making it difficult to assess where the soldiers were standing when they fired); two Gibraltar Police officers testified to collecting the casings, one for fear that they might be stolen and the other on the orders of a superior. Statements from other police and military witnesses revealed that the Gibraltar Police had lost evidence and that the soldiers did not give statements to the police until over a week after the shootings.

One of the first witnesses with no involvement in Operation Flavius to give evidence to the inquest was Allen Feraday, Principal Scientific Officer at the Royal Armaments Research and Development Establishment. He posited that a remote detonator could reach from the scenes of the shootings to the car park in which Savage had left the white Renault and beyond. On cross-examination, he stated that the aerial on the Renault was not the type he would expect to be used for receiving a detonation signal, adding that the IRA had not been known to use a remote-detonated bomb without a direct line of sight to their target. The following day, "Soldier G" (who had made the determination that the white Renault contained a bomb) told the coroner that he was not an explosives expert, and that his assessment was based on his belief that the vehicle's aerial looked "too new". Dissatisfied, McGrory called his own expert witness—Dr Michael Scott, an expert in radio-controlled detonation—who disagreed with government witnesses that a bomb at the assembly area could have been detonated from the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, having conducted tests prior to testifying. The government responded by commissioning its own tests, conducted by British Army signallers, which showed that radio communication between the petrol station and the car park was possible, but not guaranteed.

Professor Alan Watson, a British forensic pathologist, carried out a <a href="post-mortem%20examination">post-mortem examination</a> of the bodies. Watson arrived in Gibraltar the day after the shootings, by which time the bodies had been taken to the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Hospital%20Gibraltar">Royal Navy Hospital</a>; he found that the bodies had been stripped of their clothing (causing difficulties in distinguishing entry and exit wounds), that the mortuary had no X-ray machine (which would have allowed Watson to track the paths of the bullets through the bodies), and that he was refused access to any other X-ray machine. After the professor returned to his home in Scotland, he was refused access to the results of blood tests and other evidence which had been sent for analysis and was dissatisfied with the photographs taken by the Gibraltar Police photographer who had assisted him. At the inquest, McGrory noted and questioned the lack of assistance given to the pathologist, which Watson told him was "a puzzle". Watson concluded that McCann had been shot four times—once in the jaw (possibly a ricochet), once in the head, and twice in the back; Farrell was shot five times (twice in the face and three times in the back). Watson was unable to determine exactly how many times Savage was shot—he estimated that it was possibly as many as eighteen times. McGrory asked Watson whether the pathologist would agree that Savage's body was "riddled with bullets"; Watson's answer made headlines the following morning: "I concur with your word. Like a frenzied attack". Watson agreed that the evidence suggested the deceased were shot while on the ground; a second pathologist called by McGrory offered similar findings. Two weeks later, the court heard from David Pryor—a forensic scientist working for London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a>—who had analysed the clothes of the dead; he told the inquest his analysis had been hampered by the condition of the clothing when it arrived. Pryor offered evidence contradictory to that given by Soldiers "A" and "B" about their proximity to McCann and Farrell when they opened fire—the soldiers claimed they were at least six feet (1.8 metres) away, but Pryor's analysis was that McCann and Farrell were shot from a distance of no more than two or three feet (0.6 or 0.9 metres).

Aside from experts and security personnel, several eyewitnesses gave evidence to the inquest. Three witnessed parts of the shootings, and gave accounts which supported the official version of events—in particular, they did not witness the SAS shooting any of the suspects while they were on the floor. Witnesses uncovered by the journalists making "Death on the Rock" also appeared: Stephen Bullock repeated his account of seeing McCann and Savage raise their hands before the SAS shot them; Josie Celecia repeated her account of seeing a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground. Hucker pointed out that parts of Celecia's testimony had changed since she spoke to "Death on the Rock", and suggested that the gunfire she heard was from the shooting of Savage rather than sustained shooting of McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, a suggestion Celecia rejected; the SAS's lawyer further observed that she was unable to identify the military personnel in photographs her husband had taken. Maxie Proetta told the coroner that he had witnessed four men (three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up, after which he heard a series of shots. In contrast to his wife's testimony, he believed that Farrell's gesture was one of self-defence rather than surrender, and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car. The government lawyers suggested that the police car the Proettas saw was the one being driven by Inspector Revagliatte, carrying four uniformed police officers rather than plain-clothed soldiers, but Proetta was adamant that the lawyers' version did not make sense. His wife gave evidence the following day. Contrary to her statement to "Death on the Rock", Carmen Proetta was no longer certain that she had seen McCann and Farrell shot while on the ground. The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta's evidence based on her changes, and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to "Death on the Rock" before the police. She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after "Death on the Rock" had been shown.

Asquez, who provided an unsworn statement to the "Death on the Rock" team through an intermediary, which the journalists included in the programme, reluctantly appeared. He retracted the statements he made to "Death on the Rock", which he claimed he had made up after "pestering" from Major Bob Randall (another "Death on the Rock" witness, who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings). The British media covered Asquez's retraction extensively, while several members of parliament accused Asquez of lying for the television (and "Death on the Rock" of encouraging him) in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government. Nonetheless, Pizzarello asked Asquez if he could explain why his original statement mentioned the Soldiers "C" and "D" donning berets, showing identity cards, and telling members of the public "it's okay, it's the police" after shooting Savage (details which were not public before the inquest); Asquez replied that he could not, because he was "a bit confused".

The inquest concluded on 30 September, and Laws and McGrory made their submissions to the coroner regarding the instructions he should give to the jury (Hucker allowed Laws to speak on his behalf). Laws asked the coroner to instruct the jury not to return a verdict of "unlawful killing" on the grounds that there had been a conspiracy to murder the IRA operatives within the British government, as he believed that no evidence had been presented at the inquest to support such a conclusion. He did also allow for the possibility that the SAS personnel had individually acted unlawfully. McGrory, on the other hand, asked the coroner to allow for the possibility that the British government had conspired to murder McCann, Savage, and Farrell, which he believed was evidenced by the decision to use the SAS for Operation Flavius. The decision, according to McGrory was

When the coroner asked McGrory to clarify whether he believed there had been a conspiracy to murder the IRA operatives, he responded

After listening to both arguments, Pizzarello summarised the evidence for the jury and instructed them that they could return a verdict of "unlawful killing" under any of five circumstances, including if they were satisfied that there had been a conspiracy within the British government to murder the three suspected terrorists. He also urged the jury to return a conclusive verdict, rather than the "ambiguity" of an "open verdict", and instructed them not to make recommendations or add a <a href="Rider%20%28legal%20judgement%29">rider</a> to their verdict.

The jury retired at 11:30 to start their deliberations. Pizzarello summoned them back after six hours with the warning that they were "at the edge" of the time in which they were allowed to come to a verdict. Just over two hours later, the jury returned. By a majority of nine to two, they returned a verdict of lawful killing.

Following the inquest, evidence came to light to contradict the version of events presented by the British government at the inquest. Six weeks after the conclusion of the inquest, a Gibraltar Police operations order leaked; the document listed Inspector Revagliatte, who had claimed to be on routine patrol, unaware of Operation Flavius, and whose siren apparently triggered the shootings, as the commander of two police firearms teams assigned to the operation. In February 1989, British journalists discovered that the IRA team operating in Spain must have contained more members than the three killed in Gibraltar. The staff at the agencies from which the team rented their vehicles gave the Spanish police descriptions which did not match McCann, Savage, or Farrell; Savage's white Renault, meanwhile, was rented several hours before Savage himself arrived in Spain.

It emerged that the Spanish authorities knew where McCann and Savage were staying; a senior Spanish police officer repeatedly told journalists that the IRA cell had been under surveillance throughout their time in Spain, and that the Spanish told the British authorities that they did not believe that the three were in possession of a bomb on 6 March. Although the Spanish government remained silent about the claims and counter-claims, it honoured 22 police officers at a secret awards ceremony for Spanish participants in Operation Flavius in December 1988, and a government minister told a press conference in March 1989 that "we followed the terrorists. They were completely under our control". The same month, a journalist discovered that the Spanish side of the operation was conducted by the <a href="Centro%20Superior%20de%20Informaci%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Defensa">Foreign Intelligence Brigade</a> rather than the local police as the British government had suggested. "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" and "<a href="Private%20Eye">Private Eye</a>" conjectured as to the reason for the Spanish government's silence—in 1988, Spain was attempting to join the <a href="Western%20European%20Union">Western European Union</a>, but was opposed by Britain (which was already a member); the papers' theory was that Margaret Thatcher's government placed political pressure on the Spanish, and that Britain later dropped its opposition in exchange for the Spanish government's silence on Operation Flavius.

In March 1990, almost two years after the shootings, the McCann, Savage, and Farrell families began proceedings against the British government at the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> in London. The case was dismissed on the grounds that Gibraltar was not part of the United Kingdom, and was thus outside the court's jurisdiction. The families launched an appeal, but withdrew it in the belief that it had no prospect of success. The families proceeded to apply to the <a href="European%20Commission%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Commission of Human Rights</a> for an opinion on whether the authorities' actions in Gibraltar violated Article 2 (the "right to life") of the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a> (ECHR). Issuing its report in April 1993, the commission criticised the conduct of the operation, but found that there had been no violation of Article 2. Nevertheless, the commission referred the case to the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> (ECtHR) for a final decision.

The British government submitted that the killings were "absolutely necessary", within the meaning of Article 2, paragraph 2, to protect the people of Gibraltar from unlawful violence, because the soldiers who carried out the shootings genuinely believed that McCann, Savage, and Farrell were capable of detonating a car bomb, and of doing so by remote control. The families contested the government's claim, alleging that the government had conspired to kill the three; that the planning and control of the operation was flawed; that the inquest was not adequately equipped to investigate the killings; and that the applicable laws of Gibraltar were not compliant with Article 2 of the ECHR. The court found that the soldiers' "reflex action" in resorting to lethal force was excessive, but that the soldiers' actions did not—in their own right—give rise to a violation of Article 2. The court held that the soldiers' use of force based on an honestly held belief (that the suspects were armed or in possession of a remote detonator) could be justified, even if that belief was later found to be mistaken. To hold otherwise would, in the court's opinion, place too great a burden on law-enforcement personnel. It also dismissed all other allegations, except that regarding the planning and control of the operation. In that respect, the court found that the authorities' failure to arrest the suspects as they crossed the border or earlier, combined with the information that was passed to the soldiers, rendered the use of lethal force almost inevitable. Thus, the court decided there had been a violation of Article 2 in the control of the operation.

As the three suspects had been killed while preparing an act of terrorism, the court rejected the families' claims for damages, as well as their claim for expenses incurred at the inquest. The court did order the British government to pay the applicants' costs incurred during the proceedings in Strasbourg. The government initially suggested it would not pay, and there was discussion in parliament of the UK withdrawing from the ECHR. It paid the costs on 24 December 1995, within days of the three-month deadline which had been set by the court.

A history of the Gibraltar Police described Operation Flavius as "the most controversial and violent event" in the history of the force, while journalist Nicholas Eckert described the incident as "one of the great controversies of the Troubles" and academic <a href="Richard%20English">Richard English</a> posited that the "awful sequence of interwoven deaths" was one of the conflict's "most strikingly memorable and shocking periods". The explosives the IRA intended to use in Gibraltar were believed to have come from Libyan ruler <a href="Muammar%20Gaddafi">Muammar Gaddafi</a> who was known to be supplying arms to the IRA in the 1980s; some sources speculated that Gibraltar was chosen for its relative proximity to Libya, and the targeting of the territory was intended as a gesture of gratitude to Gaddafi.

Maurice Punch, an academic specialising in policing issues, described the ECtHR verdict as "a landmark case with important implications" for the control of police operations involving firearms. According to Punch, the significance of the ECtHR judgement was that it placed accountability for the failures in the operation with its commanders, rather than with the soldiers who carried out the shooting itself. Punch believed that the ruling demonstrated that operations intended to arrest suspects should be conducted by civilian police officers, rather than soldiers. The case is considered a landmark in cases concerning Article 2, particularly in upholding the principle that Article 2, paragraph 2, defines circumstances in which it is permissible to use force which may result in a person's death as an unintended consequence, rather than circumstances in which it is permissible to intentionally deprive a person of their life. It has been cited in later ECtHR cases concerning the use of lethal force by police.

After the inquest verdict, the <a href="Governor%20of%20Gibraltar">Governor of Gibraltar</a>, Air Chief Marshal Sir <a href="Sir%20Peter%20Terry">Peter Terry</a> declared "Even in this remote place, there is no place for terrorists." In apparent revenge for his role in Operation Flavius, Terry and his wife, Lady Betty Terry, were shot and seriously injured in front of their daughter when IRA paramilitaries opened fire on the Terry home in <a href="Staffordshire">Staffordshire</a> two years later, in September 1990.

Following Kenneth Asquez's retraction of the statement he gave to "Death on the Rock" and his allegation that he was pressured into giving a false account of the events he witnessed, the IBA contacted Thames Television to express its concern and to raise the possibility of an investigation into the making of the documentary. Thames eventually agreed to commission an independent inquiry into the programme (the first such inquiry into an individual programme), to be conducted by two people with no connection to either Thames or the IBA; Thames engaged <a href="David%20Hennessy%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Windlesham">Lord Windlesham</a> and <a href="Richard%20Rampton">Richard Rampton, QC</a> to conduct the investigation. In their report, published in January 1989, Windlesham and Rampton levelled several criticisms at "Death on the Rock", but found it to be a "trenchant" piece of work made in "good faith and without ulterior motives". In conclusion, the authors believed that "Death on the Rock" proved "freedom of expression can prevail in the most extensive, and the most immediate, of all the means of mass communication".

Terry Sanford

James Terry Sanford (August 20, 1917 – April 18, 1998) was an American university administrator and politician from <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>. A member of the <a href="Southern%20Democrats">Democratic Party</a>, Sanford was the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20North%20Carolina">65th Governor of North Carolina</a> (1961–1965), a two-time <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Presidential candidate</a> in the 1970s and a <a href="United%20States%20Senator">U.S. Senator</a> (1986–1993). Sanford was a strong proponent of public education and introduced a number of reforms and new programs in North Carolina's schools and institutions of <a href="higher%20education">higher education</a> as the state's governor, increasing funding for education and establishing the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Fund">North Carolina Fund</a>. From 1969 to 1985, Sanford was President of <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a>.

An <a href="Eagle%20Scout%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Eagle Scout</a> as a youth, Sanford became an <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> <a href="special%20agent">agent</a> after graduating from the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> in 1939. During <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>, he saw combat in the <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">European Theatre</a> and received a <a href="battlefield%20commission">battlefield commission</a>. Following his return to civilian life after World War II, Sanford attended and graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20School%20of%20Law">University of North Carolina School of Law</a> and began a legal career in the late 1940s, soon becoming involved in politics. A lifelong Democrat, he was noted for his progressive leadership in <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> and education; although his opponents criticized him as a "<a href="tax%20and%20spend">tax-and-spend</a>" <a href="liberalism">liberal</a>, Sanford is remembered as a major public figure of the South after World War II.

Sanford was born in 1917 in <a href="Laurinburg%2C%20North%20Carolina">Laurinburg, North Carolina</a>, the son of Elizabeth Terry (Martin) and Cecil Leroy Sanford, both of <a href="English%20American">English</a> descent. He became an Eagle Scout in Laurinburg's <a href="Troop%23Troops%20in%20civilian%20organizations">Troop 20</a> of the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a> (BSA). Shortly before he died, Sanford related his <a href="Scouting">Scouting</a> experience to journalist <a href="David%20Gergen">David Gergen</a> and said that it "probably saved my life in the war. Boys who had been <a href="Boy%20Scout">Scouts</a> or had been in the <a href="Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps">CCC</a> knew how to look after themselves in the woods... What I learned in Scouts sustained me all my life; it helped me make decisions about what was best." The BSA recognized him with its <a href="Distinguished%20Eagle%20Scout%20Award">Distinguished Eagle Scout Award</a>.

Sanford graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> in 1939 and then served as a <a href="special%20agent">special agent</a> in the <a href="FBI">FBI</a> for two years. He married Margaret Rose Knight on July 4, 1942, and they later had two children: Terry Jr. and Elizabeth. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, he enlisted as a private in the <a href="US%20Army">US Army</a> and later attained the rank of <a href="first%20lieutenant%23United%20States">first lieutenant</a>. He <a href="Paratrooper">parachuted</a> into France with the <a href="517th%20Parachute%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">517th Parachute Infantry Regiment</a> and fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>. He was awarded the <a href="Bronze%20Star%20Medal">Bronze Star</a> and <a href="Purple%20Heart">Purple Heart</a> for his bravery and wounds, respectively. Sanford was <a href="military%20discharge%23Honorable">honorably discharged</a> in 1946.

Sanford later served as a <a href="company%20commander">company commander</a> with the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">captain</a> in Company K of 119th Infantry Regiment of the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Army%20National%20Guard">North Carolina Army National Guard</a> from 1948 to 1960. After the war, Sanford earned a <a href="law%20degree">law degree</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20School%20of%20Law">University of North Carolina School of Law</a> and served as president of the Young Democratic Clubs of North Carolina, now known as the <a href="Young%20Democrats%20of%20North%20Carolina">Young Democrats of North Carolina</a>.

Sanford was an assistant director of the Institute of Government of the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20at%20Chapel%20Hill">University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</a> from 1946 until 1948, then began a private practice of law in <a href="Fayetteville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Fayetteville</a>. Sanford served one term as a <a href="North%20Carolina%20Senate">state senator</a> (1953–55), and chose not to run for a second term. He ran for governor of North Carolina in 1960, defeating <a href="I.%20Beverly%20Lake%2C%20Sr.">I. Beverly Lake, Sr.</a>, Malcolm Buie Seawell, and <a href="John%20D.%20Larkins">John D. Larkins</a> in the Democratic primary and Robert Gavin in the general election. Elected to a single term (as North Carolina governors could then be elected for only one term), Sanford served from January 1961 to January 1965.

In 1960, North Carolina spent $237 per pupil in public school (as opposed to New York's $562), payed some of the lowest salaries in the country to its teachers, had overcrowded high school classes, and had the lowest average number of years of education among its residents in the United States. Sanford believed that improved statewide education would raise North Carolina's low average wages. In his inaugural address, he affirmed his wish to increase spending for the purpose, saying, "If it takes more taxes to give our children this quality education, we must face that fact and provide the money. We must never lose sight of the fact that our children are our best investment. This is no age for the faint of heart."

Sanford nearly doubled North Carolina's expenditures on public schools. He began consolidating the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina">University of North Carolina</a> system to ensure its solvency and strength and oversaw the creation of the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Community%20College%20System">North Carolina Community College System</a>. He conceived the idea for the <a href="Governor%27s%20School%20of%20North%20Carolina">Governor's School of North Carolina</a>, a publicly funded six-week residential summer program for gifted high school students in the state. He established the North Carolina School of the Arts (now <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina%20School%20of%20the%20Arts">University of North Carolina School of the Arts</a>) to keep talented students "in the fields of music, drama, the dance and allied performing arts, at both the high school and college levels of instruction" in their home state.

The centerpiece of Sanford's education platform was the Quality Education Program, which called for a 22% increase in average teacher pay, 33% more funds for instructional supplies, and a 100% increase in school library money. Sanford initially had difficulty figuring out how to fund his proposal, as the state already levied comparatively high income and corporate taxes, and a luxury tax on goods such as tobacco and soft drinks was likely to upset much of the populace. Many other elected state officials were fiscally conservative, and were likely to oppose any significant borrowing of money and raising debts. Thus, at the end of February 1961, Sanford decided to fund his proposals through the elimination of exemptions of the state's 3% sales tax on certain goods, including food and prescription drugs. The advanced taxes were controversial, and the conservative <a href="North%20Carolina%20General%20Assembly">North Carolina General Assembly</a> was hesitant to pass them into law. Upon the convening of the General Assembly in March many legislators commented in private that the proposal was doomed to fail. Liberals and journalists criticized it as unfair to the poor, who would be hurt the most by a tax on food.

Sanford promoted his plan through a series of rallies across the state, one of which was broadcast on radio. He argued that North Carolina trailed most other states with respect to education and that the exemptions elimination was more acceptable than a 1% tax increase on all other items. He also intensively lobbied state legislators, inviting them to breakfast at the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Executive%20Mansion">Governor's Mansion</a> and visiting them at the <a href="Sir%20Walter%20Hotel">Sir Walter Hotel</a>, where most of them stayed while the General Assembly was in session. Aside from arguing for his program, Sanford conducted political favors in exchange for support. He also actively challenged his critics to think of a better way to fund the education plan. Members of the press and disgruntled liberals backed down when they realized that without the new levy the education expansions would have to be scaled down. His effort was ultimately successful and the General Assembly implemented his program and the taxes. The latter were poorly received in North Carolina and resulted in a backlash; in November 1961 the electorate rejected 10 state bond proposals in a referendum (the first time a bond had been turned down since 1924) and a public opinion poll found that three fifths of the population disapproved of Sanford's performance as Governor. In the 1962 elections the Democrats lost seats in the State House of Representatives. Though Sanford was disappointed, he remained convinced that the tax proposal was the best way to fund his program.

Feeling that his education program had spent most of his political capital in the legislature, Sanford began seeking the support of the <a href="Ford%20Foundation">Ford Foundation</a> to fund anti-poverty efforts. He eventually established the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Fund">North Carolina Fund</a> under the leadership of <a href="George%20Esser">George Esser</a> to fight <a href="poverty">poverty</a> and promote racial equality across the state.

In his inaugural address, Sanford appealed for mutual respect and understanding between races and said that "no group of our citizens can be denied the right to participate in the opportunities of first-class citizenship." He enrolled his daughter Betsee and his son Terry in the integrated Murphy School (it was attended by a single black student), an action which received attention in the state and national press.

In January 1964 <a href="James%20Farmer">James Farmer</a> and <a href="Floyd%20McKissick">Floyd McKissick</a> of the <a href="Congress%20of%20Racial%20Equality">Congress of Racial Equality</a> demanded that the city of <a href="Chapel%20Hill%2C%20North%20Carolina">Chapel Hill, North Carolina</a>, already one of the most integrated communities in the state, fully desegregate by February 1 or face a wave of demonstrations. Sanford released a statement of reproach towards the ultimatum and promised municipal officials his support. He later said, "I felt that I had been pushed around long enough."

During Sanford's tenure, activities of the white supremacist <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> in North Carolina rapidly increased. Sanford requested information on the Klan from the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> (FBI). When the reports were found to be insufficient and unsatisfactory, he arranged for an undercover agent of the FBI working in the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Division%20of%20Motor%20Vehicles">North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles</a> to infiltrate the organization in the eastern portion of the state. Several months later the FBI announced that North Carolina had one of the largest Klan membership in the country.
In June 1964 an interracial group of students traveled to <a href="Elm%20City">Elm City</a> to renovate a local African-American church. Members of the <a href="United%20Klans%20of%20America">United Klans of America</a> confronted the youths, who promptly left the state. When a larger interracial group arrived to complete the work, 250 klansmen marched into the town and two of them attempted to burn the church down. On June 22, Sanford issued a statement referring to anti-Klan legislation and saying, "Because there is a growing concern across the state, I think it is necessary to remind the people involved that the Klu Klux Klan is not going to take over North Carolina."

Sanford condemned the Klan's methods and ordered the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Highway%20Patrol">State Highway Patrol</a> to assist the municipal police in protecting the church and maintaining order. His staff quietly brokered a compromise, convincing the local pastor to accommodate the white volunteers in a hotel instead of local black residents' homes, thereby avoiding the racial mixing of which the klansmen disapproved. State authorities dealt with members of the Klan in a similarly accommodating manner throughout the rest of Sanford's tenure, allowing the organization to strengthen its position in the region. In response to Sanford's criticism of their actions in Elm City, klansmen burnt a cross on the lawn of the Governor's Mansion in mid-August. Sanford inspected the cross, later commenting, "It is a badge of honor to have such hoodlums against you, but it is a mark of shame for the state of North Carolina to have such childish activities going on." In December when the Klan threatened businessmen who had sponsored interracial Christmas parades, he encouraged its members to "read the <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus">Christmas story</a> and the message of goodwill towards all men contained in the Bible" and declared that "If there are any illegal acts on the part of the Ku Klux Klan they will be prosecuted."

Sanford was a close political ally of <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, a fact that disturbed some North Carolina Democrats suspicious of Kennedy's Catholicism. According to Kennedy's personal secretary, <a href="Evelyn%20Lincoln">Evelyn Lincoln</a>, Sanford would have been Kennedy's choice for vice president on the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201964">1964 Democratic ticket</a> if Kennedy had lived. In her 1968 book "Kennedy and Johnson" she reported that Kennedy, told her that <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> would be replaced as Vice President.

Lincoln wrote of that November 19, 1963, conversation just three days before <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20assassination">Kennedy's assassination</a>:
Additionally, Sanford used his leverage with the White House to expand the <a href="Research%20Triangle%20Park">Research Triangle Park</a> (RTP), which sparked an economic surge in the state, eventually luring <a href="IBM">IBM</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> to the Triangle area.

Sanford was also a staunch opponent of <a href="capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20States">capital punishment</a>. His "numerous statements against capital punishment were so well known that prisoners on North Carolina’s death row pointedly referred to them in their clemency appeals."

After his term in office ended, Sanford opened a law firm. He had agreed to serve as Johnson's campaign manager in 1968 just before Johnson's withdrawal on March 31. Sanford later took over as the campaign manager for the Democratic nominee <a href="Hubert%20Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a> in his race against Republican <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> for the presidency.

Johnson wanted Humphrey to pick Sanford as his running mate. On one occasion, the Humphrey campaign asked Sanford if he wanted to be the vice presidential candidate. Sanford declined, and Humphrey ultimately picked Senator <a href="Edmund%20Muskie">Edmund Muskie</a> of Maine. Though Sanford received a number of legal and business offers from the private sector during this period, he was interested in a position that would allow him to keep his political prospects open.

In 1969, Sanford became president of Duke University, a position he held for the next 16 years. That helped quell student unrest over the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> early in his tenure as university president. Addressing the protests of the 1970 Kent State shootings with tolerance, choosing to not call in police to clear the roads, leading to the protesting students going back to their rooms at night so that West Campus could be reopened the next day kept the campus calm during a turbulent spring. Shortly before his tenure, on February 13, 1969, 60 student members of the Afro-American Society had occupied Duke's main administration center, the Allen Building, demanding the creation of a Black Studies program. After three days of clashes with police, they left the building peaceably February 16, when school officials agreed to the program. During his tenure, Sanford strongly opposed confrontation and a heavy police action which helped defuse racial tensions.

Perhaps the greatest controversy of Sanford's presidency was his effort to establish the <a href="Richard%20Nixon%20Presidential%20Library%20and%20Museum">presidential library</a> of former US President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> at Duke. Sanford raised the subject with Nixon during a visit to the former president at Nixon's New York City office on July 28, 1981. Sanford continued to seek Nixon's advice on multiple issues within the months that followed. The library proposal became public in mid-August, creating considerable controversy at the university. Though Sanford enjoyed some support for his effort, most of the faculty were against the proposal, the largest concern being that the facility would be a monument to Nixon rather than a center of study. Sanford tried to engineer a compromise, but the proposal by the Duke Academic Council of a library only a third the size of that which Nixon wanted and their rejection of a Nixon museum to accompany it, ultimately led Nixon to decline Sanford's offer and site his library in the city of his birth, <a href="Yorba%20Linda%2C%20California">Yorba Linda, California</a>, instead; it was dedicated there in 1990.

Though Sanford enjoyed his time as Duke's president, he still harbored political ambitions. As the 1972 presidential primary season began, he was approached by several people who felt that the field of Democratic candidates was weak. He was particularly keen to challenge Alabama governor <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a> in an effort to show that Wallace's segregationist views did not represent majority Southern opinion. Announcing his candidacy on March 8, he faced long odds in a crowded field. Knowing that he could not win a majority of delegates in the primary, he hoped to secure enough to emerge as a compromise candidate in a deadlocked convention. Even in the North Carolina primary, however, Wallace beat Sanford by 100,000 votes, and Sanford managed only a fifth-place finish at the <a href="1972%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1972 Democratic National Convention</a> with 77.5 votes, behind <a href="George%20McGovern">George McGovern</a> (1,864.95), <a href="Henry%20M.%20Jackson">Henry M. Jackson</a> (525), Wallace (381.7), and <a href="Shirley%20Chisholm">Shirley Chisholm</a> (151.95).

Undeterred, Sanford began preparations two years later for a run for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. Announcing his candidacy on June 1, 1975, he juggled campaign appearances with his obligations as president of Duke. While he developed a following among educators, he did not have a satisfactory campaign theme by the new year. Then, while campaigning in Massachusetts in January, he suffered sharp pains and was diagnosed with a <a href="heart%20murmur">heart murmur</a>. On January 25, Sanford withdrew from the primaries, the first Democrat to do so that year.

After retiring as president of Duke University in 1985, Sanford remained active in party politics. He made an unsuccessful run for chairman of the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> in 1985, in which he was supported by future House Speaker <a href="Nancy%20Pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>. Sanford lost to <a href="Paul%20G.%20Kirk">Paul G. Kirk</a> by a vote of 203–150.

After failing to find a Democrat willing to run for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican <a href="John%20P.%20East">John P. East</a>, Sanford announced his own candidacy for the nomination. His opponent was <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congressman</a> <a href="Jim%20Broyhill">Jim Broyhill</a>. After East committed suicide on June 29, 1986, Broyhill was temporarily appointed to the seat on July 3, until a special election could be held on November 4. Despite being attacked as a liberal, Sanford defeated Broyhill by three percentage points in the November election. Critics of Sanford primarily focused on three areas: his promotion of opportunities for minorities, "tax-and-spend" education funding, and his anti-poverty campaign. He took office on November 5, the day after the special election, to serve out the last two months of East's term and the subsequent six-year term.
Sanford found his years in the Senate frustrating. He was concerned about the runaway deficit spending of the era, and he pursued economic development for Central America as an alternative to Republican-driven military policies. He led the Duke-based <a href="International%20Commission%20for%20Central%20American%20Recovery%20and%20Development">International Commission for Central American Recovery and Development</a>, a task force of scholars and leaders that published "Poverty, Conflict, and Hope: A Turning Point in Central America" (also known as the Sanford Commission Report since he was "the principal catalyst of the commission's work") in 1989 with the principles for promoting peace, democracy and equitable <a href="International%20development">development</a> in <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. Sanford served on multiple Senate committees: <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Select%20Committee%20on%20Ethics">Select Committee on Ethics</a> (Chair); <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Special%20Committee%20on%20Aging">Special Committee on Aging</a>; <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20the%20Budget">Budget</a>; <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Banking%2C%20Housing%2C%20and%20Urban%20Affairs">Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs</a> including the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Banking%20Subcommittee%20on%20Security%20and%20International%20Trade%20and%20Finance">Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policy</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Banking%20Subcommittee%20on%20Securities%2C%20Insurance%2C%20and%20Investment">Subcommittee on Securities</a>; and <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">Foreign Relations</a> including <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Subcommittee%20on%20Near%20Eastern%20and%20South%20and%20Central%20Asian%20Affairs">Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs</a> (Chair), <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Subcommittee%20on%20African%20Affairs">Subcommittee on African Affairs</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Foreign%20Relations%20Subcommittee%20on%20Western%20Hemisphere%2C%20Peace%20Corps%20and%20Narcotics%20Affairs">Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere and Peace Corps Affairs</a>. He was a leading critic of American involvement in the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>. He had a liberal voting record in comparison to his Democratic colleagues from the South, and he campaigned successfully against the passage of a <a href="constitutional%20amendment">constitutional amendment</a> prohibiting <a href="Flag%20Desecration%20Amendment">flag-burning</a> with a counter-campaign promoting the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">United States Bill of Rights</a>. Yet Sanford thought his accomplishments in the Senate paled against those he made as governor, and he seriously contemplated retiring and pursuing other projects before deciding to run for reelection. His voting record was consistently more liberal than that of any of his predecessors, being given an <a href="American%20Conservative%20Union">American Conservative Union</a> rating of 12%.

Sanford's opponent in the 1992 election was <a href="Lauch%20Faircloth">Lauch Faircloth</a>, a former Democrat turned Republican who had served as state Highway Commissioner in Sanford's gubernatorial administration. Enjoying substantial backing from Sanford's Senate colleague, <a href="Jesse%20Helms">Jesse Helms</a>, Faircloth accused Sanford of being a tax-and-spend liberal bound to special interests. While initial polls showed that Sanford had a comfortable lead over his rival, he lost supporters after an operation for an infected <a href="heart%20valve">heart valve</a> kept him from campaigning for much of October and raised doubts as to whether he was capable of serving another term. On November 3, 1992, Faircloth won the election by a 100,000-vote margin.

Sanford wrote several books, including: "But What About the People?", where he describes his efforts during the 1960s to establish a system of quality public education in North Carolina; "Storm Over the States", where he lays forth a new groundwork for state government and the federal system by recommending a "creative federalism"; and "Outlive Your Enemies: Grow Old Gracefully", where he describes actions that will slow the aging process and rules for prolonging healthy life. He also taught classes in law and political science at Duke University and campaigned for the construction of a major performing arts center in the <a href="Research%20Triangle">Research Triangle</a> area that would provide a permanent home for the <a href="American%20Dance%20Festival">American Dance Festival</a>, the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Symphony">North Carolina Symphony</a> and the Carolina Ballet. Sanford practiced law again in his later years and merged his own firm with that of another former governor, <a href="James%20Holshouser">James Holshouser</a>. Holshouser continued to practice with Sanford Holshouser LLP until his death (the firm continues under that name), and their economic development consulting firm continued under that name.

The New York Times writer David Stout characterized Sanford as a "contradictory politician" and a man who "lack[ed] burning desire."

Sanford announced in late December 1997 that he had been diagnosed with inoperable <a href="esophageal%20cancer">esophageal cancer</a> and that his doctors said he had a few months to live. After his release from the hospital, his condition slowly deteriorated. He died in his sleep while surrounded by his family at his Durham home. He was 80 years old. At his funeral, he was eulogized by a childhood friend who said Sanford "took [the Boy Scout] oath when he was twelve years old and kept it. It started out, 'On my honor, I will do my best to do my duty to God and my country,' and included such things as 'help other people at all times.' He believed it. He was the eternal Boy Scout." Sanford is entombed in the crypt of <a href="Duke%20Chapel">Duke University Chapel</a>.

Sanford was a major public figure of the post-World War II South. He played a key role in the transformation of Southern politics into the <a href="New%20South%23Politics">New South</a>, primarily in the areas of race relations and education. In recognition of his efforts in education and in countless other areas, a 1981 <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> survey named him one of the 10 best governors of the 20th century.

The Terry Sanford Federal Building and Courthouse in <a href="Raleigh%2C%20North%20Carolina">Raleigh</a>, the state capital, is named after Sanford. Sanford served as a role model to a number of southern governors, including <a href="Jim%20Hunt">Jim Hunt</a> of North Carolina (his protege), <a href="William%20Winter%20%28politician%29">William Winter</a> of Mississippi, and <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> of Arkansas. Upon his death Clinton—who had since become President of the United States—said, "His work and his influence literally changed the face and future of the South, making him one of the most influential Americans of the last 50 years." <a href="John%20Edwards">John Edwards</a> wrote that Sanford was his political hero.

Duke University has since established an undergraduate and graduate school (formerly institute) in public policy called the <a href="Sanford%20School%20of%20Public%20Policy">Sanford School of Public Policy</a>. Fayetteville High School, in Fayetteville, North Carolina, was renamed <a href="Terry%20Sanford%20High%20School">Terry Sanford High School</a> in his honor in 1968.
