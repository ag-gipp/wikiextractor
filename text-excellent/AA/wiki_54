LaRouche criminal trials

The LaRouche criminal trials in the mid-1980s stemmed from federal and state investigations into the activities of American <a href="political%20activist">political activist</a> <a href="Lyndon%20LaRouche">Lyndon LaRouche</a> and members of his movement. They were charged with conspiring to commit fraud and soliciting loans they had no intention of repaying. LaRouche and his supporters disputed the charges, claiming the trials were politically motivated.

In 1986, hundreds of state and federal officers raided LaRouche offices in Virginia and Massachusetts. A federal grand jury in Boston, Massachusetts, indicted LaRouche and 12 associates on <a href="credit%20card%20fraud">credit card fraud</a> and <a href="obstruction%20of%20justice">obstruction of justice</a>. The subsequent trial, described as an "extravaganza", was repeatedly delayed and ended in mistrial. Following the mistrial, a federal grand jury in <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria, Virginia</a>, indicted LaRouche and six associates. After a short trial in 1988, LaRouche was convicted of <a href="mail%20fraud">mail fraud</a>, <a href="conspiracy%20%28crime%29">conspiracy</a> to commit mail fraud, and <a href="tax%20evasion">tax evasion</a>, and was sentenced to prison for fifteen years. He entered prison in 1989 and was <a href="paroled">paroled</a> five years later. At the same trial, his associates received lesser sentences for mail fraud and conspiracy. In separate state trials in Virginia and New York, 13 associates received terms ranging from one month to 77 years. The Virginia state trials were described as the highest-profile cases that the state Attorney General's office had ever prosecuted. Fourteen states issued <a href="injunction">injunction</a>s against LaRouche-related organizations. Three LaRouche-related organizations were forced into bankruptcy after failing to pay <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a> fines.

Defense lawyers filed numerous unsuccessful appeals that challenged the conduct of the grand jury, the contempt fines, the execution of the search warrants and various trial procedures. At least ten appeals were heard by the <a href="United%20States%20court%20of%20appeals">United States court of appeals</a>, and three were appealed to the <a href="U.S.%20Supreme%20Court">U.S. Supreme Court</a>. Former <a href="U.S.%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a> <a href="Ramsey%20Clark">Ramsey Clark</a> joined the defense team for two appeals. Following the convictions, the LaRouche movement mounted failed attempts at <a href="exoneration">exoneration</a>.

Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lyndon LaRouche formed a variety of political organizations, including the <a href="U.S.%20Labor%20Party">U.S. Labor Party</a> and the National Democratic Policy Committee. These organizations served as the platforms for <a href="Lyndon%20LaRouche%20U.S.%20Presidential%20campaigns">presidential campaigns by LaRouche</a> starting in 1976, and by his followers in scores of local races. According to one candidate, supporters viewed LaRouche as "the greatest political leader and economist of the 20th century, and they're proud to be associated with him. They feel he's leading the battle to save Western civilization." The "Survey of Jewish Affairs, 1987" called the LaRouche movement one of the two most prominent "extremist political groups" of 1986.

The movement's greatest electoral success came in 1986 when two supporters, <a href="Janice%20Hart">Janice Hart</a> and Mark J. Fairchild, won the Democratic Party nominations for <a href="Illinois%20Secretary%20of%20State">Illinois Secretary of State</a> and <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Illinois">Lieutenant Governor</a>. Both lost in the general election. Also in 1986, the "Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee" (PANIC) got an <a href="initiative">initiative</a> on the California ballot, <a href="California%20Proposition%2064%20%281986%29">Proposition 64</a> (also known as the "LaRouche Initiative"), which attracted widespread opposition and was defeated that November.

According to arguments made by LaRouche's attorneys in later appeals, the government investigations were started under the FBI's <a href="COINTELPRO">COINTELPRO</a> in the 1960s. Edward Spannaus, a defendant in the trials, further notes that there was a memorandum written on January 12, 1983, by former <a href="FBI">FBI</a> chief <a href="William%20Hedgcock%20Webster">William Webster</a> to <a href="Oliver%20%26quot%3BBuck%26quot%3B%20Revell">Oliver "Buck" Revell</a>, head of the Bureau's General Investigative Division. It requested information on the funding of LaRouche and the <a href="U.S.%20Labor%20Party">U.S. Labor Party</a>, including whether the U.S. Labor Party might be funded by hostile intelligence agencies. The LaRouche organization asserts that this formulation was specifically tailored to enable FBI "active measures" against LaRouche under <a href="Executive%20Order%2012333">Executive Order 12333</a>, which permits such measures if a political movement receives foreign funding. The memo was eventually obtained by LaRouche's attorneys and submitted as an exhibit in the 1987 trial of LaRouche and co-defendants in Boston.

In August 1982, former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> sent a memo to Webster requesting an investigation of the LaRouche movement due to their "increasingly obnoxious" harassment of him, which was raised at a meeting that day of the <a href="President%27s%20Foreign%20Intelligence%20Advisory%20Board">President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board</a> by senior member <a href="David%20Abshire">David Abshire</a>. Revell replied to Kissinger that there was sufficient evidence to proceed with an investigation. The FBI conducted an investigation but did not find evidence of a violation of Kissinger's <a href="Civil%20and%20political%20rights">civil rights</a>. The investigation was closed in late 1983.

In the mid-1980s, the U.S. government and eleven states began investigations into alleged financial improprieties by LaRouche groups. A federal <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> reportedly began investigating "an extensive nationwide pattern of credit card fraud" by LaRouche organizations in November 1984. That same year a <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> bank froze the accounts of LaRouche's 1984 presidential campaign due to allegedly fraudulent credit-card charges.

In January 1985, the grand jury in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, subpoenaed documents from the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), and three other LaRouche organizations: Caucus Distributors Inc., <a href="Fusion%20Energy%20Foundation">Fusion Energy Foundation</a>, and Campaigner Publications Inc. Seven weeks later, on March 29, 1985, a U.S. District Court Judge <a href="A.%20David%20Mazzone">A. David Mazzone</a> held them to be in contempt and fined them $45,000 per day. The fines for all the organizations eventually totaled over $20Â million. The same grand jury subpoenaed Elliot I. Greenspan, an official of Caucus Distributors Inc., to appear but he <a href="Pleading%20the%20Fifth">pleaded the Fifth Amendment</a> and refused to testify. He was granted immunity and compelled to testify but only did so after being jailed for contempt for two days. A spokesman for LaRouche called the investigation "a political terror operation".

Investigations by a separate federal grand jury in <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria, Virginia</a>, along with state agencies in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a> and <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> were also underway. The FBI, IRS, <a href="Federal%20Election%20Commission">FEC</a> and personnel of other federal agencies were conducting separate investigations. The <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> revoked the tax-exempt status of the Fusion Energy Foundation in September 1985, and a year later the State of New York sought to dissolve the corporation, alleging that it used "persistently fraudulent and illegal" means to solicit donations. U.S. Attorney <a href="William%20Weld">William Weld</a> announced in January 1986, that he would convene a national conference "to coordinate a prosecutive and investigative effort" against LaRouche. The conference was held the following month in Boston. Three states, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> and <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, banned fund raising by Caucus Distributors Inc. in May 1986, due to the sale of unregistered promissory notes. The Illinois Secretary of State began civil proceedings against Caucus Distributors Inc. in June 1986, seeking an injunction to bar deceptive business practices. Minnesota officials banned "Independent Democrats for LaRouche" from fund raising, an order that was affirmed on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

LaRouche lawyers filed a series of related civil suits against individuals, agencies and businesses. They sued Weld and former Attorney General <a href="William%20French%20Smith">William French Smith</a> to try to stop the FBI investigation of the credit card case. They sued the New Jersey bank that had frozen their credit card merchant accounts; and they sued <a href="Chemical%20Bank">Chemical Bank</a> in a similar suit. Edward Spannaus, a treasurer for LaRouche campaigns, filed complaints with the state bar and the U.S. Justice Department against one of the Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the case.

Beginning October 6, 1986, the <a href="Leesburg%2C%20Virginia">Leesburg, Virginia</a>, headquarters of the LaRouche organization was searched in a coordinated, two-day raid by hundreds of officers of the FBI, <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">IRS</a>, other federal agencies, and Virginia state authorities, supported by armored cars and a helicopter. The agents also surrounded LaRouche's heavily guarded estate for the duration of the search but did not enter it. While surrounded, LaRouche sent a telegram to President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> saying that an attempt to arrest him "would be an attempt to kill me. I will not submit passively to such an arrest, but ... I will defend myself". He later assured that he would comply peaceably with any warrant. LaRouche offices in <a href="Quincy%2C%20Massachusetts">Quincy, Massachusetts</a> were searched as well. US Attorney <a href="Henry%20E.%20Hudson">Henry E. Hudson</a> held a press conference to say that the searches had recovered subpoenaed materials, including notebooks and index cards.

Warren J. Hamerman, Chair of the NDPC, said the searches "conducted by <a href="Donald%20Regan">Donald Regan</a>'s associate William Weld's forces against presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche's headquarters coincides with Don Regan's desperate attempts to maintain the cover-up on <a href="AIDS">AIDS</a>". LaRouche later said that the Soviet Premier had ordered the raid as part of an assassination attempt. "The man with the <a href="mark%20of%20the%20beast">mark of the beast</a> on his head, <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachov</a>, has demanded my elimination", said LaRouche. In his 1987 autobiography, he wrote that the raid was ordered by <a href="Raisa%20Gorbachev">Raisa Gorbachev</a>, whom he described as outranking her husband in the <a href="nomenklatura">nomenklatura</a> due to her leadership of the Soviet Cultural Fund.

On the same day as the Leesburg search, the Boston grand jury handed down a 117-count indictment that named ten LaRouche associates, two corporations, and three campaign committees. Authorities charged them with making unauthorized credit charges that defrauded $1Â million from over 1,000 people. The charges also included a scheme to raise funds by soliciting loans with no intention of repaying them. The <a href="National%20Caucus%20of%20Labor%20Committees">National Caucus of Labor Committees</a> was charged, along with others, of conspiring to obstruct justice. Prosecutors charged that defendants had burned records, sent potential grand jury witnesses out of the country, and failed to provide subpoenaed evidence. The indictment quoted LaRouche telling an associate that, in reaction to legal problems, "we are going to stall, tie them up in the courts ... just keep stalling, stall and appeal, stall and appeal". Three of the indicted associates remained at large for over a year, and investigators were allegedly given false information. On June 30, 1987, the U.S. grand jury in Boston indicted LaRouche on one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Meanwhile, the state cases were progressing. On February 16, 1987, the Commonwealth of Virginia indicted 16 LaRouche associates on securities fraud and other felonies. On March 3, 1987, the State of New York indicted 15 LaRouche associates on charges of grand larceny and securities fraud.

In early April 1987, the government charged in court that LaRouche organizations may have been trying to sell properties for cash to more easily conceal their assets and avoid paying $21.4Â million in contempt of court fines. The U.S. Department of Justice filed an <a href="involuntary%20bankruptcy">involuntary bankruptcy</a> petition on April 20, 1987, to collect the debt from Caucus Distributors Inc., <a href="Fusion%20Energy%20Foundation">Fusion Energy Foundation</a>, and Campaigner Publications Inc. In a rare procedure, the companies were seized before the bankruptcy came to trial. Assistant U.S. Attorney S. David Schiller wrote in a brief that the debtors had a "pattern of transferring or commingling substantial corporate assets to their members and other insiders for little or no consideration and for non-business purposes". The trustees later reported they were only able to locate about $86,000 in assets.

The bankruptcy halted the publication of a weekly newspaper, "New Solidarity", and a bi-monthly science magazine, "<a href="Fusion%20%28magazine%29">Fusion</a>". At least one publication, "<a href="21st%20Century%20Science%20and%20Technology">Fusion</a>", was reborn with a new name but the same editor and material.

The attorneys who represented the LaRouche entities in the bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that the action was unprecedented and improper, alleging that it deviated from the standard rules of involuntary bankruptcy, and that members of the Alexandria prosecution team from the second criminal trial were involved in the planning and execution of the bankruptcy.

During the bankruptcy trial in September 1989, an FBI agent destroyed evidence (credit card receipts, cancelled checks, and FEC filings) immediately after he had promised the court he would preserve them. On October 25, 1989, Judge <a href="Martin%20V.B.%20Bostetter">Martin V.B. Bostetter</a> dismissed the government's involuntary bankruptcy petition, finding that two of the entities involved were nonprofit fund-raisers and therefore not subject to involuntary bankruptcy actions. According to the LaRouche movement, Bostetter said the government's actions amounted to bad faith regardless of whether government agents and attorneys had intended this outcome. He found that the government's actions and representations in obtaining the bankruptcy had the effect of misleading the court as to the status of the organization, leading to a "<a href="constructive%20fraud">constructive fraud</a> on the court". In 1993, an appeals court decision said that Bostetter had specifically rejected that view, and said that the defendants had "greatly distorted the character of much of the evidence". Appeals that went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court found that the matter of the involuntary bankruptcy would not change the outcome of LaRouche's conviction.

The LaRouche organization asserts that it has proof, obtained under the <a href="Freedom%20of%20Information%20Act%20%28United%20States%29">Freedom of Information Act</a>, which shows that the purpose of the bankruptcy was simply to shut down the affected entities rather than to collect fines. The U.S. Attorney said, "Essentially the court holds that we did not abuse the bankruptcy filing, just that we should have filed differently." He also noted that only a minimal amount of money had been collected.

United States District Judge <a href="Robert%20Keeton">Robert Keeton</a> presided in Boston. Jury selection was completed in September 1987. Before the trial could begin, Keeton granted a motion to sever the case of <a href="Roy%20Frankhouser">Roy Frankhouser</a>, whose case was tried first in front of a different jury.
Frankhouser had been an informant for the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Alcohol%2C%20Tobacco%2C%20Firearms%20and%20Explosives">ATF</a> and other law enforcement agencies, in addition to being a <a href="neo-Nazism">neo-Nazi</a> and a former Pennsylvania <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> grand dragon. Frankhouser became a security consultant for LaRouche after convincing him that he was actively connected to U.S. intelligence agencies.

In "U.S. v. Frankhauser", Frankhouser testified that he and LaRouche security employee Forrest Lee Fick had invented a connection to the CIA in order to justify his $700 a week salary. They persuaded a friend to play a former top CIA official ("Mr. Ed") in meetings with LaRouche associates who, according to LaRouche group lawyers, came to believe that they had a direct line of communication to the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> and <a href="Kremlin">Kremlin</a> through Mr. Ed andâas "a national resource in security matters"âwere immune from prosecution. When LaRouche found out about the grand jury investigation, he reportedly told Frankhouser to get the CIA to quash it. Frankhouser told LaRouche that the CIA wanted him to destroy evidence and hide witnesses. Frankhouser claimed that on another occasion LaRouche sent him to Boston to check on the grand jury investigation. Instead of going to Boston he went to a <a href="Star%20Trek%20convention">Star Trek convention</a> in <a href="Scranton%2C%20Pennsylvania">Scranton, Pennsylvania</a> and called to warn LaRouche that the FBI had wiretapped his phones. LaRouche was called as a defense witness in Frankhouser's trial but he refused to testify, exercising his <a href="Fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifth Amendment</a> right to avoid self-incrimination.

Frankhouser was found guilty of obstruction of the federal investigation into credit-card fraud. He was sentenced to three years and a $50,000 fine. After his conviction, he was granted immunity against further prosecution and compelled to testify against LaRouche in the Boston trial. Frankhouser appealed his conviction on April 3, 1989, arguing that his case should not have been severed from the main case, that his counsel had inadequate time to prepare, and that he was not provided with allegedly exculpatory evidence. The appeal was rejected in July.

The trial of LaRouche and his six co-defendants, "U.S. v. LaRouche Campaign", began on December 17, 1987, with the jury that had been picked in September, before the Frankhouser trial. The 12 defense lawyers made 400 pretrial motions.

The prosecution argued that pressure to fill fund raising quotas had led to 2,000 instances of credit card fraud, and that organization members had sought to obstruct the investigation. The defense presented the case that the prosecution was the culmination of a 20-year campaign of harassment by the FBI and CIA, and that the prosecution was acting on the orders of the CIA when they destroyed evidence and hid witnesses.

During the trial, a search of the personal files of <a href="Oliver%20North">Oliver North</a> was ordered by Judge Keeton to look for evidence that North had led an effort to harass and infiltrate the LaRouche movement, causing an additional delay in the trial. The search produced a May 1986 telex from <a href="Iran-Contra">Iran-Contra</a> defendant General <a href="Richard%20Secord">Richard Secord</a> to North, discussing the gathering of information against LaRouche. After this memo surfaced, Judge Keeton ordered a search of Vice President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George Bush</a>'s office for documents relating to LaRouche. Another delay came when the trial was halted to give time for the FBI to search their files for exculpatory documents. The trial was delayed again when federal agents seized LaRouche properties as part of the involuntary bankruptcy procedure in 1988.

Originally expected to last from three to six months, the trial stretched out much longer. One local reporter called the Boston trial a "long, complex and costly multidefendant extravaganza". After several jurors asked to be excused due to the length of the trial, the defense refused to proceed with fewer than 12 jurors, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial on May 4, 1988. According to one of the jurors, all defendants, including LaRouche, would have been found not guilty. He told a reporter "it seemed some of the government's people caused the problem", and that people working on behalf of the government "may have been involved in some of this fraud to discredit the campaign." At the time of the mistrial, a spokesperson said that the Constitutional Defense Fund, a LaRouche organization, had spent over $2Â million on legal and administrative expenses. Defense attorneys said they would appeal if the government sought a new trial.

A retrial in Boston was scheduled for January 3, 1989, but the charges were dismissed after the Alexandria convictions; this was over the objections of the LaRouche lawyers who said they were seeking vindication. The Assistant U.S. Attorney who handled both the Boston and Alexandria cases said after the dismissal, "It was the Boston prosecuting effort which led to the evidence which allowed the indictment and convictions in Alexandria, and I think justice was served by the substantial sentences received."

Throughout the trial, three of the indicted individuals were fugitives: Michael Gelber, Charles Park, and Richard Sanders. According to Roy Frankhouser, they had been sent to Europe. They surrendered to the court in 1990 and were sentenced by Judge Keeton to one year each for obstructing the investigation.

On July 3, 1986, the <a href="First%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">First Circuit Court of Appeals</a> upheld the contempt of court fines from the Boston grand jury. That decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which let it stand. The First Circuit Court heard an appeal on September 11, 1987, alleging abuse of the grand jury and denied it six days later. On November 3, 1987, six organizations affiliated with LaRouche argued that their documents were seized improperly during the October 1986 search. The court denied the appeal the following January. Jeffrey Steinberg said on December 11, 1987, that 100 notebooks compiled by himself and his wife should not have been included in the grand jury subpoena or the search. He lost that appeal the following January. The court heard an appeal from <a href="NBC">NBC</a> on January 5, 1988, over a lower court subpoena of NBC outtakes of a videotaped interview with a witness, Forrest Lee Fick. The lower court ruled the subpoenaed outtakes were to be placed under seal and subject to <a href="in%20camera">in camera</a> review only, giving the court discretion whether to release any portion to the defendants. LaRouche had asserted the outtakes could be used to impeach Fick's testimony. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling in March.

Following the mistrial in Boston, the prosecution moved to schedule a new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create <a href="double%20jeopardy">double jeopardy</a>. The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.

Judge <a href="Albert%20V.%20Bryan%20Jr.">Albert V. Bryan Jr.</a> presided over "U.S. v. LaRouche" in the <a href="U.S.%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Eastern%20District%20of%20Virginia">U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia</a>, where LaRouche resided. That court was known as a "<a href="rocket%20docket">rocket docket</a>" for its speed in disposing of cases. LaRouche and six associates were indicted on October 14, 1988 on charges of <a href="mail%20fraud">mail fraud</a> and <a href="Conspiracy%20%28crime%29">conspiracy</a> to commit mail fraud. Trial was scheduled for six weeks after the indictment. Defense lawyers made an unusual appeal asking for a delay, which was rejected.

Judge Bryan granted a prosecution motion "<a href="in%20limine">in limine</a>", ruling that the defense would not be permitted to discuss, or even allude to, the fact that the indebted entities had been placed in involuntary bankruptcy. It also excluded claims of vindictive prosecution and political harassment by the government. Bryan wrote, "the court will not allow a delving into any details of alleged infiltration ... for the reason that ... this would divert the jury from the issues raised in the indictment."

The prosecution, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson, presented evidence that LaRouche and his staff solicited US$34Â million in loans since 1983 with false assurances to potential lenders and showed "reckless disregard for the truth". In his opening statement to the trial, Robinson said, "Members of the jury, this case is about money. It's about how the defendants got money, and to a lesser extent, what they did with that money when they got itÂ ... The defendants, all seven of them, are charged in engaging in a scheme to defraud. That is, to obtain those loans by making false promises, false pretences, saying things to potential lenders which they knew weren't true."

The most important evidence was the testimony of lenders, many of them elderly retirees, who had loaned a total of $661,300 to help LaRouche fight the "war on drugs" but only received $10,000 in repayment. One of the prosecutors, John Markham, said those loans represented "just a very small portion of unrepaid borrowing". Other testimony asserted that, as of 1987, half of the $4Â million borrowed by the 1984 presidential campaign was unpaid, and that only $5Â million had been repaid out of $30Â million in non-campaign loans. LaRouche supporters claim the unrepaid amount was $294,000 but, according to testimony at trial, the amount owed by 1987 topped $25Â million.

Several witnesses were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution. A former fundraiser testified that he was told, "No matter what the person you are talking to says, get the money. [...] If you are talking to an unemployed worker who says he has got to feed ... a dozen children, forget it. Get the money. Most of these people are immoral anyway. This is the most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money."

None of the defendants testified. Outside of court, LaRouche denied all the charges, calling them "an all-out frame-up by a state and federal task force," and said that the federal government was trying to kill him. "The purpose of this frame-up is not to send me to prison. It's to kill me," LaRouche said. "In prison it's fairly easy to kill me ... If this sentence goes through, I'm dead."

One of the charges against LaRouche was that he had conspired to avoid paying income tax, not having filed a return in ten years. LaRouche claimed to have had no income. LaRouche lived on a 172-acre (700,000Â m) estate near <a href="Leesburg%2C%20Virginia">Leesburg, Virginia</a>, with a pond and horse ring. It was purchased for his use by Oklahoma oilman David Nick Anderson for $1.3Â million, with LaRouche organizations paying rent to cover the $9,605 mortgage. LaRouche had named the property, otherwise known as <a href="Ellwood%20%28Leesburg%2C%20Virginia%29">Ellwood</a>, "Ibykus Farm" after a work by <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>. His wife, Helga LaRouche, is reported to have overseen hundreds of thousands of dollars in renovations to the property. In all, the LaRouche group spent over US$4Â million on Virginia real estate during this period, according to trial testimony. The LaRouche defense argued that Ibykus Farm was a "<a href="safehouse">safehouse</a>" needed for the security of LaRouche and others. The government argued that security expenditures were "misplaced priorities."

In 1985, a judge in a separate case had described LaRouche's testimony about being almost penniless as "completely lacking in credibility". In 1986, in the same case, LaRouche said that he did not know who had paid the rent on the estate, or for his food, lodging, clothing, transportation, bodyguards, or lawyers since 1973. The judge fined him for failing to answer.

On December 16, 1988, LaRouche was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud involving more than $30Â million in defaulted loans; 11 counts of actual mail fraud involving $294,000 in defaulted loans; and one count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The judge said that the claim of a vendetta was "arrant nonsense", and that, "the idea that this organization is a sufficient threat to anything that would warrant the government bringing a prosecution to silence them just defies human experience."
Jury foreman Buster Horton told "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" that it was the failure of LaRouche aides to repay loans which swayed the jury in the Virginia case. He said that the jury "all agreed [LaRouche] was not on trial for his political beliefs. We did not convict him for that. He was convicted for those 13 counts he was on trial for."

As part of the trial in Alexandria, six of LaRouche's associates were also found guilty. His chief fund-raiser, William Wertz, was convicted on ten mail fraud counts. LaRouche's legal adviser and treasurer, Edward Spannaus, along with fund raising operatives Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg, <a href="Michael%20Billington%20%28activist%29">Michael Billington</a>, and Joyce Rubinstein, were convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Wertz and Spannaus were sentenced to five years imprisonment each, with Spannaus serving a total of two and a half years until his release from custody. Both were fined $1,000. The others received three-year terms and various fines.

While in prison LaRouche released claims that he was tortured as part of an assassination attempt. LaRouche ran two political campaigns from prison: for Virginia's 10th Congressional District in 1990 and for U.S. President in 1992. One of his cellmates during his incarceration at the <a href="Federal%20Medical%20Center%2C%20Rochester">Federal Medical Center, Rochester</a> in Minnesota was televangelist <a href="Jim%20Bakker">Jim Bakker</a>. Bakker later devoted a chapter of his book, "I Was Wrong", to his experience with LaRouche. Bakker described his astonishment at LaRouche's detailed knowledge of the Bible. According to Bakker, LaRouche received a daily briefing each morning by phone, often in German, and on more than one occasion LaRouche had information days before it was reported on the network news. Bakker also wrote that his cellmate was convinced that their cell was bugged. In Bakker's view, "to say LaRouche was a little paranoid would be like saying that the Titanic had a little leak." LaRouche also befriended <a href="Richard%20Miller%20%28agent%29">Richard Miller</a>, a former FBI agent and fellow inmate who was imprisoned on espionage charges. LaRouche was paroled in 1994 after serving five years of the 15-year sentence, the normal schedule for parole at that time. LaRouche commented later that "...Â in effect, George H. W. Bush put me in the jug, and Bill Clinton got me out".

The defendants in the Alexandria trial appealed their convictions to <a href="Fourth%20Circuit%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals</a> on October 6, 1989. Former U.S. Attorney General <a href="Ramsey%20Clark">Ramsey Clark</a> joined the defense team, which contended that there were six faults in the trial. In the words of the Circuit Court's opinion, the alleged errors were:
Seventeen "<a href="amicus%20curiae">amicus curiae</a>" ("friend of the court") briefs were filed in the appeal. One, by Albert Bleckmann, director of the Institute for Public Law and Political Sciences at the <a href="University%20of%20M%C3%BCnster">University of MÃ¼nster</a>, objected to the lack of "voir dire", the exclusion of evidence under the motion "in limine", the fact that the government did not approach LaRouche about his tax situation before indicting him for tax violations, and concerns about <a href="double%20jeopardy">double jeopardy</a> because of the nearly identical charges in the Boston and Alexandria trials. A brief by a French lawyer said that, "a crime of thought seems to have been camouflaged as a common law crime." Notable submitters of <a href="amicus">amicus</a> briefs included: <a href="James%20Robert%20Mann%20%28South%20Carolina%29">James Robert Mann</a>, <a href="Charles%20E.%20Rice">Charles E. Rice</a>, <a href="Jay%20Alan%20Sekulow">Jay Alan Sekulow</a> and <a href="George%20P.%20Monaghan">George P. Monaghan</a>.

The three-judge panel reviewed and rejected each item, affirming the defendants' convictions and sentences unanimously on January 22, 1990. Five months later the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case.

The Attorney General of Virginia, <a href="Mary%20Sue%20Terry">Mary Sue Terry</a>, prosecuted eight LaRouche organizations on charges of <a href="securities%20fraud">securities fraud</a> relating to $30Â million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of <a href="Roanoke%2C%20Virginia">Roanoke</a>. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, a decision by the <a href="State%20Corporation%20Commission">State Corporation Commission</a> (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were <a href="Security%20%28finance%29">securities</a>. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the <a href="promissory%20note">promissory note</a>s were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizationsâ<a href="Fusion%20Energy%20Foundation">Fusion Energy Foundation Inc.</a>, Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.âto stop their sale. Five other states had already issued <a href="injunction">injunction</a>s, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent Democrats for LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling.

Six of LaRouche's associates were convicted and two pleaded guilty. Rochelle Ascher, a fundraiser, was sentenced in Leesburg to 86 years (reduced to 10 years) for six charges of fraudulently selling securities and one count each of selling an unregistered security with intent to defraud, selling a security by an unregistered agent with intent to defraud, and conspiracy to commit security fraud. In two Roanoke trials, four other associates were found guilty of securities fraud charges: Donald Phau, Lawrence Hecht, Paul Gallagher and Anita Gallagher. Richard Welsh and Martha M. Quinde pleaded guilty and received 12 month and one month terms, respectively.

Michael Billington was charged in a Roanoke court with having knowingly solicited 131 loans that would never be repaid from 85 people, totaling $1.24Â million. Represented by a court-appointed lawyer, he rejected a <a href="plea%20bargain">plea bargain</a> that would have limited his prison sentence to the three years he had already served in the federal case. The lawyer, Brian Gettings, doubted Billington's <a href="Competence%20%28law%29">competence</a> and told the court that he believed LaRouche was making the decisions in the case rather than his client. The court ordered two psychiatric tests. The first physician deemed him competent. Billington refused to cooperate with a second examination that was to be conducted by an expert on <a href="cult">cult</a>s. Billington sought to fire Gettings, who had already tried to quit over competency question, but the judge refused to permit Billington to substitute a different attorney. A LaRouche spokesman said that Billington was prepared for trial. Billington was convicted on nine counts of "conspiracy to fail to register as a securities broker". Under Virginia's court system, the jury determines prison terms although a judge may override the jury's recommendation. The jury in this case recommended 77 years (out of a possible 90); the judge refused to lower it because Billington continued to insist upon his innocence (which the judge deemed lack of remorse) and because he had warned that he would accept the jury recommendation if Billington requested a jury trial. Billington served a total of ten years in prison before being released on parole. The lead prosecutor said the case involved "willful and massive fraud that has caused a lot of people to suffer".

A trial in New York state courts on charges of scheming to defraud resulted in the conviction of Robert Primack, Marielle Kronberg and Lynne Speed.

"My imprisonment is the American <a href="Dreyfus%20affair">Dreyfus case</a>", LaRouche said in a January 1989 interview from prison. The prosecutor denied claims of a conspiracy, describing the theory as an "<a href="George%20Orwell">Orwellian</a> fantasy ... that we are hiding some supersecret spy plot which, if exposed, would exonerate them". LaRouche supporters insisted that LaRouche was jailed, not for any violation of the law, but for his beliefs.

LaRouche also alleged systematic government misconduct:
The record shows, that for nearly thirty years, elements of the U.S. Department of Justice have been engaged in world-wide political targeting of me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.

LaRouche and his lawyers asserted that the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League</a> (ADL) sought to destroy his organization, and that the prosecution was the result of a conspiracy between the ADL, the government and the media. This claim stemmed from a series of meetings that LaRouche publications refer to as the <a href="John%20Train%20%28investment%20advisor%29">John Train</a> "Salon".

In testimony submitted to the <a href="Senate%20Judiciary%20Committee">Senate Judiciary Committee</a> on July 13, 1998, the LaRouche-affiliated <a href="Schiller%20Institute">Schiller Institute</a> claimed that "[t]he inability to repay lenders and other crediters [sic] was the consequence of an unprecedented <a href="involuntary%20bankruptcy">involuntary bankruptcy</a> proceeding initiated by the Justice Department against those companies in 1987, initiated in an "<a href="ex%20parte">ex parte</a>", "<a href="in%20camera">in camera</a>" proceeding".

<a href="Friedrich%20August%20Freiherr%20von%20der%20Heydte">Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte</a>, a professor of <a href="constitutional%20law">constitutional</a> and <a href="international%20law">international law</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Mainz">University of Mainz</a> in Germany, compared the LaRouche trial to the <a href="Dreyfus%20affair">Dreyfus affair</a>, which he called "a classical example of a political trial". He wrote, "Just as LaRouche was, the French Capt. Alfred Dreyfus was deprived by the structure of the trial procedures, of any opportunity to prove his innocence, and facts critical for his defense were excluded from the trial."

On November 8, 1991, Angelo Vidal d'Almeida Ribeiro, the <a href="United%20Nations%20special%20rapporteur">Special Rapporteur</a> for the <a href="United%20Nations%20Commission%20on%20Human%20Rights">United Nations Commission on Human Rights</a>, filed a request to the U.S. Government based on a complaint that had been filed concerning the LaRouche case. The U.S. government responded by saying that LaRouche had been given due process under the laws of the United States. The U.N. Commission took no further action.

Ramsey Clark wrote a letter in 1995 to then-Attorney General <a href="Janet%20Reno">Janet Reno</a> in which he said that the case involved "a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge". He asserted that, "The government, ex parte, sought and received an order effectively closing the doors of these publishing businesses, all of which were involved in First Amendment activities, effectively preventing the further repayment of their debts." He called the convictions "a tragic miscarriage of justice which at this time can only be corrected by an objective review and courageous action by the Department of Justice". The LaRouche movement organized two panels to review the cases: the Curtis Clark Commission, and the <a href="Schiller%20Institute%23Mann-Chestnut%20hearings">Mann-Chestnut hearings</a>.

On September 18, 1996, a full-page advertisement appeared in the "New Federalist", a LaRouche publication, as well as "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" and "<a href="Roll%20Call">Roll Call</a>". Entitled "Officials Call for LaRouche's Exoneration", its signatories included <a href="Arturo%20Frondizi">Arturo Frondizi</a>, former <a href="President%20of%20Argentina">President of Argentina</a>; figures from the 1960s <a href="American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement">American Civil Rights Movement</a> such as <a href="Amelia%20Boynton%20Robinson">Amelia Boynton Robinson</a> (a leader of the Larouche-affiliated <a href="Schiller%20Institute">Schiller Institute</a>), <a href="James%20Bevel">James Bevel</a> (a Larouche movement participant) and <a href="Rosa%20Parks">Rosa Parks</a>; former <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senator</a> and Democratic Presidential Candidate <a href="Eugene%20McCarthy">Eugene McCarthy</a>; <a href="Mervyn%20M.%20Dymally">Mervyn M. Dymally</a>, who chaired the <a href="Congressional%20Black%20Caucus">Congressional Black Caucus</a>; and artists such as classical vocalist <a href="William%20Warfield">William Warfield</a> and violinist <a href="Norbert%20Brainin">Norbert Brainin</a>, former 1st Violin of the <a href="Amadeus%20Quartet">Amadeus Quartet</a>.

In 2009, Molly Kronberg, widow of <a href="Kenneth%20Kronberg">Kenneth Kronberg</a>, sued LaRouche in federal court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, alleging that he and his associates libelled and harassed her on account of her compelled testimony in the 1988 case which led to his conviction. LaRouche alleges that Kronberg perjured herself and colluded with the prosecutors to frame him in order to cover up a bad check issued in 1979 by her from a <a href="New%20Benjamin%20Franklin%20House%20Publishing%20Company">New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company</a> account for royalties owed him. One of the prosecutors in the 1988 case, John Markham, is representing Kronberg in the suit.

Giants: Citizen Kabuto

Giants: Citizen Kabuto is a <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person shooter</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> with <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> elements. It was the first project for <a href="Planet%20Moon%20Studios">Planet Moon Studios</a>, which consisted of former <a href="Shiny%20Entertainment">Shiny Entertainment</a> employees who had worked on the game "<a href="MDK%20%28video%20game%29">MDK</a>" in 1997. "Giants" went through four years of development before <a href="Interplay%20Entertainment">Interplay Entertainment</a> published it on December 6, 2000, for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>; a port was published by <a href="MacPlay">MacPlay</a> in 2001, and the game was also <a href="Porting%23Porting%20in%20gaming">ported</a> to the later that year.

In the game, players take control of a single character from one of three humanoid races to either complete the story in <a href="Single-player%20mode">single-player mode</a> or to challenge other players in <a href="Online%20game">online</a> <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer matches</a>. They can select heavily armed "Meccaryns" equipped with <a href="jet%20pack">jet pack</a>s, or <a href="amphibian">amphibious</a> <a href="Wizard%20%28character%20class%29">spell-casting</a> "Sea Reapers"; the game's subtitle, "Citizen Kabuto", refers to the last selectable race, a thundering <a href="behemoth">behemoth</a> who can execute earthshaking <a href="professional%20wrestling%20attacks">wrestling attacks</a> to pulverize its enemies. The single-player mode is framed as a sequential story, putting the player through a series of missions, several of which test the player's reflexes in <a href="action%20game">action game</a>-like <a href="puzzles">puzzles</a>.

Game critics praised "Giants" for its <a href="state-of-the-art">state-of-the-art</a> <a href="Computer%20graphics">graphics</a> on Windows computers, a humorous story, and successfully blending different <a href="Video%20game%20genres">genres</a>. Criticisms focused on crippling <a href="software%20bug">software bug</a>s and the lack of an in-game <a href="Saved%20game">save feature</a>. The console version rectified some of the flaws found in the PC versions, at the cost of removing several features. The game initially sold poorly for Windows and PlayStationÂ 2; however, it sold well afterwards, and gained a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>.

In "Giants: Citizen Kabuto", players take on the roles of three <a href="humanoid">humanoid</a> races: gun-toting Meccaryns, <a href="magic%20%28gaming%29">magic</a>-wielding Sea Reapers, and the gigantic Kabuto. Each player is assigned direct control of a single character. The game's developers, <a href="Planet%20Moon%20Studios">Planet Moon Studios</a>, created this design to encourage players to focus on the action and not to be burdened with <a href="micromanagement%20%28computer%20gaming%29">micromanagement</a>. Players can customize the controls, which are largely the same for each race, with slight differences for abilities.

The <a href="single-player">single-player</a> mode consists of a sequence of missions set as an <a href="wikt%3Aoverarching">overarching</a> story. Each mission requires the completion of certain objectives to progress to the next mission. The objectives are usually the elimination of enemies or a certain structure, but several of them test the player's <a href="eye%E2%80%93hand%20coordination">eyeâhand coordination</a> or require the player to rescue and protect certain units. Players control their characters from a default <a href="third-person%20shooter">third person perspective</a>; a <a href="first-person%20shooter">first person view</a> is optional. Each race has its own offensive style, and a special mode of fast movement. Killing a creature releases a <a href="power-up">power-up</a>, which heals or awards weapons to its collector.

The <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> elements of "Giants" consist of base building and resource gathering, wherein the resources are small humanoids called Smarties. There are a limited number of Smarties in a mission, and players must rush to gather them, or kidnap them from each other to gain an advantage. Players also gather sustenance for the Smarties to make them work; Meccaryn and Reaper players hunt the cattle-like Vimps for meat and souls respectively. The options in building a base are limited; players can neither choose the locations for the structures nor manage their workforce in detail. Players in control of Kabuto need not build a base; instead, the character gains strength and produces subordinate characters by hunting for food. Kabuto consumes Smarties to increase his size and power; at maximum size, he can produce smaller <a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>-like units as subordinates. To restore his health, Kabuto eats Vimps and other units (player- and computer-controlled).

<a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">Multiplayer</a> mode allows a maximum of five Meccaryn, three Sea Reaper, and one Kabuto player(s) to play in each session. Due to the lack of a <a href="game%20server%20browser">game server browser</a>, players connect through online services <a href="MPlayer.com">MPlayer</a> or <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy Arcade</a> for the Windows version, and <a href="GameRanger">GameRanger</a> for the Mac OSÂ X version. Besides the standard "destroy all enemy bases and units" missions, the multiplayer mode includes <a href="deathmatch%20%28gaming%29">deathmatch</a>es and "<a href="Capture%20the%20flag">Capture the Smartie (flag)</a>"-type games. Players are permitted either to start with a full base or to build one from foundations. 

The game world of "Giants" is set on a fictional "Island" traveling through <a href="space">space</a>. Its surface comprises <a href="grassland">grassland</a>s, <a href="desert">desert</a>s, and <a href="forest">forest</a>s, surrounded by azure seas. Players have an unobstructed view of the game world to its horizon; whereas distant objects are slightly blurred to convey a sense of distance. Missions for Meccaryns provide cover to hide behind, large spaces of water for Reapers, and creatures for Kabuto to eat.

Planet Moon intended for the <a href="player%20characters">player characters</a> to provide a varied gameplay experience, laying down requirements to make the characters distinct with unique advantages and disadvantages.



For non-playable races, the team designed Smarties to have oversized heads, bulging eyes, and idiotic personalities for comedic effect. Players labor for the Smarties while witnessing their <a href="hedonism">hedonistic</a> indulgences. The payoff, however, is a "giant gun". Standard enemies include Reaper Guards (male Reapers with no magical ability, who serve as common soldiers), as well as <a href="fauna">fauna</a> such as the <a href="insectoid">insectoid</a> Rippers, <a href="Working%20animal">beast-of-burden</a> Sonaks, and <a href="bat">bat</a>-like Verms.

Originally featuring each race in its own distinct story, the single-player mode now depicts a single sequential story wherein the player begins as Baz and must complete a sequence of missions before assuming the role of Delphi. On completion of Delphi's story, the player takes control of a Kabuto character. Williams used <a href="Cutscene%23Animated%20cutscenes">cut scenes</a> to introduce and conclude each mission.

As Baz, the player searches for Reg and Tel. Timmy, a Smartie rescued in the first mission, functions as a guide for the player, introducing other Smartie characters and providing <a href="exposition%20%28literary%20technique%29">exposition</a> of the scenario. The plot portrays the Smarties as suffering under the reign of the Sea Reapers and their Queen <a href="Sappho">Sappho</a>. Alluding to the film "<a href="The%20Magnificent%20Seven">The Magnificent Seven</a>", Baz gathers the separated Meccaryns and takes on a <a href="quest%20%28gaming%29">quest</a> to solve the Smarties' predicaments. In a <a href="Climax%20%28narrative%29">climactic</a> cut scene, Sappho sacrifices Timmy to Kabuto, and the young Smartie's grandfather, Borjoyzee, becomes the player's guide. Baz leads an escape from the area and sets up a base to lead a counterattack. Thereafter Delphi becomes the player's character. Yan, the <a href="Samurai">Samurai</a> Smartie, serves as the guide for this story segment, giving instructions on Delphi's abilities. After completing the training missions under Yan, Delphi attacks Sappho's base and the Reapers, eventually confronting the queen in a <a href="boss%20%28video%20games%29">boss</a> fight. When defeated, Sappho summons Kabuto to destroy the Smarties, but Kabuto eats her instead.

In the final story, Delphi has transformed herself into a Kabuto-like creature to challenge the original. The player wanders around the islands as the Delphi-Kabuto character, searching for prey to increase her size. After Delphi-Kabuto achieves her maximum size, she proceeds to a boss fight with the original Kabuto. Despite her victory, Kabuto revives in a triggered cut scene and restores her Reaper form, whereupon the player takes the role of Baz against the revived monster. After defeating Kabuto, Baz is shown in the final cut scene, flying off to Planet Majorca with Delphi, Borjoyzee, and his fellow Meccaryns.

When five members of <a href="Shiny%20Entertainment">Shiny Entertainment</a>'s "<a href="MDK%20%28video%20game%29">MDK</a>" development team broke off to set up <a href="Planet%20Moon%20Studios">Planet Moon Studios</a> in 1997 with <a href="Software%20engineering">software engineer</a>, Scott Guest, they decided to make their first project fun and original, a game with graphics and gameplay unseen at that time. <a href="Nick%20Bruty">Nick Bruty</a>, Bob Stevenson, and Tim Williams initially conceived the idea of pitting players as spacemen, pirates, and giants against each other and having fun. Initially projected for release in late 1999, the game suffered delays to its development largely due to the illness of their chief <a href="programmer">programmer</a>, Andy Astor; he was suffering from stage IV <a href="mantle%20cell%20lymphoma">mantle cell lymphoma</a> in late 1999. The team realized they needed more resources and by 2000, they had hired two more programmers and an artist. Producing a next-generation game required them to keep up with 1998â2000's rapid advancement of technology, which resulted in further delays. The team upsized the <a href="Texture%20mapping">graphic textures</a> as they changed the graphical software to support <a href="NVIDIA">NVIDIA</a> <a href="Video%20card">graphics cards</a>. Within a year after development started in 1999, the initial minimum graphics specification climbed from requiring graphics cards to those of the <a href="GeForce">GeForce-series</a>. Planet Moon deemed <a href="game%20engine">game engine</a>s available during development too restrictive and inappropriate for their requirements, and built their own. Called Amityville, it could support <a href="Glide%20API">Glide</a>, <a href="OpenGL">OpenGL</a>, and <a href="Direct3D">Direct3D</a>. The team used it to create the required "lush and vibrant" outdoor environments, and terrain deformation effects.

Planet Moon designed the structure of the single-player mode to be a gradual learning process for the players; the game would introduce new command sets to the players as they progress, and encourage them to repeat using the new commands for that mission. From the start of the project, the team intended the controls to be simple, and mapped commonly used commands to a few keys. <a href="Focus%20group">Focus group</a>s consisting more than 25 testers went through this design to verify its ease. Planet Moon aimed for a complex <a href="Game%20artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI); <a href="non-player%20characters">computer-controlled characters</a> would evade shots and take cover. The enemy AI would plot its actions according to long-term goals. The development team consulted Mark Frohnmayer, lead programmer of the multiplayer game "<a href="Tribes%202">Tribes 2</a>", for advice on implementing the multiplayer portion. To <a href="game%20balance">balance</a> the characters in combat, Planet Moon focused on characteristics that could affect the fighting capabilities, instead of tweaking the damage output. The team faced a tight schedule, and abandoned several features initially in the game. Early designs allowed players to change the landscape; they could gorge out water channels and isolate segments of the land by playing as Reapers. The Kabuto character initially could bake mud into "mud shepherd" units and use them to defend its herd of food.

<a href="Interplay%20Entertainment">Interplay Entertainment</a> released the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Windows</a> version of the game on December 7, 2000. Planet Moon later created a special version of the game optimized for the graphics card to display water reflections, soft-edged shadows, and weather effects. This version was not sold as a standalone commercial product but as a part of certain GeForceÂ 3 graphic card <a href="Product%20bundling">package deal</a>s. <a href="MacPlay">MacPlay</a> announced on November 1, 2000, it was publishing the version of the game. <a href="The%20Omni%20Group">The Omni Group</a> was responsible for the <a href="Porting%23Porting%20in%20gaming">porting</a> of the game; they rewrote the game's <a href="source%20code">software</a> to take advantage of the symmetric multi-processing capability of Mac OSÂ X. Eleven months later, MacPlay released the port. Multiplayer mode was initially disabled in the retail release but was re-inserted in a later <a href="patch%20%28computing%29">patch</a>. "Giants" was also ported to the (PS2), a process overseen by Interplay's division, Digital Mayhem, who posted updates of their progress on <a href="IGN">IGN</a>. Their greatest challenge for the PS2 port was converting and storing the <a href="special%20effects">special effects</a> of the Windows version onto the lesser storage space of the PS2. <a href="LightWave%203D">LightWave 3D</a> was used by the team to convert the graphic resources. Although they had to reduce the <a href="image%20resolution">image resolution</a>, Digital Mayhem increased the number of <a href="Polygons%23In%20computer%20graphics">polygons</a> that composed the player character <a href="3D%20modeling">models</a>, making them smoother and more detailed in shape. Due to the limited capabilities of the PS2 as compared to the Windows platform and the addition of a <a href="Saved%20game">save feature</a>, the team focused on enhancing the action gameplay, streamlining the interfaces, and tweaking the Reaper ski races, level designs, and game balance. They redesigned the controls for the <a href="DualShock%23DualShock%202">PS2's controller</a>, and after finding the <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a>s less easy to aim with than a mouse, implemented a feature to help the player's aim. Digital Mayhem originally intended to retain the multiplayer mode, but discarded it, believing the PS2 environment could not generate the same multiplayer atmosphere as the Windows platform. Interplay released the PS2 port on December 21, 2001. They also announced plans for an <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> port but nothing resulted from this.

Near the release of the United States (US) Windows version of the game, Planet Moon failed to obtain a "Teen" rating from the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">ESRB</a> despite changing the original red blood to green and covering Delphi's <a href="toplessness">toplessness</a> with a bikini top. They made the changes to broaden retail opportunities because many large <a href="Retailing">retailers</a> in the US refused to sell "Mature"-rated games; <a href="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> reiterated in October 2002 that they would never stock their shelves with software that contained vulgarity or nudity. Planet Moon Studios later released a patch that reverted the color of the blood to red, and computer gamers found they could restore Delphi's toplessness by deleting a file.

Interplay offered a bonus disc containing extra multiplayer levels to those who pre-ordered the Windows version of the game. On October 5, 2003, they offered the game's soundtrack to those who purchased "Giants" from their online store. <a href="Composer">Composer</a>s <a href="Mark%20Snow">Mark Snow</a> (noted for his "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" <a href="Sheet%20music">musical scores</a>), <a href="Mark%20Morgan%20%28composer%29">Mark Morgan</a>, and <a href="Jeremy%20Soule">Jeremy Soule</a> (both known for the music of several video games) were involved in the music for "Giants". Interplay hired Morgan to compose the scores, although reports showed they initially hired Snow for the task. Morgan, however, could not fully concentrate on the task due to personal reasons and handed it over to Soule. <a href="Closing%20credits">Closing credits</a> of the game listed only Morgan and Soule, and Soule compiled their works onto the original soundtrack of the game. Soule originally offered to autograph the soundtrack on its release in the United States; however, he stopped his offer when email feedback revealed many were intending to <a href="Copyright%20infringement">pirate</a> his work through the <a href="peer-to-peer">peer-to-peer</a> <a href="file%20sharing">file sharing</a> software <a href="Napster">Napster</a> instead of buying it. 

Planet Moon Studios' blending of two <a href="genre">genre</a>s in "Giants" has earned the acclaim of reviewers. <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> and <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> found the simplified <a href="real-time%20strategy">real-time strategy</a> task of resource gathering in "Giants" more interesting than tedious, and Troy Dunniway, Microsoft's Head of Game Design in 2002, commented that the real-time strategy elements enhanced the game's <a href="Shooter%20game">shooter</a> aspect rather than making it a hybrid of two genres. "<a href="Sci%20Fi%20Weekly">Sci Fi Weekly</a>" was impressed that both styles of play never interfered with each other, which was complemented by the unique gameplay of each race. The Entertainment Depot, however, found the base building in several missions tedious; they said the player had to rebuild the base several times due to being forced to leave the base defenseless, which allowed the enemy destroy the structures.

Reviewers commented that the imaginative character designs and use of advanced graphics technology, such as <a href="Transform%2C%20clipping%2C%20and%20lighting">hardware transform and lighting</a>, and <a href="bump%20mapping">bump mapping</a>, made the graphics of the game unrivaled in its time; ActionTrip was so impressed by the game's visuals that they thought their graphics card was supporting the complex hardware environmental bump mapping it was incapable of. The animation of Kabuto's antics such as <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Elbow%20drop">elbow dropping</a> onto tiny enemies, and tossing up and catching food with his mouth, in particular, won the praises of reviewers. Many critics, however, were disappointed that the computer versions of the game could not run smoothly at full details on the recommended system specifications.

The AI in the game was also the subject of much commentary. Reviewers said they needed to prompt the allied <a href="non-player%20characters">non-player characters</a> to perform actions on several occasions, although the allied AI performed pretty well most of the time. FiringSquad disagreed, calling their computer controlled teammates worthless and finding joy in leaving them to their deaths. The game review site thought the same of the enemy AI, a view echoed by <a href="IGN">IGN</a>; enemies were unaware of the deaths of nearby teammates, and kept running into obstacles. ActionTrip, however, stated the enemy AI did well enough to take cover or flee when hurt, and constantly attack the player's base.

Many reviewers found the best part of "Giants" to be its bawdy humor; the scenes were "bizarre and funny without ever letting the silliness distract or annoy the player". FiringSquad claimed the humor kept them plowing through the game regardless of the issues they encountered, and were disappointed when the game steadily lost this approach in the later stages. Mac Guild and "<a href="Macworld">Macworld UK</a>", however, considered the humor crude on a childlike level and its delivery forced. In spite of the humor, many reviewers found themselves bored by the monotony and slow pace of certain segments, According to ActionTrip, "Giants" lacked a unique quality to capture attention, compared to its contemporaries such as "<a href="American%20McGee%27s%20Alice">American McGee's Alice</a>", "", and "<a href="Sea%20Dogs%20%28video%20game%29">Sea Dogs</a>".

The frequent <a href="crash%20%28computing%29">crashes</a> of the retail Windows versions infuriated many reviewers; Game Revolution censured Interplay for focusing on censoring the game for marketing purposes instead of testing for and fixing the software bugs before release. Several reviewers could not connect to multiplayer games due to failed connections or bugs. The reviewers who managed to play online, commented the games were fun, although they were occasionally disconnected or <a href="lag">lag</a>ged. GamesFirst lamented the lack of dedicated low <a href="ping%20%28video%20gaming%29">ping</a> <a href="Game%20server">servers</a>, and several reviewers declared that the computer versions of the game was flawed for not implementing an in-game save feature.

Reviewers appreciated the PS2 version for including the asked-for save feature, but complained the ported game retained the AI and level design issues associated with the Windows version. IGN remarked that it looked less impressive than the computer versions. The lower resolution, flat textures, washed out colors, and sparser environments made the game average looking. The PS2 version also exhibited <a href="clipping%20%28computer%20graphics%29">clipping</a> issues; character models and projectiles would pass through objects on occasion. The game reviewer, however, praised the console version for presenting a smooth animation, rarely <a href="frame%20rate">dropping frames</a>. On the contrary, other reviewers stated the frame rate dropped when there are several objects on the screen, presenting a heavy load on the graphics engine. The lack of replay value for the console version after completing the single player mode was a common complaint among the reviewers.

<a href="Review%20aggregator">Review aggregator</a>s <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> and <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> calculated scores of 85 and 86.7% from their selected reviews for "Giants" as of 2007. Although most critics had awarded high scores to the game, <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> and GSoundtracks reported the Windows version sold poorly. In contrast, the Mac OSÂ X version sold out within months of its release, in spite of its smaller market base. According to the quarterly sales reports by <a href="NPD%20Group">NPDFunWorld</a>, the PS2 version sold 11,272Â copies in the US for the six months since its release. This is a poor sales figure compared to the 51,726Â copies of "<a href="Shadow%20Hearts">Shadow Hearts</a>" and 753,251Â copies of "<a href="Max%20Payne%20%28video%20game%29">Max Payne</a>" sold in the same period for the PS2. Despite the poor overall sales, reviewers have nominated "Giants" as a game deserving a sequel, and have kept it on "<a href="PC%20Gamer%23PC%20Gamer%20UK">PC Gamer UK</a>"s TopÂ 100 as of 2007. In 2009, Andrew Groen of GameZone ran a retrospective on "Giants" and suggested that the game's mix of humor and action inspired later games such as "<a href="Ratchet%20%26amp%3B%20Clank">Ratchet & Clank</a>" and "<a href="Jak%20and%20Daxter">Jak and Daxter</a>". He further commented that games of 2004â09 were influenced by "Giants" in one way or another. 

On September 25, 2015, the independent studio <a href="Rogue%20Rocket%20Games">Rogue Rocket Games</a>, co-founded by <a href="Nick%20Bruty">Nick Bruty</a>, former Planet Moon Studios founder, started a <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> campaign for developing a new independent crowd-funded game said to be "the spiritual successor of "Giants: Citizen Kabuto"", titled "First Wonder".

As of February 2016, the Kickstarter did not reach its goal and the spiritual successor was cancelled, despite being <a href="Steam%20Greenlight">Greenlit on Steam</a>.

William M. Branham

William Marrion Branham (April 6, 1909 â December 24, 1965) was an American Christian minister and <a href="Faith%20healing">faith healer</a> who initiated the postâ<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> <a href="Healing%20Revival">healing revival</a>. He left a lasting impact on <a href="televangelism">televangelism</a> and the modern <a href="Charismatic%20movement">Charismatic movement</a> and is recognized as the "principal architect of restorationist thought" for Charismatics by some Christian historians. At the time they were held, his inter-denominational meetings were the largest religious meetings ever held in some American cities. Branham was the first American <a href="Deliverance%20ministry">deliverance minister</a> to successfully campaign in Europe; his ministry reached global audiences with major campaigns held in North America, Europe, Africa, and India.

Branham claimed to have received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry and launching his campaigning career in mid-1946. His fame spread rapidly as crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitations and reports of miracles happening at his meetings. His ministry spawned many emulators and set in motion the broader healing revival that later became the modern Charismatic movement. From 1955, Branham's campaigning and popularity began to decline as the <a href="Pentecostal">Pentecostal</a> churches began to withdraw their support from the healing campaigns for primarily financial reasons. By 1960, Branham transitioned into a teaching ministry.

Unlike his contemporaries, who followed doctrinal teachings known as the <a href="Full%20Gospel">Full Gospel</a> tradition, Branham developed an alternate theology that was primarily a mixture of <a href="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> and <a href="Arminianism">Arminian</a> doctrines, and had a heavy focus on <a href="dispensationalism">dispensationalism</a> and Branham's own unique <a href="Eschatology">eschatological</a> views. While widely accepting the <a href="Restorationism">restoration</a> doctrine he espoused during the healing revival, his divergent post-revival teachings were deemed increasingly controversial by his Charismatic and Pentecostal contemporaries, who subsequently disavowed many of the doctrines as "revelatory madness". Many of his followers, however, accepted his sermons as oral scripture and refer to his teachings as The Message. In 1963, Branham preached a sermon in which he indicated he was a prophet with the anointing of <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a>, who had come to herald <a href="Second%20Coming">Christ's second coming</a>. Some followers of his teachings placed him at the center of a <a href="cult%20of%20personality">cult of personality</a> during his final years. Branham claimed to have made over one million converts during his career. His teachings continue to be promoted through the William Branham Evangelistic Association, who reported in 2018 that about 2 million people receive their material. Branham died following a car accident in 1965.

William M. Branham was born near <a href="Burkesville%2C%20Kentucky">Burkesville, Kentucky</a>, on April 6, 1909, the son of Charles and Ella Harvey Branham, the oldest of ten children. He claimed that at his birth, a "Light come whirling through the window, about the size of a pillow, and circled around where I was, and went down on the bed". Branham told his publicist <a href="Gordon%20Lindsay">Gordon Lindsay</a> that he had mystical experiences from an early age; and that at age three he heard a "voice" speaking to him from a tree telling him "he would live near a city called New Albany". According to Branham, that year his family moved to <a href="Jeffersonville%2C%20Indiana">Jeffersonville, Indiana</a>. Branham also said that when he was seven years old, God told him to avoid smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages. Branham stated he never violated the command.

Branham's father was an alcoholic, and he grew up in "deep poverty" much like their neighbors. As a child, he would often wear a coat held closed only by safety pins, without a shirt underneath. Branham's neighbors reported him as "someone who always seemed a little different", but said he was a dependable youth. His tendency towards "mystical experiences and moral purity" caused misunderstandings among his friends, family, and other young people; he was a "<a href="black%20sheep">black sheep</a>" from an early age. Branham called his childhood "a terrible life."

At 19, Branham left home seeking a better life. He traveled to <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, where he worked for two years on a ranch and began a successful career in boxing. He returned to Jeffersonville when his brother died in 1929. Branham had no experience with religion as a child; he said the first time he heard a prayer was at his brother's funeral. Soon after, while working for the <a href="Public%20Service%20Company%20of%20Indiana">Public Service Company of Indiana</a>, Branham was almost killed when he was overcome by gas. While recovering from the accident, he said he again heard a voice leading him to begin seeking God. He began attending a local <a href="Independent%20Baptist">Independent Baptist</a> church, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville, where he converted to Christianity. Six months later he was ordained as an Independent Baptist minister. His early ministry was an "impressive success"; he quickly attracted a small group of followers, who helped obtain a tent in which he could hold a revival.

At the time of Branham's conversion, the First Pentecostal Baptist Church of Jeffersonville was a nominally Baptist church that observed some Pentecostal doctrines, including <a href="faith%20healing">divine healing</a>. As a result, he may have been exposed to some Pentecostal teachings from his conversion. He was first exposed to a Pentecostal denominational church in 1936, which invited him to join, but he refused.

During June 1933, Branham held revival meetings in his tent. On June 2 that year, the "<a href="News%20and%20Tribune">Jeffersonville Evening News</a>" said the Branham campaign reported 14 converts. His followers believed his ministry was accompanied by miraculous signs from its beginning, and that when he was baptizing converts on June 11, 1933 in the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> near Jeffersonville, a bright light descended over him and that he heard a voice say, "As John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Jesus Christ, so your message will forerun His second coming". Belief in the baptismal story is a critical element of faith among Branham's followers. Branham initially interpreted this in reference to the restoration of the <a href="Spiritual%20gift">gifts of the spirit</a> to the church and made regular references to the baptismal story from the earliest days of the healing revival. In later years, Branham also connected the story to his teaching ministry. Baptist historian <a href="Doug%20Weaver%20%28Author%29">Doug Weaver</a> said Branham may have embellished the baptismal story when he was achieving success in the healing revival.

Following his June tent meeting, Branham's supporters helped him organize a new church, the Branham Tabernacle, in Jeffersonville. Branham served as pastor from 1933 to 1946. The church flourished at first but its growth began to slow. Because of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> it was often short of funds, so Branham served without compensation. Branham believed the stagnation of the church's growth was a punishment from God for his failure to embrace Pentecostalism. Branham married Amelia Hope Brumbach (b. July 16, 1913) in 1934, and they had two children; William "Billy" Paul Branham (b. September 13, 1935) and Sharon Rose Branham (b. October 27, 1936). Branham's wife died on July 22, 1937, and their daughter died four days later (July 26, 1937), shortly after the <a href="Ohio%20River%20flood%20of%201937">Ohio River flood of 1937</a>. Branham interpreted their deaths as God's punishment for his continued resistance to holding revivals for the <a href="Oneness%20Pentecostalism">Oneness Pentecostals</a>.

Branham married Meda Marie Broy in 1941, and together they had three children; Rebekah (b. 1946), Sarah (b. 1950), and Joseph (b. 1955).

Branham is known for his role in the <a href="healing%20revival">healing revival</a>s that occurred in the United States in the 1940s and 1950s, and most participants in the movement regarded him as its initiator. Christian writer John Crowder described the period of revivals as "the most extensive public display of miraculous power in modern history". Some, like Christian author and countercult activist <a href="Hank%20Hanegraaff">Hank Hanegraaff</a>, rejected the entire healing revival as a hoax and condemned the evangelical and Charismatic movements as cults. Divine healing is a tradition and belief that was historically held by a majority of Christians but it became increasingly associated with Evangelical Protestantism. The fascination of most of American Christianity with divine healing played a significant role in the popularity and inter-denominational nature of the revival movement.

Branham held massive inter-denominational meetings, from which came reports of hundreds of miracles. Historian <a href="David%20Edwin%20Harrell">David Harrell</a> described Branham and <a href="Oral%20Roberts">Oral Roberts</a> as the two giants of the movement and called Branham its "unlikely leader."

Branham held his first meetings as a <a href="Faith%20healing">faith healer</a> in 1946. His healing services are well documented, and he is regarded as the pacesetter for those who followed him. At the time they were held, Branham's revival meetings were the largest religious meetings some American cities he visited had ever seen; reports of 1,000 to 1,500 converts per meeting were common. Historians name his June 1946 <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a> meetings as the inauguration of the healing revival period. He said he had received an angelic visitation on May 7, 1946, commissioning his worldwide ministry. In his later years, in an attempt to link his ministry with the <a href="end%20time">end time</a>, he connected his vision with the establishment of the nation of Israel, at one point mistakenly stating the vision occurred on the same day.

His first revival meetings were held over 12 days during June 1946 in St. Louis. His first campaign manager, W. E. Kidston, was editor of "The Apostolic Herald" and had many contacts in the Pentecostal movement. Kidston was instrumental in helping organize Branham's early revival meetings. "<a href="Time%20Magazine">Time magazine</a>" reported on his St. Louis campaign meetings, and according to the article, Branham drew a crowd of over 4,000 sick people who desired healing and recorded him diligently praying for each. Branham's fame began to grow as a result of the publicity and reports covering his meetings. Following the St. Louis meetings, Branham launched a tour of small Oneness Pentecostal churches across the <a href="Midwest">Midwest</a> and southern United States, from which stemmed reports of healing and one report of a resurrection. By August his fame had spread widely. He held meetings that month in <a href="Jonesboro%2C%20Arkansas">Jonesboro, Arkansas</a> and drew a crowd of 25,000 with attendees from 28 different states. The size of the crowds presented a problem for Branham's team as they found it difficult to find venues that could seat large numbers of attendees.

Branham's revivals were interracial from their inception and were noted for their "racial openness" during the period of widespread racial unrest. An African American minister participating in the St. Louis meetings claimed to be healed during the revival, helping to bring Branham a sizable African American following from the early days of the revival. Dedicated to ministering to both races, Branham insisted on holding interracial meetings even in the southern states. To satisfy segregation laws when ministering in the south, Branham's team would use a rope to divide the crowd by race.

After holding a very successful revival meeting in <a href="Shreveport%2C%20Louisiana">Shreveport</a> during mid-1947, Branham began assembling an evangelical team that stayed with him for most of the revival period. The first addition to the team was <a href="Jack%20Moore%20%28preacher%29">Jack Moore</a> and Young Brown, who periodically assisted him in managing his meetings. Following the Shreveport meetings, Branham held a series of meetings in <a href="San%20Antonio">San Antonio</a>, Phoenix, and at various locations in California. Moore invited his friend Gordon Lindsay to join the campaign team, which he did beginning at a meeting in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>, in late 1947. Lindsay was a successful publicist and manager for Branham, and played a key role in helping him gain national and international recognition.In 1948, Branham and Lindsay founded "<a href="Voice%20of%20Healing">Voice of Healing</a>" magazine, which was originally aimed at reporting Branham's healing campaigns. Lindsay was impressed with Branham's focus on humility and unity, and was instrumental in helping him gain acceptance among <a href="Trinitarian">Trinitarian</a> and Oneness Pentecostal groups by expanding his revival meetings beyond the <a href="United%20Pentecostal%20Church">United Pentecostal Church</a> to include all of the major Pentecostal groups.

The first meetings organized by Lindsay were held in northwestern North America during late 1947. At the first of these meetings, held in <a href="Vancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia">Vancouver, British Columbia</a>, Canadian minister <a href="Ern%20Baxter">Ern Baxter</a> joined Branham's team. Lindsay reported 70,000 attendees to the 14 days of meetings and long prayer lines as Branham prayed for the sick. William Hawtin, a Canadian Pentecostal minister, attended one of Branham's Vancouver meetings in November 1947 and was impressed by Branham's healings. Branham thus became an influence on the <a href="Latter%20Rain%20%28post-World%20War%20II%20movement%29">Latter Rain</a> revival movement, which Hawtin helped initiate. In January 1948, meetings were held in Florida; <a href="F.%20F.%20Bosworth">F. F. Bosworth</a> met Branham at the meetings and also joined his team. Bosworth was among the pre-eminent ministers of the Pentecostal movement and lent great weight to Branham's campaign team. He remained a strong Branham supporter until his death in 1958. Bosworth endorsed Branham as "the most sensitive person to the presence and working of the Holy Spirit" he had ever met. During early 1947, a major campaign was held in <a href="Kansas%20City">Kansas City</a>, where Branham and Lindsay first met Oral Roberts. Roberts and Branham had contact at different points during the revival. Roberts said Branham was "set apart, just like Moses".

Branham spent many hours ministering and praying for the sick during his campaigns, and like many other leading evangelists of the time he suffered <a href="exhaustion">exhaustion</a>. After one year of campaigning, his exhaustion began leading to health issues. Attendees reported seeing him "staggering from intense fatigue" during his last meetings. Just as Branham began to attract international attention in May 1948, he announced that due to illness he would have to halt his campaign. His illness shocked the growing movement, and his abrupt departure from the field caused a rift between him and Lindsay over the "Voice of Healing" magazine. Branham insisted that Lindsay take over complete management of the publication. With the main subject of the magazine no longer actively campaigning, Lindsay was forced to seek other ministers to promote. He decided to publicize Oral Roberts during Branham's absence, and Roberts quickly rose to prominence, in large part due to Lindsay's coverage.

Branham partially recovered from his illness and resumed holding meetings in October 1948; in that month he held a series of meetings around the United States without Lindsay's support. Branham's return to the movement led to his resumed leadership of it. In November 1948, he met with Lindsay and Moore and told them he had received another angelic visitation, instructing him to hold a series of meetings across the United States and then to begin holding meetings internationally. As a result of the meeting, Lindsay rejoined Branham's campaigning team.

Most revivalists of the era were flamboyant but Branham was usually calm and spoke quietly, only occasionally raising his voice. His preaching style was described as "halting and simple", and crowds were drawn to his stories of angelic visitation and "constant communication with God". He refused to discuss controversial doctrinal issues during the early years of his campaigns, and issued a policy statement that he would only minister on the "great evangelical truths". He insisted his calling was to bring unity among the different churches he was ministering to and to urge the churches to return to the roots of early Christianity.

In the first part of his meetings, one of Branham's companion evangelists would preach a sermon. Ern Baxter or F. F. Bosworth usually filled this role, but other ministers also participated in Branham's campaigns. Baxter generally focused on bible teaching; Bosworth counseled supplicants on the need for faith and the doctrine of divine healing. Following their build-up, Branham would take the podium and deliver a short sermon, in which he usually related stories about his personal life experiences. After completing his sermon, he would proceed with a prayer line where he would pray for the sick. Branham would often request God to "confirm his message with two-or-three faith inspired miracles". His campaign manager organized the prayer line, sending supplicants forward to be prayed for on stage individually. Branham generally prayed for a few people each night and believed witnessing the results on the stage would inspire faith in the audience and permit them to experience similar results without having to be personally prayed for. Describing Branham's method, Bosworth said "he does not begin to pray for the healing of the afflicted in body in the healing line each night until God anoints him for the operation of the gift, and until he is conscious of the presence of the Angel with him on the platform. Without this consciousness he seems to be perfectly helpless."

Branham told audiences the angel that commissioned his ministry had given him two signs by which they could prove his commission. He described the first sign as vibrations he felt in his hand when he touched a sick person's hand, which communicated to him the nature of the illness, but did not guarantee healing. Branham's use of what his fellow evangelists called a <a href="word%20of%20knowledge">word of knowledge</a> gift separated him from his contemporaries. This second sign did not appear in his campaigns until after his recovery in 1948, and was used to "amaze tens of thousands" at his meetings. According to Bosworth, this gift of knowledge allowed Branham "to see and enable him to tell the many events of [people's] lives from their childhood down to the present". This caused many in the healing revival to view Branham as a "seer like the old testament prophets". Branham amazed even fellow evangelists, which served to further push him into a legendary status in the movement. Branham's audiences were often awestruck by the events during his meetings. At the peak of his popularity in the 1950s, Branham was widely adored and "the neo-Pentecostal world believed Branham to be a prophet to their generation".

Branham faced criticism and opposition from the early days of the healing campaign. According to historian Ronald Kydd, Branham evoked strong opinions from people with whom he came into contact; "most people either loved him or hated him". In 1947, Rev. Alfred Pohl, a minister in <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, Canada, stated that many people Branham pronounced as healed later died. A year later, W. J. Taylor, a district superintendent with the <a href="Pentecostal%20Assemblies%20of%20Canada">Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada</a>, raised the same concern and asked for a thorough investigation. Taylor presented evidence that claims of the number of people healed were vastly overestimated. He stated, "there is a possibility that this whole thing is wrong". The number of people who claimed to be healed in Branham's campaign meetings "is impossible to approximate" and the numbers vary greatly between sources. According to Kydd, by watching films of the revival meetings, "the viewer would assume almost everyone was healed" but the results proved otherwise the few times follow-up was made. No consistent record of follow-ups was made, making analysis of the claims difficult to subsequent researchers. Pentecostal historian <a href="Walter%20Hollenweger">Walter Hollenweger</a> said, "very few were actually healed". Some attendees of Branham's meetings believed the healings were a hoax and accused him of selectively choosing who could enter the prayer line. Some people left his meetings disappointed after finding Branham's conviction that everyone in the audience could be healed without being in the prayer line proved incorrect. Branham generally attributed the failure of supplicants to receive healing to their lack of faith.

The "word of knowledge" gift was likewise subject to much criticism. Hollenweger investigated Branham's use of the "word of knowledge gift" and found no instances in which Branham was mistaken in his often-detailed pronouncements. Criticism of Branham's use of this gift was primarily around its nature; some accused him of <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a> and <a href="telepathy">telepathy</a>. Branham was openly confronted with such criticisms and rejected the assertions.

In January 1950, Branham's campaign team held their <a href="Houston">Houston</a> campaign, one of the most significant series of meetings of the revival. The location of their first meeting was too small to accommodate the approximately 8,000 attendees, and they had to relocate to the <a href="Sam%20Houston%20Coliseum">Sam Houston Coliseum</a>. On the night of January 24, 1950, Branham was photographed during a debate between Bosworth and local Baptist minister W. E. Best regarding the theology of divine healing. Bosworth argued in favor, while Best argued against. The photograph showed a light above Branham's head, which he and his associates believed to be supernatural. The photograph became well-known in the revival movement and is regarded by Branham's followers as an iconic relic. Branham believed the light was a divine vindication of his ministry; others believed it was a glare from the venue's overhead lighting.

In January 1951, U.S. Congressman <a href="William%20David%20Upshaw">William Upshaw</a>, who had been crippled for 59 years as the result of an accident, said he was miraculously healed and had regained the ability to walk in a Branham meeting, further fueling Branham's fame. Upshaw sent a letter describing his healing claim to each member of Congress. Among the widespread media reports was a story in the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" that described it as "perhaps the most effective healing testimony this generation has ever seen". Upshaw died in November 1952, at the age of 86.

Branham's meetings were regularly attended by journalists, who wrote articles about the miracles reported by Branham and his team throughout the years of his revivals, and claimed patients were cured of various ailments after attending prayer meetings with Branham. "Durban Sunday Tribune" and "<a href="The%20Mercury%20%28South%20Africa%29">The Natal Mercury</a>" reported wheelchair-bound people rising and walking. "<a href="Winnipeg%20Free%20Press">Winnipeg Free Press</a>" reported a girl was cured of deafness. "<a href="El%20Paso%20Herald-Post">El Paso Herald-Post</a>" reported hundreds of attendees at one meeting seeking divine healing. "Logansport Press" reported a father's claim that his four-year-old son, who suffered from a "rare brain ailment", benefited from Branham's meetings. Despite such occasional glowing reports, most of the press coverage Branham received was negative.

According to Hollenweger, "Branham filled the largest stadiums and meeting halls in the world" during his five major international campaigns. Branham held his first series of campaigns in Europe during April 1950 with meetings in Finland, Sweden, and Norway. Attendance at the meetings generally exceeded 7,000 despite resistance to his meetings by the state churches. In Norway, the Directorate of Health forbade Branham from laying hands on the sick and sent police to his meetings to enforce the order. Branham was the first American deliverance minister to successfully tour in Europe. A 1952 campaign in South Africa had the largest attendance in Branham's career, with an estimated 200,000 attendees. According to Lindsay, the altar call at his Durban meeting received 30,000 converts. During international campaigns in 1954, Branham visited Portugal, Italy, and India. Branham's final major overseas tour in 1955 included visits to Switzerland and Germany.

In 1955, Branham's campaigning career began to slow following financial setbacks. Even after he became famous, Branham continued to wear inexpensive suits and refused large salaries; he was not interested in amassing wealth as part of his ministry and was reluctant to solicit donations during his meetings. During the early years of his campaigns, donations had been able to cover costs, but from 1955, donations failed to cover the costs of three successive campaigns, one of which incurred a $15,000 deficit. Some of Branham's business associates thought he was partially responsible because of his lack of interest in the financial affairs of the campaigns and tried to hold him personally responsible for the debt. Branham briefly stopped campaigning and said he would have to take a job to repay the debt, but the <a href="Full%20Gospel%20Business%20Men%27s%20Fellowship%20International">Full Gospel Business Men's Fellowship International</a> ultimately offered financial assistance to cover the debt. Branham became increasingly reliant on the Full Gospel Businessmen to finance his campaign meetings as the Pentecostal denominations began to withdraw their financial support.

Finances became an issue again in 1956 when the <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Service">Internal Revenue Service</a> (IRS) charged Branham with tax evasion. The American government targeted the other leading revivalists with lawsuits during the same time period, including Oral Roberts, <a href="Jack%20Coe">Jack Coe</a>, and <a href="A.%20A.%20Allen">A. A. Allen</a>. The IRS asserted income reported by the ministers as non-taxable gifts was taxable. Except Allen, who won his legal battle, the evangelists settled their cases out of court. The IRS investigation showed Branham did not pay close attention to the amount of money flowing through his ministry. It also revealed that others were taking advantage of him. Branham's annual salary was $7,000 while his manager's was $80,000. Oral Roberts earned a salary of $15,000 in the same years. The case was eventually settled out of court with the payment of a $40,000 penalty. Branham was never able to completely pay off the debt. Amid the financial issues, Lindsay left Branham's campaign team. Branham eventually criticized the "Voice of Healing" magazine as a "massive financial organization" that put making money ahead of promoting good.

By the mid-1950s, dozens of the ministers associated with Branham and his campaigns had launched similar healing campaigns. In 1956, the healing revival reached its peak, as 49 separate evangelists held major meetings. Through the "Voice of Healing" magazine, Branham and Lindsay ineffectively attempted to discourage their activities by saying Branham wished they would help their local churches rather than launch national careers. The swelling number of competitors and emulators further reduced attendance at Branham's meetings. His correspondence also decreased sharply; whereas he had once received "a thousand letters a day", his mail dropped to 75 letters a day but Branham thought the decline was temporary. He continued expecting something greater, which he said "nobody will be able to imitate". In 1955, he reported a vision of a renewed tent ministry and a "third pull which would be dramatically different" than his earlier career.

Among Branham's emulators was <a href="Jim%20Jones">Jim Jones</a>, the founder and leader of the <a href="Peoples%20Temple">Peoples Temple</a>. Seeking a means to catapult his fame and earn followers, he invited Branham to a self-organized religious convention held at the <a href="Cadle%20Tabernacle">Cadle Tabernacle</a> auditorium in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> from June 11 to 15, 1956. To draw the crowds he was seeking, Jones needed a religious headliner and arranged to share the platform with Branham. Branham critics Peter Duyzer and John Collins reported that Branham "performed numerous miracles", drawing a crowd of 11,000. Jones later became known for the <a href="Jonestown%20Massacre">mass murder and suicide at Jonestown</a> in November 1978. According to Collins, Jim Jones and <a href="Paul%20Sch%C3%A4fer">Paul SchÃ¤fer</a> were influenced to move to South America by Branham's 1961 prophecy concerning Armageddon. Collins and Duyzer concluded that Jones did not "see eye-to-eye" with Branham and that Jones did not believe Branham was honest.

By 1960, the number of evangelists holding national campaigns dropped to 11. Several perspectives on the decline of the healing revival have been offered. Crowder suggested Branham's gradual separation from Gordon Lindsay played a major part in the decline. Harrell attributed the decline to the increasing number of evangelists crowding the field and straining the financial resources of the Pentecostal denominations. Weaver agreed Pentecostal churches gradually withdrew their support for the healing revival, mainly over the financial stresses put on local churches by the healing campaigns. The <a href="Assemblies%20of%20God%20USA">Assemblies of God</a> were the first to openly withdraw support from the healing revival in 1953. Weaver pointed to other factors that may have helped destroy the initial ecumenism of the revival; tension between the independent evangelists and the Pentecostal churches caused by the evangelists' fund-raising methods, denominational pride, sensationalism, and doctrinal conflictsâparticularly between the Oneness and Trinitarian factions within Pentecostalism.

As the healing revival began to wane, many of Branham's contemporaries moved into the leadership of the emerging Charismatic movement, which emphasized use of spiritual gifts. The Charismatic movement is a global movement within both Protestant and non-Protestant Christianity that supports the adoption of traditionally Pentecostal beliefs, especially the spiritual gifts (charismata). The movement began in the teachings of the healing revival evangelists and grew as their teachings came to receive broad acceptance among millions of Christians. At the same time the Charismatic movement was gaining broad acceptance, Branham began to transition to a teaching ministry. He began speaking on the controversial doctrinal issues he had avoided for most of the revival. By the 1960s, Branham's contemporaries and the Pentecostal denominations that had supported his campaigns regarded him as an extremely controversial teacher. The leadership of the Pentecostal churches pressed Branham to resist his urge to teach and to instead focus on praying for the sick. Branham refused, arguing that the purpose of his healing ministry was to attract audiences and, having thus been attracted, it was time to teach them the doctrines he claimed to have received through supernatural revelation. Branham argued that his entire ministry was divinely inspired and could not be selectively rejected or accepted, saying, "It's either all of God, or none of God".

At first, Branham taught his doctrines only within his own church at Jeffersonville, but beginning in the 1960s he began to preach them at other churches he visited. His criticisms of Pentecostal organizations, and especially his views on holiness and the role of women, led to his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement and the Pentecostals from whom he had originally achieved popularity. Branham acknowledged their rejection and said their organizations "had choked out the glory and Spirit of God". As a result of their view of his teachings, many Pentecostals judged that Branham had "stepped out of his anointing" and had become a "bad teacher of heretical doctrine".

Despite his rejection by the growing Charismatic movement, Branham's followers became increasingly dedicated to him during his later life; some even claimed he was the <a href="Messiah">Messiah</a>. Branham quickly condemned their belief as heresy and threatened to stop ministering, but the belief persisted. Many followers moved great distances to live near his home in Jeffersonville and, led by Leo Mercer, subsequently set up a colony in Arizona following Branham's move to <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson</a> in 1962. Branham lamented Mercer and the actions of his group as he worried that a cult was potentially being formed among his most fanatical followers.

Branham continued to travel to churches and preach his doctrine across North America during the 1960s. He held his final set of revival meetings in Shreveport at the church of his early campaign manager Jack Moore in November 1965.

Branham developed a unique theology and placed emphasis on a few key doctrines, including his <a href="eschatology">eschatological</a> views, <a href="annihilationism">annihilationism</a>, <a href="Oneness%20Pentecostalism">oneness of the Godhead</a>, <a href="predestination">predestination</a>, <a href="Perseverance%20of%20the%20saints">eternal security</a>, and the <a href="Serpent%20seed">serpent's seed</a>. His followers refer to his teachings collectively as "The Message". Kydd and Weaver have both referred to Branham's teachings as "Branhamology". Most of Branham's teachings have precedents within sects of the Pentecostal movement or in other non-Pentecostal denominations. The doctrines Branham imported from non-Pentecostal theology and the unique combination of doctrines that he created as a result led to widespread criticism from Pentecostal churches and the Charismatic movement. His unique arrangement of doctrines, coupled with the highly controversial nature of the serpent seed doctrine, caused the alienation of many of his former supporters.

The <a href="Full%20Gospel">Full Gospel</a> tradition, which has its roots in <a href="Arminianism%23Wesleyan%20Arminianism">Wesleyan Arminianism</a>, is the theology generally adhered to by the Charismatic movement and Pentecostal denominations. Branham's doctrines are a blend of both <a href="Calvinism">Calvinism</a> and <a href="Arminianism">Arminianism</a>, which are considered contradictory by many theologians. As a result, his theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally during the years of the healing revival. Many of his followers regard his sermons as oral scripture and believe Branham had rediscovered the true doctrines of the early church.

Throughout his ministry, Branham taught a doctrine of faith healing that was often the central teaching he espoused during the healing campaign. He believed healing was the main focus of the ministry of Jesus Christ and believed in a dual <a href="Atonement%20in%20Christianity">atonement</a>; "salvation for the soul and healing for the body". He believed and taught that miracles ascribed to Christ in the New Testament were also possible in modern times. Branham believed all sickness was a result of demonic activity and could be overcome by the faith of the person desiring healing. Branham argued that God was required to heal when faith was present. This led him to conclude that individuals who failed to be healed lacked adequate faith. Branham's teaching on divine healing were within the mainstream of Pentecostal theology and echoed the doctrines taught by <a href="Smith%20Wigglesworth">Smith Wigglesworth</a>, Bosworth, and other prominent Pentecostal ministers of the prior generation.

Annihilationism is a doctrinal conflict within Pentecostalism that first appeared within the movement in the teachings of <a href="Charles%20Fox%20Parham">Charles Fox Parham</a>. Not all Pentecostal sects accepted the teaching. Prior to 1957, Branham taught a doctrine of eternal punishment in hell. By 1957 he had adopted an annihilationist position in keeping with Parham's teachings. He began promoting the belief that punishment of the damned in Hell would not last for eternity and that eventually the damned would cease to exist. He believed that "eternal life was reserved only for God and his children". In 1960, Branham claimed the Holy Spirit had revealed this doctrine to him as one of the <a href="end-time">end-time</a> mysteries. Promoting annihilationism led to the alienation of Pentecostal groups that had rejected Parham's teaching on the subject.

Like other doctrines, the Godhead formula was a point of doctrinal conflict within Pentecostalism. As Branham began offering his own viewpoint, it led to the alienation of Pentecostal groups adhering to <a href="Trinitarianism">Trinitarianism</a>. Branham shifted his theological position on the <a href="Godhead%20in%20Christianity">Godhead</a> during his ministry. Early in his ministry, Branham espoused a position closer to an orthodox Trinitarian view. By the early 1950s, he began to privately preach the Oneness doctrine outside of his healing campaigns. By the 1960s, he had changed to openly teaching the Oneness position, according to which there is one God who <a href="Modalistic%20Monarchianism">manifests himself in multiple ways</a>; in contrast with the Trinitarian view that three distinct persons comprise the Godhead.

Branham came to believe that trinitarianism was <a href="tritheism">tritheism</a> and insisted members of his congregation be <a href="Baptism%20in%20the%20name%20of%20Jesus">re-baptized in Jesus's name</a> in imitation of <a href="Paul%20the%20Apostle">Paul the Apostle</a>. Branham believed his doctrine had a nuanced difference from the Oneness doctrine and to the end of his ministry he openly argued that he was not a proponent of Oneness doctrine. He distinguished his baptismal formula from the Oneness baptism formula in the name of Jesus by teaching that the baptismal formula should be in the name of Lord Jesus Christ. He argued that there were many people named Jesus but there is only one Lord Jesus Christ. By the end of his ministry, his message required an acceptance of the oneness of the Godhead and baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ.

Branham adopted and taught a <a href="Predestination%20in%20Calvinism">Calvinistic form of the doctrine of predestination</a> and openly supported Calvin's doctrine of Eternal Security, both of which were at odds with the <a href="Predestination%23Arminianism">Arminian view of predestination</a> held by Pentecostalism. Unlike his views on the Godhead and Annihilationism, there was no precedence within Pentecostalism for his views on predestination, and opened him to widespread criticism. Branham lamented that more so than any other teaching, Pentecostals criticized him for his predestination teachings. Branham believed the term "predestination" was widely misunderstood and preferred to use the word "foreknowledge" to describe his views.

As Branham's ministry progressed, he increasingly condemned modern culture. According to Weaver, Branham's views on modern culture were the primary reason the growing Charismatic movement rejected him; his views also prevented him from following his contemporaries who were transitioning from the healing revival to the new movement. He taught that immoral women and education were the central sins of modern culture and were a result of the serpent's seed. Branham viewed education as "Satan's snare for intellectual Christians who rejected the supernatural" and "Satan's tool for obscuring the 'simplicity of the Message and the messenger'". Weaver wrote that Branham held a "<a href="H.%20Richard%20Niebuhr">Christ against Culture</a>" opinion, according to which loyalty to Christ requires rejection of non-Christian culture; an opinion not unique to Branham.

Pentecostalism inherited the Wesleyan doctrine of <a href="entire%20sanctification">entire sanctification</a> and <a href="outward%20holiness">outward holiness</a> from its founders, who came from Wesleyan-influenced denominations of the post-<a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> era. The rigid moral code associated with the holiness movement had been widely accepted by Pentecostals in the early twentieth century. Branham's strict moral code echoed the traditions of early Pentecostalism but became increasingly unpopular because he refused to accommodate mid-century Pentecostalism's shifting viewpoint. He denounced cigarettes, alcohol, television, rock and roll, and many forms of worldly amusement.

Branham strongly identified with the lower-class roots of Pentecostalism and advocated an <a href="Asceticism%23Christianity">ascetic lifestyle</a>. When he was given a new <a href="Cadillac">Cadillac</a>, he kept it parked in his garage for two years out of embarrassment. Branham openly chastised other evangelists, who seemed to be growing wealthy from their ministries and opposed the prosperity messages being taught. Branham did not view financial prosperity as an automatic result of salvation. He rejected the <a href="prosperity%20gospel">prosperity gospel</a> that originated in the teachings of Oral Roberts and A. A. Allen. Branham condemned any emphasis on expensive church buildings, elaborate choir robes, and large salaries for ministers, and insisted the church should focus on the imminent return of Christ.

Branham's opposition to modern culture emerged most strongly in his condemnation of the "immorality of modern women". He taught that women with short hair were breaking God's commandments and according to Weaver, "ridiculed women's desire to artificially beautify themselves with makeup". Branham believed women were guilty of committing adultery if their appearance was intended to motivate men to lust, and viewed a woman's place as "in the kitchen". Citing the creation story in which Eve is taken from Adam's side, Branham taught that woman was a byproduct of man. According to Weaver, "his pronouncements with respect to women were often contradictory" and he regularly offered glowing praise of women. Weaver stated that Branham "once told women who wore shorts not to call themselves Christians" but qualified his denunciations by affirming that obedience to the <a href="outward%20holiness">holiness moral code</a> was not a requirement for salvation. Branham did not condemn women who refused the holiness moral code to Hell, but he insisted they would not be part of the <a href="rapture">rapture</a>.

Weaver wrote that Branham's attitude to women concerning physical appearance, sexual drive, and marital relations, was misogynistic, and that Branham saw modern women as "essentially immoral sexual machines who were to blame for adultery, divorce and death. They were the tools of the Devil." Some of Branham's contemporaries accused him of being a "woman hater", but he insisted he only hated immorality. According to Edward Babinski, women who follow the holiness moral code Branham supported regard it as "a badge of honor".

Branham taught an unorthodox doctrine of the source of <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>. He believed the story of the <a href="fall%20of%20man">fall of man</a> in the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a> is allegorical and interpreted it to mean the <a href="Serpent%20%28Bible%29">serpent</a> had sexual intercourse with Eve and that their offspring was <a href="Cain">Cain</a>. Branham taught that Cain's modern descendants were masquerading as educated people and scientists, and that Cain's descendants were "a big religious bunch of illegitimate bastard children" who comprised the majority of society's criminals. He believed the serpent was the <a href="Transitional%20fossil">missing link</a> between the <a href="Common%20chimpanzee">chimpanzee</a> and man, and speculated that the serpent was possibly a human-like giant. Branham held the belief that the serpent was transformed into a reptile after it was cursed by God. Weaver commented on Branham's interpretation of the story; "Consequently every woman potentially carried the literal seed of the devil".

Branham first spoke about original sin in 1958; he rejected the orthodox view of the subject and hinted at his own belief in a hidden meaning to the story. In later years, he made his opinion concerning the sexual nature of the fall explicitly known. Weaver wrote that Branham may have become acquainted with serpent's seed doctrine through his Baptist roots; <a href="Daniel%20Parker%20%28Baptist%29">Daniel Parker</a>, an American Baptist minister from Kentucky, promulgated a <a href="Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit%20Predestinarian%20Baptists">similar doctrine</a> in the mid-1800s. According to Pearry Green, Branham's teaching on the serpent's seed doctrine was viewed by the broader Pentecostal movement as the "filthy doctrineÂ ... that ruined his ministry". No other mainstream Christian group held a similar view; Branham was widely criticized for spreading the doctrine. His followers view the doctrine as one of his greatest revelations.

In 1960, Branham preached a series of sermons on the <a href="Seven%20churches%20of%20Asia">seven church ages</a> based on chapters two and three of the <a href="Book%20of%20Revelation">Book of Revelation</a>. The sermons closely aligned with the teachings of <a href="C.%20I.%20Scofield">C. I. Scofield</a> and <a href="Clarence%20Larkin">Clarence Larkin</a>, the leading proponents of dispensationalism in the preceding generation. Like Larkin and Scofield, Branham said each church represents a historical age, and taught that the angel of each age was a significant church figure. The message included the description of a messenger to the <a href="Laodicean%20Church">Laodicean Church</a> age, which Branham believed would immediately precede the rapture. Branham explained the Laodicean age would be immoral in a way comparable to <a href="Sodom%20and%20Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>, and it would be a time in which Christian denominations rejected Christ. As described by Branham, the characteristics of the Laodicean age resemble those of the modern era. Branham described the characteristics of the Laodicean messenger by comparing his traits to <a href="Elijah">Elijah</a> and <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>. He asserted the messenger would be a mighty prophet who put the Word of God first, that he would be a lover of the wilderness, that he would hate wicked women, and be an uneducated person. Branham claimed the messenger to this last age would come in the spirit of Elijah the prophet and cited the <a href="Book%20of%20Malachi">Book of Malachi</a> 4:5â6 as the basis for claiming the Elijah spirit would return. His belief in a "seventh church age messenger" came from his interpretation of the Book of Revelation 3:14â22.

Branham preached another sermon in 1963, further indicating he was a prophet who had the anointing of Elijah and was a messenger heralding the second coming of Christ. Branham did not directly claim to be the end-time messenger in either of his sermons. Weaver believed Branham desired to be the eschatological prophet he was preaching about, but had self-doubt. Branham left the identity of the messenger open to the interpretation of his followers, who widely accepted that he was that messenger.

Branham regarded his 1963 series of sermons on the <a href="Seven%20Seals">Seven Seals</a> as a highlight of his ministry. According to Weaver, they were primarily "a restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages". The sermons focused on the Book of Revelation 6:1â17, and provided an interpretation of the meaning of each of the seals. Branham claimed the sermons were inspired through an angelic visitation.

Branham believed <a href="denominationalism">denominationalism</a> was "a <a href="Number%20of%20the%20beast">mark of the beast</a>", which added to the controversy surrounding his later ministry. Branham was not opposed to organizational structures; his concern focused on the "road block to salvation and spiritual unity" he believed denominations created by emphasizing loyalty to their organizations.

Branham's doctrine was similar to the <a href="Anti-Catholicism">anti-Catholic</a> rhetoric of classical Pentecostalism and Protestantism, which commonly associated the mark of the beast with <a href="Catholicism">Catholicism</a>. Branham, though, uniquely associated the image of the beast with Protestant denominations. In his later years, he came to believe all denominations were "synagogues of Satan". A key teaching of Branham's message was a command to true Christians to "come out" of the denominations and accept the message of the Laodicean messenger, who had the "message of the hour". He argued that continued allegiance to a denomination was an acceptance of the mark of the beast, which would mean missing the rapture.

Branham issued a series of prophecies during his ministry. He claimed to have had a prophetic revelation in June 1933 that predicted seven major events would occur before the <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming of Christ</a>. His followers believe he predicted several events, including the <a href="1937%20Ohio%20River%20Flood">1937 Ohio River Flood</a>. In 1964, Branham said judgement would strike the west coast of the United States and that Los Angeles would sink into the ocean; his most dramatic prediction. Following both the 1933 and 1964 prophecies, Branham predicted the rapture would happen by 1977 and would be preceded by various worldwide disasters, the unification of denominational Christianity, and the rise-to-power of the Roman Catholic Pope. Peter Duyzer, among other of Branham's critics, wrote that either none of Branham's prophecies came true or that they were all made after the fact. Weaver wrote that Branham tended to embellish his predictions over time. Branham's followers believe his prophecies came true, or will do so in the future.

Of all of Branham's doctrines, his teachings on Christian restorationism have had the most lasting impact on modern Christianity. Charismatic writer Michael Moriarty described his teachings on the subject as "extremely significant" because they have "impacted every major restoration movement since". As a result, Moriarty concluded Branham has "profoundly influenced" the modern Charismatic movement. Branham taught the doctrine widely from the early days of the healing revival, in which he urged his audiences to unite and restore a form of church organization like the primitive church of early Christianity. The teaching was accepted and widely taught by many of the evangelists of the healing revival, and they took it with them into the subsequent Charismatic and evangelical movements. <a href="Paul%20Cain%20%28minister%29">Paul Cain</a>, Bill Hamon, <a href="Kenneth%20Hagin">Kenneth Hagin</a>, and other restoration prophets cite Branham as a major influence; they played a critical role in introducing Branham's restoration views to the <a href="Apostolic-Prophetic%20Movement">Apostolic-Prophetic Movement</a>, the <a href="Association%20of%20Vineyard%20Churches">Association of Vineyard Churches</a>, and other large Charismatic organizations. The <a href="Toronto%20Blessing">Toronto Blessing</a>, the <a href="Brownsville%20Revival">Brownsville Revival</a>, and other nationwide revivals of the late 20th century have their roots in Branham's restorationist teachings.

The teaching holds that Christianity should return to a form mirroring the primitive Christian church. It supports the restoration of apostles and prophets, <a href="signs%20and%20wonders">signs and wonders</a>, spiritual gifts, <a href="spiritual%20warfare">spiritual warfare</a>, and the elimination of non-primitive features of modern Christianity. Branham taught that by the end of the first century of Christianity, the church "had been contaminated by the entrance of an antichrist spirit". As a result, he believed that from a very early date, the church had stopped following the "pure Word of God" and had been seduced into a false form of Christianity. He stated the corruption came from the desire of early Christianity's clergy to obtain political power, and as a result became increasingly wicked and introduced false creeds. This led to denominationalism, which he viewed as the greatest threat to true Christianity. Branham viewed <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> as the initiator of a process that would result in the restoration of the true form of Christianity, and traced the advancement of the process through other historic church figures. He believed the rapture would occur at the culmination of this process. Although Branham referred in his sermons to the culmination of the process as a future event affecting other people, he believed he and his followers were fulfilling his restoration beliefs.

On December 18, 1965, Branham and his familyâexcept his daughter Rebekahâwere returning to Jeffersonville, Indiana, from Tucson for the Christmas holiday. About east of <a href="Friona%2C%20Texas">Friona, Texas</a>, and about southwest of Amarillo on <a href="U.S.%20Route%2060%20in%20Texas">U.S. Highway 60</a>, just after dark, a car driven by a drunken driver traveling westward in the eastbound lane collided head-on with Branham's car. He was rushed to the hospital in Amarillo where he remained comatose for several days and died of his injuries on Christmas Eve, December 24, 1965.

Branham's death stunned the Pentecostal world and shocked his followers. His funeral was held on December 29, 1965, but his burial was delayed. His body was finally buried on April 11, 1966; Easter Monday. Most eulogies only tacitly acknowledged Branham's controversial teachings, focusing instead on his many positive contributions and recalled his wide popularity and impact during the years of the healing revival. Gordon Lindsay's eulogy stated that Branham's death was the will of God and privately he accepted the interpretation of Kenneth Hagin, who claimed to have prophesied Branham's death two years before it happened. According to Hagin, God revealed that Branham was teaching false doctrine and God was removing him because of his disobedience.

In the confusion immediately following Branham's death, expectations that he would rise from the dead developed among his followers. Most believed he would have to return to fulfill a vision he had regarding future tent meetings. Weaver attributed the belief in Branham's imminent resurrection to Pearry Green, though Green denied it. Even Branham's son Billy Paul seemed to expect his father's resurrection and indicated as much in messages sent to Branham's followers, in which he communicated his expectation for Easter 1966. The expectation of his resurrection remained strong into the 1970s, in part based on Branham's prediction that the rapture could occur by 1977. After 1977, some of his followers abandoned his teachings.

Branham was the "initiator of the post-World War II healing revival" and, along with Oral Roberts, was one of its most revered leaders. Branham is most remembered for his use of the "sign-gifts" that awed the Pentecostal world. According to writer and researcher Patsy Sims, "the power of a Branham service and his stage presence remains a legend unparalleled in the history of the Charismatic movement." The many revivalists who attempted to emulate Branham during the 1950s spawned a generation of prominent Charismatic ministries. Branham has been called the "principal architect of restorationist thought" of the Charismatic movement that emerged out of the healing revival. The Charismatic view that the Christian church should return to a form like that of the early church has its roots in Branham's teachings during the healing revival period. The belief is widely held in the modern Charismatic movement, and the legacy of his restorationist teaching and ministering style is evident throughout televangelism and the Charismatic movement.

The more controversial doctrines Branham espoused in the closing years of his ministry were rejected by the Charismatic movement, which viewed them as "revelatory madness". Charismatics are apologetic towards Branham's early ministry and embrace his use of the "sign-gifts". Charismatic author John Crowder wrote that his ministry should not be judged by "the small sliver of his later life", but by the fact that he indirectly "lit a fire" that began the modern Charismatic movement. Non-Charismatic Christianity completely rejected Branham.

Crowder said Branham was a victim of "the adoration of man" because his followers began to idolize him in the later part of his ministry. Harrell took a similar view, attributing Branham's teachings in his later career to his close friends, who manipulated him and took advantage of his lack of theological training. Weaver also attributed Branham's eschatological teachings to the influence of a small group of his closest followers, who encouraged his desire for a unique ministry. According to Weaver, to Branham's dismay, his followers had placed him at the "center of a Pentecostal personality cult" in the final years of his ministry. Edward Babinski describes Branham's followers as "odd in their beliefs, but for the most part honest hard-working citizens", and wrote that calling them a cult "seems unfair". While rejecting Branham's teachings, Duyzer offered a glowing review of Branham's followers, stating he "had never experienced friendship, or love like we did there".

Though Branham is no longer widely known outside Pentecostalism, his legacy continues today. Summarizing the contrasting views held of Branham, Kydd stated, "Some thought he was God. Some thought he was a dupe of the devil. Some thought he was an end-time messenger sent from God, and some still do." Followers of Branham's teachings can be found around the world; Branham claimed to have made over one million converts during his campaign meetings.

By the Way

By the Way is the eighth studio album by American rock band <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>. The album was released July 9, 2002 on <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>. It sold more than 286,000 copies in the first week, and peaked at number two on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> (their <a href="Stadium%20Arcadium">next album</a> would peak at number one). Singles from the album included "<a href="By%20the%20Way%20%28song%29">By the Way</a>," "<a href="The%20Zephyr%20Song">The Zephyr Song</a>," "<a href="Can%27t%20Stop%20%28Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20song%29">Can't Stop</a>," "<a href="Dosed">Dosed</a>" and "<a href="Universally%20Speaking">Universally Speaking</a>." The lyrical subject matter vocalist <a href="Anthony%20Kiedis">Anthony Kiedis</a> addresses in "By the Way" is a divergence from previous Chili Peppers albums, with Kiedis taking a more candid and reflective approach to his lyrics.

"By the Way" was lauded by critics as a departure from the band's previous styles, and is recognized for the melodic and subdued emotions given by the Chili Peppers. Guitarist <a href="John%20Frusciante">John Frusciante</a> is credited with writing most of the album's melodies, backing vocal arrangements, bass lines and guitar progressions, therefore changing the direction of the recording dramatically: "his warm, understated guitar work and his <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a> style vocal harmonies are king this time around." "By the Way" contained very little of the signature punk-funk <a href="Music%20genre%23Fusional%20origins">fusion</a> the band had become known for playing. Frusciante has stated that writing ""By the Way" [was] one of the happiest times in my life." The album went on to sell more than 8 million copies worldwide.

Following a life-threatening drug addiction that developed after leaving the Chili Peppers in 1992, Frusciante completed a month of <a href="drug%20rehabilitation">drug rehabilitation</a> at Las Encinas in Pasadena in 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the band. After several months of writing and recording, the Chili Peppers' next album, "<a href="Californication%20%28album%29">Californication</a>" was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming the Chili Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, "<a href="One%20Hot%20Minute">One Hot Minute</a>". A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including <a href="Woodstock%201999">Woodstock 1999</a> and <a href="Rock%20in%20Rio">Rock in Rio</a>.

The writing and formation of "By the Way" began immediately following the culmination of <a href="Californication%20tour">"Californication's" world tour</a>, in the spring of 2001. As with "Californication", much of the creation took place in the band members' homes and other practice locations, such as a recording studio stage. Kiedis recalled of the situation: "We started finding some magic and some music and some riffs and some rhythms and some jams and some grooves, and we added to it and subtracted from it and pushed it around and put melodies to it." Frusciante and Kiedis would collaborate for days straight, discussing guitar progressions and sharing lyrics. For Kiedis, "writing "By the Way"...was a whole different experience from "Californication". John was back to himself and brimming with confidence." Prior to recording "By the Way", the Chili Peppers decided that they would again have <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> produce the album. Rubin had, in the past, granted the Chili Peppers creative freedom on their recording material; this was something they thought essential for the album to be unique, and could only occur with his return.

According to the 2010 book, "The Red Hot Chili Peppers: An Oral/Visual History", Frusciante had originally intended for the album to be very different from how it was eventually completed. Frusciante wanted an album of two different types of songs: songs that were more "English-sounding" and melodic, and songs that were more punk-rock sounding. Frusciante's punk inspiration came from listening to music by <a href="The%20Damned%20%28band%29">The Damned</a> and <a href="Discharge%20%28band%29">Discharge</a>, among others. Rick Rubin was not familiar with the latter bands and sound and thought that the melodic songs were original and more exciting, causing the band to focus mostly on the melodic material. However, one punk rock influenced song was recorded during these sessions, "Body of Water," but did not make the final cut and was instead included on "<a href="The%20Zephyr%20Song">The Zephyr Song</a>" single. Many of the more melodic inspired songs came from Frusciante being heavily into music by <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">The Beach Boys</a> and <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> along with <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a> groups and their harmonies. Frusciante said he listened to <a href="Emerson%2C%20Lake%20%26amp%3B%20Palmer">Emerson, Lake & Palmer</a> every day during the recording of "By the Way". These new styles as well as Frusciante being especially prolific during this era came to alienate Flea, who had wanted the band to return to its earlier funk-influenced sound. Frusciante felt the band had already thoroughly explored funk and was more interested in creating something new for the band. According to Kiedis, Flea felt his voice wasn't being heard, and there was a point where he considered leaving the band. While speaking to Swedish paper <a href="Aftonbladet">Aftonbladet</a>, Frusciante mentioned that he listened to guitarists such as <a href="John%20McGeoch">John McGeoch</a> for his work on the <a href="Magazine%20%28band%29">Magazine</a>'s and <a href="Siouxsie%20and%20the%20Banshees">Siouxsie and the Banshees</a>' albums including "<a href="Juju%20%28Siouxsie%20and%20the%20Banshees%20album%29">Juju</a>", <a href="Adrian%20Fisher%20%28musician%29">Adrian Fisher</a> of <a href="Sparks%20%28band%29">Sparks</a> for "<a href="Kimono%20My%20House">Kimono My House</a>", <a href="Johnny%20Marr">Johnny Marr</a> of <a href="the%20Smiths">the Smiths</a>, <a href="Vini%20Reilly">Vini Reilly</a> of <a href="The%20Durutti%20Column">The Durutti Column</a> and <a href="Keith%20Levene">Keith Levene</a> of <a href="PiL">PiL</a>. He also credits <a href="XTC">XTC</a> singer/guitarist <a href="Andy%20Partridge">Andy Partridge</a> in the 2002 issue of <a href="Total%20Guitar">Total Guitar</a> magazine for being an influence on his guitar work for the album.

The album's guitar and bass ensemble was primarily dictated by Frusciante, rather than a collaborative effort between him and bassist Flea. Therefore, the record took different direction than any previous Chili Peppers' album. Frusciante sought to create an emotional and poignant <a href="soundscape">soundscape</a> throughout the recording. Drawing influences from musicians such as <a href="Vini%20Reilly">Vini Reilly</a> of <a href="The%20Durutti%20Column">The Durutti Column</a> and <a href="John%20McGeoch">John McGeoch</a>, Frusciante made use of textured and multilayered guitar progressions on "By the Way", using tools such as the <a href="mellotron">mellotron</a> and various <a href="effects%20pedal">effects pedal</a>s throughout. In 2006, while promoting the band's subsequent studio album, "<a href="Stadium%20Arcadium">Stadium Arcadium</a>", Flea reflected on the composition of "By the Way", stating: "John went to this whole level of artistry. But he made me feel like I had nothing to offer, like I knew shit."
Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs written for the album such as "By the Way," "I Could Die for You," "Dosed," "Warm Tape" and non-album tracks "Someone" and "Body of Water" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like "This Is the Place" and "Don't Forget Me" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in "This Is the Place" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: "On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean." "Venice Queen" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's <a href="Venice%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Venice Beach</a>. It mourned her death as a painful loss: "We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen."

"By the Way" diverged from the band's previous styles, containing few funk-driven songs. "Can't Stop" and the title track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. "Throw Away Your Television," while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus. Other "experimental" tracks include the melodica-based "On Mercury." "Cabron," the only track to be played entirely on acoustic guitar, has distinctive Latin influences. "Tear" and "Warm Tape" were keyboard based more so than guitar or bass, the latter being completely written on the instrument. Technically, "By the Way" saw the Chili Peppers employing several devices to distort and alter guitar and vocal sequences. "Don't Forget Me" utilizes a mellotron, <a href="Wah-wah%20pedal">wah pedal</a>, and echoing techniques to convey an emotive atmosphere, while Frusciante uses a <a href="Big%20Muff">Big Muff</a> for the solos on "Minor Thing."

Many outtakes from the album have been released or exist. "Time" and a cover version of <a href="Dion%20and%20the%20Belmonts">Dion and the Belmonts</a>' "<a href="Teenager%20in%20Love">Teenager in Love</a>" were released on the "By the Way" single. "Body of Water," "Out of Range," "Someone" and "Rivers of Avalon" were all released on "The Zephyr Song" single. "Slowly Deeply," which was featured on the "Universally Speaking" single, is an outtake from the "Californication" sessions. "<a href="Fortune%20Faded">Fortune Faded</a>," a song originally recorded during the album sessions was later re-recorded in 2003 and released as a single along with the b-side, "Eskimo," another "By the Way" outtake. A cover version of the <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a>' "<a href="Havana%20Affair">Havana Affair</a>" was also recorded and later released in 2003 on "". The single for "Can't Stop" also features an alternate mix of the song with higher harmonies and a clearer bass line. In 2003, the band re-entered the studio to work on its "Greatest Hits" album. The sessions produced enough songs for a new album, many which have gone unreleased. Of the songs released, "Bicycle Song" and "Runaway" were released in 2006 as bonus tracks on the iTunes release of "By the Way".

In August 2014, unreleased tracks from the album's recording sessions were leaked to the internet. Many of the album's released songs and outtakes are in their earliest forms and feature improvised lyrics by Kiedis. The leak included three songs never heard before including "Goldmine," "Fall Water" and "Rock & Roll" along with the original version of "Fortune Faded." Many of the songs are featured under their working titles (which prior to release were also mentioned in various interviews): Soul Train ("By the Way"), Coltraine ("The Zephyr Song"), I Would Die ("I Could Die For You"), Drone ("This is the Place"), Throw Away ("Throw Away Your Television"), Epic ("Venice Queen") and New Wave ("Quixoticelixer") To date, "Strumming on D and J", a song assumed to be an instrumental jam and that Frusciante mentioned during pre-album release interviews, has never been released.

All paintings, photography and art direction is credited to <a href="Julian%20Schnabel">Julian Schnabel</a> and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The woman featured on the cover of "By the Way" is Stella Schnabel, Julian Schnabel's daughter and Frusciante's then-girlfriend. Regarding the artwork, Frusciante noted: "My girlfriend's father offered to do the album art, so we sent him rough mixes of eight songs, and he just got the vibe of the album from that. He said that he wouldn't be offended if we didn't like it, but we loved what he did. He's also given us great covers for all the singles. He's a true artist."

Several pages of the album's booklet, and single for "By the Way" contain paintings of a goat head. A somewhat blurry, black and white photograph of the band in a desolate field, and each band member individually, is also present.

The majority of the booklet's artwork are various scenes of replica grass and plants, stars and indistinguishable objects, which appears to be a miniature pole, placed in dirt. Single covers for "The Zephyr Song" and "Can't Stop" both feature this same background, although angled slightly differently. The lyrics for "By the Way" are placed on top of the landscape, hand written by Kiedis in pink lettering.

Feeling extremely confident in their album, the Chili Peppers issued the statement, "Greetings from the dimensions of invisible shapes and colors. The music on this record has expanded our space and made us bigger. Thank you for listening and being exactly where and who you are," in a press release. Chad Smith commented that "By the Way" is "very honest, raw, emotional music. It's a very dynamic, rich and lush album. Probably the best collection of Chili Peppers songs we've ever put out. " <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a> promoted the album heavily in the months prior to the record's 2002 release, especially targeting the online market in order to steer customers away from illegal downloads. The record label implemented a campaign they colloquially title "A Song a Day". This program, initiated on June 21, was aimed at leaking one song per day until the album was released. Over 150 radio stations participated in broadcasting the band's new daily material, along with <a href="MTV">MTV</a>, <a href="VH1">VH1</a>, and digital music retailers like <a href="iTunes">iTunes</a>, as well as Cell phone companies. <a href="AOL">AOL</a> featured the Chili Peppers as their "Artist of the Month" in June, streaming interviews and live performances of the band free of charge; they also sold an MP3 of "By the Way", the record's first single, for ninety-nine cents and raffled off tickets that gave fans a chance to see the band in Japan in November.

"By the Way" was released on CD and <a href="LP%20album">LP</a> on July 9, 2002, under the Warner Bros. label, selling 281,948 copies in the United States in its first week and 1.8 million worldwide. It was certified gold just a few months later on October 26, 2002. Five singles were released from it; of these, the title track "By the Way" was the most successful, peaking at No. 2 on the UK charts and No. 1 on the Billboard rock charts. Although the album sold fewer copies than "Californication", "By the Way" managed to peak at No. 2 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, one spot higher than "Californication". Around the world, the album debuted at number one in the UK, Switzerland, New Zealand, Austria, and Sweden; and number two in France. In March 2006, the Red Hot Chili Peppers' albums were made available for download from the <a href="iTunes%20Music%20Store">iTunes Music Store</a> and other online retailers. "By the Way" included two previously unreleased tracks ("Runaway", and "Bicycle Song"), recorded during the 2004 "Greatest Hits" sessions.

The album received a positive reaction from critics, who praised "By the Way" for its melodic, multilayer and textured styles. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s Zac Johnson said that the album was "sophisticated...the Peppers have not sacrificed any of their trademark energy or passions for life, universal love, and (of course) lust". "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" called the album "insanely melodic" and a "near-perfect balance of gutter grime and high-art aspiration", comparing it to other works, such as <a href="The%20Beach%20Boys">The Beach Boys</a>' album "<a href="Pet%20Sounds">Pet Sounds</a>". "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" applauded the recording, and considered it to be "the strongest Chili's album since 1991's "Blood Sugar Sex Magik"". Giving the album 5 stars out of 5, "Q" called "By the Way" "A fantastic record; full of wonder." Kimberly Mack of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> commented on how the album "...showcases a more sophisticated, lush sound that only today's Peppers could have conceived", and that "Anthony Kiedis' lyrics are more personal than ever." Frusciante was, in his eyes, "a musical talent to be reckoned with and is the undeniable X factor in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' sound."

However, the praise was balanced by certain critics. "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" considered "By the Way" to be an indistinguishable sequel to "Californication", calling it "Californication 2". It further condemned the Chili Peppers for not varying their style and remaining extremely similar in sound. Jaime Lowe of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" panned Kiedis's lyrics as "absolutely baffling" and commented that "it's as if he picked up a rhyming dictionary and arbitrarily strung some phrases together." The newspaper's <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> was also critical of his songwriting, writing that "it's not enough for Anthony Kiedis to get all matureâhe's supposed to say something interesting about maturity." "Entertainment Weekly" praised "By the Way" for being well refined and a superb collaboration, but criticized the Chili Peppers for playing it safe and keeping the album's energy mild; for being "more fascinating for what it symbolizes than what it is."

Allmusic considered the song "By the Way" to combine "fiery Hollywood funk, gentle harmonies, a little bit of singing about girls, [and] a little bit of hanging out in the streets in the summertime." "Rolling Stone" commented on "how close this band has come to conjuring pure California sunshine" in "The Zephyr Song". "Midnight" was highly regarded by several sources. It was chosen as one of "By the Way"'s "Allmusic Track Picks". Kimberly Mack of Pop Matters considered it to have "hippie-friendly lyrics" and to "evoke images of tie-dyed T-shirts and AM radio." Mack also regarded "Venice Queen" as "a masterpiece...Frusciante's backing vocals are hauntingly beautiful." In 2005, "By the Way" was ranked number 375 in "Rock Hard" magazine's book of "The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time".

The information regarding accolades attributed to "By the Way" is adapted from AcclaimedMusic.net.

Flea was still upset over the problems he had with John during the making of the album. Flea felt that John was trying to take over the band and that he could no longer express himself in the context of the band. Flea decided that he would finish the album but quit prior to their tour. According to Chad Smith, Flea and Frusciante eventually had a sit-down meeting with each other to air out their differences. Frusciante had no idea how Flea was feeling and had no intentions of taking over the band. Flea also credited practicing <a href="Vipassan%C4%81">VipassanÄ</a> meditation along with Frusciante for helping the two repair their musical relationship. With their problems worked out, the band launched their promo tour to support the album on New York City's <a href="Ellis%20Island">Ellis Island</a>. Sponsored by the rock radio station <a href="WNYL%20%28FM%29">K-Rock</a>, the event was titled the "Pep Rally". The band performed eight songs from "By the Way", as well as tracks from "Californication" and "Blood Sugar Sex Magik" in front of 900 contest winners. The "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" declared the show "one of the top concerts of the year." The location was chosen in order to reinvigorate lower <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> after the <a href="September%2011%2C%202001%20attacks">September 11, 2001 attacks</a> and all proceeds were donated to pertinent charity organizations. Immediately following this, the Chili Peppers embarked on a world tour to support the album. Beginning in Europe, they also played at events such as the <a href="Fuji%20Rock%20Festival">Fuji Rock Festival</a> and <a href="Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival</a> in between. The band eventually culminated their Europe leg of the tour in February 2003, and commenced the United States leg on May 1. The Chili Peppers played at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in New York City on June 3, 2003 to a sold-out crowd and an enthusiastic response from critics. Kelefa Sanneh of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reported that "on Tuesday night, the [Red Hot Chili Peppers] came to Madison Square Garden for an extraordinary two-hour performance...On 'Don't Forget Me', [Flea] strummed chords, while Mr. Frusciante contributed a gorgeous guitar line that bubbled and hissed like some sort of chemical reaction." The US leg ended on June 21; the band took a small hiatus before performing at <a href="Slane%20Castle">Slane Castle</a> on August 23, to a crowd of over 80,000. "<a href="Live%20at%20Slane%20Castle%20%28Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20video%29">Live at Slane Castle</a>", the result of the concert, would become the Chili Peppers' second live DVD, after "<a href="Off%20the%20Map%20%28video%29">Off the Map</a>".

Following several Japanese and Australian performances, the Red Hot Chili Peppers planned three nights at London's <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a>. Over 240,000 tickets were sold within hours, with roughly 80,000 people attending each show on June 19, 20 and 25, respectively. It became the highest-grossing concert at a single venue in history, accumulating an estimated $17 million gross revenue. Due to the success of the three shows, the band released their first live album "<a href="Live%20in%20Hyde%20Park">Live in Hyde Park</a>" in Europe, Australia, Japan and New Zealand, excluding the United States. Later that year, the Chili Peppers played for the 2004 <a href="Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> in support of their political beliefs, with Kiedis saying "Do what you gotta do" at the end of the band's set. Finally, they played at the <a href="Rock%20am%20Ring">Rock am Ring</a> festival as one of the final performances of the "By the Way" tour.

In 2006, Flea revealed that he once again considered leaving the band whilst touring in support of the album, stating that "throughout the "By the Way" tour I would play a show and then go and sit on the end of my bed staring into space." He planned to teach full-time at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, but ultimately decided to remain within the band. Flea later stated that "the most painful part of quitting, and the thing that stopped me, was the idea of telling Anthony."

California State Route 56

State Route 56 (SRÂ 56) is an eastâwest <a href="State%20highways%20in%20California">state highway</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="California">California</a>. It runs from <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">InterstateÂ 5</a> (I-5) in the <a href="Carmel%20Valley%2C%20San%20Diego">Carmel Valley</a> neighborhood of <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> to <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20California">I-15</a>. The eastern terminus of the highway is also the western end of the Ted Williams Parkway. SRÂ 56 serves as an important connector between I-5 and I-15, being the only eastâwest freeway between <a href="California%20State%20Route%2078">SRÂ 78</a> in <a href="North%20County%2C%20San%20Diego">north San Diego County</a>, several miles away, and <a href="California%20State%20Route%2052">SRÂ 52</a> near <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Air%20Station%20Miramar">Marine Corps Air Station Miramar</a>. It is also named the Ted Williams Freeway, after the San Diego-born <a href="Ted%20Williams">baseball player</a>.

SRÂ 56 was added to the state highway system in 1959 as Legislative RouteÂ 278, and was renumbered SRÂ 56 in the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>. Plans in 1964 were to connect SRÂ 56 to the north end of <a href="California%20State%20Route%20125">SRÂ 125</a> and continue east to <a href="California%20State%20Route%2067">SRÂ 67</a>, but these plans did not come to fruition. The eastern end from Black Mountain Road to I-15 was completed in 1993; the western end from I-5 to Carmel Creek Road was completed in 1995 after several lawsuits filed by the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a> and other community groups. The two ends were not connected until the middle portion of the freeway was completed in 2004. The delay was largely due to funding issues and environmental concerns.

Eastbound SRÂ 56 begins as a ramp from the northbound <a href="Interstate%205">I-5</a>'s local bypass lanes. The interchange is not complete; southbound I-5 traffic must exit to Carmel Valley Road before entering SRÂ 56. Westbound traffic on SRÂ 56 merges into the southbound I-5 local bypass lanes, which provide access to I-805. Continuing east, the route then has an interchange at Carmel Creek Road, which provides access to the nearby <a href="San%20Diego%20Jewish%20Academy">San Diego Jewish Academy</a>, and proceeds eastward through a residential area. After passing milepost 2, the freeway has another interchange with Carmel Country Road south of the community of <a href="Torrey%20Hills%2C%20San%20Diego">Torrey Hills</a>.

SRÂ 56 meets Carmel Valley Road and curves northward, passing <a href="Canyon%20Crest%20Academy">Canyon Crest Academy</a> before turning southeastward. The route passes over McGonigle Creek before intersecting Camino Del Sur, which serves the nearby <a href="Westview%20High%20School%20%28San%20Diego%29">Westview High School</a>. Southeast of Camino Del Sur, SRÂ 56 curves back east, passing under Carmel Mountain Road without an exit. The route encounters exits with Black Mountain Road and Rancho PeÃ±asquitos Boulevard in <a href="Rancho%20Pe%C3%B1asquitos%2C%20San%20Diego">Rancho PeÃ±asquitos</a> in a primarily residential area before meeting its terminus at a partial cloverleaf interchange with <a href="Interstate%2015">I-15</a>. Past the bridge over I-15, the road continues as Ted Williams Parkway, ending at Twin Peaks Road in <a href="Poway%2C%20California">Poway</a>.

SRÂ 56 is part of the <a href="California%20Freeway%20and%20Expressway%20System">California Freeway and Expressway System</a>; it is not part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. In 2014, SRÂ 56 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 32,000Â vehicles between I-15 and the eastern terminus at Ted Williams Parkway, and 81,000Â vehicles between Carmel Creek Road and Carmel Country Road, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the freeway.

Planning for SRÂ 56 started in 1956, according to San Diego Councilwoman Barbara Warden. The route was first added to the California State Highway System in 1959 as Legislative Route Number 278 (LRNÂ 278). The routing ran from <a href="Legislative%20Route%202%20%28California%20pre-1964%29">LRNÂ 2</a>, which later became <a href="US%20101%20%28CA%29">USÂ 101</a>, all the way east to <a href="Legislative%20Route%20198%20%28California%20pre-1964%29">LRNÂ 198</a>, which is now SRÂ 67. In the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>, LRNÂ 278 was renumbered SRÂ 56 and was designated to run from I-5 to <a href="California%20State%20Route%2067">SRÂ 67</a>. On DecemberÂ 30, 1980, the City of Poway included SRÂ 56 in their city plan extending all the way east through the city to a northern extension of <a href="California%20State%20Route%20125">SR 125</a>. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SRÂ 56 all the way to SRÂ 67, although Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in their city. Nevertheless, there are no plans to construct the portion of SRÂ 56 east of I-15; several arterial roads connect the eastern end of the SR 56 freeway with SR 67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (<a href="CR%20S5%20%28CA%29">CR S5</a>), and Poway Road (<a href="CR%20S4%20%28CA%29">CR S4</a>).
Citizens began to lobby for the construction of SRÂ 56 in 1986, in a similar action to efforts for <a href="California%20State%20Route%2052">SR 52</a>. As far back as 1987, the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a> opposed the use of sales tax revenue to build the freeway because of environmental concerns. A public forum was held on AprilÂ 10, 1990, in Rancho PeÃ±asquitos. Since funds were not available for constructing the middle of the route, many opposed the construction of the eastern part of SRÂ 56 as a "road to nowhere". Opposition to the western end of the freeway related to concerns about destruction of "farmland, marshland, and willow scrubland", the habitat of the endangered <a href="Bell%27s%20vireo">least Bell's vireo</a>. The <a href="San%20Diego%20City%20Council">San Diego City Council</a> voted against such widening of Carmel Valley Road on AprilÂ 12, citing the environmental concerns. <a href="Caltrans">Caltrans</a> rejected other routes, and insisted on ending the freeway at I-5 and Carmel Valley Road. The council reversed its decision on MayÂ 8; after the public gave several opinions on the matter, Caltrans agreed to set aside for <a href="environmental%20mitigation">environmental mitigation</a>, and $2Â million (about $ in dollars) was to be set aside for the purchase of land for a park near the San Dieguito River.

In JuneÂ 1990, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy and the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the San Diego City Council to require them to move the western terminus of SRÂ 56 closer to Sorrento Valley. On AugustÂ 1, the City of San Diego received a petition in which more than 45,000Â people requested that the City Council overturn their decision or refer it to a public referendum. The City Council backed down and rescinded the appropriate zoning changes on AugustÂ 7, in efforts to keep the city from having to run a special election. They also approved the plans for the eastern portion between Black Mountain Road and I-15. Meanwhile, the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the city as well. The California Coastal Commission approved the construction on SeptemberÂ 13, and several local residents representing both sides of the debate attended the meeting in <a href="Marina%20del%20Rey%2C%20California">Marina del Rey</a>.

Construction on the predecessor of SRÂ 56 began on NovemberÂ 16, 1987, the Newland-California Company paying for the work as a local developer. Around 1990, the North City Parkway was completed as a two-lane road between Rancho PeÃ±asquitos Boulevard (then PeÃ±asquitos Boulevard) and I-15, along the proposed route of SRÂ 56. The first official segment of the freeway from Black Mountain Road to I-15 was constructed next, beginning on JulyÂ 25, 1991 by Daley Corporation and W.R. Connelly Inc. This was scheduled to open in MayÂ 1993, at a cost of $13Â million (about $ in dollars).

Opposition to the western segment (from I-5 to Carmel Valley Road) persisted. By 1991, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy filed an appeal with the 4th District Court of Appeals after losing the lawsuit to the city of San Diego and Caltrans. The Sierra Club had also sued the <a href="California%20Coastal%20Commission">California Coastal Commission</a>. On July 16, 1992, the Sierra Club withdrew its lawsuit after the City of San Diego agreed to work to keep the PeÃ±asquitos Lagoon flowing to the ocean and to restore a wetland area. Following the Sierra Club's settlement, the City of <a href="Del%20Mar%2C%20California">Del Mar</a> raised an objection to the club's decision to accept a settlement, since the city had given a $7,000 contribution (about $ in dollars) to the case. The Sierra Club agreed to return the money in AugustÂ 1992.

The Del Mar Conservancy suit continued, and the plaintiffs requested a court order to stop construction. This lawsuit claimed that the state and city had not done enough environmental studies and mitigation. The 4th District Court of Appeals denied an appeal on OctoberÂ 23. InÂ 1993, citizens complained that funds were being diverted from a recreational park to build the freeway, possibly hindering the development of a new elementary school. The segment was finally completed at a projected cost of $27.2Â million (about $ in dollars), opening to traffic by 1995. The ramps connecting SRÂ 56 to I-5 were opened between 1997 and 1998; traffic was diverted onto Carmel Valley Road in the meantime.
The freeway is named after <a href="Ted%20Williams">Ted Williams</a>, a <a href="List%20of%20members%20of%20the%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> baseball player born in San Diego who played for the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> during his 21-year career. The San Diego City Council also considered naming SRÂ 56 after the former governor and San Diego mayor <a href="Pete%20Wilson">Pete Wilson</a>. The Council voted 7-1 to name it after Williams on May 12, 1992. Since Williams was still alive, the State of California had to approve the name. <a href="Lionel%20Van%20Deerlin">Lionel Van Deerlin</a> alleged that Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer nominated Wilson for the honor as political ammunition against Councilman Ron Roberts. Williams came to <a href="Mt.%20Carmel%20High%20School%20%28San%20Diego%2C%20California%29">Mt. Carmel High School</a> on JulyÂ 12, 1992, for the freeway dedication. Kevin McNamara, who had worked with the government to get the name approved despite opposition, was charged $15,000 (about $ in dollars) for the highway signs when the name was official. The freeway was officially named after Ted Williams in 1993 by the Legislature.

A gap in the freeway remained, nevertheless. Concerns about the missing funds for the freeway date back to 1990. Since the proposed route passed through the open area between Carmel Valley and Rancho PeÃ±asquitos, revenue from the Proposition A sales tax hike could not be used. InÂ 1993, a "Citizens United for State Route 56" group was commissioned to work on the funding issues. Two years later, County Supervisor Pam Slater briefly proposed making SRÂ 56 a toll road in order to raise funds for construction. The city of San Diego agreed to pay $25Â million (about $ in dollars), and the state indicated that it would contribute $20Â million.

HighwayÂ 680 was a planned county route that would have run from <a href="Encinitas%2C%20California">Encinitas</a> to <a href="Rancho%20Bernardo%2C%20California">Rancho Bernardo</a>. The San Diego County Board of Supervisors cancelled the plans in FebruaryÂ 1994, respecting the wishes of the city of Encinitas. There were concerns that some of the traffic from this proposed route would now travel on SRÂ 56 instead. On MayÂ 17, 1994, $20Â million (about $ in dollars) allocated to HighwayÂ 680 was given to the SRÂ 56 project.

In JanuaryÂ 1998, the State Transportation Improvement Program approved a $245Â million allocation (about $ in dollars) for the expansion, and hopes were to finish construction by 2000, with traffic projected to decrease by 20Â percent on I-15. There were environmental concerns that fostered consideration of four northern alternatives. One of them was chosen in JuneÂ 1998 by the San Diego City Council, amid concerns that by moving the route away from "environmentally sensitive canyons", the freeway would be closer to residences. Some of those living in Rancho Glens Estates sued the city over these concerns in August.
Construction began on the missing portion of SRÂ 56 on OctoberÂ 21, 1999, amid allegations of a missing <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> permit, at an estimated cost of $111Â million (about $ in dollars). The California Coastal Commission approved the extension on MayÂ 10, 2000, after residents lost two lawsuits relating to the proximity of the freeway. Caltrans was required to install a drainage system because of the wetlands; this requirement was similar to a court ruling for a project in the <a href="Bolsa%20Chica%20Ecological%20Reserve">Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve</a>. At this time, the completion was estimated to occur in 2004, at a cost of $151Â million (about $ in dollars). In OctoberÂ 2000, Carmel Valley Road was extended to Black Mountain Road, providing a paved alternative until SRÂ 56 was completed; commuters had to travel on a unpaved road, one of the only roads between I-5 and I-15 in North County.

Local developers contributed $21Â million (about $ in dollars) for the construction of the interchange at Camino Ruiz, and construction began on JulyÂ 11, 2001. An open house was held on the portion of the freeway between the Camino Ruiz (renamed Camino del Sur) interchange and the Black Mountain Road interchange on AprilÂ 5, 2003. The road was scheduled to open on AprilÂ 12, 2003, and was projected to decrease the traffic on city streets coming from the extended Carmel Valley Road.

The city of San Diego constructed SRÂ 56 from Black Mountain Road to Carmel Mountain Road, and Caltrans built the remaining portion of the route to Carmel Creek Road. The bridges were still under construction in NovemberÂ 2000 on the city portion. San Diego mayor <a href="Dick%20Murphy">Dick Murphy</a> commissioned the San Diego Freeway Congestion Strike Team to attempt to accelerate stalled freeway projects such as SRÂ 56 in 2001. In MayÂ 2001, the City Council allocated another $5.1Â million (about $ in dollars) to purchase land to build the freeway. Critics stated that the construction of SRÂ 56 was a short-term solution, and that traffic would return by 2020.

FCI Constructors Inc. and W.R. Connelly Inc. won the contract for the Caltrans portion of the new freeway at a <a href="Construction%20bidding">bid</a> of $50.2Â million (about $ in dollars), with completion scheduled for 2004. The freeway was built with two lanes in each direction, additional land being available to expand to three lanes if necessary. The project continued on schedule through the <a href="Gray%20Davis%23Budget%20crisis">2003 California budget crisis</a>, receiving $4.3Â million from the state in 2003. InÂ 2004, there were citizen complaints about the lack of a sound wall to reduce the freeway noise in private residences. It took until JulyÂ 19, 2004, to join the west and east ends of the freeway; a public festival was held on the freeway on JulyÂ 17. The cost of completing the middle segment was reported at $220Â million in 2004 (about $ in dollars). Citizens complained in 2008 that the bike path along SRÂ 56 was difficult to access from the northern side of the interchange with El Camino Real; however, funding issues prevented the construction of a paved path at the time.

The construction of a "dual freeway" at the western end was scheduled to begin in early 2002, referring to the two <a href="carriageways">carriageways</a> needed for each direction of the freeway. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SRÂ 56 from I-5 or <a href="I-805%20%28CA%29">I-805</a>. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic. The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in FebruaryÂ 2006. The southbound I-15 to westbound SRÂ 56 ramp was improved in a construction project in 2005.

Concerns about the lack of a ramp from westbound SRÂ 56 to northbound I-5 date back from 1988, because of a projected increase of traffic on local Carmel Valley streets. Planning for the missing ramps at the western end of SRÂ 56 was under way in 2008, despite nearby homeowner opposition. Caltrans agreed not to destroy homes in late JuneÂ 2008, but concerns about noise and funding remained. On JuneÂ 13, 2012, Caltrans held a public forum to discuss five proposals to address the missing ramps at the western terminus:
A <a href="Environmental%20impact%20statement">Final Environmental Document</a> is scheduled to be released in the middle of 2016. In the meantime, Caltrans studies have begun relating to widening the route to three lanes in each direction, as called for by the 2050 regional plan.

California State Route 67

State Route 67 (SRÂ 67) is a <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a> in <a href="San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">San Diego County</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. It begins at <a href="Interstate%208%20%28California%29">InterstateÂ 8</a> (I-8) in <a href="El%20Cajon%2C%20California">El Cajon</a> and continues to <a href="Lakeside%2C%20California">Lakeside</a> as the San Vicente Freeway before becoming an <a href="undivided%20highway">undivided highway</a> through the eastern part of <a href="Poway%2C%20California">Poway</a>. In the town of <a href="Ramona%2C%20California">Ramona</a>, the route turns into Main Street before ending at <a href="State%20Route%2078%20%28California%29">SRÂ 78</a>. SRÂ 67 provides direct access from the city of <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> to the <a href="East%20County%2C%20San%20Diego">East County</a> region of <a href="San%20Diego%20County">San Diego County</a>, including Ramona and <a href="Julian%2C%20California">Julian</a>.

The route has existed as a railroad corridor since the turn of the 20th century. A highway known as the Julian road was built by 1913, and was designated as Legislative RouteÂ 198 in the state highway system by 1935. RouteÂ 198 was renumbered SRÂ 67 in the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>. A freeway south of Lakeside was built in the late 1960s, and opened to traffic in 1970. Since then, the portion of the highway north of Lakeside has become known for a high number of traffic accidents and related fatalities. The <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans) has made several attempts to remedy the problem and make the road safer.

SRÂ 67 begins at <a href="Interstate%208">I-8</a> in <a href="El%20Cajon%2C%20California">El Cajon</a>; known as the San Vicente Freeway, it turns north near the <a href="Westfield%20Parkway">Westfield Parkway</a> shopping center. There are two <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">interchanges</a> in the city of El Cajon: one with Broadway and Fletcher Parkway, and another with Bradley Avenue. Following this, the freeway leaves the El Cajon city limits, entering the city of <a href="Santee%2C%20California">Santee</a> near <a href="Gillespie%20Field">Gillespie Field</a>, before coming to an interchange with the eastern end of <a href="California%20State%20Route%2052">SRÂ 52</a> in Santee. Near the Woodside Avenue exit, SRÂ 67 turns northeast, paralleling the <a href="San%20Diego%20River">San Diego River</a> and entering the unincorporated area of <a href="Eucalyptus%20Hills%2C%20California">Eucalyptus Hills</a> as it leaves the San Diego urban area. Riverford Road and Winter Gardens Boulevard have interchanges with SR 67.

The freeway ends, and SRÂ 67 turns north and becomes an undivided highway at Mapleview Street, crossing the San Diego River and entering the locale of <a href="Moreno%2C%20San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">Moreno</a>. SRÂ 67 then enters the rural area east of <a href="Sycamore%20Canyon%20County%20Open%20Space%20Preserve">Sycamore Canyon County Open Space Preserve</a> near the locale of <a href="Foster%2C%20San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">Foster</a>, passing to the west of <a href="San%20Vicente%20Reservoir">San Vicente Reservoir</a>. The road intersects the eastern end of Scripps Poway Parkway and <a href="County%20Route%20S4%20%28California%29">County Route S4</a> (CRÂ S4), the latter within the <a href="Poway%2C%20California">Poway</a> city limits. In eastern Poway, SRÂ 67 veers east, eventually leaving the city and entering unincorporated <a href="Rock%20Haven%2C%20San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">Rock Haven</a>. The road continues near Rosemont, California before turning northeast and becoming Julian Road and then Main Street in downtown <a href="Ramona%2C%20California">Ramona</a>. SRÂ 67 ends at the intersection with <a href="California%20State%20Route%2078">SRÂ 78</a>; SRÂ 78 intersects to the northwest as Pine Street and continues northeast along Main Street towards <a href="Julian%2C%20California">Julian</a>.

SRÂ 67 is part of the <a href="California%20Freeway%20and%20Expressway%20System">California Freeway and Expressway System</a>, but is not part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. The route is named the CHP Officer Christopher D. Lydon Memorial Freeway from I-8 to Mapleview Street in <a href="Lakeside%2C%20California">Lakeside</a>. In 2013, SRÂ 67 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 94,000 between Broadway and Bradley Avenue (the highest AADT for the highway), and 18,100 between Rio Maria Road and Poway Road (the lowest AADT for the highway).

The "Julian road" had been constructed by 1872, and was used for <a href="stagecoaches">stagecoaches</a>. In 1883, "The San Diego Union and Daily Bee" described it as a "disgrace to the county. It could hardly be in a worse condition...Â and should be repaired immediately." On OctoberÂ 21, 1885, the county Board of Supervisors agreed to a realignment of the Julian road, in what was known as the Bernardo District, onto private property. The road was described in 1890 by "The San Diego Union and Daily Bee" as passing through farms, and the <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">grade</a> was "cut on the west side of the canyon and buttressed with granite the greater part of the way." The route continued towards Ramona through vineyards, passing by more boulders.

Between 1885 and 1891, the <a href="San%20Diego%2C%20Cuyamaca%2C%20and%20Eastern%20Railroad">San Diego, Cuyamaca, and Eastern Railroad</a> was extended from San Diego through El Cajon to the town of Foster, northeast of Lakeside. In 1896, the stagecoach line connected the terminus of the railroad line in Foster to Julian, and transported the San Diego newspapers to Ramona by 2:30 pm each day. The county began to survey a new routing of the Julian road in 1913 cutting through the El Monte Ranch, reducing the distance from San Diego to Julian by and removing some steep grades.

<a href="Construction%20bidding">Bidding</a> was conducted on the Julian road, then known as Road No.Â 3A, on JuneÂ 30, 1920; however, progress on the grading of the road fell behind the county engineer's expectations by October, with only of the road complete. The road was paved from Santee to El Cajon by the end of 1920. Between Foster and Julian, the paved road was opened in JulyÂ 1922, at a cost of $550,000 (about $ in dollars). The "Ramona Road" remained unpaved between the Mussey Grade and the road to Ballena, a distance of , and the estimated cost of paving it was $400,000 (about $ in dollars). In 1925, there were left of unpaved road between Ramona and Julian, and state and county taxes were to be used to fund this project. The Mussey Grade was completed in April 1925, marking the completion of the paved road between San Diego and Ramona.

San Diego County declared the Julian road a county boulevard in 1926, meaning that vehicles were required to stop before entering the highway. The road that would become SRÂ 67 was added to the state highway system in 1933, from El Cajon to near <a href="Santa%20Ysabel%2C%20California">Santa Ysabel</a>, and was designated as RouteÂ 198 in 1935. It consisted of Maine and Woodside avenues in Lakeside and Magnolia Avenue in the city of El Cajon all the way to <a href="U.S.%20Route%2080%20%28California%29">U.S. Route 80</a> (USÂ 80) at Main Street. Because of the construction of the San Vicente Reservoir north of Lakeside, a section of the road had to be submerged, and it was decided to relocate the road further west by the foot of <a href="Mount%20Woodson">Mount Woodson</a>. The road was allocated $830,784 in funding (about $ in dollars) to be realigned, widened, and repaved between Lakeside and Mount Woodson in 1942. Grading and paving of the part was scheduled for completion on DecemberÂ 15, 1943.

Funding was allocated for traffic signals on the portion between Main Street and Broadway in El Cajon in 1954. RouteÂ 198 also extended onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to <a href="California%20State%20Route%2094">SRÂ 94</a>. This portion was signed as Sign RouteÂ 67 by 1962, from Campo Road to USÂ 80. In the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>, RouteÂ 198 was renumbered as State RouteÂ 67; the portion south of I-8 was renumbered as <a href="California%20State%20Route%20125">SRÂ 125</a>.

The State Highway Commission decided to reroute SRÂ 67 through Lakeside in 1954, moving it closer to the San Diego River and away from the city center, using the land formerly occupied by the old railroad. In 1961, the construction of the San Vicente Freeway was listed as a high-priority project by the <a href="California%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">California Chamber of Commerce</a>. During 1964, the county of San Diego received $1Â million (about $ in dollars) to construct SRÂ 67 as a freeway from Pepper Drive to Broadway in the city of El Cajon. Another $1Â million (about $ in dollars) was allocated in 1965, and the project was extended to I-8. The freeway from I-8 to Pepper Drive was complete by 1967, when Caltrans announced that "yellow, non-reflectorized markers interspersed with raised yellow dots" would be installed on the freeway portion to delineate the shoulder; this was the first section to use them in the county. By December 1968, the freeway was complete from I-8 north to Woodside Avenue; the grade at the northern end was smoothed out during the widening of the road in early 1970. In March, the freeway was under construction from Woodside Avenue to the San Diego River, at a cost of $3.2Â million (about $ in dollars). The freeway portion opened on OctoberÂ 12, 1970; it was constructed four lanes wide.

It was planned that SRÂ 67 would be the eastern terminus of <a href="California%20State%20Route%2056">SRÂ 56</a>. On DecemberÂ 30, 1980, the City of Poway included SRÂ 56 in the city plan extending east through the city to a northern extension of <a href="SR%20125%20%28CA%29">SR 125</a>. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SRÂ 56 to SRÂ 67, although the City of Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in the city. There are no plans to construct the portion of SRÂ 56 east of I-15. Several arterial roads connect the eastern end of the SRÂ 56 freeway with SRÂ 67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (<a href="County%20Route%20S5%20%28California%29">CRÂ S5</a>), and Poway Road (<a href="County%20Route%20S4">CRÂ S4</a>).

The highway portion of SRÂ 67 was popularly known as "Slaughterhouse Alley" because of the high number of fatal accidents. The road was widened in 1979 to add a shoulder and passing lane between the north end of the freeway and Poway Road. During the construction, there were concerns about speeding cars putting the construction workers in danger. The total cost was $927,000 (about $ in dollars), and Asphalt Inc. performed the work.

The reputation of the highway continued into the early years of the 21st century. In 2000, a $1Â million project (about $ in dollars) was authorized to widen the shoulders of the road, after there were 413Â accidents and 15Â fatalities on SRÂ 67 from 1996 to 1999. At this time, County Supervisor Dianne Jacob proposed expanding the highway portion to four lanes along the entire route. Following a safety initiative, including the involvement of law enforcement and trucking companies, accidents and fatalities both decreased by the end of 2001. Accidents continued, however, and by November 2008, electronic signs were installed to inform motorists of their speed, and another publicity campaign had been launched. The reduction from two lanes to one lane heading southbound just after a curve has been blamed for at least some of the accidents, with collisions resulting from cars "jockeying" to be ahead. Head-on collisions are another source of crashes. Despite this, in 2009 Caltrans did not view the road as unsafe according to official metrics.

In May 2009, the <a href="San%20Diego%20Association%20of%20Governments">San Diego Association of Governments</a> (SANDAG) announced that fixing SRÂ 67 was numberÂ 17 on its priority list, resulting in an estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway that would not be limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the <a href="California%20Highway%20Patrol">California Highway Patrol</a> agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early DecemberÂ 2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SRÂ 67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.

In 1983, the Kassler Corporation was awarded a contract to renovate the interchange with I-8 for $9.1Â million (about $ in dollars). SRÂ 67 from Poway Road to the Poway city limits was proposed to be widened in 1985. There was a movement in 1987 to construct a northbound offramp at Woodside Avenue, due to traffic congestion at the Prospect Avenue offramp; however, it was never built. <a href="Call%20boxes">Call boxes</a> were installed on SRÂ 67 in 1994.

There was also a proposal in 2000 to renovate the interchange at Bradley Avenue. The next year, SANDAG approved the construction of a southern bypass of Ramona and widening from Vigilante Road to Dye Road for a cost of $200Â million as part of a 2030 transportation plan. The chairman of the Ramona Planning Group suggested calming traffic by using a <a href="roundabout">roundabout</a> instead of widening the highway.

The road's guardrails and signs sustained damage in the 2003 <a href="Cedar%20Fire%20%282003%29">Cedar Fire</a>. That year, there were plans to widen RouteÂ 67 from Mapleview Street to Dye Road; however, when threatened with a lawsuit from Save Our Forests and Ranchlands, SANDAG agreed to "reconsider" the project. Traffic jams were prevalent on October 21 and 22 in 2007, during the <a href="October%202007%20California%20wildfires">ongoing local wildfires</a> and the evacuation of Ramona on the narrow road.

"Heavy construction" of SRÂ 52 from SRÂ 125 eastward to SRÂ 67 began in February 2008, after it had been delayed by funding issues that were finally resolved in 2006 with voter-approved statewide transportation bonds. The interchange with SRÂ 52 began to be constructed in mid-June 2008. Completion was scheduled for 2010, but was delayed to early 2011 due to weather-related delays. This new interchange opened to traffic on MarchÂ 29, 2011. The cost of this project was $525 million, funded with state and federal funds as well as TransNet county sales tax revenue.

Olivia Manning

Olivia Mary Manning (2 March 1908Â âÂ 23 July 1980) was a British novelist, poet, writer, and reviewer. Her fiction and non-fiction, frequently detailing journeys and personal odysseys, were principally set in the United Kingdom, Europe, and the Middle East. She often wrote from her personal experience, though her books also demonstrate strengths in imaginative writing. Her books are widely admired for her artistic eye and vivid descriptions of place.

Manning's youth was divided between <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, giving her what she described as "the usual <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> sense of belonging nowhere". She attended art school and moved to London, where her first serious novel, "The Wind Changes," was published in 1937. In August 1939 she married <a href="R.%20D.%20Smith">R. D. Smith</a> ("Reggie"), a <a href="British%20Council">British Council</a> lecturer posted in <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>, Romania, and subsequently lived in Greece, Egypt, and Palestine as the Nazis overran Eastern Europe. Her experiences formed the basis for her best-known work, the six novels making up "The Balkan Trilogy" and "The Levant Trilogy", known collectively as "<a href="Fortunes%20of%20War%20%28novel%20series%29">Fortunes of War</a>". Critics judged her overall output to be of uneven quality, but this series, published between 1960 and 1980, was described by <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> as "the finest fictional record of the war produced by a British writer".

Manning returned to London after the war and lived there until her death in 1980; she wrote poetry, short stories, novels, non-fiction, reviews, and drama for the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a>. Both Manning and her husband had affairs, but they never contemplated divorce. Her relationships with writers such as <a href="Stevie%20Smith">Stevie Smith</a> and <a href="Iris%20Murdoch">Iris Murdoch</a> were difficult, as an insecure Manning was envious of their greater success. Her constant grumbling about all manner of subjects is reflected in her nickname, "Olivia Moaning", but Smith never wavered in his role as his wife's principal supporter and encourager, confident that her talent would ultimately be recognised. As she had feared, real fame only came after her death in 1980, when <a href="Fortunes%20of%20War%20%28TV%20series%29">an adaptation of "Fortunes of War"</a> was televised in 1987.

Manning's books have received limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender and are not easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> in decline. Her works are critical of war and racism, and <a href="colonialism">colonialism</a> and <a href="imperialism">imperialism</a>; they examine themes of displacement and physical and emotional alienation.

Olivia Manning was born in North End, Portsmouth on 2Â March 1908. Her father, Oliver Manning, was a naval officer who rose from naval trainee to <a href="lieutenant-commander">lieutenant-commander</a> despite a lack of formal schooling. At the age of 45, while visiting the port of <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, he met Olivia Morrow, a publican's daughter fourteen years his junior; they married less than a month later in December 1904, in the <a href="Presbyterian%20church">Presbyterian church</a> in her home town of <a href="Bangor%2C%20County%20Down">Bangor, County Down</a>.

Manning adored her womanising father who entertained others by singing <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> and reciting poetry he had memorised during long sea voyages. In contrast, her mother was bossy and domineering, with a "mind as rigid as cast-iron", and there were constant marital disputes. The initially warm relationship between mother and daughter became strained after the birth of Manning's brother Oliver in 1913; delicate and frequently ill, he was the centre of his mother's attention, much to the displeasure of Manning, who made several childish attempts to harm him. This unhappy, insecure childhood left a lasting mark on her work and personality.

Manning was educated privately at a small <a href="dame%20school">dame school</a> before moving to the north of Ireland in 1916, the first of several extended periods spent there while her father was at sea. In Bangor she attended Bangor Presbyterian School, and in Portsmouth Lyndon House School then <a href="Portsmouth%20Grammar%20School">Portsmouth Grammar School</a>, developing, as she recalled, "the usual Anglo-Irish sense of belonging nowhere". Schoolmates described her as shy and prone to tantrums; her tendency to tell boastful tall-tales about her family led to ostracism by her peers. Supported by her father, Manning read and wrote extensively, preferring novels, especially those by <a href="H.%20Rider%20Haggard">H. Rider Haggard</a>. Her mother discouraged such pursuits, and confiscated material she thought unsuitable; when she found her daughter reading the "<a href="Times%20Literary%20Supplement">Times Literary Supplement</a>" she scolded that "young men do not like women who read papers like that", and that Manning should focus on marketable job skills, such as typing.

Indeed, when financial circumstances forced Manning to leave school at sixteen, she worked as a <a href="Copy%20typist">typist</a> and spent some time as a junior in a beauty salon. A talented artist, she took evening classes at the <a href="Portsmouth%20Municipal%20School%20of%20Art">Portsmouth Municipal School of Art</a>, where a fellow student described her as intellectual and aloof. In May 1928, she had a painting selected for an exhibition at <a href="Southsea">Southsea</a>, and was subsequently offered a one-woman show of her works. Manning seemed to be poised for a career as an artist, but she had meanwhile continued her interest in literature, and at the age of twenty determined instead to be a writer. Her artist's eye is apparent in her later intense descriptions of landscapes.

Manning's first published works were three serialised detective novels, "Rose of Rubies", "Here is Murder" and "The Black Scarab" which appeared in the "<a href="Portsmouth%20News">Portsmouth News</a>" beginning in 1929 under the pseudonym Jacob Morrow. Manning did not acknowledge these books until the 1960s; their publication dates might have given away her age, a secret she kept even from her husband. Between 1929 and 1935 she wrote about 20 short stories, including a ghost story that was the first work to be published under her own name, though using initials to obscure her gender. Manning also wrote two literary novels, neither of which was accepted for publication. Her second manuscript sufficiently impressed <a href="Edward%20Garnett">Edward Garnett</a>, a literary editor at <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>, that he asked his assistant <a href="Hamish%20Miles">Hamish Miles</a> to write her a note of encouragement. Miles, a respected and well-connected literary adviser and translator in his late thirties, invited Manning to visit if she were ever in London. Manning, feeling stifled in Portsmouth, had already made efforts to move to the capital, but her meeting with Miles made her more determined. She succeeded in obtaining a typing job at the department store <a href="Peter%20Jones%20%28department%20store%29">Peter Jones</a>, and, despite opposition from her mother, moved into a run-down <a href="bed-sit">bed-sit</a> in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>.

Short of food and money, Manning spent long hours writing after work. Miles took Manning under his wing, dazzling her with dinners, literary conversation, and gossip, and providing unaccustomed support. A married man with two children, he told Manning that his wife was an invalid and no longer able to tolerate sex; they soon became lovers. Manning later recalled that "sex for both of them was the motivating charm of life".

A case of mistaken identity involving an artist with a similar name led Manning to a better-paid job <a href="Distressing">antiquing</a> furniture, at which she worked for more than two years, still writing in her spare time. She recalled this as "one of the happiest seasons" of her life. With Miles' encouragement she completed a novel, "The Wind Changes", and saw it published by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> in April 1937. The novel, set in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> in June 1921 during the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Irish War of Independence</a>, revolved around a woman torn between an Irish patriot and an English writer with pro-Republican sympathies. It was well received, with one reviewer commenting that "the novel shows unusual promise". Soon after, Miles learnt that he had an inoperable brain tumour, and disappeared from Manning's life. Since the affair had been kept secret she had difficulty obtaining information about him, and could not afford to visit him in the <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> hospital where he lay dying. She lost her job at Peter Jones, moved to a well-paid job at the <a href="Medici%20Society">Medici Society</a>, but was sacked when she refused her boss's order to give up novel-writing in the evening so as to conserve her energy for the day job. Manning obtained other work assessing new novels for their potential as films for <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>, but by the time she had saved sufficient money for a trip to Edinburgh, Miles was too ill to see her. He died in December 1937.

Miles did not normally introduce his literary friends to each other, but before his death, he had been forced by circumstance to introduce Manning to the poet <a href="Stevie%20Smith">Stevie Smith</a>. The two developed an immediate rapport and enjoyed exploring London's backstreets, with regular outings to museums, cinema, and visits to the <a href="Palmers%20Green">Palmers Green</a> home that Smith shared with an eccentric aunt. According to a mutual friend, Manning found in Smith's home "an atmosphere of security and comfort which must have made her room in <a href="Oakley%20Street%2C%20Chelsea">Oakley Street</a> seem even chillier and more threadbare". The novelist and critic <a href="Walter%20Allen">Walter Allen</a> met Manning in 1937 and observed that she had a "devastating" wit "and was as formidable a young woman as any in London". Manning and Smith, he added, were a malicious pair of snobs.

In July 1939, Walter Allen introduced Manning to the charming <a href="Marxist">Marxist</a> <a href="R.%20D.%20Smith">R. D. "Reggie" Smith</a>. Smith was a large, energetic man, possessed of a constant desire for the company of others. The son of a Manchester toolmaker, he had studied at <a href="Birmingham%20University">Birmingham University</a>, where he had been coached by the left-wing poet <a href="Louis%20MacNeice">Louis MacNeice</a> and founded the Birmingham Socialist Society. According to the British intelligence organisation <a href="MI5">MI5</a>, Smith had been recruited as a communist spy by <a href="Anthony%20Blunt">Anthony Blunt</a> on a visit to Cambridge University in 1938.

When he met Manning, Smith was on leave from his <a href="British%20Council">British Council</a> position as a lecturer in Romania. He had diligently prepared himself for the introduction to Manning by reading her works, and felt that her book "The Wind Changes" showed "signs of genius". He described Manning as a "jolie laide", possessing lovely hair, hands, eyes, and skin though an overlong nose, and fell in love at first sight. When he borrowed a <a href="Half%20crown%20%28British%20coin%29">half-crown</a> from her on their first meeting and repaid it the next day, he knew they would marry. Manning was less certain of the relationship, but Smith quickly moved into her flat, proposing in bed a few weeks later. They were married at Marylebone Registry Office on 18Â August 1939, with Stevie Smith and Louis MacNeice as witnesses. The bridegroom, unconventionally yet true to form, did not produce a ring for the ceremony. A few days after the wedding, the couple received word that Smith had been recalled to <a href="Bucharest">Bucharest</a>. They left within a matter of hours; Manning later wrote to Stevie Smith from Romania asking her to find out what had happened to their flat and to take care of her books while she was away.
The couple travelled by train to Bucharest, arriving on 3Â September 1939, the day Britain declared war on Germany. Between the two world wars, Romania had looked to France to guarantee its security against German territorial aspirations. The impact of the <a href="Munich%20Agreement">Munich Agreement</a> (1938), the <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">GermanâSoviet Non-Aggression Pact</a> (1939), and the <a href="Fall%20of%20France">Fall of France</a> (1940) increased German influence and control over the country, and included demands that Romania cede territory and resources. The couple's time in Bucharest coincided with the rise of fascist and <a href="totalitarian">totalitarian</a> power within ostensibly neutral Romania, while war threatened from without, driving thousands of refugees within its borders.

The Smiths initially rented a flat, but later moved in with the diplomat <a href="Adam%20Watson">Adam Watson</a>, who was working with the British Legation. Those who knew Manning at the time described her as a shy, provincial girl who had little experience with other cultures. She was both dazzled and appalled by Romania. The <a href="caf%C3%A9%20society">cafÃ© society</a>, with its wit and gossip, appealed to her, but she was repelled by the peasantry and the aggressive, often mutilated, beggars. Her Romanian experiences were captured in the first two volumes of "The Balkan Trilogy" ("<a href="The%20Great%20Fortune">The Great Fortune</a>" and "The Spoilt City"), considered one of the most important literary treatments of Romania during the war. In her novels, Manning described Bucharest as being on the margins of European civilisation, "a strange, half-Oriental capital" that was "primitive, bug-ridden and brutal", whose citizens were peasants, whatever their wealth or status.

Manning spent her days writing; her main project was a book about <a href="Henry%20Morton%20Stanley">Henry Morton Stanley</a> and his search for <a href="Emin%20Pasha">Emin Pasha</a>, but she also maintained an intimate correspondence with Stevie Smith, which was full of Bloomsbury gossip and intrigue. She undertook a dangerous journalistic assignment to interview the former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Romania">Romanian Prime Minister</a> <a href="Iuliu%20Maniu">Iuliu Maniu</a> in <a href="Cluj-Napoca">Cluj</a>, <a href="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>, at the time full of German troops, and soon to be transferred by Romania to Hungary as part of the <a href="Second%20Vienna%20Award">Second Vienna Award</a> of August 1940, imposed by the Germans and Italians. Like many of her experiences, the interview was to be incorporated into a future work; others included her impromptu <a href="baptism">baptism</a> of Smith with cold tea because she feared being separated from him after death, and Smith's production of a <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a> play, in which she was promised a prime role that was given to another.

Smith was relentlessly gregarious, and throughout his life, his warmth, wit, and friendliness earned him many friends and drinking companions. In contrast, Manning was reticent and uncomfortable in social settings and remained in the background. She acted, in her own words, as a "camp-follower", trailing after Smith as he went from bar to bar, often choosing to go home early and alone. While Manning remained faithful to Smith during the war, their friend <a href="Ivor%20Porter">Ivor Porter</a> was to report that Smith had numerous affairs.

The approaching war and rise of fascism and the <a href="Iron%20Guard">Iron Guard</a> in Romania disconcerted and frightened Manning. The abdication of <a href="Carol%20II%20of%20Romania">King Carol</a> and the advance of the Germans in September 1940 increased her fears, and she repeatedly asked Smith "But where will the Jews go?" Just before German troops entered Romania on 7 October at the invitation of the new dictator <a href="Ion%20Antonescu">Ion Antonescu</a>, Manning flew to Greece, followed a week later by Smith.

Manning was subject to anxieties bordering on paranoia throughout her life. She had good reason to be concerned about Smith, who travelled from Romania to Greece on the German <a href="Deutsche%20Luft%20Hansa">Lufthansa</a> airline â Lufthansa planes were sometimes diverted to <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> countries. He arrived safely, bringing a rucksack, a suitcase full of books, but no appropriate clothes for work. Smith relaunched his hectic social life, but his wife interacted little with the expatriate community, focussing instead on her writing. Nevertheless, this was a happy time for Manning; "Romania is abroad," said Manning, "but Greece is home". Manning had her admirers, including Terence Spencer, a British Council lecturer who acted as her companion while Smith was busy with other activities â he later appeared as the character Charles Warden in "Friends and Heroes", the third book of "The Balkan Trilogy". Soon after their arrival, Greece entered the war against the Axis. In spite of early successes against invading Italian forces, by April 1941 the country was at risk of invasion from the Germans; in a later poem Manning recalled the "horror and terror of defeat" of a people she had grown to love. The British Council advised its staff to evacuate, and on 18 April Manning and Smith left <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a> for Egypt on the "Erebus", the last civilian ship to leave Greece.

For the three dangerous days of the passage to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> the passengers subsisted on oranges and wine. On board with the Smiths were the novelist <a href="Robert%20Liddell">Robert Liddell</a>, the Welsh poet Harold Edwards, and their wivesâ the Smiths shared a cramped cabin with the Edwardses. Mrs. Edwards had brought with her a hat box full of expensive Parisian hats, which Manning kept placing in the passageway outside the cabin, and from whence Mrs. Edwards kept returning it. The two were not on speaking terms by the end of the voyage, but Manning had the last word: when Mrs. Edwards later opened her hatbox she found that Manning had crushed the hats with a chamberpot.

Arriving in Alexandria, the refugees gratefully devoured the food provided by the British military, but learned that the swastika was now flying over the Acropolis. Manning's first impressions of Egypt were of squalor and unreality: "For weeks we lived in a state of recoil". From Alexandria they went by train to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, where they renewed contact with Adam Watson, who was now Second Secretary at the British Embassy. He invited them to stay at his <a href="Garden%20City%20%28Cairo%29">Garden City</a> flat that overlooked the embassy.

Though nominally an independent country, Egypt had been effectively under British control since the late nineteenth century. With the outbreak of war, and under the terms of the <a href="Anglo-Egyptian%20treaty%20of%201936">Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936</a>, the country was under virtual occupation by the British. At this stage in the war, the Germans were advancing apparently unstoppably across the desert towards Egypt, and Cairo was rife with rumours and alarms. Manning was jittery and fearful. She was constantly anxious about illness and was indeed frequently unwell. Concerned, Smith suggested that it might be best if she returned to England, but she retorted "Wherever we go, we go together. If we return home, we both go. I won't have the war separating us. End of story." Her father had made her a firm believer in the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and the benefits it had brought the world, and Manning was a patriotic Briton, confident of ultimate Allied success. In Egypt, she confronted the fact that British occupation had never been popular. Smith quickly discovered the Anglo-Egyptian Union in <a href="Zamalek">Zamalek</a>, where he drank and talked politics and poetry. As usual, he was well liked, and according to <a href="Lawrence%20Durrell">Lawrence Durrell</a> often had a string of disreputable friends with him. Manning was much less popular. Durrell described her as a "hook-nosed condor", whose critical manner was unappreciated by many who knew her.

Manning was incensed that the British Council did not immediately find a job for Smith, whom she considered one of their most brilliant teachers. She took her revenge by writing scurrilous verse about the Council's representative, <a href="C.%20F.%20A.%20Dundas">C. F. A. Dundas</a>, later immortalised as the ineffectual Colin Gracey in "Fortunes of War". Manning's characters were often based on real people though she never drew precisely from life. Her mocking portrait of the British Council lecturer Professor Lord Pinkrose was loosely based on <a href="Edward%20Plunkett%2C%2018th%20Baron%20of%20Dunsany">Lord Dunsany</a>, sent to occupy the Byron Chair of English at <a href="Athens%20University">Athens University</a> in 1940. She also resented that Amy Smart, wife of <a href="Walter%20Smart">Walter Smart</a> and frequent patron of artists, poets, and writers in Cairo, paid so little attention to her and Smith; she later took revenge in a similar way.
In October 1941, Smith was offered a post as lecturer at <a href="Alexandria%20University">Farouk University</a> in Alexandria. The couple moved from Cairo to share a flat with fellow teacher Robert Liddell. The Germans regularly bombed the city, and the raids terrified Manning, who irritated Smith and Liddell by insisting that all three descend to the <a href="air%20raid%20shelter">air raid shelter</a> whenever the sirens wailed. Almost immediately after her arrival in Alexandria came devastating news of her brother Oliver's death in a plane crash. The emotional upset this caused prevented her from writing novels for several years.

The air raids became intolerable to Manning, and she soon moved back to Cairo, where in late 1941 she became press attachÃ© at the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Egypt">United States Legation</a>. In her spare time, she worked on "Guests at the Marriage", an unpublished prototype for "The Balkan Trilogy", as well as short stories and poetry, some of which she sent to Stevie Smith in the hopes of getting them published. Over the years, Stevie had brooded over Manning's desertion of their friendship to marry Reggie Smith, and around this time Stevie's jealousy took an overt form; in 1942 she wrote a poem entitled "Murder", in which a man stands beside a grave and admits, "My hand brought Reggie Smith to this strait bed â / Well, fare his soul well, fear not I the dead". In subsequent reprintings, the name "Reggie Smith" was replaced by "Filmer Smith", veiling the allusion, but Manning found out and was furious.

During her time in Egypt, Manning became a contributor to two Middle East-based literary magazines, ""Desert Poets"" and ""Personal Landscapes"", founded by <a href="Bernard%20Spencer">Bernard Spencer</a>, Lawrence Durrell, and <a href="Robin%20Fedden">Robin Fedden</a>. The latter sought to explore the "personal landscapes" of writers experiencing exile during the war. The founders, like Manning, maintained a strong attachment to Greece rather than an artistic and intellectual engagement with Egypt. In remembering the departure from Greece, Manning wrote "We faced the sea / Knowing until the day of our return we would be / Exiles from a country not our own." During their time in Egypt and Palestine, Manning and her husband maintained close links with refugee Greek writers, including translating and editing the work of <a href="George%20Seferis">George Seferis</a> and <a href="Elie%20Papadimitriou">Elie Papadimitriou</a>. Manning described her impressions of the Cairo poetry scene in "Poets in Exile" in <a href="Cyril%20Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a>'s magazine "Horizon". She defended the writers from the claim of a London reviewer that they were "out of touch", suggesting that their work was strengthened by their access to other cultures, languages, and writers. Her review was much critiqued by those featured, including Durrell who objected to Spencer's poetry being praised at his expense.

In 1942, Smith was appointed as Controller of English and Arabic Programming at the <a href="Palestine%20Broadcasting%20Service">Palestine Broadcasting Service</a> in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>; the job was to begin later, but in early July, with the German troops rapidly advancing on Egypt, he persuaded Manning to go ahead to Jerusalem to "prepare the way".

The couple were to spend three years in Jerusalem. On arrival, Manning approached the "<a href="The%20Jerusalem%20Post">Jerusalem Post</a>" for a job, and was soon appointed a reviewer. Between 1943 and 1944 she served as press assistant at Jerusalem's Public Information office, and then moved to the same position at the British Council office in Jerusalem. Manning continued to work on her book about Stanley and Emin Pasha, and took advantage of army drivers who were willing to give lifts to civilians; she visited Palestine, <a href="Petra">Petra</a> and <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, gathering material for future works.

In 1944, Manning became pregnant; the couple were overjoyed and Manning relaxed, becoming less critical of others, including her own mother, with whom she had long had a difficult relationship. Uncharacteristically, she rested, walked, painted and even knitted. In the seventh month, the baby died "in utero", and as was the practice at the time, Manning was obliged to wait two difficult months to deliver her dead child. "I am like a walking cemetery", she sorrowfully repeated during this period. Grief-stricken, Manning became paranoid, constantly afraid that Smith would be assassinated. Smith decided that she was having a nervous breakdown, and in October 1944 accompanied her to Cyprus for a month's holiday. Returning to Jerusalem, she was still far from well, and the poet <a href="Louis%20Lawler">Louis Lawler</a> noticed the discontent of this "strange and difficult woman", and Smith's "wonderfully patient" behaviour, despite Manning calling her husband by his last name throughout the period. Manning never fully recovered from her loss and was rarely to talk or write of it. She was unable to have further children and in the future directed her maternal feelings towards animals, especially cats.

During her time in the Middle East, Manning had picked up <a href="amoebic%20dysentery">amoebic dysentery</a>, which led to several admissions to hospitals in Cairo and Palestine. When the war in Europe ended in May 1945, her state of health led the couple to decide that Manning should return to England earlier than Smith. They travelled to <a href="Suez">Suez</a> together, where she sailed for home alone.

After a brief stay with her still-grieving parents in heavily bombed Portsmouth, Manning moved into a London <a href="apartment">flat</a>. Smith arrived in mid-1945 and found a job in the Features Department of the <a href="BBC">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> (BBC). He was identified as a Communist spy by MI5 in 1947 and placed under surveillance. According to his file, Smith had been working to increase Soviet influence in Romania and the Middle East throughout the war. Manning did not share her husband's political beliefs, but was quite aware that their phone was being tapped and feared that his open support for Communism would lead to him being sacked from the BBC. Smith was soon transferred away from Features to the less politically sensitive Drama department. The surveillance stopped when he resigned from the Communist Party after the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Russian invasion of Hungary</a> in 1956.

Manning also worked for the BBC; she wrote scripts for including adaptations of novels by <a href="George%20Eliot">George Eliot</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Bennett">Arnold Bennett</a> and <a href="Ada%20Leverson">Ada Leverson</a>. She completed her book on Stanley and Emin Pasha, titled "The Remarkable Expedition" in the UK and "The Reluctant Rescue" in the US, which was published in 1947, and subsequently reissued in 1985. The book received generally good reviews but remains comparatively unknown. In 1948, her book of short stories, "Growing Up", was published by <a href="Heinemann%20%28book%20publisher%29">Heinemann</a>, with the title story a fictionalised account of her affair with Hamish Miles. Manning was to remain with the publisher until 1974.

After living in a series of rented flats, in 1951 the couple moved to a house in <a href="St.%20John%27s%20Wood">St. John's Wood</a>, where they sublet rooms to lodgers such as the actors <a href="Julian%20Mitchell">Julian Mitchell</a> and <a href="Tony%20Richardson">Tony Richardson</a>. Fuelled by plenty of <a href="gin%20and%20tonic">gin and tonic</a> to cover her shyness, Manning could be a witty participant in London's literary scene; as in childhood she was given to making boastful inventions, such as claiming a family relationship to <a href="Marie%20Adelaide%20Belloc%20Lowndes">Marie Belloc Lowndes</a> and that she had received a marriage proposal from <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> the morning after his wife's death. Her insecurities also showed in other ways: she was very anxious about finances, and always alert for ways to make and save money. After the war both she and Smith were unfaithful. At parties, Smith would regularly ask other women if they were interested in extramarital encounters, while Manning claimed to have had affairs with both <a href="William%20Gerhardie">William Gerhardie</a> and <a href="Henry%20Green">Henry Green</a>, and engaged in an unrequited pursuit of her lodger, Tony Richardson. Jerry Slattery, her doctor, became her long-term lover; her affair came as a shock to Smith, who felt he must have disappointed his wife. After a difficult start, Smith adjusted and soon became a close friend of Slattery. Manning's adultery in some ways made it easier for Smith to justify his own frequent affairs, including his longstanding relationship with Diana Robson, who was to become his second wife. Manning never paid undue attention to his infidelities, usually responding, "you know what Reggie's like". The two never contemplated divorce, believing that marriage was a lifelong commitment.

Manning's first post-<a href="war%20novel">war novel</a>, "Artist Among the Missing", an evocative account of life in the Middle East, was published in 1949 and received mixed reviews. She worked on an Irish travel book, "The Dreaming Shore", which drew on her Anglo-Irish upbringing, but proved "a millstone" as it required multiple expensive journeys to Ireland. The book was notable for her view that Ireland would one day be united. Manning continued the series of publications with "School for Love", published in 1951. The novel concerned a boy growing up in Palestine during the Second World War. With its publication, Smith, on whom Manning relied heavily for literary judgment, help, and support, boasted that "My Olivia is what might be called an established author". The novel was generally well-received, but faced the possibility of a libel suit from <a href="Clarissa%20Graves">Clarissa Graves</a>, sister of <a href="Robert%20Graves">Robert</a> on whom Miss Bohun, one of the novel's characters, may have been based.

Manning supplemented her book writing by reviewing for "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>", "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>", "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>", "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" and others, as well as making occasional contributions to the "Palestine Post". Her fourth novel, "A Different Face", was published in 1953. Set in a drab city based on Manning's hometown of Portsmouth, it chronicled the main character's attempts to leave his birthplace. The book was not well-reviewed, and as was frequently the case, Manning felt slighted, feeling that she did not get the reviews she deserved. Neurotic self-doubt and perfectionism made her difficult and easily offended, and she was very aware of younger writers outstripping her. Such an author was <a href="Iris%20Murdoch">Iris Murdoch</a>, with whom Manning shared an interest in <a href="UFO">flying saucers</a> and an uneasy friendship that was tinged with jealousy at the younger Murdoch's greater success. Manning knew that she was spiteful, but could not help herself, frequently critiquing writer friends to others. She consistently praised and admired <a href="Ivy%20Compton-Burnett">Ivy Compton-Burnett</a> to whom she had been introduced in 1945, and whose friendship she greatly valued. She complained about her publisher Heinemann and her lack of recognition from her peers: <a href="Anthony%20Powell">Anthony Powell</a> called her "the world's worst grumbler", and the publisher remembered that she was "never an easy author to handle". A friend gave her the nickname "Olivia Moaning", which was picked up by others, much to Manning's annoyance.

In 1955 Manning published "The Doves of Venus", which drew on her experiences in London in the 1930s; the two friends, Ellie Parsons and Nancy Claypole, bore similarities to Manning and Stevie Smith. In the book, an isolated Ellie seeks to escape a stultifying mother. The reviews were generally favourable, but Manning was not satisfied. Perhaps annoyed at her depiction in the novel, Stevie Smith wrote what Manning described as a "bitchy review"; the two great friends barely spoke thereafter, despite Smith's efforts at a rapprochement. Eventually, Manning grudgingly forgave her: learning of Smith's final illness, she remarked, "Well, if she's really ill, we'll have to let bygones be bygones."

Much time and focus were given to animals, especially the <a href="Siamese%20cat">Siamese cat</a>s of which Manning was especially fond. She was very concerned about the health and comfort of her pets, taking them on visits to friends, along with hot water bottles for them in case the temperature dropped. She frequently sacked vets â telling one "I do not pay you to tell me that there is nothing wrong with my animal"Â â and trying animal faith healers at times. She was also a committed supporter of organisations combating animal cruelty. Her love and interest in cats was illustrated in her book "Extraordinary Cats", published in 1967.

In December 1956, Manning published "My Husband Cartwright", a series of twelve sketches about Smith that had originally appeared in <a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>. It was not widely reviewed, and as usual, Manning was frustrated and annoyed. The book was to be a precursor of her portrait of her husband in "Fortunes of War", detailing comic episodes that highlighted Smith's character, including his gregarious nature and interest in social issues: "My husband Cartwright is a lover of his fellow-men. Lovers of their fellow-men can be maddeningÂ ... While lecturing abroad he suddenly conceived a resentment of 'sights' especially 'useless' sights, such as ruins or tombs. You might suppose that were it not for such distractions as Tiberias, the Valley of the Kings or Hadrian's Villa, tourists abroad would occupy themselves solely in alleviating poverty."

Between 1956 and 1964 Manning's main project was "The Balkan Trilogy", a sequence of three novels based on her experiences during the Second World War; as usual she was supported and encouraged by Smith. The books describe the marriage of Harriet and Guy Pringle as they live and work in Romania and Greece, ending with their escape to Alexandria in 1941 just ahead of the Germans. Guy, a man at once admirable and unsatisfactory, and Harriet, a woman alternately proud and impatient, move from early passion to acceptance of difference. Manning described the books as long chapters of an autobiography, and early versions were written in the first person, though there was significant fictionalisation. While Manning had been 31 and Smith 25 at the outset of war, Manning's alter ego Harriet Pringle was a mere 21, and her husband a year older. Manning was a writer by profession, while her creation was not.

The first book in the trilogy, "The Great Fortune", received mixed reviews, but subsequent volumes, "The Spoilt City" and "Friends and Heroes" were generally well-received; <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> announced that Manning was "among the most accomplished of our women novelists" and comparisons were made to <a href="Lawrence%20Durrell">Lawrence Durrell</a>, <a href="Graham%20Greene">Graham Greene</a>, <a href="Evelyn%20Waugh">Evelyn Waugh</a> and <a href="Anthony%20Powell">Anthony Powell</a>. There were a few carping voices, and as usual, they ignited Manning's ire.

Following the publication of the final volume of "The Balkan Trilogy" in 1965, Manning worked on her cat memoir and a collection of short stories, "A Romantic Hero and Other Stories", both of which were published in 1967. Another novel, "The Play Room" (published as "The Camperlea Girls" in the US), appeared in 1969. The book of short stories and "The Play Room" both contained homosexual themes, a topic which interested Manning. The latter was a less than successful exploration of the lives and interests of adolescents, though the reviews were generally encouraging. A film version was proposed, and <a href="Ken%20Annakin">Ken Annakin</a> asked her to write the script. The movie, with more explicit lesbian scenes than the book, was all but made before the money ran out; a second version, with a very different script, was also developed but came to nothing. "Everything fizzled out", she said. "I wasted a lot of time and that is something which you cannot afford to do when you are sixty"; in keeping with her obfuscations about her age, she was actually sixty-two.

The 1970s brought a number of changes to the household: the couple moved to a smaller apartment following Smith's early retirement from the BBC and 1972 appointment as a lecturer at the <a href="New%20University%20of%20Ulster">New University of Ulster</a> in <a href="Coleraine">Coleraine</a>. The couple subsequently lived apart for long periods, as Manning rejected the idea of moving to Ireland.

Manning was always a close observer of life, and gifted with a photographic memory. She told her friend <a href="Kay%20Dick">Kay Dick</a> that, "I write out of experience, I have no fantasy. I don't think anything I've experienced has ever been wasted. Her 1974 novel "The Rain Forest" showed off her creative skills in her portrayal of a fictional island in the Indian Ocean and its inhabitants. Set in 1953, the novel's central characters are a British couple; the book examines their personal experiences and tragedies against the background of a violent end to colonial British rule. The book is one of Manning's lesser-known books, and she was disappointed that it was not shortlisted for the <a href="Booker%20prize">Booker prize</a>.

Early in 1975 Manning began "The Danger Tree", which for a time she described as "The Fourth Part of the Balkan Trilogy"; in the event, it became the first novel in "The Levant Trilogy", continuing the story of the Pringles in the Middle East. The first book proved "a long struggle" to write, in part because of Manning's lack of confidence in her powers of invention: the book juxtaposes the Desert War experiences of a young officer, Simon Boulderstone, with the securer lives of the Pringles and their circle. Manning, fascinated by sibling relationships, and remembering the death of her own brother, also examined the relationship between Simon and his elder brother, Hugo. She felt inadequate in her ability to write about soldiers and military scenes; initial reviewers agreed, finding her writing unconvincing and improbable, though subsequent reviewers have been considerably kinder.

While some parts of the book were inventions, she also made use of real-life incidents. The opening chapter of "The Danger Tree" describes the accidental death of the young son of Sir Desmond and Lady Hooper. The incident was based on fact: Sir Walter and Lady Amy Smart's eight-year-old boy was killed when he picked up a <a href="Model%2024%20grenade">stick bomb</a> during a desert picnic in January 1943. Just as described in the novel, his grief-stricken parents had tried to feed the dead boy through a hole in his cheek. Manning had long been resentful at the Smarts' failure to include her and Smith in their artistic circle in Cairo. The scene was considered in poor taste even by Manning's friends, who were also outraged that the quiet and faithful Lady Smart was associated with Manning's very different Lady Hooper. Though both Sir Walter and his wife had died by the time of publication, Manning's publisher received a solicitor's letter written on behalf of the Smart family, objecting to the scene and requiring that there should be no further reference to the incident or to the couple in future volumes. Manning ignored both requests. She based the character of Aidan Pratt on the actor, writer, and poet <a href="Stephen%20Haggard">Stephen Haggard</a>, whom she had known in Jerusalem. Like Pratt, Haggard committed suicide on a train from Cairo to Palestine, but in Haggard's case it followed the end of a relationship with a beautiful Egyptian woman, rather than unrequited homosexual love. After years of complaints about her publisher Heinemann, Manning moved to <a href="Weidenfeld%20%26amp%3B%20Nicolson">Weidenfeld & Nicolson</a>, and remained with them until the end of her life. "The Danger Tree" was a considerable critical success, and though Manning was disappointed yet again that her novel was not shortlisted for the Booker prize, "<a href="The%20Yorkshire%20Post">The Yorkshire Post</a>" selected it as their Best Novel of 1977. This award followed her appointment as a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="1976%20Birthday%20Honours">1976 Birthday Honours</a>.

With <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Field Marshal Montgomery</a>'s "Memoirs" as her guide, Manning found battle scenes easier to write in the second volume of the trilogy, "The Battle Lost and Won". After a slow start, Manning wrote with certainty and speed; the book was completed in a record seven months and published in 1978. The book follows the Pringles as <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Rommel</a> and the <a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a> approach Alexandria, where Guy is teaching. Egypt remains a place of privilege and sexual exchange for the non-combatants and the Pringles' marriage slowly disintegrates.

Manning was deeply affected by the sudden death in 1977 of Jerry Slattery, her lover and confidant for more than a quarter of a century. Manning's last years were also made difficult by physical deterioration; <a href="arthritis">arthritis</a> increasingly affected her, leading to <a href="hip%20replacement">hip replacement</a>s in 1976 and in 1979 and she suffered poor health related to amoebic dysentery caught in the Middle East. Manning began work on the final novel in "The Levant Trilogy", "The Sum of Things", in which Harriet agrees to sail home to the UK, but having said goodbye to Guy, changes her mind. The novel describes Harriet's travels in Syria, Lebanon and Palestine, observes Guy's supposed widowerhood in Cairo after he hears of the sinking of Harriet's ship, and follows Simon Boulderstone's injury during the battle of <a href="El%20Alamein">El Alamein</a> and recovery.

"The Sum of Things" was published posthumously, for on 4Â July 1980 Manning suffered a severe stroke while visiting friends in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. She died in hospital in <a href="Ryde">Ryde</a> on 23Â July; somewhat typically, Smith, having been recalled from Ireland, was not present when she died. He could not bear to see her "fade away" and had gone to London to keep himself busy. Manning had long predicted that the frequently tardy Smith would be late for her funeral, and he almost was. His mourning period, characterised by abrupt transitions from weeping to almost hysterical mirth, was precisely how Manning had imagined Guy Pringle's reaction to Harriet's supposed death in "The Sum of Things". Manning was cremated and her ashes buried at <a href="Billingham%20Manor">Billingham Manor</a> on the Isle of Wight.

Manning had long complained about the lack of recognition she had received as a writer and was not consoled when her husband and friends responded that her talent would be recognised, and her works read for years to come. "I want to be really famous now, "Now"", she retorted. As it happened, her renown and readership developed substantially after her death; a <a href="Fortunes%20of%20War%20%28TV%20series%29">television serialisation</a> of "Fortunes of War" starring <a href="Emma%20Thompson">Emma Thompson</a> and <a href="Kenneth%20Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a> finally came to fruition in 1987, bringing her work to a wider audience.

The posthumous popularity of "Fortunes of War" notwithstanding, most of Manning's books are rarely read and have received little critical attention. Of her books, only "Fortunes of War", "School for Love", "The Doves of Venus", "The Rain Forest" and "A Romantic Hero" remain in print. Some of her novels, most often "Fortunes of War", have been translated into French, German, Finnish, Swedish, Danish, Spanish, Greek, Romanian and Hebrew. As in her lifetime, opinions are divided; some assert that her books are "flawed by self-indulgence and a lack of self-judgment", and criticise portrayals of ethnic and religious groups as stereotyped and caricatured. Others praise tight, perceptive and convincing narratives and excellent characterisation. Her plots are often described as journeys, odysseys and quests in both literal and metaphorical senses. Manning's talent for "exquisite evocations of place", including physical, cultural and historical aspects have been widely admired, and the critic Walter Allen complimented her "painter's eye for the visible world".

Manning's best known works, the six books comprising "Fortunes of War", have been described as "the most underrated novels of the twentieth century" and the author as "among the greatest practitioners of 20th-century "<a href="roman-fleuve">roman-fleuve</a>"". Written during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> more than sixteen years after the period described, "The Balkan Trilogy", set in Romania and Greece, is considered one of the most important literary treatments of the region in wartime, while criticised for the Cold War era images of <a href="Balkanism">Balkanism</a>, and for Manning's inability to "conceal her antipathy towards all things Romanian". "The Levant Trilogy", set in the Middle East, is praised for its detailed description of Simon Boulderstone's desert war experience and the juxtaposition of the Pringles and their marriage with important world events. Excerpts from the novels have been reprinted in collections of women's war writing.
Theodore Steinberg argues for the "Fortunes of War" to be seen as an <a href="epic%20%28genre%29">epic</a> novel, noting its broad scope and the large cast of interesting characters set at a pivotal point of history. As with other epic novels, the books examine intertwined personal and national themes. There are frequent references to the <a href="Trojan%20War">Fall of Troy</a>, including Guy Pringle's production of Shakespeare's "<a href="Troilus%20and%20Cressida">Troilus and Cressida</a>" in which British expatriates play themselves while Romania and Europe mirror the doomed Troy. In Steinberg's perspective, the books also challenge the typically male genre conventions of the epic novel by viewing the war principally through the eyes of a female character "who frequently contrasts her perceptions with those of the men who surround her". In contrast, Adam Piette views the <a href="novel%20sequence">novel sequence</a> as a failed epic, the product of a Cold War desire to repress change as illustrated by "Harriet's self-pityingly dogged focus on their marriage" without dealing with the radicalism of the war, and fate of its victims as represented by Guy and his political engagement.

Manning's other works have largely been described as precursors to the two trilogies. Her pre-war novel, "The Wind Changes" (1937), set in Ireland, anticipates the future works in its "subtle exploration of relationships against a backdrop of war". Her post-war works, which are alternately set at home and abroad, are considered first, less than successful steps in clarifying her ideas about an expatriate war and how to write about it. Novels and stories set in England and Ireland are permeated by staleness and discontent, while those set abroad highlight the excitement and adventure of her later works. Two books set in Jerusalem, "The Artist Among the Missing" (1949) and "School for Love" (1951), her first commercial and critical success, are also first steps in exploring themes such war, colonialism and British imperialism.

Manning wrote reviews, radio adaptations and scripts and several non-fiction books. Her book "The Remarkable Expedition" (1947) about Emin Pasha and Henry Stanley was generally well reviewed, and when reissued in 1985 was praised for its humour, story telling and fairness to both subjects. Her travel book about Ireland, "The Dreaming Shore" (1950), received a mixed review even from her old friend Louis MacNeice, but extracts from this and other of Manning's Irish writing have subsequently been admired and anthologised. Manning's book "Extraordinary cats" (1967) proved to be chiefly about her own well-loved pets, and Stevie Smith's review in the "Sunday Times" complained that the book was "more agitated than original". She also published two collections of short stories, the well-reviewed "Growing Up" (1946) and "A Romantic Hero and Other Stories" (1967); the latter included eight stories from the earlier volume, and is imbued with a sense of mortality.

In contrast to other women's war fiction of the period, Manning's works do not recount life on the <a href="home%20front">home front</a>. Instead, her Irish and Second World War fiction observe combatants and non-combatants at the front and behind the lines. Wars, in Manning's view, are battles for place and influence, and "with her range of images and illusions, Manning reminds us that wars over land have been a constant". Her books do not celebrate British heroism nor the innocence of civilians, emphasising instead that the causes and dangers of war come as much from within as from without, with the gravest threats coming from fellow Britons. Military men are far from heroic, and official British responses are presented as farcical. In the "Fortunes of War", the conflict is viewed largely from the perspective of a civilian woman, an observer, though later books include Simon Boulderstone's soldier's view of battle. Views differ on her success in the "Fortunes of War" battlescenes; initial reviews by <a href="Auberon%20Waugh">Auberon Waugh</a> and <a href="Hugh%20Massie">Hugh Massie</a> criticised them as implausible and not fully realised, but later commentators have describing her depiction of battle as vivid, poignant and largely convincing. Her books serve as an indictment of war and its horrors; William Gerhardie noted in 1954 of "Artist among the Missing" that "it is war seen in a compass so narrowed down that the lens scorches and all but ignites the paper". There is a strong focus of the impermanence of life; death and mortality are a constant presence and preoccupation for civilian and soldier alike, and repetitionÂ â of stories, events and deathsÂ â used to give "the impression of lives trapped in an endless war" for which there is no end in sight.

A major theme of Manning's works is the British empire in decline. Her fiction contrasts <a href="deterministic">deterministic</a>, imperialistic views of history with one that accepts the possibility of change for those displaced by colonialism. Manning's works take a strong stance against British imperialism, and are harshly critical of racism, anti-Semitism and oppression at the end of the British colonial era. "British imperialism is shown to be a corrupt and self-serving system, which not only deserves to be dismantled but which is actually on the verge of being dismantled", writes Steinberg. The British characters in Manning's novels almost all assume the legitimacy of British superiority and imperialism and struggle with their position as oppressors who are unwelcome in countries they have been brought up to believe welcome their colonising influence. In this view, Harriet's character, marginalised as an exile and a woman, is both oppressor and oppressed, while characters such as Guy, Prince Yakimov and Sophie seek to exert various forms of power and authority over others, reflecting in microcosm the national conflicts and imperialism of the British Empire. Phyllis Lassner, who has written extensively on Manning's writing from a colonial and post-colonial perspective, notes how even sympathetic characters are not excused their complicity as colonisers; the responses of the Pringles assert "the vexed relationship between their own status as colonial exiles and that of the colonised" and native Egyptians, though given very little direct voice in "The Levant Trilogy", nevertheless assert <a href="subjectivity">subjectivity</a> for their country.

In "The Artist Among the Missing" (1949), Manning illustrates the racial tensions that are created when imperialism and <a href="multiculturalism">multiculturalism</a> mix, and, as in her other war novels, evaluates the political bind in which the British seek to defeat racist Nazism while upholding British colonial exploitation. The "School for Love" (1951) is the tale of an orphaned boy's journey of disillusionment in a city that is home to Arabs, Jews and a repressive, colonial presence represented in the novel by the cold, self-righteous, and anti-Semitic character of Miss Bohun.

Manning explores these themes not only in her major novels set in Europe and the Middle East, but also in her Irish fiction, "The Wind Changes" (1937) and eight short stories which were mostly written early in her career. In these works, colonialist attitudes are reproduced by Manning's stereotyping of Catholic southerners as wild, primitive and undisciplined, while northerners live lives of well-ordered efficiency. Displaced principal characters struggle to find their place in social groups whose values they no longer accept. Manning has also been noted for her direct and early focus on the impact of the end of colonial rule. "The Rain Forest" (1974) presents a later, highly pessimistic view, satirising British expatriate values on a fictional island. It also critiques those involved in the independence movement, expressing a disillusioned view of the island's future post-independence prospects.

Displacement and alienation are regular themes in Manning's books. Characters are often isolated, physically and emotionally removed from family and familiar contexts and seeking a place to belong. This crisis of identity may reflect that of Manning herself as the daughter of an Irish mother and a British naval officer. "I'm really confused about what I am, never really feeling that I belong in either place", she told an interviewer in 1969. In Manning's war fiction, conflict creates additional anxiety, emotional displacement and distance, with characters unable to communicate with each other. Eve Patten notes the "pervasive sense of <a href="liminality">liminality</a>" and the recurrent figure of the <a href="refugee">refugee</a> in Manning's work. Early literary interest in displacement was reinforced by Manning's own terrifying and disorientating experiences as a refugee during the war. Her travels also brought her into direct contact with the far worse plight of other war refugees, including Jewish asylum-seekers who were leaving Romania aboard the "<a href="Struma%20disaster">Struma</a>". Exile had its rewards for literary refugees such as Manning, offering exposure to different cultures and "the sense of a greater, past civilisation", as she described in her 1944 review of British poetry. Her writing reflects her deep concern for the realities of most refugees, who are portrayed as "a degraded and demoralised <a href="Other%20%28philosophy%29">Other</a>", challenging complacent Western notions of stability and nationality.

Manning has been classified as an <a href="Orientalism%20%28book%29">Orientalist</a> writer, whose depictions of cultures frequently emphasise exoticism and alien landscape. This feature has been most closely examined in her novels set in Romania. In these, scholars note Manning's positioning of Romania as an exotic "Other", a legacy of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> located at the limits of civilised Europe and on the frontier with the uncivilised Orient. Her negative perceptions of Romanian "Otherness" include a childlike population living decadent lives, passive and immoral women, corruption, and a wild, untamed environment. These are contrasted with more positive reactions to Greece and Western Europe as the centre of civilising and orderly life in other books. In keeping with colonial construction of exoticism in Western literature, "otherness" is increasingly domesticated as characters recognise, with greater exposure to the country, links to Western culture. Her depiction of Romania led to "Fortunes of War" being restricted as seditious writing under Romania's Communist government.

Manning's books are not easily classified as a part of the feminist canon. Manning supported the rights of women, particularly equal literary fees, but had no sympathy for the <a href="women%27s%20movement">women's movement</a>, writing that "[t]hey make such an exhibition of themselves. None can be said to be beauties. Most have faces like porridge." In Manning's books, the word "feminine" is used in a derogatory sense, and tends to be associated with female complacency, foolishness, artifice and deviousness, and fulfilment for women comes in fairly conventional roles of wife, mother and the private domain. <a href="Elizabeth%20Bowen">Elizabeth Bowen</a> remarked that Manning had "an almost masculine outfit in the way of experience" that influenced her writing about women and the war. Manning viewed herself not as a female writer, but as a writer who happened to be a woman, and early in her career she obscured her gender using a pseudonym and initials. Manning found it easier to create male characters, and in general her novels tend to minimise differences in gender, writing about people rather than women in particular. Harriet Pringle, for example, moves through processes of self-discovery and empowerment as an individual rather than in feminist solidarity with her sex. In Manning's "The Doves of Venus" (1960), based on Manning's friendship with Stevie Smith, female characters display "the 1950s anger more often associatedÂ ... with young men". Treglown comments on how Manning's early books generally took a forthright approach to sex, often initiated by female characters. Her approach became more nuanced in later volumes, with a subtler depiction of sex, sensuality and sexual frustration in "Fortunes of War". The <a href="Analytical%20psychology">Jungian</a> critic Richard Sugg interpreted Manning's female characters as punishing themselves for breaching society's gender norms, including for having erotic feelings. In contrast, Treglown hypothesised that it reflected Manning's ongoing grieving for her stillborn child.

Ace Books

Ace Books is an American specialty publisher of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> books. The company was founded in New York City in 1952 by <a href="A.%20A.%20Wyn">Aaron A. Wyn</a> and began as a genre publisher of <a href="mystery%20fiction">mysteries</a> and <a href="western%20%28genre%29">westerns</a>. It soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction (sf) title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, <a href="Gothic%20fiction">gothic</a> novels, media <a href="tie-in">tie-in</a> <a href="novelizations">novelizations</a>, and <a href="romance%20novel">romances</a>. Ace became known for the "<a href="dos-%C3%A0-dos%20binding%23T%C3%AAte-b%C3%AAche">tÃªte-bÃªche</a>" binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this "Ace Double" format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound "tÃªte-bÃªche", until 1973.

Ace, along with <a href="Ballantine%20Books">Ballantine Books</a>, was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, <a href="Donald%20A.%20Wollheim">Donald A. Wollheim</a> and <a href="Terry%20Carr">Terry Carr</a>, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to <a href="Grosset%20%26amp%3B%20Dunlap">Grosset & Dunlap</a>. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third <a href="Ace%20Science%20Fiction%20Specials">Ace Science Fiction Specials</a> series, for which Carr was the editor. Further <a href="mergers%20and%20acquisitions">mergers and acquisitions</a> resulted in the company becoming a part of <a href="Berkley%20Books">Berkley Books</a>. Ace then became an <a href="imprint%20%28trade%20name%29">imprint</a> of <a href="Penguin%20Group">Penguin Group (USA)</a>.

Editor <a href="Donald%20A.%20Wollheim">Donald A. Wollheim</a> was working at <a href="Avon%20%28publishers%29">Avon Books</a> in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade <a href="A.%20A.%20Wyn">A. A. Wyn</a> to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a>s under the name <a href="A.%20A.%20Wyn%27s%20Magazine%20Publishers">A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers</a>. His magazines included "Ace Mystery" and "Ace Sports", and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at <a href="Pyramid%20Books">Pyramid Books</a>. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound "<a href="dos-%C3%A0-dos%20binding%23T%C3%AAte-b%C3%AAche">tÃªte-bÃªche</a>": <a href="Keith%20Vining">Keith Vining</a>'s "Too Hot for Hell", backed with <a href="Samuel%20W.%20Taylor">Samuel W. Taylor</a>'s "The Grinning Gismo", priced at 35 <a href="Cent%20%28currency%29">cents</a>, with serial number D-01. A "tÃªte-bÃªche" book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle (sometimes with advertising pages in between). This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace's; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers, on the premise that this would help new writers gain readers. The main drawback of the "Ace Double" format was that the two books had to fit a fixed page length (usually totalling between 256 and 320 low-height pages); thus one or both novels might be cut or revised to fit. Despite the tag "Complete and Unabridged" on the cover, books so labeled were sometimes still abridged.

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>'s first novel, "Junkie" (written under the pseudonym "William Lee"), and many novels by <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>, <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>, <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>, <a href="Harry%20Whittington%20%28author%29">Harry Whittington</a>, and <a href="Louis%20L%27Amour">Louis L'Amour</a>, including those written under his pseudonym "Jim Mayo".

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent's "Life with Lancelot", backed with <a href="William%20Barton%20%28writer%29">William Barton</a>'s "Hunting on Kunderer", issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the "Ace Double" name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than "tÃªte-bÃªche".

Ace's second title was a western (also "tÃªte-bÃªche"): <a href="William%20Colt%20MacDonald">William Colt MacDonald</a>'s "Bad Man's Return", bound with <a href="J.%20Edward%20Leithead">J. Edward Leithead</a>'s "Bloody Hoofs". Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as <a href="P.%20G.%20Wodehouse">P. G. Wodehouse</a>'s "<a href="Quick%20Service">Quick Service</a>", bound with his "<a href="The%20Code%20of%20the%20Woosters">The Code of the Woosters</a>". In 1953, <a href="A.E.%20van%20Vogt">A.E. van Vogt</a>'s "<a href="The%20World%20of%20Null-A">The World of Null-A</a>", bound with his "The Universe Maker", appeared; this was Ace's first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released <a href="Theodore%20S.%20Drachman">Theodore S. Drachman</a>'s "Cry Plague!", with a plot that could be regarded as sf, but the book it was bound withâ<a href="Leslie%20Edgley">Leslie Edgley</a>'s "The Judas Goat"âwas not sf .) Another sf double followed later in 1953, and sf rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace's business. By 1955, the company released more sf titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, sf titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid <a href="juvenile%20delinquent">juvenile delinquent</a> novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, "The Young Wolves" by Edward De Roo and D-378, "Out for Kicks" by Wilene Shaw.

By the late 1950s, Ace's output was approaching one hundred titles a year, still heavily dominated by the primary genres. Almost all the books were 35 cents, though some slim single volumes were 25 cents, and a handful were half a dollar. In the early '60s, rising costs finally forced an increase in the price of the books, and more books appeared at 40 cents, 45 cents and higher. A few thick volumes, such as the 1967 paperback of <a href="Frank%20Herbert">Frank Herbert</a>'s "<a href="Dune%20%28novel%29">Dune</a>", were priced at 95 cents. With <a href="Ballantine%20Books">Ballantine Books</a>, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for sf, but none matched the influence of either company.

Market dominance was not only reflected in numbers of books publishedâAce published, during this period, the first novels of authors such as <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a> ("<a href="Solar%20Lottery">Solar Lottery</a>", 1955, D-103, bound with <a href="Leigh%20Brackett">Leigh Brackett</a>'s "The Big Jump"); <a href="Gordon%20R.%20Dickson">Gordon R. Dickson</a> ("Alien from Arcturus", 1956, D-139, bound with <a href="Nick%20Boddie%20Williams">Nick Boddie Williams</a>' "The Atom Curtain"), <a href="Samuel%20R.%20Delany">Samuel R. Delany</a> ("The Jewels of Aptor", 1962, F-173, bound with <a href="James%20White%20%28author%29">James White</a>'s "Second Ending"), <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a> ("<a href="Rocannon%27s%20World">Rocannon's World</a>", 1966, G-574, bound with <a href="Avram%20Davidson">Avram Davidson</a>'s "The Kar-Chee Reign"), <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a> ("<a href="...And%20Call%20Me%20Conrad">This Immortal</a>", 1966, F-393),
and <a href="R.%20A.%20Lafferty">R. A. Lafferty</a>'s "<a href="Past%20Master%20%28novel%29">Past Master</a>" (1968, H-54).

In 1964, science fiction author <a href="Terry%20Carr">Terry Carr</a> joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the <a href="Ace%20Science%20Fiction%20Specials">Ace Science Fiction Specials</a> line, publishing critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as <a href="R.%20A.%20Lafferty">R. A. Lafferty</a>, <a href="Joanna%20Russ">Joanna Russ</a> and <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>. Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual "Year's Best Science Fiction" anthology series; and Carr also edited "Universe", a well-received original anthology series. "Universe" was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.

In 1965, Wollheim argued that there was a <a href="copyright">copyright</a> loophole in the American edition of "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" by <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>. The <a href="Houghton%20Mifflin">Houghton Mifflin</a> edition had been bound using pages printed in the United Kingdom for the <a href="Allen%20%26amp%3B%20Unwin">George Allen & Unwin</a> edition, and as a result, U.S. copyright law might not protect the text. Based on this view, Ace Books published the first-ever paperback edition of Tolkien's work, featuring cover art and hand-drawn title pages by <a href="Jack%20Gaughan">Jack Gaughan</a>. After considerable controversy and the release of a competitive authorized (and revised) edition by <a href="Ballantine%20Books">Ballantine Books</a> (the back covers of which included a message from Tolkien urging consumers to buy the Ballantine edition and boycott any "unauthorized" versions â referring directly to the Ace editions), Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

Wyn died in 1967, and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.

Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with <a href="New%20American%20Library">New American Library</a>, he proceeded to set up <a href="DAW%20Books">DAW Books</a>. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year's Best Science Fiction anthology series.

By the early 1970s, Ace Books became a major division of the old publisher, <a href="Charter%20Communications%20%28publisher%29">Charter Communications</a>, which was based out of the Hippodrome Building, 1120 <a href="Avenue%20of%20the%20Americas">Avenue of the Americas</a>, in New York City. In 1972, Ace was acquired by <a href="Grosset%20%26amp%3B%20Dunlap">Grosset & Dunlap</a>, and in 1982, Grosset & Dunlap was in turn acquired by <a href="G.P.%20Putnam%27s%20Sons">G.P. Putnam's Sons</a>. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset & Dunlap empire by this time. Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a <a href="freelancer">freelance</a> editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, <a href="William%20Gibson">William Gibson</a>'s "<a href="Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>", <a href="Kim%20Stanley%20Robinson">Kim Stanley Robinson</a>'s "<a href="Three%20Californias%20Trilogy">The Wild Shore</a>", <a href="Lucius%20Shepard">Lucius Shepard</a>'s "Green Eyes", and <a href="Michael%20Swanwick">Michael Swanwick</a>'s "In the Drift". All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the sf genre. Other prominent sf publishing figures who have worked at Ace include <a href="Tom%20Doherty">Tom Doherty</a>, who left to start <a href="Tor%20Books">Tor Books</a>, and <a href="Jim%20Baen">Jim Baen</a>, who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded <a href="Baen%20Books">Baen Books</a>. Writers who have worked at Ace include <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a> and <a href="Ellen%20Kushner">Ellen Kushner</a>.

In 1996, <a href="Penguin%20Group">Penguin Group (USA)</a> acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its sf imprint. As of December 2012, recently published authors included <a href="Joe%20Haldeman">Joe Haldeman</a>, <a href="Charles%20Stross">Charles Stross</a>, <a href="Laurell%20K.%20Hamilton">Laurell K. Hamilton</a>, <a href="Alastair%20Reynolds">Alastair Reynolds</a>, and <a href="Jack%20McDevitt">Jack McDevitt</a>. Penguin merged with <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> in 2013 to form <a href="Penguin%20Random%20House">Penguin Random House</a>, which continues to own Berkley. Ace's editorial team is also responsible for the <a href="Roc%20Books">Roc Books</a> imprint, although the two imprints maintain a separate identity.

The following people have worked at Ace Books in various editorial roles. The list is sorted in order of the date they started working at Ace, where known. It includes editors who are notable for some reason, as well as the most recent editors at the imprint.

Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as "D-31" and "H-77", and numeric, such as "10293" and "15697". The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in "tÃªte-bÃªche" format: <a href="Keith%20Vining">Keith Vining</a>'s "Too Hot for Hell" backed with <a href="Samuel%20W.%20Taylor">Samuel W. Taylor</a>'s "The Grinning Gismo". That series continued until D-599, Patricia Libby's "Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry", but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate "Double" (i.e., "tÃªte-bÃªche") or "Single"; there are D-series titles that are not "tÃªte-bÃªche", although none of the "tÃªte-bÃªche" titles have an S serial number. Towards the end of this initial series, the F series began (at a new price), and thereafter there were always several different letter series in publication simultaneously. The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101. The "tÃªte-bÃªche" format proved attractive to book collectors, and some rare titles in mint condition command prices over $1,000.

Madlax

The story revolves around two young women who seemingly have little in common and do not know of the other's existence at the beginning. The eponymous Madlax is a legendary mercenary and assassin in the fictional <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a>-torn country of Gazth-Sonika, who cannot remember her past or indeed her real name before twelve years ago, when the war started. The other main character is Margaret Burton, the sole heir of a wealthy aristocratic family in the peaceful European country Nafrece. Twelve years before the story begins, an airliner Margaret and her mother were on crashed over Gazth-Sonika, and its passengers, as well as Margaret's father who led the rescuers, have been missing ever since. Margaret, however, mysteriously traveled back to Nafrece on her own, <a href="retrograde%20amnesia">losing her memories</a> prior to her return; the only thing she recalls is a single word, "Madlax". With this thread linking the two girls, they both independently start investigating the powerful <a href="crime%20syndicate">crime syndicate</a> Enfant after its enigmatic mastermind shows interest in both of them.

"Madlax" was produced as a <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a> to the studio's earlier project, "<a href="Noir%20%28anime%29">Noir</a>", and together with "<a href="El%20Cazador%20de%20la%20Bruja">El Cazador de la Bruja</a>", these series constitute a <a href="trilogy">trilogy</a> exploring the "<a href="girls%20with%20guns">girls-with-guns</a>" genre. The production of "Madlax" began in 2002 but it wasn't until <a href="Y%C5%8Dsuke%20Kuroda">YÅsuke Kuroda</a> joined the project that the series took its final form. While the critics noted the resulting similarities between "Noir" and "Madlax", they also acknowledged the differences, such as the latter's less episodic and more plot-driven style and, in particular contrast to the predominantly <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realistic</a> "Noir", incorporation of many supernatural elements, which the audience must often interpret without further explanation.

The first half of the series alternates between the two leads. <a href="Madlax%20%28character%29">Madlax</a> is one of the most efficient <a href="special%20forces">special ops</a> agents for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while <a href="Margaret%20Burton%20%28Madlax%29">Margaret Burton</a> is a sleepy, clumsy <a href="amnesia">amnesia</a>c living in Nafrece, a country styled after France. When a "picture book", presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international criminal network Enfant, she discovers that the origins of the book lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant's top operative, <a href="Carrossea%20Doon">Carrossea Doon</a>, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction, towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble for some time. Meanwhile, <a href="Vanessa%20Rene">Vanessa Rene</a>, Margaret's former tutor whose parents died because of Gazth-Sonikan war, discovers that her current employer, Bookwald Industries, covertly supports the war by supplying both sides with firearms and starts investigating its true cause. Her investigation brings her to Gazth-Sonika, where Madlax is hired as her <a href="bodyguard">bodyguard</a>, and together, they uncover data that proves that Enfant orchestrated the entire conflict. Enfant eventually intercepts them and they are forced into hiding. Back in Nafrece, Margaret decides to help Vanessa and travels to Gazth-Sonika, accompanied by her devoted and sometimes overprotective <a href="maid">maid</a> <a href="Elenore%20Baker">Elenore Baker</a> and Carrossea Doon.

Eventually, Madlax and Margaret meet and embark on a search for <a href="List%20of%20Madlax%20characters%23Quanzitta%20Marison">Quanzitta Marison</a>, a Gazth-Sonikan mystic who supposedly knows about Margaret's book, Enfant's involvement with it, and Enfant itself. Lady Quanzitta does indeed tell them about Enfant and its plans to plunge the entire world into a total war, starting with Gazth-Sonika. She reveals that Enfant's leader <a href="Friday%20Monday">Friday Monday</a> possesses <a href="supernatural">supernatural</a> powers connected to the three ancient books, one of which belongs to Margaret. Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.

While Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by Limelda Jorg, a Gazth-Sonikan <a href="sniper">sniper</a> who holds a grudge against Madlax ever since she failed to stop an assassination by Madlax earlier in the show. Limelda kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into <a href="clinical%20depression">clinical depression</a>. Elenore and Lady Quanzitta's servant <a href="List%20of%20Madlax%20characters%23Nakhl">Nakhl</a> manage to restore Madlax's will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant's headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday's control, shoots Madlax. 

Believing Madlax to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people's inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret's memories return and she snaps out of his <a href="mind%20control">mind control</a>. Only now does the audience learn the <a href="back-story">back-story</a>: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret's father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own father. To escape the horrible truth of her <a href="patricide">patricide</a>, Margaret split herself into <a href="hypostasis%20%28philosophy%29">three personae</a>: the "memory keeper" <a href="List%20of%20Madlax%20characters%23Laetitia">Laetitia</a>, the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. Margaret then fuses her three personae back together to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Madlax, who should no longer exist after the fusion, appears and guns down Monday. It becomes apparent that Margaret has once again split herself into three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae. 

When everything is said and done, Margaret fully releases Madlax so she can live her life freely and also adopts Laetitia as her younger sister so she won't be alone. Madlax ultimately makes peace with Limelda and they travel together.

"Madlax" is set against the backdrop of Gazth-Sonikan <a href="war">war</a> and the first episodes contrast the tranquil Nafrece with the war-torn Gazth-Sonika; later, the story moves completely to the combat zone, focusing on the central characters, such as <a href="Limelda%20Jorg">Limelda Jorg</a>, and their suffering. In an interview, the director Mashimo stated that "[t]he story is about portraying inner struggles of people, while showing what life is like in this place of madness and this other place of peace". Accordingly, the series' title is a <a href="portmanteau">portmanteau</a> of two English words, "<a href="wiktionary%3Amad">mad</a>" and "<a href="wiktionary%3Arelax">re"lax"ed</a>", mirroring the authors' intention to portray the two extremes of human being.

"Madlax" also plays as the story of Margaret Burton's search for her <a href="psychological%20identity">psychological identity</a>. Based on the Mashimo Menu theme titles available to her, Yuki Kajiura has suggested an interpretation that while searching for her memories, Margaret meets the other characters ("Gatekeepers") one after another and learns about the lifestyles ("Gates") they represent. In the end, she finds her own "Gate", which is the new identity that finally replaces the one she lost twelve years ago.

According to the director KÅichi Mashimo, he envisioned "Noir" and "Madlax" as part of a trilogy exploring the <a href="girls%20with%20guns">girls-with-guns</a> genre, and soon after the release of the latter, he confirmed having plans to produce the third installment, which would later become "<a href="El%20Cazador%20de%20la%20Bruja">El Cazador de la Bruja</a>". In late 2002, Mashimo invited <a href="Shigeru%20Kitayama">Shigeru Kitayama</a>, the producer of "Noir" who once came up with its original idea, to discuss a new series entitled "Madlax". Kitayama greatly expanded Mashimo's original <a href="screenplay">screenplay</a> plan, but it was not until <a href="Y%C5%8Dsuke%20Kuroda">YÅsuke Kuroda</a> was put in charge of the script that the series took its final appearance. It took Kuroda around one year to finish the screenplays for all 26 episodes, during which he was constantly encouraged by Mashimo to add his own original ideas to their initial plan. Kuroda has admitted that at the time he received Mashimo's invitation, he felt frustrated after his first project has been canceled by the publisher, so he decided to make "Madlax" "really extravagant", blending as many genres at once as he could. KÅichi Mashimo, furthermore, admitted that the most unusual <a href="plot%20twist">plot twist</a>s, like Margaret and Madlax's connection to each other, were invented by Kuroda and him while <a href="alcohol%20intoxication">drunk</a>.

By comparison with "Noir", "Madlax" features a much larger primary cast, including multiple recurring male <a href="character%20%28arts%29">characters</a>, an element nearly absent in the former. It was not so in the original screenplay draft written by Mashimo and Kitayama: for example, "Madlax" was Margaret's own nickname and <a href="List%20of%20Madlax%20characters%23Charlie">Charlie</a> (Vanessa's colleague at Bookwald Industries) had one of the central roles similar to Speedy's in "<a href="Avenger%20%28anime%29">Avenger</a>". Only the "draft" characters' names remained of them when Kuroda has rewritten the script. A total of three <a href="character%20designer">character designer</a>s collaborated on "Madlax" cast: Satoshi Ohsawa (who also worked on "Noir" cast) created the central heroines Margaret and Madlax; Minako Shiba drew Friday Monday and Carrossea Doon; and Satoko Miyachi was entrusted with the "mysterious" characters, Laetitia and Poupee.

As with many of studio Bee Train's other works, the entire "Madlax" soundtrack was composed by the acclaimed Yuki Kajiura, making it her and KÅichi Mashimo's fifth project together. In an interview Kajiura recalls having written the score in a hotel high-rise to save studio costs, and that this change in location helped her to explore different styles of music.

Kajiura and <a href="Yuuka%20Nanri">Yuuka Nanri</a>'s duo <a href="FictionJunction%20Yuuka">FictionJunction Yuuka</a> recorded the series' opening and ending themes, and "Inside Your Heart", respectively, as well as two insert songs: "nowhere" and "I'm here". Aside from the opening sequence, "Fragments of an Eye" is featured in the series itself: at the end of episode 18 and in the episode 24, when Margaret is humming its tune to herself in the flower field.

In the insert song "nowhere", there is a frequently repeated background <a href="refrain">refrain</a> . It doesn't have any particular meaning but since the song usually plays when Madlax is fighting, "Yanmaani" has become something of a joke to Japanese fans, claiming that it apparently gives her <a href="superpower%20%28ability%29">superpowers</a>.

Originally, "Madlax" was broadcast in Japan by <a href="TV%20Tokyo">TV Tokyo</a> from 5 April to 27 September 2004, from <a href="late%20night%20anime">1:30 to 2:00 a.m.</a> every Tuesday (formally, Monday night). Shortly before the series finished airing, it has been licensed in North America and Europe by ADV Films, which has previously acquired distribution rights for "Noir" and has long had plans to license its successor, as well. The official English <a href="dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">dub</a> has been released in the United States under the trademark "MADLAX" on a total of seven DVDs from 12 April 2005 to 28 March 2006. A complete collection was released by ADV on 17 July 2007. "Madlax" has become the first series on which ADV Films' director and producer <a href="David%20Williams%20%28producer%29">David Williams</a> tested the technology of distributing <a href="promotion%20%28marketing%29">promotional</a> materials via <a href="Peer-to-peer">P2P network</a> <a href="BitTorrent%20%28protocol%29">BitTorrent</a>. As of September 1, 2009, all of the titles from ADV's catalog, including Madlax, were transferred to <a href="Section23%20Films%23AEsir%20Holdings">AEsir Holdings</a>, with distribution from <a href="Section23%20Films">Section23 Films</a>.

The North-American DVD release contains extras available in English only, such the controversial <a href="self-parody">self-parody</a> "Conversations with SSS" and "Sock Puppet Theater", an <a href="Easter%20egg%20%28media%29">Easter egg</a> <a href="live%20action">live action</a> about Madlax going after <a href="Chris%20Patton">Chris Patton</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Madlax%20characters%23Badgis">Badgis</a>' voice actor and an annoying womanizer.

On 7 February 2006, the first episode of "Madlax" aired on Anime Network (which was, like ADV Films, a subsidiary of <a href="A.D.%20Vision">A.D. Vision</a> at the time). On 4 April, shortly after the last DVD volume has been released, the consequent broadcast was put on halt and until 27 June, only the first 8 episodes were repeated. Since then, the series has been relaunched multiple times. <a href="Madman%20Entertainment">Madman Entertainment</a>, who previously licensed "Noir" in its region, has acquired rights for distribution of "Madlax" in Australia and New Zealand and released it on seven DVD volumes between 20 July 2005 and 26 July 2006. A complete collection was released on 4 April 2007.

The series' <a href="original%20soundtrack">original soundtrack</a> was released on two albums on 21 July and 22 September 2004 by <a href="Victor%20Entertainment">Victor Entertainment</a>. Two singles, "<a href="Hitomi%20no%20Kakera">Hitomi no Kakera</a>" and "<a href="Inside%20Your%20Heart">Inside Your Heart</a>", were published in the same year by FictionJunction Yuuka, each containing an opening/ending theme and one insert song, as well as their respective <a href="karaoke">karaoke</a> versions.

"MADLAX the Bible" is a 95-page <a href="artbook">artbook</a> that was published in Japan on 21 May 2005 by <a href="Hobby%20Japan">Hobby Japan</a>. Aside from illustrations and artworks for the series, it contains interviews with its authors and voice actors, as well as diverse additional information about the show in Japanese. The artbook has never been published outside Japan. Since the word "<a href="Bible">Bible</a>" is derived from , meaning "holy books", it is likely that the artbook's title is a reference to the Holy Books that play an important role in the series' plot.

A <a href="resin">resin</a> <a href="model%20kit">model kit</a> known as "Madlax with Guns" has been produced, featuring a <a href="figurine">figurine</a> of Madlax <a href="dual%20wield">dual wield</a>ing her signature <a href="SIG%20P210">SIG P210</a>s. A <a href="polystone">polystone</a> figurine entitled simply "Madlax", was launched in August 2007. In Japan, a <a href="T-shirt">T-shirt</a> with "Madlax" logo has been added to the limited edition of the first DVD volume, and the "first press" of the OST albums came with logotype <a href="mousepad">mousepad</a>s.

A <a href="light%20novel">light novel</a> spin-off of the series, titled , has been published on 1 June 2011 by <a href="Hobby%20Japan">Hobby Japan</a>. Written by Seiya Fujiwara and illustrated by Shunsuke Tagami (neither of whom had been involved in the production of the original TV series), the book focuses on Elenore Baker as the main character in a <a href="Setting%20%28narrative%29">setting</a> somewhat different from that of the anime. In this <a href="Continuity%20%28fiction%29">continuity</a>, Elenore is a combat-trained maid traveling across the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, looking for the lost Margaret and, along the way, helping the weary locals with their struggles.
"Madlax" was often accused of being secondary and reusing "<a href="Noir%20%28anime%29">Noir</a>" stylistic solutions, such as the story <a href="premise%20%28film%29">premise</a>, the two heroines' appearance, and the musical style. Nevertheless, some sources praised the story for being more monolithic and consequent than its predecessor's, owing to all its episodes and <a href="subplot">subplot</a>s being tightly intertwined and held together by the <a href="A-Plot">primary plot</a>.

The majority of reviewers perceived the early episodes of "Madlax" as boring and too slow-paced, but some of the same critics later remarked that the prolonged <a href="exposition%20%28literary%20technique%29">exposition</a> is crucial to the unusual <a href="Series%20finale">finale</a> of the series, which fully establishes the series' own identity and sets it apart from other works. According to them, after the initial volume, the story gets better and better with every new episode, though some have been dissatisfied with its "pseudo-<a href="existentialism">existentialistic</a>" ending. Erica Friedman, the president of <a href="Yuricon">Yuricon</a>, highly praised Kuroda's script, naming it "the best writing that Bee Train has done". Professional reviewers welcomed the increased number of sympathetic characters, especially the distinguishable male ones (Friday, Carrossea, Colonel Burton), as opposed to stormtrooper-like operatives of Soldats in "Noir", but the female character designs were still said to be much more detailed (to the point of <a href="fanservice">fanservice</a> in the case of Madlax) than the more generic male characters.

The high quality of the <a href="animation">animation</a> in "Madlax" was generally acknowledged. On the negative side, the episodes that involve <a href="computer">computer</a> use and <a href="computer%20crime">hacking</a> received criticism for their lack of realism. In terms of soundtrack, "Madlax" has not become as innovative as "Noir", with critics suggesting its OST to be a blend of "Noir" and "<a href=".hack//Sign">.hack//Sign</a>" styles. Nevertheless, the reviewers acknowledged its superiority over the majority of contemporary works. The English translation released by ADV Films was praised for preserving most of the series' original stylistic aspects and inviting veteran voice actors for the dub. Reviewers went as far as to suggest that several English voices (especially <a href="Mike%20Kleinhenz">Mike Kleinhenz</a>'s) match the characters better than the Japanese ones. Others, however, criticized the dub, e.g. Carl Kimlinger of <a href="Anime%20News%20Network">Anime News Network</a> in his 2009 review of the series rated the performance as "wildly uneven, ranging from goodÂ ... to plain amateurish", citing "delivery issues" as main problem of the dub.

The initial slow pacing, especially compared to the first episodes of "Noir", became a main reason why the audience often dropped watching "Madlax" before it could present its later story turns which eventually resulted in the moderate success of the series. Among other suggested reasons behind the mediocre popularity of the show were: the <a href="market%20saturation">market saturation</a>, which resulted from other anime series attempting to repeat the success of "Noir" since 2001; the expectable disinterest against a ""Noir" <a href="remake">remake</a>", found among the fans of the first series; the over-the-top action scenes that some felt to be ridiculous; and its unconventional genre, which straddled "Madlax" uncomfortably between fans of mystical <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and those who prefer "Noir" strict realism.

Suffolk Punch

The Suffolk Horse, also historically known as the Suffolk Punch or Suffolk Sorrel, is an English <a href="horse%20breed">breed</a> of <a href="Draft%20horse">draught horse</a>. The breed takes the first part of its name from the county of <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, and the name "Punch" from its solid appearance and strength. It is a heavy draught horse which is always <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> in colour, traditionally spelled "" by the <a href="breed%20registry">breed registries</a>. Suffolk Punches are known as <a href="easy%20keeper">good doer</a>s, and tend to have energetic <a href="horse%20gait">gaits</a>.

The breed was developed in the early 16th century, and remains similar in <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a> to its <a href="Foundation%20bloodstock">founding stock</a>. The Suffolk Punch was developed for farm work, and gained popularity during the early 20th century. However, as agriculture became increasingly mechanised, the breed fell out of favour, particularly from the middle part of the century, and almost disappeared completely. Although the breed's status is listed as critical by the UK <a href="Rare%20Breeds%20Survival%20Trust">Rare Breeds Survival Trust</a> and the <a href="American%20Livestock%20Breeds%20Conservancy">American Livestock Breeds Conservancy</a>, a resurgence in interest has occurred, and population numbers are increasing. The breed pulled <a href="artillery">artillery</a> and non-motorised commercial vans and buses, as well as being used for farm work. It was also exported to other countries to upgrade local equine stock. Today, they are used for draught work, <a href="forestry">forestry</a> and advertising.

Suffolk Punches generally stand , weigh , and are always <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a> in colour. The traditional spelling, still used by the Suffolk Horse Society, is "" (with no "t" in the middle of the word). Horses of the breed come in many different shades of chestnut, ranging from dark to red to light. Suffolk <a href="horse%20breeding">horse breeders</a> in the UK use several different colour terms specific to the breed, including dark <a href="liver%20%28color%29">liver</a>, dull dark, red, and bright. White <a href="horse%20markings">markings</a> are rare and generally limited to small areas on the face and lower legs. Equestrian author <a href="Marguerite%20Henry">Marguerite Henry</a> described the breed by saying, "His color is bright chestnutÂ â like a tongue of fire against black field furrows, against green corn blades, against yellow wheat, against blue horizons. Never is he any other color."

The Suffolk Punch tends to be shorter but more massively built than other British heavy draught breeds, such as the <a href="Clydesdale%20%28horse%29">Clydesdale</a> or the <a href="Shire%20horse">Shire</a>, as a result of having been developed for agricultural work rather than road haulage. The breed has a powerful, arching neck; well-muscled, sloping shoulders; a short, wide <a href="back%20%28horse%29">back</a>; and a muscular, broad <a href="rump%20%28animal%29">croup</a>. Legs are short and strong, with broad joints; sound, well-formed <a href="horse%20hoof">hooves</a>; and little or no <a href="feathering%20%28horse%29">feathering</a> on the <a href="fetlock">fetlock</a>s. The <a href="Horse%20gait">movement</a> of the Suffolk Punch is said to be energetic, especially at the <a href="trot%20%28horse%20gait%29">trot</a>. The breed tends to mature early and be long-lived, and is economical to keep, needing less <a href="fodder">feed</a> than other horses of similar type and size. They are hard workers, said to be willing to "pull a heavily laden wagon till [they] dropped."

In the past, the Suffolk was often criticised for its poor feet, having hooves that were too small for its body mass. This was corrected by the introduction of classes at major <a href="Horse%20show">shows</a> in which hoof <a href="Equine%20conformation">conformation</a> and structure were judged. This practice, unique among horse breeds, resulted in such an improvement that the Suffolk Punch is now considered to have excellent foot conformation.

The Suffolk Punch <a href="breed%20registry">registry</a> is the oldest English breed society. The first known mention of the Suffolk Punch is in <a href="William%20Camden">William Camden</a>'s "Britannia", published in 1586, in which he describes a working horse of the eastern counties of England that is easily recognisable as the Suffolk Punch. This description makes them the oldest breed of horse that is recognisable in the same form today. A detailed genetic study shows that the Suffolk Punch is closely genetically grouped not only with the <a href="Fell%20Pony">Fell</a> and <a href="Dales%20Pony">Dales</a> British ponies, but also with the European <a href="Haflinger">Haflinger</a>. They were developed in Norfolk and <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> in the east of England, a relatively isolated area. The local farmers developed the Suffolk Punch for farm work, for which they needed a horse with power, stamina, health, longevity, and docility, and they bred the Suffolk to comply with these needs. Because the farmers used these horses on their land, they seldom had any to sell, which helped to keep the bloodlines <a href="purebred">pure</a> and unchanged.
The <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation sire</a> of the modern Suffolk Punch breed was a <a href="stallion">stallion</a> foaled near <a href="Woodbridge%2C%20Suffolk">Woodbridge</a> in 1768 and owned by Thomas Crisp of <a href="Ufford%2C%20Suffolk">Ufford</a>. At this time, the breed was known as the Suffolk <a href="Sorrel%20%28horse%29">Sorrel</a>. This horse was never named, and is simply known as "Crisp's horse". Although it is commonly (and mistakenly) thought that this was the first horse of the breed, by the 1760s, all other male lines of the breed had died out, resulting in a <a href="Population%20bottleneck">genetic bottleneck</a>. Another bottleneck occurred in the late 18th century.

In 1784, the breed was described as " high, short and compact with bony legs, often light sorrel in color, gentle, tractable, strong" and with "shoulders loaded with flesh". During its development, the breed was influenced by the <a href="Norfolk%20Trotter">Norfolk Trotter</a>, <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a> <a href="Cob%20%28horse%29">Cob</a>, and later the <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>. The uniform colouring derives in part from a small trotting stallion named Blakes Farmer, foaled in 1760. Other breeds were <a href="Cross%20breeding">crossbred</a> in an attempt to increase the size and stature of the Suffolk Punch, as well as to improve the shoulders, but they had little lasting influence, and the breed remains much as it was before any crossbreeding took place. The Suffolk Horse Society, formed in Britain in 1877 to promote the Suffolk Punch, published its first stud book in 1880. The first official exports of Suffolks to Canada took place in 1865. In 1880, the first Suffolks were imported into the United States, with more following in 1888 and 1903 to begin the breeding of Suffolk Punches in the US. The American Suffolk Horse Association was established and published its first stud book in 1907. By 1908, the Suffolk had also been exported from England to Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Russia, Sweden, various parts of Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina and other countries.
By the time of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the Suffolk Punch had become a popular workhorse on large farms in East Anglia due to its good temperament and excellent work ethic. It remained popular until the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, when a combination of the need for increased wartime food production (which resulted in many horses being sent to the slaughterhouse), and increased farm mechanisation which followed the war-decimated population numbers. Only nine foals were registered with the Suffolk Horse Society in 1966, but a revival of interest in the breed has occurred since the late 1960s, and numbers have risen continuously. The breed did remain rare, and in 1998, only 80 breeding <a href="mare">mare</a>s were in Britain, producing around 40 foals per year. In the United States, the American Suffolk Horse Association became inactive after the war and remained so for 15Â years, but restarted in May 1961 as the draught-horse market began to recover. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the American registry allowed some <a href="Belgian%20%28horse%29">Belgian</a>s to be bred to Suffolk Punches, but only the <a href="filly">fillies</a> from these crosses were permitted registry with the American Suffolk Horse Association.

As of 2001, horses bred with American bloodlines were not allowed to be registered with the British Association, and the breed was considered the rarest horse breed in the United Kingdom. Although the Suffolk Punch population has continued to increase, the <a href="Rare%20Breeds%20Survival%20Trust">Rare Breeds Survival Trust</a> of the UK considers their survival status critical, in 2011, between 800 and 1,200Â horses were in the United States and around 150 were in England. The <a href="American%20Livestock%20Breeds%20Conservancy">American Livestock Breeds Conservancy</a> also lists the breed as critical. The Suffolk Horse Society recorded the births of 36 purebred foals in 2007, and a further 33 foals as of March 2008. By 2016, about 300 Suffolk Punches were in the UK with 30 to 40 purebred foals being born annually.

The Suffolk Punch was used mainly for draught work on farms but was also often used to pull heavy <a href="artillery">artillery</a> in wartime. Like other heavy horses, they were also used to pull non-motorised vans and other commercial vehicles. Today, they are used for commercial <a href="forestry">forestry</a> operations, for other draught work, and in advertising. They are also used for <a href="crossbreed">crossbreed</a>ing, to produce heavy <a href="sport%20horse">sport horse</a>s for use in <a href="show%20hunter">hunter</a> and <a href="show%20jumping">show jumping</a> competition. As a symbol of the county in which they are based, <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%23Colours%20and%20crest">Ipswich Town F.C.</a> incorporate a Suffolk Punch as a dominant part of their team crest.

The Suffolk Punch contributed significantly to the creation of the <a href="Jutland%20%28horse%29">Jutland</a> breed in Denmark. Oppenheimer LXII, a Suffolk Punch imported to Denmark in the 1860s by noted Suffolk dealer Oppenheimer of <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, was one of the founding stallions of the Jutland. Oppenheimer specialised in selling Suffolk Punches, importing them to the Mecklenburg Stud in Germany. The stallion Oppenheimer founded the Jutland breed's most important bloodline, through his descendant Oldrup Munkedal. Suffolks were also exported to Pakistan in the 20th century, to be used in upgrading native breeds, and they have been crossed with Pakistani horses and <a href="donkey">donkey</a>s to create army remounts and <a href="mule">mule</a>s. Suffolks have adapted well to the Pakistani climate, despite their large size, and the programme has been successful. The <a href="Vladimir%20Heavy%20Draft">Vladimir Heavy Draft</a>, a draught breed from the former <a href="USSR">USSR</a>, is another which has been influenced by the Suffolk.

Hurricane Carmen

Hurricane Carmen was the most intense <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> of the <a href="1974%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1974 Atlantic hurricane season</a>. A destructive and widespread storm, Carmen originated as a tropical disturbance that emerged from Africa toward the end of August. The disturbance traveled westward, spawning a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> east of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> on AugustÂ 29. The storm moved through the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>, and in an environment conducive to intensification, it quickly strengthened to its initial peak intensity as a CategoryÂ 4 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">SaffirâSimpson Hurricane Scale</a>. Carmen moved ashore on the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">YucatÃ¡n Peninsula</a>, where, despite striking a sparsely populated region, it caused significant crop damage and killed several people. Before the storm's arrival, officials had set up several evacuation centers, and many residents had moved to higher ground.

Upon entering the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, Carmen turned northward and re-intensified as it approached the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. Initially threatening the major city of <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, it veered westward and made landfall on the marshland of southern <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, eventually dissipating over eastern <a href="Texas">Texas</a> on SeptemberÂ 10. <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20watches%20and%20warnings">Tropical cyclone watches and warnings</a> had been issued for the storm, and approximately 100,000 residents left their homes and sought shelter. Damage was lighter than first feared, but the sugar industry suffered substantial losses. Throughout its course, the hurricane killed 8 people and caused $162Â million in damage. Due to the severity of the storm, the name "Carmen" was <a href="List%20of%20retired%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20names">retired</a> from the list of Atlantic <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming">tropical cyclone names</a>.

The origins of Hurricane Carmen can be traced to a weather disturbance over <a href="Africa">Africa</a> during the middle of AugustÂ 1974. The disturbance moved slowly westward with little <a href="convection%20%28meteorology%29">convective activity</a> initially, although upon entering the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a>, it spawned a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> within the <a href="Intertropical%20Convergence%20Zone">Intertropical Convergence Zone</a>. The wave had intensified and broadened by AugustÂ 25, and it eventually split into two components, the northernmost of which consolidated into an organized storm system. Moving westward, the system developed into a tropical depression on AugustÂ 29, more than east of <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>. Due to favorable <a href="Outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a> from an <a href="anticyclone">anticyclone</a> nearby, the depression gradually strengthened as it moved through the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a>. It attained tropical storm status on August 30, south of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, and was named Carmen by the <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a>. At first, the storm's proximity to <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> prevented further strengthening, but by AugustÂ 31, it had managed to intensify into a CategoryÂ 1 hurricane on the <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">SaffirâSimpson Hurricane Scale</a>. As Carmen passed south of <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, an <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye feature</a> briefly appeared.

On SeptemberÂ 1, the hurricane began to <a href="rapid%20deepening">rapidly deepen</a> over warm waters of the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>; by 18:00Â <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a> (UTC), it had strengthened to CategoryÂ 4 intensity. Continuing westward, the storm passed north of <a href="Swan%20Islands%2C%20Honduras">Swan Island</a> later that day. Early on SeptemberÂ 2, a <a href="eyewall%20replacement%20cycle">double eyewall</a> appeared on satellite imagery. Carmen's forward movement gradually slowed as the storm took a <a href="west%20by%20north">west by north</a> direction, and it reached its initial peak intensity with <a href="maximum%20sustained%20winds">maximum sustained winds</a> of 150Â mph (240Â km/h), accompanied by a central <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> of 928Â <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (hPa; 27.4Â <a href="Inches%20of%20mercury">inHg</a>). Atmospheric steering currents became increasingly weaker, and Carmen slowed to a drift. Later on SeptemberÂ 2, the hurricane made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> on the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">YucatÃ¡n Peninsula</a>; its northern jog spared <a href="Belize%20City">Belize City</a> from a direct hit. The storm's center passed a few miles north of <a href="Chetumal%2C%20Quintana%20Roo">Chetumal</a>, <a href="Quintana%20Roo">Quintana Roo</a>.

The cyclone drifted inland, deteriorating to a tropical storm on SeptemberÂ 3. About a day later, Carmen emerged into the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, where it nearly stalled. Turning northward, the storm regained hurricane strength on SeptemberÂ 5. Carmen continued to strengthen and accelerated northward towards the <a href="United%20States%20Gulf%20Coast">United States Gulf Coast</a>, reaching a forward speed of ; at 00:00Â UTC on SeptemberÂ 7, it once again became a CategoryÂ 3 major hurricane. The storm reached its second peak intensity while located south of <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>; although the wind speeds were identical to that of its initial peak, the barometric pressure was slightly higher. Carmen weakened and veered westward before landfall, ultimately striking south-central Louisiana. After moving ashore, the hurricane quickly lost strength and late on SeptemberÂ 9 degenerated into a tropical depression. The depression moved westward and soon dissipated over eastern <a href="Texas">Texas</a>.

Initial reactions to the approaching hurricane in the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula were regarded as calm by the United States media. Mexican officials declared an emergency alert by SeptemberÂ 2, although they did not advise any evacuations. Meteorologists in the United States urged those living near the coast to move inland immediately. Fearing significant loss of life and property, the <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> began preparations for the approaching hurricane in Belize. The following day, the <a href="Mexican%20Army">Mexican Army</a> rushed to set up emergency operation centers and shelters in five cities. Mobile communication units and relief teams were prepared for deployment following the storm's passage. Many of the nearly 35,000Â residents in and around the city of Chetumal evacuated to higher ground.

Although it initially threatened the United States city of <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, the hurricane turned west prior to making landfall and spared the area from severe damage. Contrary to its actual path, forecasters predicted the hurricane to execute an eastward swerve toward <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. Had the cyclone instead continued northward and traveled over <a href="Lake%20Pontchartrain">Lake Pontchartrain</a>, low-lying areas could have suffered "catastrophic" flooding. Over 100,000Â residents of the <a href="U.S.%20Gulf%20Coast">Gulf Coast</a>, mostly in <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, evacuated in advance of the hurricane, causing heavy congestion on highways. About 60,000Â people sought shelter in facilities across the New Orleans region, according to Red Cross officials.

<a href="Hurricane%20warning">Hurricane warning</a>s were issued along the coast, while <a href="Coast%20Guard">Coast Guard</a> personnel went door-to-door on <a href="Grand%20Isle%2C%20Louisiana">Grand Isle</a> urging residents to leave the area. From there through the coast of southwestern Florida, small craft were advised to remain near shore due to rough seas. Offshore, workers were removed from oil rigs. Many Mississippi citizens, having experienced the destruction of <a href="Hurricane%20Camille">Hurricane Camille</a> just five years earlier, quickly left their coastal homes.

As a tropical depression and storm, Carmen produced moderate rainfall across <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and the northern Lesser Antilles, peaking at in <a href="Cayey%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Jajome Alto, Puerto Rico</a>. The storm spawned a tornado on Puerto Rico and triggered flash flooding, which collectively left over $2Â million in damage. Winds approaching <a href="gale%20force">gale force</a> affected several islands. Heavy rain fell on <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a> as the storm progressed westward, and on <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, the storm caused three drownings. High winds and heavy rainfall were reported there and in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. The hurricane damaged local reefs on the north shore of Jamaica during its passage.

Following the storm, the name "Carmen" was <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming%23Retirement">retired</a> from the annually rotating list of hurricane names. However, due to a change in the naming scheme in 1979, it was not replaced by any particular name.

Although Carmen made landfall as a powerful CategoryÂ 4 hurricane, it caused significantly less damage than anticipated because it struck a sparsely populated region. However, torrential rainfall from the storm inundated farmland across the region, ruining rice crops. The fishing industry also sustained major losses. Communication with the hardest hit regions was lost following Carmen's passage; however, early reports stated that at least five people were injured. Several days later, officials in Mexico confirmed that three people had been killed by the storm. The city of Chetumal was described as a "disaster", and hundreds of people were left homeless. More than 5,000Â people in the city lost their belongings as a result of the storm. Officials in the area estimated that damage in Chetumal alone reached $8Â million (1974Â USD). Throughout the YucatÃ¡n Peninsula, Hurricane Carmen claimed four lives and wrought $10Â million (1974Â USD) in damage.

Following Carmen's passage, officials feared the worst for an area of 1,000Â mi (2,590Â km) where communication was lost in Belize. A reconnaissance task force was sent out from Belize City the day after Carmen made landfall to assist any residents stranded by the storm. One person was killed off the coast of Belize after being washed off his boat by large swells produced by Carmen. Three other fishermen were listed as missing following similar incidents. Thousands of people moved from coastal areas inland to escape the storm. Crop damage in the country was reportedly severe.

Carmen dropped moderate rainfall along its path, though the heaviest rainfall occurred well to the east of the storm's center, in southern <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> and the northern <a href="Florida%20Panhandle">Florida Panhandle</a>. Precipitation peaked at over in <a href="Atmore%2C%20Alabama">Atmore, Alabama</a>. Winds gusted up to , and along the coast, tides ran as high as above normal. Over northwestern Louisiana, winds ranged from and brought down several trees. In New Orleans, despite wind gusts to , minimal damage was reported. The hurricane's effects in <a href="Baton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana">Baton Rouge</a> were confined to strewn debris and a few downed trees. Because Carmen moved ashore over uninhabited marshland, it caused far less damage than initially feared. Nonetheless, tidal flooding from the Gulf of Mexico and coastal bodies of water was severe. Freshwater flooding was less extreme. In total, the storm inundated of land in Louisiana, including in <a href="Terrebonne%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Terrebonne Parish</a> and in <a href="Plaquemines%20Parish%2C%20Louisiana">Plaquemines Parish</a>. A large oak tree was overturned by high winds in the town of Jeanerette in Iberia Parish.
The storm's greatest impact was the loss of sugar cane crops in Louisiana. An estimated of sugar cane in 16Â parishes was damaged, and about 20Â percent was completely ruined. After a tour of the affected area, then-<a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Louisiana">Governor</a> <a href="Edwin%20Edwards">Edwin Edwards</a> estimated crop damage alone at $400Â million, although a more recent estimate placed total agricultural damage from the hurricane at $74Â million. The sugar cane crop was crucial to the country's sugar supplies, rendering the losses "doubly bad", and sugar <a href="futures%20contract">futures</a> rose drastically after the storm. Other crops damaged by Carmen included soybeans, rice, and cotton.

Tidal action along the coast affected the balance of salinity in coastal marshes and water bodies. The sudden intrusion of saltwater stressed delicate plants. Fish, shrimp and oysters also suffered the ecological effects of Hurricane Carmen. Flooding on land caused some wildlife to drown. Several parks in Louisiana sustained damage, either from flooding or high winds; losses to <a href="Grand%20Isle%2C%20Louisiana">Grand Island</a> State Park in particular totaled $114,600. The oil and gas industry was also affected, and its estimated $24.7Â million in losses resulted mainly from damage to equipment and offshore facilities. The storm diminished oil production by 1.4 million barrels when it shut down operations for 24 to 48 hours at various locations. Over 60,000 <a href="electric%20cooperative">electric cooperative</a> customers lost power.

The hurricane caused two fatalities in Louisiana: a utility repairman who was electrocuted while working on power lines damaged by strong winds, and a motorist who was involved in a storm-related traffic accident. Total monetary losses in the state was estimated at $150 million. Overall, the hurricane spawned four confirmed tornadoes. One touched down near <a href="Brandon%2C%20Mississippi">Brandon, Mississippi</a>, destroying a barn and causing other damage. Another struck <a href="Kaplan%2C%20Louisiana">Kaplan, Louisiana</a>, injuring one person. The storm's effects in Mississippi were described as minimal and were mainly confined to minor traffic accidents during bouts of heavy precipitation. Light to moderate rainfall from the storm extended as far east as Florida and Georgia and as far west as Oklahoma and Texas.

In the film "<a href="Forrest%20Gump">Forrest Gump</a>", Hurricane Carmen was featured in a scene in which <a href="Forrest%20Gump%20%28character%29">Forrest Gump</a> and Lt. Dan Taylor ride the storm out aboard their shrimp boat, Jenny.

Giant eland

The giant eland ("Taurotragus derbianus"), also known as the Lord Derby eland, is an open-forest and <a href="savanna">savanna</a> <a href="antelope">antelope</a>. A species of the family <a href="Bovidae">Bovidae</a> and genus "<a href="Taurotragus">Taurotragus</a>", it was described in 1847 by <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a>. The giant eland is the largest species of antelope, with a body length ranging from . There are two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>: "T.Â d.Â derbianus" and "T.Â d.Â gigas".

The giant eland is an <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>, eating grasses, foliage and branches. They usually form small <a href="herd">herd</a>s consisting of 15â25 members, both males and females. Giant elands are not <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a>, and have large <a href="home%20range">home range</a>s. They are naturally alert and wary, which makes them difficult to approach and observe. They can run at up to and use this speed as a defence against <a href="Predation">predators</a>. Mating occurs throughout the year but peaks in the <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a>. They mostly inhabit broad-leafed savannas, <a href="woodland">woodland</a>s and <a href="glade%20%28geography%29">glade</a>s.

The giant eland is native to <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a>, <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>, <a href="Chad">Chad</a>, <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, <a href="Guinea">Guinea</a>, <a href="Mali">Mali</a>, <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>, and <a href="South%20Sudan">South Sudan</a>. It is no longer present in <a href="The%20Gambia">The Gambia</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, and <a href="Togo">Togo</a>. Its presence is uncertain in <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, <a href="Guinea-Bissau">Guinea-Bissau</a>, and <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a> due to over hunting and a lack of professional wildlife management. The subspecies have been listed with different conservation statuses by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).

The scientific name of the giant eland is "Taurotragus derbianus", derived from three words: "tauros", "tragos", and "derbianus". "Tauros" is <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> for a bull or bullock. "Tragos" is Greek for a male goat, and refers to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear which resembles a goat's beard.

The giant eland is also called "Lord Derby's eland" in honour of <a href="Edward%20Smith-Stanley%2C%2013th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby</a>. It was due to his efforts that the giant eland was first introduced to England between 1835 and 1851. Lord Derby sent botanist <a href="Joseph%20Burke%20%28botanist%29">Joseph Burke</a> to collect animals, either alive or dead, from South Africa for his museum and <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a>. The first elands introduced in England were a pair of common elands, and what would later be identified as a giant eland bull. The details were recorded in Smith-Stanley's privately printed work, "Gleanings from the Menagerie at Knowsley Hall". The Latin name indicates that it "belonged to" (given by the suffix -"anus") Derby, hence "derbianus".

Although the giant eland is somewhat larger than the common eland, the epithet 'giant' actually refers to its large horns. The name 'eland' is Dutch for "elk" or "moose". It has a <a href="Baltic%20languages">Baltic</a> source similar to the Lithuanian "Ã©lnis", which means "deer". It was borrowed earlier as "ellan" (French) in the 1610s or "elend" (German).

The giant eland was first <a href="Species%20description">described</a> in 1847 by <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a>, a British zoologist, who called it "Boselaphus derbianus". At that time, it was also called the 'black-necked eland' and "Gingi-ganga".

Giant eland is placed in the genus "<a href="Taurotragus">Taurotragus</a>" of family <a href="Bovidae">Bovidae</a>. Giant elands are sometimes considered part of the genus "<a href="Tragelaphus">Tragelaphus</a>" on the basis of <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetics</a>, but are usually categorized as "Taurotragus", along with the <a href="common%20eland">common eland</a> ("T.Â oryx"). Together with the <a href="bongo%20%28antelope%29">bongo</a>, Giant eland and common eland are the only antelopes in the <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> "Tragelaphini" to be given a generic name other than "Tragelaphus". Although some authors, like <a href="Theodor%20Haltenorth">Theodor Haltenorth</a>, regarded the giant eland as <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a> with the common eland, they are usually considered two distinct species.

Two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of giant eland have been recognized:


The giant elands are spiral-horned antelopes. Despite its common name, this species broadly overlaps in size with the common eland ("Taurotragus oryx"). However, the giant eland is somewhat larger on average than the common eland and is thus the largest species of <a href="antelope">antelope</a> in the world. They are typically between in head-and-body length and stand approximately at the shoulder. Giant elands exhibit <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, as males are larger than females. The males weigh and females weigh . The tail is long, having a dark tuft of hair, and averages in length. The life expectancy of giant elands is up to 25 years in the wild, and about 20 years in captivity.

The smooth <a href="Coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a> is reddish-brown to <a href="Chestnut%20%28colour%29">chestnut</a>, usually darker in males than females, with 8â12 well-defined vertical white stripes on the torso. The colour of the male's coat darkens with age. According to zoologist Jakob Bro-JÃ¸rgensen, the colour of the male's coat can reflect the levels of <a href="androgen">androgen</a>, a male hormone, which is highest during <a href="Rutting%20season">rutting</a>. Comparing the subspecies, "T.Â d.Â derbianus" is characterised by 15 body stripes, smaller size, and a <a href="rufous">rufous</a> colour, while "T.Â d.Â gigas" is larger, a sandy colour, and has 12 body stripes.

A crest of short black hair extends down the neck to the middle of the back, and is particularly prominent on the shoulders. The slender legs are slightly lighter on their inner surfaces, with black and white markings just above the <a href="hooves">hooves</a>. There are large black spots on the upper forelegs. The bridge of the nose is charcoal black, and there is a thin, indistinct <a href="Tan%20%28colour%29">tan</a>-coloured line, which is the chevron, between the eyes. The lips are white, as are several dots along the jawline. A pendulous <a href="dewlap">dewlap</a>, larger in males than females, originates from between the jowls and hangs to the upper chest when they reach <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a>, with a fringe of hair on its edge. The large ears of the giant eland serve as signaling devices. Giant elands have comparatively longer legs than the common eland, as well as much brighter black and white markings on the legs and <a href="pastern">pastern</a>s.

Both sexes have tightly spiraled, 'V'-shaped <a href="Horn%20%28anatomy%29">horns</a>. They can be up to long on males and on females. Males have horns that are thicker at the ends, longer, and more divergent than those of females. These features of the horns suggest that the giant eland evolved from an ancestor with true <a href="Display%20%28zoology%29">display</a> horns.

Fecal studies of the western giant eland revealed the presence of a newly found species "<a href="Eimeria%20derbani">Eimeria derbani</a>", of genus "<a href="Eimeria">Eimeria</a>", which consists of <a href="Apicomplexa">Apicomplexa</a>n parasites. The <a href="sporulation">sporulation</a> lasted for two days at a temperature of . The species has been differentiated from "<a href="Eimeria%20canna">E.Â canna</a>" and "<a href="Eimeria%20triffittae">E.Â triffittae</a>", which parasitize the common eland ("T.Â oryx"). The giant eland is also parasitised by "<a href="Carmyerius%20spatiosus">Carmyerius spatiosus</a>" (a <a href="trematode">trematode</a> species), "<a href="Taenia%20crocutae">Taenia crocutae</a>" and "<a href="Taenia%20hyaenae">T.Â hyaennae</a>" (two <a href="tapeworm">tapeworm</a> species).

The giant eland has 31 male <a href="chromosome">chromosome</a>s and 32 female chromosomes. In a 2008 <a href="phylogenomics">phylogenomic</a> study of spiral-horned antelopes, chromosomal similarities were observed between <a href="Bos%20taurus">cattle</a> ("Bos taurus") and eight species of spiral-horned antelopes, namely: <a href="nyala">nyala</a> ("Tragelaphus angasii"), <a href="lesser%20kudu">lesser kudu</a> ("T.Â imberbis"), bongo ("T.Â eurycerus"), <a href="bushbuck">bushbuck</a> ("T.Â scriptus"), <a href="greater%20kudu">greater kudu</a> ("T.Â strepsiceros"), <a href="sitatunga">sitatunga</a> ("T.Â spekei"), giant eland and common eland ("T.Â oryx"). It was found that chromosomes involved in <a href="Centromere">centric</a> <a href="Fusion%20gene">fusion</a>s in these species used a complete set of cattle <a href="Fluorescence%20in%20situ%20hybridization">painting probes</a> generated by <a href="Laser%20capture%20microdissection">laser microdissection</a>. The study confirmed the presence of the <a href="chromosome%20translocation">chromosome translocation</a> known as <a href="Robertsonian%20translocation">Robertsonian translocation</a> (1;29), a widespread evolutionary marker common to all known tragelaphid species.

An accidental mating between a male giant eland and a female kudu produced a male offspring, but it was <a href="azoospermic">azoospermic</a>. Analysis showed that it completely lacked <a href="germ%20cell">germ cell</a>s, which produce <a href="gamete">gamete</a>s. Still, the hybrid had a strong male scent and exhibited male behaviour. Chromosomal examination showed that chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11 differed from the parental <a href="karyotype">karyotype</a>s. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears like the eland's, but a bit widened like kudu's. The tail was half the length of that of an eland with a tuft of hair at the end as in kudu.

Previous genetic studies of African savanna <a href="ungulate">ungulate</a>s revealed the presence of a long-standing <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> <a href="Refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugium</a> in eastern and southern Africa, which also includes the giant eland. The common eland and giant eland have been estimated to have diverged about 1.6 million years ago.

Giant elands live in the broad-leafed savanna, woodlands, and glades of central and western Africa, which correspond to the two subspecies. They also live in forests as well as on the fringes of deserts. The giant elands can also live in deserts, as they produce very dry dung. They are found in South Sudan and <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a> into northern <a href="Cameroon">Cameroon</a> and southern <a href="Chad">Chad</a>.

They inhabit places near hilly or rocky landscapes and those with water sources nearby. Science author <a href="Jonathan%20Kingdon">Jonathan Kingdon</a> had thought the giant elands lived only in woodlands of "<a href="Isoberlinia%20doka">Isoberlinia doka</a>", an African hardwood tree. The giant eland is adapted to these broad-leafed, deciduous "<a href="Isoberlinia">Isoberlinia</a>" woodlands. Recent studies proved that they also inhabit woodlands with trees of the genera "Terminalia", "<a href="Combretum">Combretum</a>", and "<a href="Afzelia">Afzelia</a>".

In the past, giant elands occurred throughout the relatively narrow belt of savanna woodland that extends across West and Central Africa from Senegal to the Nile. Today they are conserved in national parks and reserves, and occur mostly in Senegal. The western giant eland is largely restricted to <a href="Niokolo-Koba%20National%20Park">Niokolo-Koba National Park</a> in <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. The eastern giant eland is found in several reserves, for example in <a href="B%C3%A9nou%C3%A9%20National%20Park">BÃ©nouÃ© National Park</a>, <a href="Faro%20National%20Park">Faro National Park</a> and <a href="Bouba%20Njida%20National%20Park">Bouba Njida National Park</a> in Cameroon and in <a href="Manovo-Gounda%20St.%20Floris%20National%20Park">Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park</a> in the Central African Republic. They are also kept in captivity.

Primarily <a href="nocturnal">nocturnal</a>, giant elands have large home ranges and seasonal migration patterns. They form separate groups of males and of females and juveniles. Adult males mainly remain alone, and often spend time with females for an hour to a week. A gregarious species, giant eland herds usually consist of 15â25 animals (sometimes even more) and do not disband during the wet season, suggesting that social rather than ecological factors are responsible for herding. During the day, herds often rest in sheltered areas. As many other animals do, giant elands scrape <a href="mineral%20lick">mineral lick</a> sites with the help of horns to loosen soil.

Giant elands are alert and wary, making them difficult to approach and observe or to hunt. If a bull senses danger, he will give deep-throated barks while leaving the herd, repeating the process until the whole herd is aware of the danger. Giant elands can move quickly, running at over , and despite their size are exceptional jumpers, easily clearing heights of . Their primary predators are the <a href="lion">lion</a> and <a href="spotted%20hyena">spotted hyena</a>, while young, sickly and a rare adult may be vulnerable to <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s and <a href="African%20wild%20dog">African wild dog</a>s. Due to their large size, they prove a good meal for the predators. However, they are not easily taken by any predator, especially the heavier and larger horned bulls which can be a dangerous adversary even for a lion pride.

Primarily a herbivore, the giant eland eats grasses and foliage, as well as other parts of a plant. In the rainy season, they browse in herds and feed on grasses. They can eat coarse, dry grass and weeds if nothing else is available. They eat fruits too, such as plums. A study in South Africa showed that an eland's diet consists of 75% shrubs and 25% grasses, with highly varying proportions. They often use their long horns to break off branches.

As they need a regular intake of water in their diet, they prefer living in places with a nearby water source. However, some adaptations they possess help them to survive even in the lack of water by maintaining a sufficient quantity of it in their body. They produce very dry dung compared to domestic cattle. In deserts, they can get their required water from the moisture of <a href="succulent%20plant">succulent plant</a>s. Another way in which they conserve water is by resting in the day and feeding at night, so that they minimize the water quantity required to cool themselves.

Several studies have investigated the eland's diet. A study of giant elands in the Bandia Natural reserve in Senegal revealed that the most important and most preferred plants were various species of "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>", "<a href="Terminalia%20%28plant%29">Terminalia</a>" and "Combretum", along with "<a href="Azadirachta%20indica">Azadirachta indica</a>", "<a href="Danielia%20olliveri">Danielia olliveri</a>", "<a href="Lonchocarpus%20laxiflorus">Lonchocarpus laxiflorus</a>", "<a href="Maytenus%20senegalensis">Maytenus senegalensis</a>", "<a href="Prosopis%20africana">Prosopis africana</a>", "<a href="Pterocarpus%20erinaceus">Pterocarpus erinaceus</a>", "<a href="Saba%20senegalensis">Saba senegalensis</a>" and pods of "<a href="Piliostigma%20thonningii">Piliostigma thonningii</a>". Another study in <a href="Sudan">Sudan</a> showed that western giant elands preferred "<a href="Cassia%20tora">Cassia tora</a>", which was the most abundant <a href="legume">legume</a> in the region.

In 2010, <a href="histology">histological</a> analysis of the feces of South African western giant elands was done in the Niokolo-Koba National Park and in the Bandia National Reserve. In both studies leaves, shoots of woody plants, and fruits were found to be the three major components. The other components that appeared in minor proportions were <a href="forb">forb</a>s and grasses, generally below five percent of the mean fecal volume. They were seen eating most foliage from "<a href="Boscia%20angusifolia">Boscia angusifolia</a>", "<a href="Grewia%20bicolor">Grewia bicolor</a>", "<a href="Hymenocardia%20acida">Hymenocardia acida</a>", and "<a href="Ziziphus%20mauritiana">Ziziphus mauritiana</a>", and the fruits of "Acacia" and "<a href="Strychnos%20spinosa">Strychnos spinosa</a>". In the Bandia Reserve, differences in diet were marked among age classes. The conclusions were that in the dry season the eland was a pure browser, consuming grasses in small amounts.

Mating occurs throughout the year, but peaks in the wet season. Females reach sexual maturity at about two years, and males at four to five years. A female can remain in <a href="estrus">estrus</a> for three days, and the estrous cycle is 21â26 days long. As in all antelopes, mating occurs at a time of food abundance. In some areas distinct breeding seasons exist. In southern Africa, females have been seen giving birth from August to October, and are joined by the males from late October to January. In <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a> calves are born in July and August.

Fights occur for <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominance</a>, in which the bulls lock horns and try to twist the necks of their opponents. As an act during <a href="Rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rut</a>, the males rub their foreheads in fresh urine or mud. They also use their horns to thresh and throw loose earth on themselves. The horns of older males get worn out due to rubbing them on tree barks. Expressions of anger are not typically observed. Dominant males may mate with multiple females. The <a href="courtship">courtship</a> is brief, consisting of a penetration and one ejaculatory thrust.

After the courtship, the <a href="Pregnancy%20%28mammals%29">gestational period</a> begins, which is of nine months duration. The delivery usually takes place in the night, after which the mother ingests the <a href="afterbirth">afterbirth</a>. Generally one calf is delivered, and it remains with its mother for six months. <a href="Lactation">Lactation</a> can last for four to five months. After the first six months the young eland might join a group of other juveniles.

A Senegalese study focused on the <a href="suckling">suckling</a> behaviour of giant eland and common eland calves about one to five months old determined that suckling bouts increased with the age of the calves. No other change occurred in the farmed common eland calves, but in the giant eland calves, the males were found to suckle more than female ones and shorter suckling bouts were marked in <a href="Parity%20%28biology%29">primiparous</a> mothers than multiparous ones. The results suggest that Derby elands that lived in their natural habitat adjusted their maternal behaviour so as to be able to readily maintain a vigilant lookout for predators and other similar risks. In contrast, the farmed common elands behaved as in the conditions of captivity, without predators.

The eastern giant eland ranged from <a href="Nigeria">Nigeria</a>, through Cameroon, Chad, the Central African Republic, and the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (formerly Zaire) to Sudan and Uganda in 1980. But the <a href="rinderpest">rinderpest</a> outbreak (1983â1984) caused a devastating 60â80% decline in the populations. The eastern giant eland is still found in extensive areas, though it has a decreasing population trend. Because of this, it is listed as '<a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>' by the IUCN. It has many uninhabited habitats that are not expected to be occupied for human settlement, particularly in northern and eastern Central African Republic and south-western Sudan, where their population has notably increased. According to Rod East, 15,000 eastern giant elands existed as of 1999, of which 12,500 are in Central African Republic. The remaining areas are often disturbed by wars and conflictsâactivities that can lead to a rapid decline in the eastern giant eland's numbers if not controlled.

The western giant eland is in a more dangerous situation, being listed as '<a href="Critically%20Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>' by the IUCN. Today they mostly occur in <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. In 1990, populations were about 1000, of which 700 to 800 were found in the Niokolo-Koba National Park and the rest in the region around the <a href="Fal%C3%A9m%C3%A9%20River">FalÃ©mÃ© River</a>. As of 2008, a population of less than 200 individuals occur there, and only a few elands exist in neighboring countries.

A study of the long-term conservation strategy of the western giant eland was done in the Bandia and Fathala reserves, using demographic and pedigree data based on continuous monitoring of reproduction during 2000 to 2009. In 2009, the semi-captive population was 54 individuals (26 males, 28 females). The female breeding probability was 84%, and the annual population growth was 1.36. With more population, the elands were divided into five groups for observation. Although the mean interbreeding level became 0.119, a potential <a href="genetic%20diversity">gene diversity</a> (GD) of 92% was retained. The authors concluded that with the introduction of new <a href="founder%20effect">founders</a>, the GD could be greatly improved in the next 100 years, and suggested that with proper management of the semi-captive population, the numbers of the western giant eland could be increased.

The major threats to the western giant eland population are overhunting for its rich meat and <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> caused by the expansion of human and livestock populations. The eastern giant eland is also depleting for similar reasons, and natural causes like continued droughts and competition from domestic animals are contributing to the reduction in numbers. Populations of the eastern giant eland had already gone down due to the rinderpest attacks. The situation was worse during World War II and other civil wars and political conflicts that harmed their natural habitats.

The giant eland is already extirpated in <a href="The%20Gambia">The Gambia</a>, <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>, and <a href="Togo">Togo</a>. The western giant eland was once reported in Togo, but is believed to have been confused with the <a href="Bongo%20%28antelope%29">bongo</a> ("Tragalephaus eurycerus"). In 1970, it was reported eliminated in Uganda, during military operations. Its presence is uncertain in Guinea-Bissau and Nigeria.

Today the western giant eland is conserved in the <a href="Niokolo-Koba%20National%20Park">Niokolo-Koba National Park</a> and the Faheme Hunting Zone in Senegal. Field studies have proved that the Niokolo-Koba National Park is ecologically suitable for the giant eland. As observed in the 2000 census of the park, the number of deaths in a decade were only 90 to 150.

The eastern giant eland is conserved in the <a href="Faro%20National%20Park">Faro National Park</a>, <a href="B%C3%A9nou%C3%A9%20National%20Park">BÃ©nouÃ© National Park</a>, Bouba Njida National Park, <a href="Bamingui-Bangoran%20National%20Park">Bamingui-Bangoran National Park</a> and <a href="Manovo-Gounda%20St.%20Floris%20National%20Park">Manovo-Gounda St. Floris National Park</a>. They are bred in captivity in the Bandia Reserve and <a href="Fathala%20Reserve">Fathala Reserve</a> in Senegal, and at <a href="White%20Oak%20Conservation">White Oak Conservation</a> in <a href="Yulee%2C%20Florida">Yulee, Florida</a>, United States. Eland born at White Oak have been sent to other countries, including Costa Rica and South Africa, to initiate breeding programs.

Giant elands give large quantities of tender meat and high-quality hides even if fed a low-quality diet. These are game animals and are also hunted for trophies. Their milk is comparatively richer in <a href="dietary%20protein">protein</a>s and <a href="milkfat">milkfat</a> than dairy cows, which may be an explanation for the quick growth of eland calves. Eland's milk has about triple the fat content and twice the protein of a dairy cow's milk. Its docility and profitable characteristics have made it a target of domestication in Africa and Russia and has also resulted in hunting.

Many people prefer to tame and raise eland rather than cattle due to their numerous benefits. Elands can survive on scarce water, which is a great advantage over domestic cattle. They can also eat coarse grasses, and can even manage to ingest some poisonous plants that can prove fatal for cattle. They are also immune to some diseases to which cattle may succumb.

The team plays most of its home matches at the <a href="Estadio%20Nacional%20del%20Per%C3%BA">Estadio Nacional</a> in <a href="Lima">Lima</a>, the country's capital.

The Peruvian team is well-known for its white shirts adorned with a diagonal red stripe, which combine <a href="Flag%20of%20Peru">Peru's national colours</a>. This basic design has been used continuously since 1936, and gives rise to the team's common Spanish nickname, "la Blanquirroja" ("the white-and-red"). Peruvian football fans are known for their distinctive cheer "Â¡Arriba PerÃº!" ("Onward Peru!"). Peru has longstanding rivalries <a href="Chile%E2%80%93Peru%20football%20rivalry">with Chile</a> and Ecuador.

The Peruvian national team enjoyed its most successful periods in the 1930s and the 1970s. In the 1930s, Peru took part in the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 and enjoyed victories in the <a href="1938%20Bolivarian%20Games">1938 Bolivarian Games</a> and the <a href="1939%20South%20American%20Championship">1939 Copa AmÃ©rica</a>, with goalkeeper <a href="Juan%20Valdivieso">Juan Valdivieso</a> and forwards <a href="Teodoro%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Teodoro FernÃ¡ndez</a> and <a href="Alejandro%20Villanueva">Alejandro Villanueva</a> playing important roles. In the 1970s, Peru qualified for three World Cups and won the <a href="1975%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica">Copa AmÃ©rica in 1975</a>, attaining worldwide recognition; the team then notably included defender <a href="H%C3%A9ctor%20Chumpitaz">HÃ©ctor Chumpitaz</a> and the forward partnership of <a href="Hugo%20Sotil">Hugo Sotil</a> and <a href="Te%C3%B3filo%20Cubillas">TeÃ³filo Cubillas</a>, often regarded as Peru's greatest player.

The national team's all-time top goalscorer is <a href="Paolo%20Guerrero">Paolo Guerrero</a>, with 35 goals, and its most-<a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">capped</a> player is <a href="Roberto%20Palacios">Roberto Palacios</a>, with 128 appearances. Under manager <a href="Ricardo%20Gareca">Ricardo Gareca</a>, Peru earned third at the <a href="2015%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica">2015 Copa AmÃ©rica</a>, reached the quarterfinals of the <a href="Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%20Centenario">Copa AmÃ©rica Centenario</a>, and participated in the group stage of the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20Group%20C">2018 FIFA World Cup</a> finals.

During the 19th century, <a href="British%20Peruvian">British immigrants</a> and Peruvians returning from England introduced football to Peru. In 1859, members of the British community in the country's capital founded the <a href="Lima%20Cricket%20and%20Football%20Club">Lima Cricket Club</a>, Peru's first organization dedicated to the practice of cricket, rugby, and football. These new sports became popular among the local upper-class over the following decades, but early developments stopped due to the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Pacific">War of the Pacific</a> that Peru fought against <a href="Chile">Chile</a> from 1879 to 1883. After the war, Peru's coastal society embraced football as a modern innovation. In Lima's "<a href="barrio">barrio</a>s", football became a popular daily activity, encouraged by bosses who wanted it to inspire solidarity and productivity among their workers. In the adjacent port of <a href="Callao">Callao</a> and other commercial areas, British civilian workers and sailors played the sport among themselves and with locals. Sports rivalries between locals and foreigners arose in Callao, and between elites and workers in Limaâas foreigners departed, this became a rivalry between Callao and Lima. These factors, coupled with the sport's rapid growth among the urban poor of Lima's <a href="La%20Victoria%20District%2C%20Lima">La Victoria</a> district (where, in 1901, the <a href="Alianza%20Lima">Alianza Lima</a> club formed), led to Peru developing the <a href="Andes">Andean region</a>'s strongest footballing culture, and, according to historian Andreas Campomar, "some of the most elegant and accomplished football on the continent".
The <a href="Peruvian%20Primera%20Divisi%C3%B3n">Peruvian Football League</a>, founded in 1912, held annual competitions until it broke up in 1921, amid disputes between the member clubs. The Peruvian Football Federation (FPF), formed in 1922, reorganised the annual tournament in 1926. The FPF joined the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) in 1925 and, after restructuring its finances, formed Peru's national team in 1927. The team debuted in the <a href="1927%20South%20American%20Championship">1927 South American Championship</a>, hosted by the FPF at Lima's Estadio Nacional. Peru lost 0â4 against <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a> in its first match, and won 3â2 over <a href="Bolivia%20national%20football%20team">Bolivia</a> in its second. Peru next competed in the <a href="1930%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">inaugural FIFA World Cup</a> in 1930, but did not advance past the first stage.

During the 1930s, Peruvian football's first <a href="Golden%20generation">golden era</a>, Peruvians traveled abroad for competition to further develop their football. A notable travel, held in Europe between 1933 and 1934 by the "Combinado del PacÃ­fico" (a squad composed of Chilean and Peruvian footballers), provided the South Americans with much experience. Starting with <a href="Ciclista%20Lima%20Association">Ciclista Lima</a> in 1926, Peruvian football clubs also toured <a href="Latin%20America">Latin America</a>, achieving numerous victories. During one of these toursâAlianza Lima's undefeated journey through Chile in 1935âemerged the "<a href="Rodillo%20Negro">Rodillo Negro</a>" ("Black Roller"), a skillful group led by forwards Alejandro Villanueva, Teodoro FernÃ¡ndez and goalkeeper Juan Valdivieso. Sports historian Richard Witzig described these three as "a soccer triumvirate unsurpassed in the world at that time", citing their combined innovation and effectiveness at both ends of the field. Peru and the "Rodillo Negro" awed crowds at the 1936 Summer Olympics, won the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201938%20Bolivarian%20Games">inaugural Bolivarian Games</a> in 1938, and finished the decade as South American champions.

Subsequent years proved less successful for the team; according to historian David Goldblatt, "despite all the apparent preconditions for footballing growth and success, Peruvian football disappeared". He attributes this sudden decline to Peruvian authorities' repression of "social, sporting and political organisations among the urban and rural poor" during the 1940s and 1950s. Nevertheless, Peru performed creditably at the South American Championships, earning third in <a href="1949%20South%20American%20Championship">Brazil 1949</a> and <a href="1955%20South%20American%20Championship">Chile 1955</a>, and only narrowly missed qualification for the <a href="1958%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Sweden 1958 World Cup</a> finals, losing over <a href="Two-legged%20tie">two legs</a> to eventual champions Brazil.
Successes during the late 1960s, including qualification for the <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Mexico 1970 World Cup</a> finals, ushered in a second golden period for Peruvian football. The formidable forward partnership between TeÃ³filo Cubillas and Hugo Sotil was a key factor in Peru's triumphs during the 1970s. Peru reached the quarter-finals in 1970, losing to the tournament winners Brazil, and earned the first <a href="FIFA%20Fair%20Play%20Trophy">FIFA Fair Play Trophy</a>; historian Richard Henshaw describes Peru as "the surprise of the 1970 competition, showing flair and a high level of skill". Five years later, Peru became South American champions for the second time when it won the 1975 Copa AmÃ©rica (the then-rechristened South American Championship). The team next qualified for two consecutive World Cup finals, reaching the second round in <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Argentina 1978</a> and the first group stage in <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Spain 1982</a>. Peru's early elimination in 1982 marked the end of the side's globally-admired "flowing football". In spite of this, Peru barely missed the <a href="1986%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Mexico 1986 World Cup</a> finals after placing second in a qualification group to eventual champions <a href="Argentina%20national%20football%20team">Argentina</a>.

Renewed expectations for Peru were centred on a young generation of Alianza Lima players known colloquially as "Los Potrillos" ("The Colts"). Sociologists Aldo Panfichi and Victor Vich write that "Los Potrillos" "became the hope of the entire country"âfans expected them to qualify for the <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Italy 1990 World Cup</a> finals. The national team entered a hiatus after its manager and several of its players <a href="1987%20Alianza%20Lima%20air%20disaster">died in a plane crash</a> carrying most of Alianza's team and staff in 1987. Peru subsequently only came close to reaching the <a href="1998%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">France 1998 World Cup</a> finals, missing qualification only on <a href="goal%20difference">goal difference</a>, but would go on to win the 1999 <a href="Kirin%20Cup">Kirin Cup</a> tournament in Japan (sharing the title with <a href="Belgium%20national%20football%20team">Belgium</a>) and <a href="Peru%20at%20the%20CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup">reached the semifinals</a> at the <a href="2000%20CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup">2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup</a> (contested as an invitee).

Qualification for the FIFA World Cup finals continued being an elusive objective for Peru during the early 21st century. According to historian <a href="Charles%20F.%20Walker">Charles F. Walker</a>, player <a href="Peru%20national%20football%20team%20indiscipline%20scandals">indiscipline problems</a> marred Peru's national team and football league. Troubles in the FPF, particularly with its then-president Manuel Burga, deepened the crisis in Peruvian footballâFIFA temporarily suspended the country from international competition, in late 2008, because the Peruvian government investigated alleged corruption within the FPF. Nonetheless, Peru succeeded in winning the 2005 and 2011 Kirin Cup tournaments, and earned third place in the <a href="2011%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica">2011 Copa AmÃ©rica</a>. In early 2015, businessman <a href="Edwin%20Oviedo">Edwin Oviedo</a> became FPF president, succeeding Burga, whom two years later faced charges of <a href="Racket%20%28crime%29">racketeering</a>, <a href="Mail%20and%20wire%20fraud">wire fraud</a>, and <a href="money%20laundering">money laundering</a> in a <a href="2015%20FIFA%20corruption%20case">football corruption trial</a> in the United States. The FPF's new leadership appointed Ricardo Gareca as Peru's manager in March 2015. Under Gareca, Peru achieved third place in the 2015 Copa AmÃ©rica, reached the quarterfinals of the <a href="Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica%20Centenario">Copa AmÃ©rica Centenario</a>, and participated in the group stage of the <a href="2018%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">Russia 2018 World Cup</a> finals.

The Peru national football team plays in red and white, the country's national colours. Its first-choice <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kit</a> has been, since 1936, white shorts, white socks, and white shirts with a distinctive red "<a href="sash">sash</a>" crossing their front diagonally from the <a href="Proper%20right">proper left</a> shoulder to the right hip and returning on the back from the right hip to the proper left shoulder. This basic scheme has been only slightly altered over the years.
Peru's kit has won praise as one of world football's most attractive designs. Christopher Turpin, the executive producer of <a href="NPR">NPR</a>'s "<a href="All%20Things%20Considered">All Things Considered</a>" news show, lauded the 1970 iteration as "the beautiful game's most beautiful shirt", also describing it as "<a href="Retro%20style">retro</a> even in 1970". Miles Kohrman, football reporter for "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>", commended Peru's kit as "one of soccer's best-kept secrets". <a href="Rory%20Smith%20%28journalist%29">Rory Smith</a>, Chief Soccer Correspondent for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", referred to Peru's 2018 version of the jersey as "a classic" with a nostalgic, fan-pleasing "blood-red sash". The version worn in 1978 came first in a 2010 <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> list of the "Best World Cup jerseys of all time", described therein as "simple yet strikingly effective".

Peru's first kit, made for the 1927 South American Championship, comprised a white-and-red striped shirt, white shorts and black socks. At the 1930 World Cup, Peru used an alternate design because <a href="Paraguay%20national%20football%20team">Paraguay</a> had already registered a similar kit with white-and-red striped shirts. The Peruvians instead wore white shirts with a red collar, white shorts and black socks. The team added a horizontal red stripe to the shirt for the 1935 South American Championship. The following year, at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, the team adopted the iconic diagonal red sash design it has retained ever since. According to historian Jaime Pulgar-Vidal OtÃ¡lora, the idea for the design came from school football matches in which coloured sashes worn over the shoulder would allow two teams wearing white shirts to play against each other.

Peru wears as its badge the emblem of the Peruvian Football Federation. The first badge, presented in 1927, had a <a href="heater%20shield">heater shield</a> design with the country's name and the federation's acronym (FPF). Eight different emblems followed, with the longest-lasting design being the modern French <a href="Escutcheon%20%28heraldry%29">escutcheon</a> form emblazoned in the team's jersey from 1953 until 2014. This design had the Peruvian flag at its base, and either the country's name or the federation's acronym at its chief. Since 2014, the badge has a retro-inspired heater shield design, with the entire field comprised by Peru's flag and the federation's acronym, surrounded by a gold-colored frame.

Eight sportswear manufacturers have supplied Peru's national team. The first, the German company <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a>, supplied the team's kit in 1978, and again between 1983-1985. The FPF have also signed contracts with manufacturers from Brazil (<a href="Penalty%20%28sports%20manufacturer%29">Penalty</a>, 1981â82), Canada (Power, 1989-1991), Italy (<a href="Diadora">Diadora</a>, 1991-1992), England (<a href="Umbro">Umbro</a>, 1996-1997, 2010-2018), and another from Germany (<a href="Puma%20%28brand%29">Puma</a>, 1987-1989). The team has also been supplied by three local firms: Calvo Sporwear (1986-1987), Polmer (1993-1995), and <a href="Walon%20Sport">Walon Sport</a> (1998-2010). Since August 2018, the Ecuadorian <a href="Marathon%20Sports">Marathon Sports</a> produce Peru's kit.

The traditional home of Peruvian football is the country's national stadium, the Estadio Nacional in Lima, which houses 45,000 spectators. The present ground is the Estadio Nacional's third incarnation, renovated under the <a href="Alan%20Garc%C3%ADa">Alan GarcÃ­a</a> administration. Its official re-inauguration, 24 July 2011, marked 88 years to the day after the <a href="Estadio%20Nacional%20%281897%29">original ground</a> opened on the same site in 1923.

To celebrate the centenary of Peru's <a href="Peruvian%20War%20of%20Independence">independence</a> from Spain, Lima's British community donated the original Estadio Nacional, a wooden structure with a capacity of 6,000. Construction began on 28 July 1921, overseen by President <a href="Augusto%20B.%20Legu%C3%ADa">Augusto B. LeguÃ­a</a>. The stadium's re-inauguration on 27 October 1952, under the <a href="Manuel%20A.%20Odr%C3%ADa">Manuel A. OdrÃ­a</a> administration, followed an onerous campaign for its renovation led by <a href="Miguel%20Dasso">Miguel Dasso</a>, president of the "Sociedad de Beneficencia de Lima". The renovated stadium boasted a cement structure and larger spectator capacity of 53,000. Its last redevelopment, in 2011, included the construction of a plaque-covered exterior, an internal multicoloured illumination system, two giant <a href="Light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> screens, and 375 private suites.

A distinctive feature of the ground is the Miguel Dasso Tower on its northern side, which contains <a href="luxury%20box">luxury box</a>es (renovated in 2004). The Estadio Nacional currently has a natural <a href="Cynodon%20dactylon">bermudagrass</a> pitch, reinstalled as part of redevelopments completed in 2011. Previously, the FPF had installed <a href="artificial%20turf">artificial turf</a> in the stadium for the <a href="2005%20FIFA%20U-17%20World%20Championship">2005 FIFA U-17 World Championship</a>, making it the only national stadium in CONMEBOL with such a turf. Despite the synthetic ground's rating of "FIFA Star II", the highest certification granted to artificial pitches, players accused the turf of causing them injuries, such as burns and bruises.

Peru sometimes play home matches at other venues. Outside the desert-like coast region of Lima, the thin atmosphere at the high-altitude <a href="Estadio%20Garcilaso%20de%20la%20Vega">Estadio Garcilaso de la Vega</a> in <a href="Cusco">Cusco</a> has been described as providing strategic advantages for Peru against certain visiting teams. Other common alternate venues for the national team include two other grounds in the Peruvian capitalâAlianza's <a href="Estadio%20Alejandro%20Villanueva">Estadio Alejandro Villanueva</a> and <a href="Club%20Universitario%20de%20Deportes">Universitario</a>'s <a href="Estadio%20Monumental%20%26quot%3BU%26quot%3B">Estadio Monumental</a>.

The national team's training grounds are located within the "Villa Deportiva Nacional" (VIDENA) <a href="sports%20complex">sports complex</a> in Lima's <a href="San%20Luis%20District%2C%20Lima">San Luis</a> district. Since 1981, the complex is managed by the Peruvian Institute of Sport (IPD). In 2017, following Peru's qualification for the Russia 2018 World Cup finals, the Peruvian Football Federation announced the creation of a new complex, the Center of National Teams, in Lima's <a href="Chaclacayo">Chaclacayo</a> district. The new complex will contain six training grounds for both the male and the female squads, including the senior and the youth sides.

Football has been the most popular sport in Peru since the early 20th century. Originally largely exclusive to Lima's <a href="Anglophile">Anglophile</a> elite and expatriates, and secluded from the rest of the city, football became an integral part of wider popular culture during the 1900s and 1910s. Over the following decades, Augusto LeguÃ­a's government institutionalised the sport into a national pastime by promoting and organising its development. Consequently, the national football team became an important element of Peru's <a href="national%20identity">national identity</a>. According to the historian Carlos Aguirre, <a href="Nationalism">nationalist</a> fervor spiked during the <a href="1970%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification">qualification phase</a> for the 1970 World Cup finals, because the revolutionary government of General <a href="Juan%20Velasco%20Alvarado">Juan Velasco Alvarado</a> tied the national team's success with the alleged cultural, social, and psychological changes spurred by the country's new political project.

Peruvian football fans are known for their distinctive cheer "Â¡Arriba PerÃº!" ("Onward Peru!"), unabating popular chant "<a href="Vamos%20%28football%20chant%29">Â¡Vamos peruanos!</a>" (Let's go Peruvians!), as well as for their use of traditional Peruvian "<a href="m%C3%BAsica%20criolla">mÃºsica criolla</a>" to express support, both at national team games and at club matches. "MÃºsica criolla" attained national and international recognition with the advent of <a href="mass%20media">mass media</a> during the 1930s, becoming a recognised symbol of Peru and its culture. The national team's most popular anthems are "<a href="Peru%20Campe%C3%B3n">Peru CampeÃ³n</a>", a "<a href="polca%20criolla">polca criolla</a>" (Peruvian polka) glorifying Peru's qualification for the Mexico 1970 World Cup, and "<a href="Contigo%20Per%C3%BA">Contigo PerÃº</a>", a "<a href="vals%20criollo">vals criollo</a>" (Peruvian waltz) that newspaper "<a href="El%20Comercio%20%28Peru%29">El Comercio</a>" calls "the hymn of Peruvian national football teams". Peru's unsuccessful World Cup finals qualification attempts, from Mexico 1986 until Russia 2018, cemented the fans' nostalgia for the 1970s' golden era and increased the popularity of "Peru CampeÃ³n".

The <a href="Estadio%20Nacional%20disaster">Estadio Nacional disaster</a> of 24 May 1964, involving Peruvian supporters, is cited as one of the worst tragedies in football history. During a qualifying match for the <a href="1964%20Summer%20Olympics">1964 Olympics</a> between Peru's under-20 team and its counterpart from Argentina, the Uruguayan referee Angel Payos disallowed a would-be Peruvian equaliser, alleging rough play. Spectators threw missiles from the stands while two fans invaded the pitch and attacked the referee. Police threw <a href="tear%20gas">tear gas</a> into the crowd, causing a stampede; trying to escape, fans were crushed against the stadium's locked gates. A total of 315 people died in the chaos, with more than 500 others injured.

The Peru national football team maintains prominent rivalries with its counterparts from neighbouring <a href="Chile%20national%20football%20team">Chile</a> and <a href="Ecuador%20national%20football%20team">Ecuador</a>. The Peruvians have a favourable record against Ecuador and a negative record against Chile. Peru faced both rivals in the 1939 South American Championship in Lima, which also marked the first time that Peru faced Ecuador in an official tournament; Peru won both games. Peru also defeated its rivals during qualifying for the <a href="1978%20FIFA%20World%20Cup%20qualification%20%28CONMEBOL%29">Argentina 1978 World Cup</a>, directly eliminating both teams.

The ChileâPeru football rivalry is known in Spanish as the "ClÃ¡sico del PacÃ­fico" ("Pacific Derby"). <a href="CNN">CNN</a> World Sport editor Greg Duke ranks it among the top ten football rivalries in the world. Peru first faced Chile in the 1935 South American Championship, defeating it 1â0. The football rivalry between Peru and Chile, partly a reflection of the geopolitical conflict between both neighboring states, is primarily a result of both football squads vying for recognition as the better team in South America's Pacific coastâas their football confederation is historically dominated by countries in South America's Atlantic coast. The two countries traditionally compete with each other over the rank of fourth-best national team in South America (after Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay). They also both claim to have invented the <a href="bicycle%20kick">bicycle kick</a>; Peruvians call it the "chalaca", while it is the "chilena" in Chile.

The rivalry between the Ecuador and Peru football teams is rooted in the historical <a href="History%20of%20the%20Ecuadorian%E2%80%93Peruvian%20territorial%20dispute">border conflict</a> between the countries dating back to the 19th century. In 1995, after the brief <a href="Cenepa%20War">Cenepa War</a>, CONMEBOL contemplated altering <a href="1995%20Copa%20Am%C3%A9rica">that year's Copa AmÃ©rica</a> group stage to prevent a match between the two sides, but ultimately did not. According to cultural historian <a href="Michael%20Handelsman">Michael Handelsman</a>, Ecuadorian fans consider losses to <a href="Colombia%20national%20football%20team">Colombia</a> or Peru "an excuse to lament Ecuador's inability to establish itself as an international soccer power". Handelsman adds that "[t]he rivalries are intense, and the games always carry an element of national pride and honor".

The following 23 players have been called up for the friendly matches against <a href="Paraguay%20national%20football%20team">Paraguay</a> and <a href="El%20Salvador%20national%20football%20team">El Salvador</a> on 22 and 26 March 2019 respectively.
<br>"Caps and goals are correct as of 20 November 2018 after the match against <a href="Costa%20Rica%20national%20football%20team">Costa Rica</a>."

The players listed below were not included in the current squad, but have been called up by Peru in the last 12 months.

A report published by CONMEBOL in 2008 described Peru as traditionally exhibiting an "elegant, technical and fine football style", and praised it as "one of the most loyal exponents of South American football talent". In 2017, Argentine manager Ricardo Gareca described Peruvian footballers as "technically sound, [physically] strong and adaptable", adding that their adaptability resulted from Peru's diverse <a href="Geography%20of%20Peru">geography</a>.

Peruvian players noted in the CONMEBOL report as "true artists of the ball" include forwards TeÃ³filo Cubillas, <a href="Pedro%20Pablo%20Le%C3%B3n">Pedro Pablo LeÃ³n</a> and Hugo Sotil, defender <a href="H%C3%A9ctor%20Chumpitaz">HÃ©ctor Chumpitaz</a> and midfielders <a href="Roberto%20Challe">Roberto Challe</a>, <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Cueto">CÃ©sar Cueto</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20del%20Solar">JosÃ© del Solar</a>, and <a href="Roberto%20Palacios">Roberto Palacios</a>. Cubillas, an attacking midfielder and forward popularly known as "El Nene" ("The Kid"), is widely regarded as Peru's greatest ever player. Chumpitaz is often cited as the team's best defender; Witzig lists him among his "Best Players of the Modern Era", and praises him as "a strong reader of the game with excellent ball skills and distribution, [who] marshalled a capable defence to support Peru's attack". "<a href="El%20Gr%C3%A1fico">El GrÃ¡fico</a>", an Argentine sports journal, described Cueto, Cubillas, and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Vel%C3%A1squez%20%28footballer%29">JosÃ© VelÃ¡squez</a> as, collectively, "the best [midfield] in the world" in 1978.

Before Cubillas' appearance, Teodoro "Lolo" FernÃ¡ndez, a forward nicknamed "El CaÃ±onero" ("The Cannoneer"), held the status of Peru's greatest playerâdue to his powerful shots, marksmanship, and club loyalty to Universitario. FernÃ¡ndez participated as a key member of the "Rodillo Negro" team of the 1930s, along with Alejandro Villanueva and Juan Valdivieso. FernÃ¡ndez scored most of the team's goals; his partner in attack, the gifted playmaker Villanueva, awed audiences with his acrobatic skills. Goalkeeper Valdivieso had a reputation as a <a href="Penalty%20kick%20%28association%20football%29">penalty</a> stopper with exceptional athleticism.

In 1972, teams representing <a href="Europe%20XI">Europe</a> and South America played a commemorative match in Basel, Switzerland, for the benefit of homeless children. Cubillas, Chumpitaz, Sotil, and <a href="Julio%20Bayl%C3%B3n">Julio BaylÃ³n</a> played in the South American team, which won the game 2â0; Cubillas scored the first goal. The teams held another match the following year, at Barcelona's <a href="Camp%20Nou">Camp Nou</a>, with the declared intent of fighting global poverty. Cubillas, Chumpitaz, and Sotil again participated, with Chumpitaz named South America's captain. Each of the Peruvians scored in a 4â4 draw, which South America won 7â6 <a href="Penalty%20shoot-out%20%28association%20football%29">on penalties</a>.

A total of 59 <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">managers</a> have led the Peru national football team since 1927 (including multiple spells separately); of these, 36 have been from Peru and 23 have been from abroad. Sports analysts and historians generally consider Peru's most successful managers to have been the Englishman <a href="Jack%20Greenwell">Jack Greenwell</a> and the Peruvian <a href="Marcos%20Calder%C3%B3n">Marcos CalderÃ³n</a>. The former managed Peru to triumph in the 1938 Bolivarian Games and the 1939 South American Championship, and the latter led Peru to victory in the 1975 Copa AmÃ©rica tournament and coached it at the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Three other managers have led Peru to tournament victoriesâ<a href="Juan%20Carlos%20Oblitas">Juan Carlos Oblitas</a>, <a href="Freddy%20Ternero">Freddy Ternero</a>, and <a href="Sergio%20Markari%C3%A1n">Sergio MarkariÃ¡n</a> each oversaw Peru's victory in the Kirin Cup in Japan, in 1999, 2005 and 2011, respectively.

Soon after forming Peru's national football team, the FPF invited Uruguayan coaches <a href="Pedro%20Olivieri">Pedro Olivieri</a> and <a href="Julio%20Borelli">Julio Borelli</a> to manage the squad. Olivieri received the FPF's first appointment, for the 1927 South American Championship, due to his prior experience managing <a href="Uruguay%20national%20football%20team">Uruguay</a>. Borelli became the national team's second manager, for the 1929 South American Championship, after some years of <a href="Referee%20%28association%20football%29">refereeing</a> football matches in Peru. The Spaniard <a href="Francisco%20Bru">Francisco Bru</a>, Peru's third manager and first World Cup coach at the inaugural tournament in 1930, previously had been <a href="Spain%20national%20football%20team">Spain</a>'s first manager. The FPF next appointed the national team's first Peruvian coach, <a href="Telmo%20Carbajo">Telmo Carbajo</a>, for the <a href="1935%20South%20American%20Championship">1935 South American Championship</a>. The team's manager since 2015 is the Argentine <a href="Ricardo%20Gareca">Ricardo Gareca</a>.

Managers that brought outstanding changes to the Peru national team's style of play include the Hungarian <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Orth">GyÃ¶rgy Orth</a> and the Brazilians <a href="Didi%20%28footballer%29">Didi</a> and <a href="Tim%20%28footballer%29">Tim</a>. Orth coached Peru from 1957 to 1959; sports historian Andreas Campomar cites Peru's "4â1 thrashing of England in Lima" as evidence of Orth's positive influence over the national team's offensive game. <a href="V%C3%ADctor%20Ben%C3%ADtez">VÃ­ctor BenÃ­tez</a>, Peru's defensive midfielder under Orth, attributes the Hungarian with maximizing the team's potential by accurately placing each player in their <a href="Association%20football%20positions">optimal positions</a>. Didi coached Peru from 1968 to 1970 and managed it at the 1970 FIFA World Cup; Campomar attributes Didi's tactics as the reason for Peru's development of a "free-flowing football" style. "<a href="Placar">Placar</a>", a Brazilian sports journal, attributed Tim, who managed Peru at the 1982 FIFA World Cup, with making Peru "a team that plays beautiful, combining efficiency with that swagger that people thought only existed in Brazil".

Peru has taken part in the World Cup finals five times. The Peruvian team competed at the first World Cup in 1930 by invitation, and has entered each tournament at the qualifying stage since 1958, qualifying for the finals four times: in 1970, 1978, 1982 and 2018. Its all-time record in World Cup qualifying matches, as of 2017, stands at 42 wins, 36 draws and 69 losses. In the finals, the team has won five matches, drawn three and lost ten, with 19 goals in favour and 32 against. Peru won the inaugural FIFA Fair Play Trophy, awarded at the 1970 World Cup, having been the only team not to receive any <a href="Yellow%20card%20%28sports%29">yellow</a> or <a href="Red%20card%20%28sports%29">red cards</a> during the competition. Peru has the peculiar distinction of facing the future FIFA World Cup champions during the tournament's finals phase.

<a href="Luis%20de%20Souza%20Ferreira">Luis de Souza Ferreira</a> scored Peru's first World Cup goal on 14 July 1930, in a match against <a href="Romania%20national%20football%20team">Romania</a>. <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Vel%C3%A1squez%20%28footballer%29">JosÃ© VelÃ¡squez</a> scored Peru's fastest World Cup finals goalâthat is, that scored soonest after kick-offâtwo minutes into the match against <a href="Iran%20national%20football%20team">Iran</a> on 11 June 1978. <a href="Jefferson%20Farf%C3%A1n">Jefferson FarfÃ¡n</a> is Peru's top scorer and fifth-overall top scorer in CONMEBOL World Cup qualification, with 16 goals. TeÃ³filo Cubillas is the team's top scorer in the World Cup finals, with 10 goals in 13 games. During the 1930 competition, a Peruvian became the first player <a href="Ejection%20%28sports%29">sent off</a> in a World Cupâhis identity is disputed between sources. Peru's <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Quiroga">RamÃ³n Quiroga</a> holds the unusual record of being the only goalkeeper to commit a foul in the opponent's side of the pitch in a match at the World Cup finals.

Peru's national team has taken part in 31 editions of the Copa AmÃ©rica since 1927, and has won the competition twice (in 1939 and 1975). The country has hosted the tournament six times (in 1927, 1935, 1939, 1953, 1957 and 2004). Peru's overall record in the competition is 52 victories, 33 draws, and 57 losses. Peru won the Fair Play award in the 2015 edition.

<a href="Demetrio%20Neyra">Demetrio Neyra</a> scored Peru's first goal in the competition on 13 November 1927, in a match against Bolivia. <a href="Christian%20Cueva">Christian Cueva</a> scored Peru's fastest Copa AmÃ©rica goal, two minutes into the match against <a href="Brazil%20national%20football%20team">Brazil</a> on 14 June 2015. Three tournaments have featured a Peruvian top scorerâTeodoro FernÃ¡ndez in 1939 and <a href="Paolo%20Guerrero">Paolo Guerrero</a> in 2011 and 2015. FernÃ¡ndez, the Copa AmÃ©rica's third-overall scorer, was named best player of the 1939 tournament; TeÃ³filo Cubillas, voted the best player in the 1975 competition, is the only other Peruvian to win this award.

Peru earned its first continental title in 1939, when it won the South American Championship with successive victories over Ecuador, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. This marked the first time that the competition had been won by a team other than Uruguay, Brazil, or Argentina. Peru became South American champions for the second time in 1975, when it won that year's Copa AmÃ©rica, the first to feature all ten CONMEBOL members. Peru came top of their group in the first round, eliminating Chile and Bolivia, and in the semifinals drew with Brazil over two legs, winning 3â1 in Brazil but losing 2â0 at home. Peru was declared the winner by drawing of lots. In the two-legged final between Colombia and Peru, both teams won their respective home games (1â0 in Bogota and 2â0 in Lima), forcing a play-off in <a href="Caracas">Caracas</a> that Peru won 1â0.

Peru competed in the <a href="CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup">CONCACAF Gold Cup</a>'s fifth edition <a href="2000%20CONCACAF%20Gold%20Cup">in 2000</a>. Peru participated, along with Colombia and <a href="South%20Korea%20national%20football%20team">South Korea</a>, as that year's invitees. The Peruvian team's overall record in the tournament is 1 victory, 1 draw, and 2 losses.

<a href="Ysrael%20Z%C3%BA%C3%B1iga">Ysrael ZÃºÃ±iga</a> scored Peru's first goal in the competition on 14 February 2000, in a match against <a href="Haiti%20national%20football%20team">Haiti</a>. <a href="Roberto%20Palacios">Roberto Palacios</a>, the team's top scorer with two goals in four matches, received a spot in that year's "team of the tournament", comprising the competition's eleven best players.

Peru progressed past the North American tournament's first stage, despite not winning any of its matches, as the second-best ranked team in Group B behind the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20soccer%20team">United States</a>. Peru next defeated <a href="Honduras%20national%20football%20team">Honduras</a> 5â3 in a heated quarterfinals match that ended a minute early due to a <a href="pitch%20invasion">pitch invasion</a> by irate Honduran fans. Colombia defeated Peru 2â1 in the semifinals, in a match that included an <a href="own%20goal">own goal</a> from Peru's <a href="Marcial%20Salazar">Marcial Salazar</a>.

Peru's senior side has competed in the Olympic football tournament once, at the 1936 Summer Olympics in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, Germany. The multiracial 1936 team has been latterly described by historian David Goldblatt as "the jewel of the country's first Olympic delegation". It had a record of two victories, scoring 11 goals and conceding 5.

Teodoro FernÃ¡ndez scored Peru's first goal in the tournament in the match against <a href="Finland%20national%20football%20team">Finland</a> on 6 August, and finished as the team's top scorer with six goals in two games, including Peru's only <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a> at the Olympics.

The <a href="1935%20South%20American%20Championship">1935 South American Championship</a> in Lima acted as the qualifying stage for the <a href="Football%20at%20the%201936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Olympic tournament</a>. Uruguay won undefeated and Argentina came second, but neither took up their Olympic spot because of economic issues. Peru, who had come third, duly represented South America. The Peruvian team began the competition with a 7â3 win over Finland, after which it faced <a href="Austria%20national%20football%20team">Austria</a>, managed by <a href="Jimmy%20Hogan">Jimmy Hogan</a> and popularly known as the "<a href="Wunderteam">Wunderteam</a>", in the quarterfinals.

Peru expected to then face Poland in the semifinals, but events off the pitch led to the withdrawal of Peru's Olympic delegation before the match.

The Peru national football team has played 610 matches since 1927, including friendlies. The largest margin of victory achieved by a Peru side is 9â1 against Ecuador, on 11 August 1938 at the Bolivarian Games in Colombia. The team's record deficit, 7â0, occurred against Brazil at the 1997 Copa AmÃ©rica in Bolivia.

The Peruvian player with the most international <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">caps</a> is <a href="Roberto%20Palacios">Roberto Palacios</a>, who represented the country 128Â times between 1992 and 2007.

Kingdom of Mysore

The Kingdom of Mysore was a kingdom in <a href="South%20India">southern India</a>, traditionally believed to have been founded in 1399 in the vicinity of the modern city of <a href="Mysore">Mysore</a>. The kingdom, which was ruled by the <a href="Wodeyar">Wodeyar</a> family, initially served as a <a href="Feudalism">vassal state</a> of the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>. With the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire (c. 1565), the kingdom became independent. The 17th century saw a steady expansion of its territory and during the rule of <a href="Kanthirava%20Narasaraja%20I">Narasaraja Wodeyar I</a> and <a href="Chikka%20Devaraja">Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar</a>, the kingdom annexed large expanses of what is now southern Karnataka and parts of Tamil Nadu to become a powerful state in the southern <a href="Deccan%20Plateau">Deccan</a>.

The kingdom reached the height of its <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Mysore">economic</a> and military power and dominion in the latter half of the 18th century under the de facto ruler <a href="Hyder%20Ali">Haider Ali</a> and his son <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>. During this time, it came into conflict with the <a href="Maratha%20Empire">Marathas</a>, the <a href="Nizam%20of%20Hyderabad">Nizam of Hyderabad</a>, the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Travancore">Kingdom of Travancore</a> and the <a href="British%20Empire">British</a>, which culminated in the four <a href="Anglo-Mysore%20Wars">Anglo-Mysore Wars</a>. Success in the first Anglo-Mysore war and a stalemate in the second was followed by defeat in the third and fourth. Following Tipu's death in the fourth war of 1799, large parts of his kingdom were annexed by the British, which signalled the end of a period of Mysorean hegemony over southern Deccan. The British restored the Wodeyars to their throne by way of a <a href="subsidiary%20alliance">subsidiary alliance</a> and the diminished Mysore was transformed into a <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a>. The Wodeyars continued to rule the state until <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">Indian independence in 1947</a>, when Mysore acceded to the <a href="Dominion%20of%20India">Union of India</a>.

Even as a princely state, Mysore came to be counted among the more developed and urbanised regions of India. This period (1799â1947) also saw Mysore emerge as one of the important centres of art and culture in India. The Mysore kings were not only accomplished exponents of the fine arts and men of letters, they were enthusiastic patrons as well, and their legacies continue to influence music and art even today.

Sources for the history of the kingdom include numerous extant lithic and copper plate <a href="epigraphy">inscriptions</a>, records from the Mysore palace and contemporary literary sources in <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a>, <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> and other languages. According to traditional accounts, the kingdom originated as a small state based in the modern city of <a href="Mysore">Mysore</a> and was founded by two brothers, Yaduraya (also known as Vijaya) and Krishnaraya. Their origins are mired in legend and are still a matter of debate; while some historians posit a northern origin at <a href="Dwarka">Dwarka</a>, others locate it in Karnataka. Yaduraya is said to have married Chikkadevarasi, the local princess and assumed the feudal title "Wodeyar" ("lit", "Lord"), which the ensuing dynasty retained. The first unambiguous mention of the Wodeyar family is in 16th century <a href="Kannada%20literature">Kannada literature</a> from the reign of the Vijayanagara king <a href="Achyuta%20Deva%20Raya">Achyuta Deva Raya</a> (1529â1542); the earliest available inscription, issued by the Wodeyars themselves, dates to the rule of the petty chief Timmaraja II in 1551.

The kings who followed ruled as vassals of the Vijayanagara empire until the decline of the latter in 1565. By this time, the kingdom had expanded to thirty-three villages protected by a force of 300 soldiers. King Timmaraja II conquered some surrounding chiefdoms, and King "Bola" Chamaraja IV ("lit", "Bald"), the first ruler of any political significance among them, withheld tribute to the nominal Vijayanagara monarch Aravidu Ramaraya. After the death of Aravidu <a href="Aliya%20Rama%20Raya">Aliya Rama Raya</a>, the Wodeyars began to assert themselves further and King Raja Wodeyar I wrested control of <a href="Srirangapatna">Srirangapatna</a> from the Vijayanagara governor ("Mahamandaleshvara") Aravidu Tirumalla â a development which elicited, if only "ex post facto", the tacit approval of Venkatapati Raya, the incumbent king of the diminished Vijayanagar empire ruling from <a href="Chandragiri">Chandragiri</a>. Raja Wodeyar I's reign also saw territorial expansion with the annexation of <a href="Channapatna">Channapatna</a> to the north from Jaggadeva Raya â a development which made Mysore a regional political factor to reckon with.

Consequently, by 1612â13, the Wodeyars exercised a great deal of autonomy and even though they acknowledged the nominal overlordship of the <a href="Aravidu%20dynasty">Aravidu dynasty</a>, tributes and transfers of revenue to <a href="Chandragiri%20Fort%2C%20Andhra%20Pradesh">Chandragiri</a> stopped. This was in marked contrast to other major chiefs "Nayaks" of Tamil country who continued to pay off Chandragiri emperors well into the 1630s. Chamaraja VI and Kanthirava Narasaraja I attempted to expand further northward but were thwarted by the <a href="Bijapur%20Sultanate">Bijapur Sultanate</a> and its Maratha subordinates, though the Bijapur armies under Ranadullah Khan were effectively repelled in their 1638 siege of Srirangapatna. Expansionist ambitions then turned southward into Tamil country where Narasaraja Wodeyar acquired Satyamangalam (in modern northern <a href="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a> district) while his successor Dodda Devaraja Wodeyar expanded further to capture western Tamil regions of <a href="Erode">Erode</a> and <a href="Dharmapuri">Dharmapuri</a>, after successfully repulsing the chiefs of <a href="Madurai">Madurai</a>. The invasion of the <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Keladi Nayaka</a>s of <a href="Malnad">Malnad</a> was also dealt with successfully. This period was followed by one of complex geo-political changes, when in the 1670s, the Marathas and the Mughals pressed into the Deccan.

Chikka Devaraja (r. 1672â1704), the most notable of Mysore's early kings, who ruled during much of this period, managed to not only survive the exigencies but further expanded territory. He achieved this by forging strategic alliances with the Marathas and the <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughals</a>. The kingdom soon grew to include <a href="Salem%2C%20Tamil%20Nadu">Salem</a> and <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> to the east, <a href="Hassan%20District">Hassan</a> to the west, <a href="Chikkamagaluru">Chikkamagaluru</a> and <a href="Tumkur">Tumkur</a> to the north and the rest of <a href="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a> to the south. Despite this expansion, the kingdom, which now accounted for a fair share of land in the southern Indian heartland, extending from the <a href="Western%20Ghats">Western Ghats</a> to the western boundaries of the <a href="Coromandel%20Coast">Coromandel</a> plain, remained landlocked without direct coastal access. Chikka Devaraja's attempts to remedy this brought Mysore into conflict with the <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">"Nayaka"</a> chiefs of <a href="Ikkeri">Ikkeri</a> and the kings ("Rajas") of Kodagu (modern Coorg); who between them controlled the <a href="Kanara">Kanara</a> coast (coastal areas of modern Karnataka) and the intervening hill region respectively. The conflict brought mixed results with Mysore annexing Periyapatna but suffering a reversal at Palupare.

Nevertheless, from around 1704, when the kingdom passed on to "Muteking" ("Mukarasu") <a href="Narasaraja%20Wodeyar%20II">Kanthirava Narasaraja II</a>, the survival and expansion of the kingdom was achieved by playing a delicate game of alliance, negotiation, subordination on occasion, and annexation of territory in all directions. According to historians Sanjay Subrahmanyam and Sethu Madhava Rao, Mysore was now formally a tributary of the Mughal empire. Mughul records claim a regular tribute ("peshkash") was paid by Mysore. However, historian <a href="Suryanath%20U.%20Kamath">Suryanath U. Kamath</a> feels the Mughals may have considered Mysore an ally, a situation brought about by MughalâMaratha competition for supremacy in southern India. By the 1720s, with the Mughal empire in decline, further complications arose with the Mughal residents at both <a href="Arcot">Arcot</a> and <a href="Sira%2C%20India">Sira</a> claiming tribute. The years that followed saw Krishnaraja Wodeyar I tread cautiously on the matter while keeping the Kodagu chiefs and the Marathas at bay. He was followed by Chamaraja Wodeyar VII during whose reign power fell into the hands of prime minister ("Dalwai" or "Dalavoy") Nanjarajiah (or Nanjaraja) and chief minister ("Sarvadhikari") Devarajiah (or Devaraja), the influential brothers from Kalale town near <a href="Nanjangud">Nanjangud</a> who would rule for the next three decades with the Wodeyars relegated to being the titular heads. The latter part of the rule of <a href="Krishnaraja%20Wodeyar%20II">Krishnaraja II</a> saw the Deccan Sultanates being eclipsed by the Mughals and in the confusion that ensued, <a href="Hyder%20Ali">Haider Ali</a>, a captain in the army, rose to prominence. His victory against the Marathas at <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> in 1758, resulting in the annexation of their territory, made him an iconic figure. In honour of his achievements, the king gave him the title "Nawab Haider Ali Khan Bahadur".

Haider Ali has earned an important place in the <a href="history%20of%20Karnataka">history of Karnataka</a> for his fighting skills and administrative acumen. The rise of Haidar came at a time of important political developments in the sub-continent. While the European powers were busy transforming themselves from trading companies to political powers, the Nizam as the "<a href="subedar">subedar</a>" of the Mughals pursued his ambitions in the Deccan, and the Marathas, following their defeat at Panipat, sought safe havens in the south. The period also saw the <a href="Carnatic%20Wars">French vie with the British</a> for control of the Carnaticâa contest in which the British would eventually prevail as British commander <a href="Eyre%20Coote%20%28East%20India%20Company%20officer%29">Sir Eyre Coote</a> decisively defeated the French under the <a href="Thomas%20Arthur%2C%20comte%20de%20Lally">Comte de Lally</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wandiwash">Battle of Wandiwash</a> in 1760, a watershed in Indian history as it cemented British supremacy in South Asia. Though the Wodeyars remained the nominal heads of Mysore during this period, real power lay in the hands of Haider Ali and his son Tipu.

By 1761, the Maratha menace had diminished and by 1763, Haider Ali had captured the <a href="Keladi%20Nayaka">Keladi kingdom</a>, defeated the rulers of <a href="Bilgi%2C%20Karnataka">Bilgi</a>, Bednur and Gutti, invaded the Malabar in the south and conquered the <a href="Zamorin">Zamorin</a>'s capital <a href="History%20of%20Kozhikode">Calicut</a> with ease in 1766 and extended the Mysore kingdom up to <a href="Dharwad">Dharwad</a> and <a href="Bellary">Bellary</a> in the north. Mysore was now a major political power in the subcontinent and Haider's meteoric rise from relative obscurity and his defiance formed one of the last remaining challenges to complete British hegemony over the Indian subcontinentâa challenge which would take them more than three decades to overcome.

In a bid to stem Haidar's rise, the British formed an alliance with the Marathas and the <a href="Nizam">Nizam</a> of Golconda, culminating in the <a href="First%20Anglo-Mysore%20War">First Anglo-Mysore War</a> in 1767. Despite numerical superiority Haider Ali suffered defeats at the battles of Chengham and Tiruvannamalai. The British ignored his overtures for peace until Haider Ali had strategically moved his armies to within five miles of Madras (modern Chennai) and was able to successfully <a href="Suing%20for%20peace">sue for peace</a>. In 1770, when the Maratha armies of <a href="Madhavrao%20Peshwa">Madhavrao Peshwa</a> invaded Mysore (three wars were fought between 1764 and 1772 by Madhavrao against Haider, in which Haider lost), Haider expected British support as per the 1769 treaty but they betrayed him by staying out of the conflict. The British betrayal and Haider's subsequent defeat reinforced Haider's deep distrust of the Britishâa sentiment that would be shared by his son and one which would inform Anglo-Mysore rivalries of the next three decades. In 1777, Haider Ali recovered the previously lost territories of Coorg and Malabar from the Marathas. Haider Ali's army advanced towards the Marathas and fought them at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saunshi">Battle of Saunshi</a> and came out victorious during the same year.

By 1779, Haider Ali had captured parts of modern Tamil Nadu and <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a> in the south, extending the Kingdom's area to about 80,000Â miÂ² (205,000Â kmÂ²). In 1780, he befriended the French and made peace with the Marathas and the Nizam. However, Haider Ali was betrayed by the Marathas and the Nizam, who made treaties with the British as well. In July 1779 Haider Ali headed an army of 80,000, mostly cavalry, descending through the passes of the Ghats amid burning villages, before laying siege to British forts in northern Arcot starting the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Mysore%20War">Second Anglo-Mysore War</a>. Haider Ali had some initial successes against the British notably at <a href="Battle%20of%20Pollilur">Pollilur</a>, the worst defeat the British suffered in India until <a href="Battle%20of%20Chillianwala">Chillianwala</a>, and Arcot, until the arrival of Sir Eyre Coote]], when the fortunes of the British began to change. On 1 June 1781 Coote] struck the first heavy blow against Haider Ali in the decisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Porto%20Novo">Battle of Porto Novo</a>. The battle was won by Coote against odds of five to one, and is regarded as one of the greatest feats of the British in India. It was followed up by another hard-fought battle at Pollilur (the scene of an <a href="Battle%20of%20Pollilur">earlier triumph of Haider Ali</a> over a British force) on 27 August, in which the British won another success, and by the rout of the Mysore troops at <a href="Sholinghur">Sholinghur</a> a month later. Haider Ali died on 7 December 1782, even as fighting continued with the British. He was succeeded by his son <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> who continued hostilities against the British by recapturing Baidanur and Mangalore.

By 1783 neither the British nor Mysore were able to obtain a clear overall victory. The French withdrew their support of Mysore following the <a href="Treaties%20of%20Versailles%20%281783%29%23Treaty%20with%20France">peace settlement in Europe</a>. Undaunted, Tipu, popularly known as the "Tiger of Mysore", continued the war against the British but lost some regions in modern coastal Karnataka to them. The <a href="Maratha%E2%80%93Mysore%20War">MarathaâMysore War</a> occurred between 1785 and 1787 and consisted of a series of conflicts between the Sultanate of Mysore and the Maratha Empire. Following <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>'s victory against the Marathas at the <a href="Siege%20of%20Bahadur%20Benda">Siege of Bahadur Benda</a>, a peace agreement was signed between the two kingdoms with mutual gains and losses. Similarly, the <a href="treaty%20of%20Mangalore">treaty of Mangalore</a> was signed in 1784 bringing hostilities with the British to a temporary and uneasy halt and restoring the others' lands to the <a href="status%20quo%20ante%20bellum">status quo ante bellum</a>. The treaty is an important document in the history of India, because it was the last occasion when an Indian power dictated terms to the British, who were made to play the role of humble supplicants for peace. A start of fresh hostilities between the British and French in Europe would have been sufficient reason for Tipu to abrogate his treaty and further his ambition of striking at the British. His attempts to lure the Nizam, the Marathas, the French and the King of Turkey failed to bring direct military aid.

Tipu's <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nedumkotta">successful attacks</a> in 1790 on the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Travancore">Kingdom of Travancore</a>, a British ally, was an effective victory for him, however it resulted in greater hostilities with the British which resulted in the <a href="Third%20Anglo-Mysore%20War">Third Anglo-Mysore War</a>. In the beginning, the British made gains, taking the <a href="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a> district, but Tipu's counterattack reversed many of these gains. By 1792, with aid from the Marathas who attacked from the north-west and the Nizam who moved in from the north-east, the British under <a href="Charles%20Cornwallis%2C%201st%20Marquess%20Cornwallis">Lord Cornwallis</a> successfully <a href="Siege%20of%20Seringapatam%20%281792%29">besieged Srirangapatna</a>, resulting in Tipu's defeat and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Seringapatam">Treaty of Srirangapatna</a>. Half of Mysore was distributed among the allies, and two of his sons were held to ransom. A humiliated but indomitable Tipu went about re-building his economic and military power. He attempted to covertly win over support from <a href="Revolutionary%20France">Revolutionary France</a>, the <a href="Amir">Amir</a> of Afghanistan, the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> and Arabia. However, these attempts to involve the French soon became known to the British, who were at the time fighting the French in <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Egypt</a>, were backed by the Marathas and the Nizam. In 1799, Tipu died <a href="Battle%20of%20Seringapatam">defending Srirangapatna</a> in the <a href="Fourth%20Anglo-Mysore%20War">Fourth Anglo-Mysore War</a>, heralding the end of the Kingdom's independence. Modern Indian historians consider Tipu Sultan an inveterate enemy of the British, an able administrator and an innovator.

Following Tipu's fall, a part of the kingdom of Mysore was annexed and divided between the Madras Presidency and the Nizam. The remaining territory was transformed into a Princely State; the five-year-old scion of the Wodeyar family, <a href="Krishnaraja%20Wodeyar%20III">Krishnaraja III</a>, was installed on the throne with chief minister ("Diwan") <a href="Purnaiah">Purnaiah</a>, who had earlier served under Tipu, handling the reins as regent and Lt. Col. <a href="Barry%20Close">Barry Close</a> taking charge as the British Resident. The British then took control of Mysore's foreign policy and also exacted an annual tribute and a subsidy for maintaining a standing British army at Mysore. As Diwan, Purnaiah distinguished himself with his progressive and innovative administration until he retired from service in 1811 (and died shortly thereafter) following the 16th birthday of the boy king.
The years that followed witnessed cordial relations between Mysore and the British until things began to sour in the 1820s. Even though the Governor of Madras, Thomas Munro, determined after a personal investigation in 1825 that there was no substance to the allegations of financial impropriety made by A. H. Cole, the incumbent Resident of Mysore, the Nagar rebellion (a civil insurrection) which broke out towards the end of the decade changed things considerably. In 1831, close on the heels of the insurrection and citing mal-administration, the British took direct control of the princely state. For the next fifty years, Mysore passed under the rule of successive British Commissioners; Sir <a href="Mark%20Cubbon">Mark Cubbon</a>, renowned for his statesmanship, served from 1834 until 1861 and put into place an efficient and successful administrative system which left Mysore a well-developed state.

In 1876â77, however, towards the end of the period of direct British rule, Mysore was struck by a devastating famine with estimated mortality figures ranging between 700,000 and 1,100,000, or nearly a fifth of the population. Shortly thereafter, Maharaja Chamaraja X, educated in the British system, took over the rule of Mysore in 1881, following the success of a lobby set up by the Wodeyar dynasty that was in favour of <a href="Rendition%20%28law%29">rendition</a>. Accordingly, a resident British officer was appointed at the Mysore court and a Diwan to handle the Maharaja's administration. From then onwards, until Indian independence in 1947, Mysore remained a Princely State within the <a href="British%20Raj">British Indian Empire</a>, with the Wodeyars continuing their rule.

After the demise of Maharaja Chamaraja X, <a href="Nalvadi%20Krishnaraja%20Wodeyar">Krishnaraja IV</a>, still a boy of eleven, ascended the throne in 1895. His mother Maharani Kemparajammanniyavaru ruled as regent until Krishnaraja took over the reins on 8 February 1902. Under his rule, with Sir M. Vishweshwariah as his Diwan, the Maharaja set about transforming Mysore into a progressive and modern state, particularly in industry, education, agriculture and art. Such were the strides that Mysore made that <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> called the Maharaja a "saintly king" ("Rajarishi"). <a href="Paul%20Brunton">Paul Brunton</a>, the British philosopher and orientalist, <a href="John%20Gunther">John Gunther</a>, the American author, and British statesman Lord Samuel praised the ruler's efforts. Much of the pioneering work in educational infrastructure that took place during this period would serve Karnataka invaluably in the coming decades. The Maharaja was an accomplished musician, and like his predecessors, avidly patronised the development of the fine arts. He was followed by his nephew <a href="Jayachamaraja%20Wodeyar">Jayachamaraja</a> whose rule came to an end when he signed the instrument of accession and Mysore joined the Indian Union on 9 August 1947.

There are no records relating to the administration of the Mysore territory during the <a href="Vijayanagara%20Empire">Vijayanagara Empire</a>'s reign (1399â1565). Signs of a well-organised and independent administration appear from the time of Raja Wodeyar I who is believed to have been sympathetic towards peasants ("<a href="raiyat">raiyat</a>s") who were exempted from any increases in taxation during his time. The first sign that the kingdom had established itself in the area was the issuing of gold coins ("Kanthirayi phanam") resembling those of the erstwhile Vijayanagara Empire during Narasaraja Wodeyar's rule.

The rule of Chikka Devaraja saw several reforms were effected. Internal administration was remodeled to suit the kingdom's growing needs and became more efficient. A postal system came into being. Far reaching financial reforms were also introduced. A number of petty taxes were imposed in place of direct taxes, as a result of which the peasants were compelled to pay more by way of land tax. The king is said to have taken a personal interest in the regular collection of revenues the treasury burgeoned to 90,000,000Â "<a href="Pagoda%20%28coin%29">Pagoda</a>" (a unit of currency) â earning him the epithet "Nine <a href="crore">crore</a> Narayana" ("Navakoti Narayana"). In 1700, he sent an embassy to Aurangazeb's court who bestowed upon him the title "Jug Deo Raja" and awarded permission to sit on the ivory throne. Following this, he founded the district offices ("Attara Kacheri"), the central secretariat comprising eighteen departments, and his administration was modeled on Mughal lines.

During <a href="Hyder%20Ali">Haider Ali</a>'s rule, the kingdom was divided into five provinces ("Asofis") of unequal size, comprising 171 <a href="taluk">taluk</a>s ("Paraganas") in total. When <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> became the "de facto" ruler, the kingdom, which encompassed (62,000Â miÂ²), was divided into 37 provinces and a total of 124 taluks ("Amil"). Each province had a governor ("Asof"), and one deputy governor. Each taluk had a headman called "Amildar" and a group of villages were in charge of a "Patel". The central administration comprised six departments headed by ministers, each aided by an advisory council of up to four members.

When the <a href="princely%20state">princely state</a> came under direct British rule in 1831, early commissioners Lushington, Briggs and Morrison were followed by Mark Cubbon, who took charge in 1834. He made <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> the capital and divided the princely state into four divisions, each under a British superintendent. The state was further divided into 120 taluks with 85 taluk courts, with all lower level administration in the <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada language</a>. The office of the commissioner had eight departments; revenue, post, police, cavalry, public works, medical, animal husbandry, judiciary and education. The judiciary was hierarchical with the commissioners' court at the apex, followed by the "Huzur Adalat", four superintending courts and eight "Sadar Munsiff" courts at the lowest level. <a href="Lewin%20Bentham%20Bowring">Lewin Bowring</a> became the chief commissioner in 1862 and held the position until 1870. During his tenure, the property "Registration Act", the "Indian Penal code" and "Code of Criminal Procedure" came into effect and the judiciary was separated from the executive branch of the administration. The state was divided into eight <a href="districts%20of%20India">districts</a> â Bangalore, Chitraldroog, Hassan, Kadur, Kolar, Mysore, Shimoga, and Tumkur.

After rendition, <a href="C.%20V.%20Rungacharlu">C. V. Rungacharlu</a>, was made the Diwan. Under him, the first Representative Assembly of British India, with 144 members, was formed in 1881. He was followed by <a href="K.%20Seshadri%20Iyer">K. Seshadri Iyer</a> in 1883 during whose tenure gold mining at the <a href="Kolar%20Gold%20Fields">Kolar Gold Fields</a> began, the <a href="Shivanasamudra">Shivanasamudra</a> <a href="hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> project was initiated in 1899 (the first such major attempt in India) and electricity and drinking water (the latter through pipes) was supplied to Bangalore. Seshadri Iyer was followed by <a href="P.%20N.%20Krishnamurti">P. N. Krishnamurti</a>, who founded The Secretariat Manual to maintain records and the Co-operative Department in 1905, <a href="V.%20P.%20Madhava%20Rao">V. P. Madhava Rao</a> who focussed on conservation of forests and <a href="T.%20Ananda%20Rao">T. Ananda Rao</a>, who finalised the Kannambadi Dam project.

Sir <a href="Mokshagundam%20Visvesvaraya">M. Visvesvaraya</a>, popularly known as the "Maker of Modern Mysore", holds a key place in the history of Karnataka. An engineer by education, he became the Diwan in 1909. Under his tenure, membership of the Mysore Legislative Assembly was increased from 18 to 24, and it was given the power to discuss the state budget. The Mysore Economic Conference was expanded into three committees; industry and commerce, education, and agriculture, with publications in English and Kannada. Important projects commissioned during his time included the construction of the <a href="Kannambadi">Kannambadi</a> Dam, the founding of the <a href="Visvesvaraya%20Iron%20and%20Steel%20Limited">Mysore Iron Works at Bhadravathi</a>, founding of the <a href="Mysore%20University">Mysore University</a> in 1916, the <a href="University%20Visvesvaraya%20College%20of%20Engineering">University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering</a> in Bangalore, establishment of the Mysore state railway department and numerous industries in Mysore. In 1955, he was awarded the <a href="Bharat%20Ratna">Bharat Ratna</a>, India's highest civilian honor.

Sir <a href="Mirza%20Ismail">Mirza Ismail</a> took office as Diwan in 1926 and built on the foundation laid by his predecessor. Amongst his contributions were the expansion of the Bhadravathi Iron Works, the founding of a cement and paper factory in <a href="Bhadravathi%2C%20Karnataka">Bhadravathi</a> and the launch of <a href="Hindustan%20Aeronautics%20Limited">Hindustan Aeronautics Limited</a>. A man with a penchant for gardens, he founded the <a href="Brindavan%20Gardens">Brindavan Gardens</a> (Krishnaraja Sagar) and built the <a href="Kaveri%20River">Kaveri River</a> high-level canal to irrigate in modern Mandya district.

In 1939 <a href="Mandya%20District">Mandya District</a> was carved out of Mysore District, bringing the number of districts in the state to nine.

The vast majority of the people lived in villages and agriculture was their main occupation. The economy of the kingdom was based on agriculture. Grains, pulses, vegetables and flowers were cultivated. Commercial crops included sugarcane and cotton. The agrarian population consisted of landlords ("<a href="Gowda%20%28caste%29">vokkaliga</a>", "<a href="zamindar">zamindar</a>", "<a href="hegde">heggadde</a>") who tilled the land by employing a number of landless labourers, usually paying them in grain. Minor cultivators were also willing to hire themselves out as labourers if the need arose. It was due to the availability of these landless labourers that kings and landlords were able to execute major projects such as palaces, temples, mosques, anicuts (dams) and tanks. Because land was abundant and the population relatively sparse, no rent was charged on land ownership. Instead, landowners paid tax for cultivation, which amounted to up to one-half of all harvested produce.

The Kingdom of Mysore reached a peak in economic power under <a href="Hyder%20Ali">Hyder Ali</a> and <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a>, in the post-<a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> era of the mid-late 18th century. They embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under their reign, Mysore overtook the <a href="Bengal%20Subah">Bengal Subah</a> as <a href="Economic%20history%20of%20India">India's dominant economic power</a>, with productive <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a> and <a href="textile%20manufacturing">textile manufacturing</a>.

Tipu Sultan is credited with founding state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="Jeddah">Jeddah</a> and <a href="Muscat%2C%20Oman">Muscat</a>, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and <a href="Metalsmith">smithing</a>, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from <a href="Bengal">Bengal</a> helped improve the <a href="sericulture">sericulture</a> industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and <a href="sandalwood">sandalwood</a>, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.

The <a href="Mysore%20silk">Mysore silk</a> industry was initiated during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Later the industry was hit by a global depression and competition from imported silk and <a href="rayon">rayon</a>. In the second half of the 20th century, it however revived and the <a href="Mysore%20State">Mysore State</a> became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.

Under Tipu Sultan, Mysore enjoyed one of the world's highest <a href="real%20wages">real wages</a> and <a href="living%20standards">living standards</a> in the late 18th century, higher than Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe. Mysore's average <a href="per-capita%20income">per-capita income</a> was five times higher than <a href="subsistence">subsistence</a> level, i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 <a href="international%20dollars">international dollars</a>), or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes in 1820 were $1,838 for the Netherlands and $1,706 for Britain.

This system changed under the British, when tax payments were made in cash, and were used for the maintenance of the army, police and other civil and public establishments. A portion of the tax was transferred to England as the "Indian tribute". Unhappy with the loss of their traditional revenue system and the problems they faced, peasants rose in rebellion in many parts of south India. After 1800, the Cornwallis land reforms came into effect. Reade, Munro, Graham and Thackeray were some administrators who improved the economic conditions of the masses. However, the homespun textile industry suffered during British rule, with the exception of the producers of the finest cloth and the coarse cloth which was popular with the rural masses. This was due to the manufacturing mills of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and Scotland being more than a match for the traditional handweaving industry, especially in spinning and weaving.

The economic revolution in England and the tariff policies of the British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called "kambli". This economic fallout led to the formation of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.

The early kings of the Wodeyar dynasty worshipped the Hindu god Shiva. The later kings, starting from the 17th century, took to <a href="Vaishnavism">Vaishnavism</a>, the worship of the Hindu god Vishnu. According to musicologist Meera Rajaram Pranesh, King Raja Wodeyar I was a devotee of the god Vishnu, King Dodda Devaraja was honoured with the title "Protector of Brahmins" ("Deva Brahmana Paripalaka") for his support to <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a>s, and Maharaja Krishnaraja III was devoted to the goddess Chamundeshwari (a form of Hindu goddess <a href="Durga">Durga</a>). Wilks ("History of Mysore", 1800) wrote about a "Jangama" (Veerashaiva saint-devotee of Shiva) uprising, related to excessive taxation, which was put down firmly by Chikka Devaraja. Historian <a href="D.%20R.%20Nagaraj">D.R. Nagaraj</a> claims that four hundred "Jangamas" were murdered in the process but clarifies that Veerashiava literature itself is silent about the issue. Historian <a href="Suryanath%20Kamath">Suryanath Kamath</a> claims King Chikka Devaraja was a Srivaishnava (follower of <a href="Sri%20Vaishnavism">Sri Vaishnavism</a>, a sect of Vaishnavism) but was not anti-Veerashaiva. Historian Aiyangar concurs that some of the kings including the celebrated Narasaraja I and Chikka Devaraja were Vaishnavas, but suggests this may not have been the case with all Wodeyar rulers. The rise of the modern day Mysore city as a centre of <a href="south%20Indian%20culture">south Indian culture</a> has been traced from the period of their sovereignty. Raja Wodeyar I initiated the celebration of the <a href="Mysore%20Dasara">Dasara</a> festival in Mysore, a proud tradition of the erstwhile Vijayanagara royal family.

<a href="Jainism">Jainism</a>, though in decline during the late medieval period, also enjoyed the patronage of the Mysore kings, who made munificent endowments to the <a href="Jain">Jain</a> monastic order at the town of <a href="Shravanabelagola">Shravanabelagola</a>. Records indicate that some Wodeyar kings not only presided over the "<a href="Mahamastakabhisheka">Mahamastakabhisheka</a>" ceremony, an important Jain religious event at Shravanabelagola, but also personally offered prayers ("<a href="Puja%20%28Hinduism%29">puja</a>") during the years 1659, 1677, 1800, 1825, 1910, 1925, 1940, and 1953.

The contact between South India and <a href="Islam">Islam</a> goes back to the 7th century, when trade between Hindu kingdoms and <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> <a href="caliphate">caliphate</a>s thrived. These Muslim traders settled on the <a href="Malabar%20Coast">Malabar Coast</a> and married local Hindu women, and their descendants came to be known as "Mappillas". By the 14th century, Muslims had become a significant minority in the south, though the advent of Portuguese missionaries checked their growth. Haider Ali, though a devout Muslim, did not allow his faith to interfere with the administration of the predominantly Hindu kingdom. Historians are, however, divided on the intentions of Haider Ali's son, Tipu Sultan. It has been claimed that Tipu raised Hindus to prominent positions in his administration, made generous grants to Hindu temples and brahmins, and generally respected other faiths, and that any religious conversions that Tipu undertook were as punishment to those who rebelled against his authority. However, this has been countered by other historians who claim that Tipu Sultan treated the non-Muslims of Mysore far better than those of the Malabar, <a href="Raichur">Raichur</a> and <a href="Coorg">Kodagu</a> regions. They opine that Tipu was responsible for mass conversions of Christians and Hindus in these regions, either by force or by offering them tax incentives and revenue benefits to convert.

Prior to the 18th century, the society of the kingdom followed age-old and deeply established norms of social interaction between people. Accounts by contemporaneous travellers indicate the widespread practice of the <a href="Hindu%20caste%20system">Hindu caste system</a> and of animal sacrifices during the nine-day celebrations (called "Mahanavami"). Later, fundamental changes occurred due to the struggle between native and foreign powers. Though wars between the Hindu kingdoms and the Sultanates continued, the battles between native rulers (including Muslims) and the newly arrived British took centre stage. The spread of English education, the introduction of the printing press and the criticism of the prevailing social system by Christian missionaries helped make the society more open and flexible. The rise of modern nationalism throughout India also affected Mysore.

With the advent of British power, English education gained prominence in addition to traditional education in local languages. These changes were orchestrated by <a href="Lord%20Elphinstone">Lord Elphinstone</a>, the governor of the <a href="Madras%20Presidency">Madras Presidency</a>. His plan became the constitution of the central collegiate institution or University Board in 1841. Accordingly, a high school department of the university was established. For imparting education in the interior regions, schools were raised in principal towns which eventually were elevated to college level, with each college becoming central to many local schools ("zilla" schools). The earliest English-medium schools appeared in 1833 in Mysore and spread across the region. In 1858, the department of education was founded in Mysore and by 1881, there were an estimated 2,087 English-medium schools in the state of Mysore. Higher education became available with the formation of <a href="Bangalore%20Central%20College">Bangalore Central College</a> in <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a> (1870), <a href="Maharaja%27s%20College%2C%20Mysore">Maharaja's College</a> (1879), Maharani's College (1901) and the <a href="Mysore%20University">Mysore University</a> (1916) in Mysore and the <a href="St.%20Agnes%20PU%20College%2C%20Mangalore">St. Agnes College</a> in <a href="Mangalore">Mangalore</a> (1921).

Social reforms aimed at removing practices such as <a href="Sati%20%28practice%29">sati</a> and social discrimination based upon <a href="Dalit">untouchability</a>, as well as demands for the emancipation of the lower classes, swept across India and influenced Mysore territory. In 1894, the kingdom passed laws to abolish the marriage of girls below the age of eight. <a href="Widow%20remarriage">Remarriage of widowed women</a> and marriage of destitute women was encouraged, and in 1923, some women were granted the permission to exercise their <a href="Women%27s%20Indian%20Association">franchise in elections</a>. There were, however, uprisings against British authority in the Mysore territory, notably the <a href="Kodagu">Kodagu</a> uprising in 1835 (after the British dethroned the local ruler Chikkaviraraja) and the <a href="Kanara">Kanara</a> uprising of 1837. The era of printing heralded by Christian missionaries, notably <a href="Hermann%20M%C3%B6gling">Hermann MÃ¶gling</a>, resulted in the founding of printing presses across the kingdom. The publication of ancient and contemporary Kannada books (such as the "<a href="Pampa%20Bharata">Pampa Bharata</a>" and the "<a href="Jaimini%23Jaimini%20Bharata">Jaimini Bharata</a>"), a <a href="Bible%20translations%20into%20Kannada">Kannada-language Bible</a>, a bilingual dictionary and a <a href="Media%20in%20Karnataka%23Newspapers">Kannada newspaper</a> called "Kannada Samachara" began in the early 19th century. <a href="Aluru%20Venkata%20Rao">Aluru Venkata Rao</a> published a consolidated Kannada history glorifying the achievements of <a href="Kannadigas">Kannadigas</a> in his book "<a href="Aluru%20Venkata%20Rao%23Karnataka%20Gatha%20Vaibhava">Karnataka Gatha Vaibhava</a>".

<a href="English%20drama">Classical English</a> and <a href="Sanskrit%20drama">Sanskrit drama</a>, and native <a href="Yakshagana">Yakshagana</a> <a href="musical%20theater">musical theater</a> influenced the Kannada stage and produced famous dramatists like <a href="Gubbi%20Veeranna">Gubbi Veeranna</a>. The public began to enjoy <a href="Carnatic%20music">Carnatic music</a> through its broadcast via public address systems set up on the palace grounds. <a href="Mysore%20painting">Mysore painting</a>s, which were inspired by the <a href="Bengal%20Renaissance">Bengal Renaissance</a>, were created by artists such as Sundarayya, Ala Singarayya, and B. Venkatappa.

The era of the Kingdom of Mysore is considered a golden age in the development of <a href="Kannada%20literature">Kannada literature</a>. Not only was the Mysore court adorned by famous <a href="Brahmin">Brahmin</a> and <a href="Veerashaiva">Veerashaiva</a> writers and composers, the kings themselves were accomplished in the fine arts and made important contributions. While conventional literature in philosophy and religion remained popular, writings in new genres such as chronicle, biography, history, encyclopedia, novel, drama, and musical treatise became popular. A native form of folk literature with dramatic representation called <a href="Yakshagana">Yakshagana</a> gained popularity. A remarkable development of the later period was the influence of <a href="English%20literature">English literature</a> and classical <a href="Sanskrit%20literature">Sanskrit literature</a> on Kannada.

Govinda Vaidya, a native of <a href="Srirangapatna">Srirangapatna</a>, wrote "Kanthirava Narasaraja Vijaya", a eulogy of his patron King Narasaraja I. Written in "sangatya" metre (a composition meant to be rendered to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), the book describes the king's court, popular music and the types of musical compositions of the age in twenty-six chapters. King Chikka Devaraja was the earliest composer of the dynasty. To him is ascribed the famous treatise on music called "Geetha Gopala". Though inspired by Jayadeva's Sanskrit writing "Geetha Govinda", it had an originality of its own and was written in "saptapadi" metre. Contemporary poets who left their mark on the entire Kannada-speaking region include the <a href="brahmin">brahmin</a> poet <a href="Lakshmisa">Lakshmisa</a> and the <a href="nomad">itinerant</a> <a href="Veerashaiva">Veerashaiva</a> poet <a href="Sarvajna">Sarvajna</a>. Female poets also played a role in literary developments, with Cheluvambe (the queen of Krishnaraja Wodeyar I), Helavanakatte Giriyamma, Sri Rangamma (1685) and Sanchi Honnamma ("Hadibadeya Dharma", late 17th century) writing notable works.

A polyglot, King Narasaraja II authored fourteen Yakshaganas in various languages, though all are written in Kannada script. Maharaja Krishnaraja III was a prolific writer in Kannada for which he earned the honorific "Abhinava Bhoja" (a comparison to the medieval King <a href="Bhoja">Bhoja</a>). Over forty writings are attributed to him, of which the musical treatise "<a href="Sritattvanidhi">Sri Tatwanidhi</a>" and a poetical romance called "Saugandika Parinaya" written in two versions, a "sangatya" and a drama, are most well known. Under the patronage of the Maharaja, Kannada literature began its slow and gradual change towards modernity. Kempu Narayana's "Mudramanjusha" ("The Seal Casket", 1823) is the earliest work that has touches of modern prose. However, the turning point came with the historically important "Adbhuta Ramayana" (1895) and "Ramaswamedham" (1898) by Muddanna, whom the Kannada scholar Narasimha Murthy considers "a <a href="Janus">Janus</a> like figure" of modern Kannada literature. Muddanna has deftly handled an ancient epic from an entirely modern viewpoint.

Basavappa Shastry, a native of Mysore and a luminary in the court of Maharaja Krishnaraja III and Maharaja Chamaraja X, is known as the "Father of Kannada theatre" ("Kannada Nataka Pitamaha"). He authored dramas in Kannada and translated <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "Othello" to "Shurasena Charite". His well-known translations from Sanskrit to Kannada are many and include "Kalidasa" and "Abhignyana Shakuntala".

Under Maharaja Krishnaraja III and his successors â Chamaraja X, Krishnaraja IV and the last ruler, Jayachamaraja, the Mysore court came to be the largest and most renowned patron of music. While the Tanjore and Travancore courts also extended great patronage and emphasised preservation of the art, the unique combination of royal patronage of individual musicians, founding of music schools to kindle public interest and a patronage of European music publishers and producers set Mysore apart. Maharaja Krishnaraja III, himself a musician and musicologist of merit, composed a number of "javalis" (light lyrics) and devotional songs in Kannada under the title "Anubhava pancharatna". His compositions bear the <a href="nom%20de%20plume">nom de plume</a> ("<a href="mudra">mudra</a>") "Chamundi'" or '"Chamundeshwari'", in honour of the Wodeyar family deity. His successor Chamaraja X founded the Oriental Library in 1891 to house music books and also commissioned phonograph recordings of several musicians for the palace library.

Under Krishnaraja IV, art received further patronage. A distinct school of music which gave importance to "<a href="raga">raga</a>" and "<a href="bhava">bhava</a>" evolved. The Royal School of Music founded at the palace helped institutionalise teaching of the art. Carnatic compositions were printed and the European staff notation came to be employed by royal musicians. Western music was also encouraged â <a href="Margaret%20Cousins">Margaret Cousins</a>' piano concerto with the Palace Orchestra marked the celebrations of Beethoven's centenary in Bangalore. Maharaja Jayachamaraja, also a renowned composer of Carnatic "<a href="kriti">kriti</a>s" (a musical composition), sponsored a series of recordings of Russian composer Nikolas Medtner and others. The court ensured that Carnatic music also kept up with the times. <a href="Gramophone%20record">Gramophone record</a>ings of the palace band were made and sold commercially. Attention was paid to "technology of the concert". Lavish sums were spent on acquiring various instruments including the unconventional horn violin, <a href="theremin">theremin</a> and <a href="calliaphone">calliaphone</a>, a mechanical music player.

The Mysore court was home to several renowned experts ("<a href="vidwan">vidwan</a>") of the time. <a href="Veene%20Sheshanna">Veena Sheshanna</a>, a court musician during the rule of Maharaja Chamaraja X, is considered one of the greatest exponents of the <a href="veena">veena</a>. His achievements in classical music won Mysore a premier place in the art of instrumental Carnatic music and he was given the honorific "Vainika Shikhamani" by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. <a href="Mysore%20Vasudevachar">Mysore Vasudevachar</a>ya was a noted musician and composer in Sanskrit and Telugu from Mysore. He holds the unique distinction of being patronised by four generations of Mysore kings and rulers and for being court musician to three of them. <a href="Muthiah%20Bhagavatar">H.L. Muthiah Bhagavatar</a> was another musician-composer who adorned the Mysore court. Considered one of the most important composers of the post-<a href="Tyagaraja">Tyagaraja</a> period, he is credited with about 400 compositions in Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil under the pen name "Harikesha". Among <a href="violin">violin</a>ists, <a href="T.%20Chowdiah">T. Chowdiah</a> emerged as one of the most accomplished exponents of the time. He is known to have mastered the seven-stringed violin. Chowdiah was appointed court musician by Maharaja Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV in 1939 and received such titles as "Sangeeta Ratna" and "Sangeeta Kalanidhi". He is credited with compositions in Kannada, Telugu and Sanskrit under the pen name "Trimakuta".

The architectural style of courtly and royal structures in the kingdom underwent profound changes during British rule â a mingling of European traditions with native elements. The Hindu temples in the kingdom were built in typical South Indian <a href="Dravidian%20architecture">Dravidian</a> style â a modest version of the Vijayanagara building idiom. When in power, Tipu Sultan constructed a palace and a mosque in Srirangapatna, his capital. However, it is the city of Mysore that is best known for its royal palaces, earning it the nickname "City of Palaces". The city's main palace, the <a href="Mysore%20Palace">Mysore Palace</a>, is also known as the Amba Vilas Palace. The original complex was destroyed by fire and a new palace was commissioned by the Queen-Regent and designed by the English architect Henry Irwin in 1897. The overall design is a combination of Hindu, Islamic, <a href="Indo-Saracenic">Indo-Saracenic</a> and <a href="Moorish%20architecture">Moorish</a> styles, which for the first time in India, used cast iron columns and roof frames. The striking feature of the exterior is the granite columns that support cusped arches on the portico, a tall tower whose finial is a gilded dome with an umbrella ("chattri") on it, and groups of other domes around it. The interior is richly decorated with marbled walls and a teakwood ceiling on which are sculptures of Hindu deities. The <a href="Durbar%20%28court%29">Durbar</a> hall leads to an inner private hall through silver doors. This opulent room has floor planels that are inlaid with semi-precious stones, and a stained glass roof supported centrally by columns and arches. The marriage hall ("Kalyana mantapa") in the palace complex is noted for its stained glass octagonal dome with peacock motifs.

The <a href="Lalitha%20Mahal">Lalitha Mahal</a> Palace was built in 1921 by E.W. Fritchley under the commission of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. The architectural style is called "Renaissance" and exhibits concepts from English <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a>s and Italian palazzos. The central dome is believed to be modelled on <a href="St.%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St. Paul's Cathedral</a> in London. Other important features are the Italian marble staircase, the polished wooden flooring in the banquet and dance halls, and the Belgian cut glass lamps. The <a href="Jaganmohan%20Palace">Jaganmohan Palace</a> was commissioned in 1861 and was completed in 1910. The three-storeyed building with attractive <a href="dome">dome</a>s, <a href="finial">finial</a>s and <a href="cupola">cupola</a>s was the venue of many a royal celebration. It is now called the Chamarajendra Art Gallery and houses a rich collection of artifacts.

The <a href="Mysore%20University">Mysore University</a> campus, also called "Manasa Gangotri", is home to several architecturally interesting buildings. Some of them are in European style and were completed in the late 19th century. They include the <a href="Jayalakshmi%20Vilas">Jayalakshmi Vilas</a> mansion, the Crawford Hall, the Oriental Research Institute (built between 1887 and 1891) with its Ionic and Corinthian columns, and the district offices ("Athara Kutchery", 1887). The Athara Kutchery, which initially served as the office of the British commissioner, has an octagonal dome and a finial that adds to its beauty. The maharaja's summer palace, built in 1880, is called the Lokaranjan Mahal, and initially served as a school for royalty. The <a href="Rajendra%20Vilas">Rajendra Vilas</a> Palace, built in the Indo-British style atop the <a href="Chamundi%20Hill">Chamundi Hill</a>, was commissioned in 1922 and completed in 1938 by Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. Other royal mansions built by the Mysore rulers were the Chittaranjan Mahal in Mysore and the <a href="Bangalore%20Palace">Bangalore Palace</a> in Bangalore, a structure built on the lines of England's <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>. The Central Food Technical Research Institute (Cheluvamba Mansion), built in <a href="baroque">baroque</a> European renaissance style, was once the residence of princess Cheluvambaamani Avaru, a sister of Maharaja Krishnaraja IV. Its extensive pilaster work and mosaic flooring are noteworthy.

Most famous among the many temples built by the Wodeyars is the Chamundeshwari Temple atop the <a href="Chamundi%20Hill">Chamundi Hill</a>. The earliest structure here was consecrated in the 12th century and was later patronised by the Mysore rulers. Maharaja Krishnaraja III added a Dravidian-style <a href="gopuram">gopuram</a> in 1827. The temple has silver-plated doors with images of deities. Other images include those of the Hindu god <a href="Ganesha">Ganesha</a> and of Maharaja Krishnaraja III with his three queens. Surrounding the main palace in Mysore and inside the fort are <a href="Group%20of%20temples%20at%20the%20Amba%20Vilas%20Palace%2C%20Mysore">a group of temples</a>, built in various periods. The Prasanna Krishnaswamy Temple (1829), the Lakshmiramana Swamy Temple whose earliest structures date to 1499, the Trinesvara Swamy Temple (late 16th century), the Shweta Varaha Swamy Temple built by Purnaiah with a touch of Hoysala style of architecture, the Prasanna Venkataramana Swami Temple (1836) notable for 12 murals of the Wodeyar rulers. Well-known temples outside Mysore city are the <a href="Yali%20%28Hindu%20mythology%29">yali</a> ("mythical beast") pillared <a href="Kote%20Venkataramana%20Temple%2C%20Bangalore">Venkataramana temple</a> built in the late 17th century in the Bangalore fort, and the Ranganatha temple in Srirangapatna.

Tipu Sultan built a wooden colonnaded palace called the <a href="Daria%20Daulat%20Bagh">Dariya Daulat Palace</a> ("lit", "garden of the wealth of the sea") in Srirangapatna in 1784. Built in the Indo-Saracenic style, the palace is known for its intricate woodwork consisting of ornamental arches, striped columns and floral designs, and paintings. The west wall of the palace is covered with murals depicting Tipu Sultan's victory over Colonel Baillie's army at Pollilur, near <a href="Kanchipuram">Kanchipuram</a> in 1780. One mural shows Tipu enjoying the fragrance of a bouquet of flowers while the battle is in progress. In that painting, the French soldiers' <a href="moustache">moustache</a>s distinguish them from the cleanshaven British soldiers. Also in Srirangapatna is the Gumbaz <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a>, built by Tipu Sultan in 1784. It houses the graves of Tipu and Haider Ali. The granite base is capped with a dome built of brick and <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>.

The first iron-cased and metal-<a href="Cylinder%20%28firearms%29">cylinder</a> <a href="rocket%20artillery">rocket artillery</a> were developed by <a href="Tipu%20Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> and his father <a href="Hyder%20Ali">Hyder Ali</a>, in the 1780s. He successfully used these metal-cylinder <a href="rocket">rocket</a>s against the larger forces of the <a href="British%20East%20India%20Company">British East India Company</a> during the <a href="Anglo-Mysore%20Wars">Anglo-Mysore Wars</a>. The <a href="Mysore">Mysore</a> rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the <a href="Fourth%20Anglo-Mysore%20War">Fourth Anglo-Mysore War</a> and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the <a href="Congreve%20rocket">Congreve rocket</a>, which was soon put into use in the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>.

Resident Evil 2

Resident Evil 2 is a <a href="survival%20horror">survival horror</a> game developed and published by <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> and released for the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> in 1998. The player controls <a href="Leon%20S.%20Kennedy">Leon S Kennedy</a> and <a href="Claire%20Redfield">Claire Redfield</a>, who must escape Raccoon City after its citizens are transformed into <a href="Zombie%20%28fictional%29">zombies</a> by a <a href="biological%20weapon">biological weapon</a> two months after the events of the original "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%281996%20video%20game%29">Resident Evil</a>." The gameplay focuses on exploration, puzzles, and combat; the main difference from its predecessor are the branching paths, with each <a href="player%20character">player character</a> having unique storylines and obstacles.

"Resident Evil 2" was directed by <a href="Hideki%20Kamiya">Hideki Kamiya</a>, produced by <a href="Shinji%20Mikami">Shinji Mikami</a>âdirector of the first "Resident Evil"âand developed by a team of around 50 over 21 months. The initial version of the game, commonly referred to as "Resident Evil 1.5", differed drastically and was canceled when it was around two-thirds complete after Mikami decided it was inadequate. The final design introduced a more cinematic presentation.

"Resident Evil 2" received praise for its atmosphere, setting, graphics and audio, and it has appeared on several lists of the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">best games ever made</a>; however, its controls, voice acting, inventory system and puzzles garnered some criticism. It is the best-selling "<a href="Resident%20Evil">Resident Evil</a>" game for a single platform, selling 4.96 million copies on PlayStation. It was <a href="Port%20%28video%20gaming%29">ported</a> to <a href="Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a>, <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> and <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>, and a modified <a href="2.5D">2.5D</a> version was released for the <a href="Game.com">Game.com</a> handheld. The story of "Resident Evil 2" was retold and built upon in several later games, and has been adapted into a variety of licensed works. It was followed by "" in 1999. A <a href="Resident%20Evil%202%20%282019%20video%20game%29">remake of the same name</a> was released for <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="Windows">Windows</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> in 2019.

As a <a href="survival%20horror">survival horror</a> game, "Resident Evil 2" features the same basic gameplay mechanics as its predecessor, "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%281996%20video%20game%29">Resident Evil</a>". The player explores a fictional city while solving puzzles and fighting monsters. The game's two protagonists may be equipped with <a href="firearms">firearms</a>, but limited ammunition adds a tactical element to weapon use. On the status screen, the player can check the condition of the protagonists, use medicine to heal their wounds, and assign weapons. The characters' current health can also be determined by their posture and movement speed. For example, a character will hold their stomach in pain if wounded, and will limp slowly if on the verge of death. The protagonists may carry a limited number of items, and must store others in boxes placed throughout the game world, where they may later be retrieved. Each protagonist is joined by a support partner during the course of the story. These characters accompany the player in certain scenes, and occasionally become playable. Certain rooms contain typewriters that the player may use to <a href="Saved%20game">save</a> the game. However, each save expends one of a limited number of ink ribbons, which the player must collect in the game world. The graphics of "Resident Evil 2" are composed of <a href="Real-time%20computer%20graphics">real-time generated</a>Â â and thus movableÂ â <a href="Polygon%20%28computer%20graphics%29">polygonal</a> character and item <a href="3D%20modeling">models</a>, superimposed over <a href="pre-rendered">pre-rendered</a> backgrounds that are viewed from fixed camera angles. The game uses <a href="tank%20controls">tank controls</a>, meaning that pressing up moves the character in the direction they face, down reverses them, and left and right rotates them, regardless of the perspective of the camera.

The main addition over the preceding game is the "Zapping System", by which each of the two playable characters are confronted with different puzzles and storylines in their respective scenarios. After finishing the "A" scenario with one protagonist, a "B" scenario, in which the events are depicted from the other character's perspective, is unlocked. The player has the option of starting the "A" scenario with either of the two protagonists, resulting in a total of four different scenarios. Actions taken during the first playthrough affect the second. For example, the availability of certain items may be altered. After each game, the player receives a ranking based on the total time taken to complete the scenario, and on the number of saves and special healing items used. Depending on the player's accomplishments, bonus weapons and costumes may be unlocked as a reward. The original version of "Resident Evil 2" contains two stand-alone <a href="minigame">minigame</a>s: "The 4th Survivor" and "The To-fu Survivor". In both of these minigames, the player must reach the goal while fighting every enemy along the way with only the default item loadout. All later versions (except the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> version) add a third minigame, "Extreme Battle", which consists of four playable characters and three stages. 

On September 29, 1998, two months after the events of the first "Resident Evil", most citizens of the <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern American</a> mountain community Raccoon City have been transformed into zombies by the T-virus, a <a href="biological%20weapon">biological weapon</a> secretly developed by the pharmaceutical company <a href="Umbrella%20Corporation">Umbrella</a>. <a href="Leon%20S.%20Kennedy">Leon S. Kennedy</a>, a police officer on his first day of duty, and <a href="Claire%20Redfield">Claire Redfield</a>, a college student looking for her brother <a href="Chris%20Redfield">Chris</a>, make their way to the Raccoon Police Department. They discover that most of the police force have been killed, and that Chris has left town to investigate Umbrella's headquarters in Europe. They split up to look for survivors and find a way out of the city. While searching for an escape route, Claire meets a little girl, Sherry Birkin, who is on the run from an unknown creature, and Leon encounters <a href="Ada%20Wong">Ada Wong</a>, who claims to be looking for her boyfriend John, an Umbrella researcher.

Raccoon City police chief Brian Irons had been bribed by Umbrella to hide evidence of the company's experiments in the outskirts of the city. He also concealed their development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon. Leon has multiple encounters with a <a href="Tyrant%20%28Resident%20Evil%29">Tyrant</a> monster air-dropped into the Raccoon Police Department by Umbrella to seek the G-virus. Irons tries to murder Claire but is killed by a G-virus mutant in the police department. Thereupon, Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and become separated. After splitting up with Leon, Ada comes upon Sherry and picks up a golden pendant the girl loses while running away. Further into the sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after he insists on his duty to protect her. They encounter a middle-aged woman who fires at Ada, but Leon dives between them and takes a bullet himself. Ada ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette and the wife of <a href="William%20Birkin">William Birkin</a>, the Umbrella scientist who created the G-virus. In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus, which turned him into the malformed creature, "G" and is now chasing Sherry. Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant and attempts to take it from Ada. A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a railing. Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and laterÂ â taken over by her emotionsÂ â returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.

Meanwhile, Claire is reunited with Sherry and discovers that "G" has implanted his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and Sherry advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by "G" leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory to find something to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant â which falls into a pit of molten metal â seemingly at the cost of her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within Sherry. After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject Sherry with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow and escapes with the G-virus in the pendant. "G"ânow mutated into an agglomeration of flesh and teethâfollows Leon and Claire, but is destroyed when the train self-destructs. After escaping from the city with Sherry, Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for Chris. <a href="List%20of%20Resident%20Evil%20characters%23HUNK">HUNK</a>, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, completes his G-virus retrieval mission.

Development of "Resident Evil 2" began one month after the completion of its predecessor in early 1996. The first footage of the game was shown at the <a href="V%20Jump">V Jump</a> Festival '96 in July. This early build, later dubbed ""Resident Evil 1.5"" by producer <a href="Shinji%20Mikami">Shinji Mikami</a>, differed drastically from the released version in its scenario, presentation and gameplay mechanics. Its plot followed the same basic outline as that of "Resident Evil 2", and featured a zombie outbreak in Raccoon City two months after the events of the first game. In this version of the story, however, Umbrella had already been closed down as a consequence of their illegal experiments. 

The development team sought to retain the level of fear from the original game, and introduced two characters who lacked experience with terrifying situations: Leon S. Kennedy, largely identical to his persona in the final build, and Elza Walker, a college student and motorcycle racer vacationing in Raccoon City, her hometown. Unlike the final version, the story paths of Leon and Elza did not cross, and each playable character had two support partners instead of just one. Leon received help from fellow police officer Marvin Branagh and a researcher named Linda â an early version of Ada â while Elza was aided by Sherry Birkin and a man named John, who appeared in "Resident Evil 2" as gun shop owner Robert Kendo.

Real-world examples influenced several character designs by artists Isao Ohishi and Ryoji Shimogama. For example, Ohishi based Leon on his <a href="bloodhound">bloodhound</a>, and Annette Birkin was modeled after actress <a href="Jodie%20Foster">Jodie Foster</a>. The police department in which "Resident Evil 1.5" began had a more modern and realistic design, and was smaller than the final building seen in "Resident Evil 2". There were more encounters with surviving policemen, such as a superior officer of Leon called Roy. The number of polygons used for enemy models was far lower than in the released version. This allowed many zombies to appear on the screen, a method of invoking fear in the player that recurred throughout "Resident Evil 1.5". Furthermore, the game employed <a href="dynamic%20music">dynamic music</a>, and frequently applied alterations to the pre-rendered backgrounds in response to events during the gameplay. The playable characters could be equipped with gear, such as protective clothes that enhanced their defense and enabled them to carry more items. The characters' polygonal models were altered by costume changes and by damage received from enemies. 

The development was carried out by a 40- to 50-person group that would later be part of <a href="Capcom%20Production%20Studio%204">Capcom Production Studio 4</a>. Director <a href="Hideki%20Kamiya">Hideki Kamiya</a> led the team, which was composed of newer Capcom employees and over half of the staff from the original "Resident Evil". In the initial stages of development, producer Mikami often had creative disagreements with Kamiya, and tried to influence the team with his own direction. He eventually stepped back to an overseeing role as producer, and only demanded to be shown the current build once a month. Believing the game's assets to be good individually, but not yet satisfactory as a whole, Mikami expected that everything would coalesce in the three months leading up to the projected May 1997 release date. Shortly thereafter, however, "Resident Evil 1.5" was scrapped at a development stage of 60â80 percent. Mikami later explained that the game would not have reached the desired quality in the aforementioned period, and especially frowned upon the gameplay and locations for being "dull and boring".

The story of "Resident Evil 1.5", with which Mikami planned to end the series, was criticized by supervisor <a href="Yoshiki%20Okamoto">Yoshiki Okamoto</a>, who found it to be too conclusive to allow for future installments. Instead, Okamoto proposed the creation of a fictional universe that would turn "Resident Evil" into a <a href="metaseries">metaseries</a>Â â similar to the "<a href="Gundam">Gundam</a>" and "<a href="James%20Bond">James Bond</a>" franchisesÂ â in which self-contained stories with common elements could be told. During a period in which the team made no progress rewriting the scenario, Okamoto was introduced to professional screenwriter <a href="Noboru%20Sugimura">Noboru Sugimura</a>, who was enthusiastic about the first game's story. Sugimura was initially consulted on a trial basis, but Okamoto was impressed by the ease with which the writer came up with solutions to the problems that plagued the script, and soon asked him to compose the entire scenario for "Resident Evil 2". One fundamental modification to the story was the reworking of Elza Walker into Claire Redfield, in order to introduce a connection to the plot of the first game. To fulfill Capcom's sales plan of two million copies, director Kamiya tried to attract new customers with a more ostentatious and <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood-like</a> story presentation. As Okamoto did not want to simply enforce the new direction, he had Sugimura discuss the plot revisions with Mikami and the development staff. The planners redesigned the game from the ground up to fit the changes, and the programmers and other remaining members of the team were sent to work on "<a href="Resident%20Evil%20%281996%20video%20game%29%23Director%27s%20Cut">Resident Evil Director's Cut</a>", which was shipped with a playable preview disc of the new "Resident Evil 2" version in order to promote the sequel and to apologize to the players for its belated release.

Only a few assets from "Resident Evil 1.5" could be recycled, as the principal locations in the final build were made to look more extravagant and artistic, based on photographs taken of the interiors of Western-style buildings in Japanese cities. These environments were created with a software program called O2, and each background took two to three weeks to render. The maximum number of zombies displayed on the screen at one time was limited to seven, making it possible to use 450 polygons for the comparatively detailed models of Leon and Claire. The protagonists, instead of being given visible wounds, were made to limp slowly upon receiving heavy damage. Apart from the graphics, one of the most important new features was the "Zapping System", which was partly inspired by "<a href="Back%20to%20the%20Future%20Part%20II">Back to the Future Part II</a>", a time travel-themed film sequel that offers a different perspective on the story of the <a href="Back%20to%20the%20Future">original film</a>. The voice-overs by the all-Canadian cast of "Resident Evil 2" were recorded before the actual <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s were completed, with each of the actors selected from a roster of ten people per role. Thereafter, the full-motion videos (FMVs) were created by filming <a href="Stop%20motion">stop motion animations</a> of <a href="action%20figures">action figures</a>, which were then rendered to completed pictures with computer graphics (CG) tools. Ada's movie model could not be finished in time. Thus, she is the only main character not to appear in a pre-rendered cutscene.

Several changes had to be made between the regional releases of "Resident Evil 2". The North American version contains more violent "game over" screens, which were removed from the Japanese "Biohazard 2". "Resident Evil 2" was also made more difficult than its Japanese equivalent to prevent rentals from affecting U.S. sales.

The music for "Resident Evil 2" was composed by Masami Ueda, Shusaku Uchiyama and Syun Nishigaki, with one track composed by <a href="Naoshi%20Mizuta">Naoshi Mizuta</a>. The compositions were meant to convey "desperation" as their underlying theme. In his role as lead composer, Ueda provided the <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motifs</a>, while Uchiyama was responsible for the horror-themed music used for the investigation and movie scenes. The main theme of the score, a versatile three-note <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>, appears several times throughout the course of the story, being included in compositions such as "Prologue", "Raccoon City" and "The Third Malformation of G". Various musical styles, ranging from <a href="Ambient%20music">ambient</a> horror music to <a href="Industrial%20music">industrial</a> pieces, are used to represent the different environments of the game. For example, the streets of Raccoon City are emphasized with militaristic percussion-based music, while the police department features ominous piano underscores. Key events of the story are supported with <a href="orchestral">orchestral</a> and cinematic compositionsÂ â a move that was inspired by <a href="Blockbuster%20%28entertainment%29">blockbuster films</a>.

Two albums containing music from the game were released in January and August 1998, respectively. The first, "Biohazard 2 Original Soundtrack", is the main release and includes most of the significant compositions. The second, "Biohazard 2 Complete Track", largely encompasses less prevalent themes, but offers an orchestral medley and a second CD with sound effects and voice collections, as well as an interview with the sound staff. "Biohazard 2 Original Soundtrack" received an identical European CD, "Resident Evil 2 Original Soundtrack". In the North American album of the same name, the opening theme "The Beginning of Story" is split up into four individual tracks. Five orchestral arrangements of the game's music were included on the "Bio Hazard Orchestra Album", a recording of a live concert performed by the <a href="New%20Japan%20Philharmonic">New Japan Philharmonic</a>. Disc jockey Piston Nishizawa created electronic remixes for several of the compositions, which were later released as the album "Biohazard 2 Remix: Metamorphoses".

After its initial release for the <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> in January 1998, "Resident Evil 2" was reissued and <a href="Port%20%28video%20gaming%29">ported</a> to other systems, often gaining new features in the process. The first re-release was the "Dual Shock Ver.", which incorporated support for the vibration and analog control functions of the PlayStation's <a href="DualShock">DualShock</a> controller. Other additions include a new unlockable minigame called "Extreme Battle", and a "Rookie" mode that enables the player to start the main story with a powerful weapon that features infinite ammunition. The Japanese release of the "Dual Shock Ver." contained a "U.S.A. Version" mode based on the difficulty level of "Resident Evil 2"'s Western versions.

The "Dual Shock Ver." served as the basis for the majority of ports, such as the <a href="Windows%209x">Windows 9x</a>-based PC-CD version "Resident Evil 2 Platinum". Aside from retaining all previously added features, the PC version can be run in higher <a href="Display%20resolution">resolutions</a>. A "Data Gallery" was added to the main menu, allowing the player to view movies, rough sketches, illustrations and 3D models. In February 2006, a Japan-exclusive, <a href="Windows%20XP">Windows XP</a>-compatible PC-DVD re-release was published. Developed by Sourcenext, it included high-quality FMVs encoded at a resolution of 640Ã480 pixels. The <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> version keeps the additions from the original PC release, and incorporates real-time display of the character's condition on the <a href="Visual%20Memory%20Unit">Visual Memory Unit</a> peripheral. The Japanese edition of the Dreamcast port was given the subtitle "Value Plus" and came with a playable demo of "". An unmodified port of the "Dual Shock Ver." was released for the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a>. The initial PlayStation version was re-released on the Japanese <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> in 2007, while the service's North American counterpart received the "Dual Shock Ver." two years later.

The <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> version of "Resident Evil 2" differs most from the other releases as its one of the very few games released for the console to have FMVs, overcoming the limited storage space on the cartridge. The PlayStation version with two CD-ROMs of up to per disc, was faithfully replicated (with unique enhancements) on a <a href="Nintendo%2064%20Game%20Pak">Nintendo 64 Game Pak</a>. Audio and video assets had to be more aggressively and creatively compressed, using novel techniques that shift the burden more toward the console's high real-time processing power. Over the course of twelve months and with a budget of $1Â million, "Resident Evil 2" was ported to the console by a team led by nine full-time and one part-time personnel from <a href="Angel%20Studios">Angel Studios</a>. Further help was provided by ten staff from Capcom Production Studio 3 and <a href="Factor%205">Factor 5</a>. This version offers features that were not included on any other system, such as alternate costumes, the ability to adjust the degree of violence and to change the blood color, a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough, and a more responsive first-person control scheme. Additionally, the port features 16 new in-game documents known as the "Ex Files", written by Tetsuro Oyama. Hidden throughout the four scenarios, they reveal new information about the series' lore and connect the story of "Resident Evil 2" to those of the other installments, including some that hadn't even been released yet at the time. The Nintendo 64 version adjusts its display resolution depending on the number of polygonal models currently on screen, and supports the console's <a href="Expansion%20Pak">Expansion Pak</a> accessory for a maximum resolution of 640Ã480 during gameplay. Other visual enhancements include smoother character animations and sharper, perspective-corrected textures for the 3D models. The Nintendo 64 version is the only one to use surround sound, with the soundtrack converted to <a href="Dolby%20Surround">Dolby Surround</a> by <a href="Chris%20H%C3%BClsbeck">Chris HÃ¼lsbeck</a>, Rudolf Stember and Thomas Engel. The team reworked the <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">sound set</a> from the ground up to provide each instrument with a higher <a href="sample%20rate">sample rate</a> than on the PlayStation, thus resulting in higher-quality music. Some features from the other enhanced ports based on the "Dual Shock Ver." do not appear in the Nintendo 64 version, such as the "Extreme Battle" minigame. In 2018, Eurogamer called this "one of the most ambitious [and impressive] console ports of all time".

A port of "Resident Evil 2" for the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> was developed internally at Capcom for a time, but technical difficulties led to its cancellation in October 1998. <a href="Tiger%20Electronics">Tiger Electronics</a> released a <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprite</a>-based <a href="2.5D">2.5D</a> version for their <a href="Game.com">Game.com</a> handheld in late 1998. It included only Leon's story path, and removed several of the original game's core features. In February 2013, an unfinished <a href="Software%20build">build</a> of "Resident Evil 1.5" was <a href="Internet%20leak">leaked onto the Internet</a>. In Italy, "Resident Evil 2" was temporarily banned in 1999 following criticism from the political organization "Movimento Diritti Civili" (Civil Rights Movement) for its realistic depiction of violence, with the law enforcement agency <a href="Guardia%20di%20Finanza">Guardia di Finanza</a> seizing over 5,500 unsold copies. After <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> asked for a re-examination of the seizure decree, the ban was lifted a few months later.

"Resident Evil 2" received critical acclaim. Its original PlayStation release holds an average score of 89 out of 100 points at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. The majority of reviews praised "Resident Evil 2" for its atmosphere, setting, graphics and audio, but criticized its controls, voice acting and certain gameplay elements.

<a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Ricardo Sanchez thought that the game's atmosphere was "dead on", and claimed that "[the] graphics, sound effects, music and level design all work together to create a spooky, horror-filled world". Ryan Mac Donald of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> shared the opinion, and found the game to be "like a product out of Hollywood". He believed that it was "more an interactive, cinematic experience than a video game". Writing for "<a href="Computer%20and%20Video%20Games">Computer and Video Games</a>", Paul Mallinson considered the game's atmosphere, story and film-like presentation its most outstanding features. Although he found its plot to be "far-fetched", he believed it was "kept down to earth by clever scripting and gritty storytelling". "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" staff writer Mike Weigand called the narrative "engrossing and dramatic", and the dialogue "well-written" and "spell-binding". Sanchez, <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Brian Davis and <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Martin Taylor praised the "Zapping System" for adding to the story and increasing the <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a>. Mac Donald thought that the idea of actions in the first scenario affecting the second was "cool in concept", but underused in the game.

"Resident Evil 2" was also praised for its graphics, which many critics believed were a substantial improvement upon those of the first installment. Sanchez and Weigand thought that the pre-rendered backgrounds were an impressive leap ahead of those in the original "Resident Evil", thanks to their increased detail and interactivity. Mac Donald praised the model animations for having reached "true realism", and commended the game's use of body language as a means of seamlessly communicating the condition of the protagonists' health. <a href="Allgame">Allgame</a>'s Shawn Sackenheim awarded its graphics the highest possible score, as he found the backgrounds to be "rendered to perfection", the cutscenes "a work of art" and the animation "fluid and eerie". The audio was well received by critics. Weigand cited it as an "excellent accompaniment to the visuals". Sanchez went as far as to say that "Resident Evil 2" "may have the best sound design yet for a console game". Sackenheim described the music and sound effects as "spot on perfect", and called the soundtrack "perfectly composed", while Mac Donald likened the game's use of audio to that of classic horror films.

A common point of criticism was the inventory system, which Sanchez called "a pain". He frowned upon the player's need to retrieve objects from item boxes, and Mac Donald criticized the system for being unrealistic, as the boxes are "[magically]" interconnected and all items take the same amount of space when being carried, regardless of their size. Furthermore, Mallinson and Mac Donald disapproved of certain puzzles, which they believed were out of place in a police station setting. Sanchez thought that the puzzles were paced better than in the first game, but also found them less interesting and too easy for experienced players. Sackenheim noted the game's brevity in his review, and remarked that the individual scenarios are not different enough to hold the interest of casual players until the end of the game. He found the controls to be "easy to pick up and play", while Sanchez thought that aiming weapons was difficult. Certain reviewers panned the voice acting, calling it "cheesy", "terrible" and "barbaric".

With the exception of the game's critically acclaimed Nintendo 64 port, most later releases of "Resident Evil 2" have received slightly lower scores than the PlayStation version. Weigand advised players who already owned "Resident Evil 2" to rent the "Dual Shock Ver." for the "Extreme Battle" minigame, and recommended that newcomers buy the updated edition instead of the original release. The Windows port was praised for its additional content, but criticized for not allowing the player to save at will, and for lacking updated backgrounds to fit the higher in-game resolution. Eurogamer said the PC's total elimination of CD-ROM load times make the game "extremely fun and simple". The Nintendo 64 version was widely commended for the technical achievement of fitting a two-disc game on a single cartridge. However, Taylor criticized this version for retaining scenes from the PlayStation version that were used to conceal loading timesÂ â a technical disadvantage of optical discs that cartridges do not share. A "GamePro" writer under the pseudonym "The Freshman" was impressed with the enhanced graphics of the Nintendo 64 port, but was disappointed by its heavily compressed CG FMVs. GameSpot's Joe Fielder found the compression to be forgivable given the cartridge format, and noted that the new exclusive features made up for the lack of the "Extreme Battle" mode. Eurogamer said the Nintendo 64's unique analog control "works supremely well to the point where it's borderline game-breaking". IGN reviewer Matt Casamassina applauded the implementation of Dolby Surround support, and called the Nintendo 64 release the "best version of the game". In 2018, Eurogamer called it "one of the most ambitious [and impressive] console ports of all time".

The clearer sound effects of the Dreamcast port were received well by <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a>'s Shawn Sparks, who also remarked that the character models look slightly sharper. However, Steve Key of "Computer And Video Games" disliked the Dreamcast release's low-resolution backgrounds, which he thought made the characters stand out too much from the environments, and thus lessened the game's atmosphere. GameSpot staff writer James Mielke did not believe that the Dreamcast port was "an essential purchase", but still called it a "great game" at an attractively low price. The GameCube release was heavily criticized for its high price and dated graphics. However, "Four-Eyed Dragon" of "GamePro" noted its superior in-game visuals of any version of the game. Davis and <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>'s Mark MacDonald were disappointed by the port's lack of features that were included in the Nintendo 64 release. <a href="Peer%20Schneider">Peer Schneider</a> of IGN found the 2.5D version for the Game.com to be frustrating and only "partially faithful" to the original release of "Resident Evil 2". Although he believed that its graphics and sound effects managed to recreate the original game's atmosphere to a certain extent, he thought that its controls were too "sluggish" to allow for an enjoyable experience.

"Resident Evil 2" has been held in high regard in the years following its initial release, and was named the fourth best game on the PlayStation by "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>". "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>", IGN, "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>", "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" and "<a href="Official%20UK%20PlayStation%20Magazine">Official UK PlayStation Magazine</a>" included it in their lists of the 100 best games of all time; it came in 62nd, 58th, 49th, 34th and sixth place, respectively. Readers of "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>" voted "Resident Evil 2" the 97th top retro game, with the staff noting that it was "considered by many to be the best in the long-running series". <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> ranked it fourth on a list of the games that most needed <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remakes</a>.

"Resident Evil 2" was promoted with a US$5 million advertising campaign. In Italy, the game reached 100,000 <a href="pre-order">pre-order</a>s, worth over 12 billion <a href="Italian%20lira">lire</a> (about more than 6.6 million <a href="United%20States%20dollar">dollars</a>). It became the fastest-selling video game in North America. On the weekend following its release, it sold 380,000 copies and grossed US$19 million. It therefore surpassed the revenue of all but one <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood movie</a> at that time and broke previous sales records set by the video games "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>" and "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>". At the 1999 Milia festival in <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a>, it took home a "Gold" prize for revenues above â¬29 million in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> during the previous year. With 4.96Â million copies sold, the PlayStation version of "Resident Evil 2" was a commercial success, and is the franchise's best-selling game on a single platform. 810,000 copies of the "Dual Shock Ver." were shipped by March 1999.

"Resident Evil 2" was the basis for several <a href="Intellectual%20property%20license">licensed</a> works and later games. Ted Adams and <a href="Kris%20Oprisko">Kris Oprisko</a> loosely adapted it into the comics "Raccoon CityÂ â R.I.P." and "A New Chapter of Evil", which were released in the first and second issues of "Resident Evil: The Official Comic Book Magazine" in March and June 1998. The 60-issue <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> comics "Biohazard 2" was published weekly from February 1998 to April 1999. A romantic comedy retelling of the game's story, centered on Leon, Claire and Ada, was released as the <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>ese two-issue comic "ÃlÃ­ng GÇbÇo II" (lit. "Demon Castle II"). "Resident Evil: City of the Dead", a 1999 book written by author <a href="S.%20D.%20Perry">S. D. Perry</a>, is a more direct adaptation of the narrative, and is the third release in her series of "Resident Evil" novelizations, published by <a href="Pocket%20Books">Pocket Books</a> in 1999.

The <a href="mobile%20game">mobile game</a> "Resident Evil: Uprising" contains a condensed version of the "Resident Evil 2" story, adapted by Megan Swaine. "", an <a href="on-rails%20shooter">on-rails shooter</a> released for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> in 2009, includes a scenario named "Memories of a Lost City", which <a href="reimagine">reimagine</a>s the original "Resident Evil 2" plot while retaining key scenes from the game's four scenarios. In 2008, "<a href="Resident%20Evil%205">Resident Evil 5</a>" producer <a href="Jun%20Takeuchi">Jun Takeuchi</a>, who had previously worked on the series as weapons designer and graphics animator, alluded to the possibility of a full-fledged <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remake</a>. Such a project had already been considered for the GameCube in 2002, but Mikami abandoned the idea as he did not want to delay the in-development "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>".

The <a href="story%20arcs">story arcs</a> introduced in "Resident Evil 2" continue in drama albums and later game releases. Kyoko Sagiyama, Junichi Miyashita, Yasuyuki Suzuki, Noboru Sugimura, Hirohisa Soda and Kishiko MiyagiÂ â screenwriters employed by Capcom's former scenario subsidiary <a href="Flagship%20%28company%29">Flagship</a>Â â created two <a href="radio%20dramas">radio dramas</a>, "Chiisana TÅbÅsha Sherry" (lit. "The Little Runaway Sherry") and "Ikiteita Onna Spy Ada" ("The Female Spy Ada Lives"). The dramas were broadcast on <a href="Radio%20Osaka">Radio Osaka</a> in early 1999, and later released by publisher <a href="Suleputer">Suleputer</a> as two separate CDs, "Biohazard 2 Drama Album". "Chiisana TÅbÅsha Sherry" begins shortly after the events of the game. Sherry is separated from Claire while fleeing from Umbrella soldiers sent to kill all witnesses of the viral outbreak. Raccoon City is burned down by the <a href="U.S.%20Government">U.S. Government</a> and Umbrella in an attempt to cover up the disaster. Sherry seeks refuge in the neighboring town of Stone Ville, and later escapes to Canada with the help of a girl named Meg, who vows to help her reunite with Claire.

"Ikiteita Onna Spy Ada" is set a few days after "Resident Evil 2", and deals with Ada's mission to retrieve Sherry's pendant with the G-virus sample, which is said to be in the possession of Hunk in the backstory of the drama album. Ada intercepts the delivery of the locket in France, and kills Hunk and his men. As a consequence of an accidental T-virus leak in Loire Village, the destination of the delivery, Ada is forced to retreat to an old castle. Along with a unit of the <a href="French%20Air%20Force">French Air Force</a> sent to burn down the village, she encounters Christine Henry, the Umbrella facility director who gave Hunk the order to deliver the G-virus to France. Jacob, the leader of the airborne unit, is revealed to be Christine's co-conspirator. However, he plans to keep the G-virus sample for himself, and shoots her. Philippe, another member of the unit, convinces Ada to give him the pendant, after which he injects himself with the G-virus to give himself the power to stop Jacob. Ada escapes and realizes her feelings for Leon, deciding to quit the spy business and return to him. The characters' story arcs are continued differently: Sherry is taken into custody by the U.S. Government immediately after the events of "Resident Evil 2", and Ada keeps the pendant with the G-virus and resumes her activities as a spy. Hunk successfully delivers a separate G-virus sample to Umbrella.

In August 2015, Capcom announced that a <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remake</a> of "Resident Evil 2" was in development. Capcom unveiled the game at <a href="E3%202018">E3 2018</a>, with trailers and gameplay footage, and announced a worldwide release date of January 25, 2019 for <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> and <a href="Windows">Windows</a>. The game uses the RE Engine, which was also used for "", and replaces the <a href="tank%20controls">tank controls</a> and fixed camera angles with "over-the-shoulder" gameplay similar to "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>".

Hartebeest

The hartebeest (; "Alcelaphus buselaphus"), also known as kongoni, is an <a href="Africa">Africa</a>n <a href="antelope">antelope</a>. Eight <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of . The weight ranges from . It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of . Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes.

Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> at one to two years of age. <a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

Inhabiting dry <a href="savanna">savanna</a>s and wooded grasslands, hartebeest often move to more arid places after rainfall. They have been reported from altitudes on <a href="Mount%20Kenya">Mount Kenya</a> up to . The hartebeest was formerly widespread in Africa, but populations have undergone drastic decline due to habitat destruction, hunting, human settlement, and competition with livestock for food. Each of the eight subspecies of the hartebeest has a different conservation status. The <a href="Bubal%20hartebeest">Bubal hartebeest</a> was declared <a href="Extinction">extinct</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) in 1994. While the populations of the red hartebeest are on the rise, those of the Tora hartebeest, already <a href="Critically%20Endangered">Critically Endangered</a>, are falling. The hartebeest is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Lesotho, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, and Tunisia; but has been <a href="introduced%20species">introduced</a> into <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a> and <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>. It is a popular <a href="game%20animal">game animal</a> due to its highly regarded meat.

The vernacular name "hartebeest" could have originated from the obsolete <a href="Afrikaans">Afrikaans</a> word "hertebeest", literally "deer beast". The name was given by the <a href="Boer">Boer</a>s, based on the resemblance of the antelope to <a href="deer">deer</a>. The first use of the word "hartebeest" in South African literature was in Dutch colonial administrator <a href="Jan%20van%20Riebeeck">Jan van Riebeeck</a>'s journal "Daghregister" in 1660. He wrote: ""Meester Pieter ein hart-beest geschooten hadde" (Master Pieter [van Meerhoff] had shot one hartebeest)". Another name for the hartebeest is "kongoni", a <a href="Swahili%20language">Swahili</a> word. "Kongoni" is often used to refer in particular to one of its <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>â<a href="Coke%27s%20hartebeest">Coke's hartebeest</a>.

The <a href="scientific%20name">scientific name</a> of the hartebeest is "Alcelaphus buselaphus". First <a href="species%20description">described</a> by German zoologist <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a> in 1766, it is classified in the genus "<a href="Alcelaphus">Alcelaphus</a>" and placed in the family <a href="Bovidae">Bovidae</a>. In 1979, palaeontologist <a href="Elisabeth%20Vrba">Elisabeth Vrba</a> supported "<a href="Sigmoceros">Sigmoceros</a>" as a separate genus for <a href="Lichtenstein%27s%20hartebeest">Lichtenstein's hartebeest</a>, a kind of hartebeest, as she assumed it was related to "<a href="Connochaetes">Connochaetes</a>" (wildebeest). She had analysed the skull characters of living and extinct species of antelope to make a cladogram, and argued that a wide skull linked Lichtenstein's hartebeest with "Connochaetes". However, this finding was not replicated by Alan W. Gentry of the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a>, who classified it as an independent species of "Alcelaphus". Zoologists such as <a href="Jonathan%20Kingdon">Jonathan Kingdon</a> and <a href="Theodor%20Haltenorth">Theodor Haltenorth</a> considered it to be a subspecies of "A. buselaphus". Vrba dissolved the new genus in 1997 after reconsideration. An <a href="MtDNA">MtDNA</a> analysis could find no evidence to support a separate genus for Lichtenstein's hartebeest. It also showed the tribe <a href="Alcelaphini">Alcelaphini</a> to be <a href="monophyletic">monophyletic</a>, and discovered close affinity between the "Alcelaphus" and the sassabies (genus "<a href="Damaliscus">Damaliscus</a>")âboth genetically and morphologically.
Eight subspecies are identified, of which two â "A. b. caama" and "A. b. lichtensteinii" â have been considered to be independent species. However, a 1999 genetic study by P. Arctander of the <a href="University%20of%20Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a> and colleagues, which sampled the <a href="mtDNA%20control%20region">control region</a> of the <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>, found that these two formed a clade within "A. buselaphus", and that recognising these as species would render "A. buselaphus" <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a> (an unnatural grouping). The same study found "A. b. major" to be the most divergent, having branched off before the lineage split to give a combined "caama/lichtensteinii" lineage and another that gave rise to the remaining <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> subspecies. Conversely a 2001 <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetic</a> study, based on <a href="D-loop">Dâloop</a> and <a href="cytochrome%20b">cytochrome b</a> analysis by Ãystein Flagstad (of the Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>) and colleagues, found that the southern lineage of "A. b. caama" and "A. lichtensteinii" diverged earliest. Analysis of skull structure supports partition into three major divisions: "A. b. buselaphus" division (<a href="Nominate%20%28taxonomy%29">nominate</a>, also including "A. b. major" division), "A. b. tora" division (also including "A. b. cokii" and "A. b. swaynei") and "A. b. lelwel" division. Another analysis of cytochrome b and D-loop sequence data shows a notable <a href="Affinity%20%28taxonomy%29">affinity</a> between the "A. b. lelwel" and "A. b. tora " divisions.

The eight subspecies, including the two controversial ones, are:


In 2000, a study scrutinised two major populations of the Swayne's hartebeest, from the <a href="Senkele%20Wildlife%20Sanctuary">Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary</a> and the <a href="Nechisar%20National%20Park">Nechisar National Park</a>, for mitochondrial (D-loop) and nuclear (<a href="microsatellite">microsatellite</a>) variability in an attempt to estimate the levels of <a href="genetic%20variation">genetic variation</a> between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a> than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the <a href="Translocation%20%28wildlife%20conservation%29">translocation</a> of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found to have a high degree of genetic variation. The study advocated <a href="in%20situ%20conservation">in situ conservation</a> of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.

The <a href="diploid">diploid</a> number of chromosomes in the hartebeest is 40. Hybrids are usually reported from areas where ranges of two subspecies overlap. Hybrids between the Lelwel and Tora hartebeest have been reported in eastern Sudan and western Ethiopia, in a stretch southward from the <a href="Blue%20Nile">Blue Nile</a> to about 9Â° N latitude. A study proved a male hybrid of the red hartebeest and the <a href="blesbok">blesbok</a> ("Damaliscus pygargus") to be <a href="Sterility%20%28physiology%29">sterile</a>. Sterility of the hybrid was attributed to difficulties in <a href="Mendel%27s%20laws">segregation</a> during <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a>, indicated by <a href="azoospermia">azoospermia</a> and a low number of <a href="germ%20cell">germ cell</a>s in its <a href="seminiferous%20tubule">seminiferous tubule</a>s.

There are three common cross-breeds between the subspecies:


The genus "Alcelaphus" emerged about 4.4 million years ago in a <a href="clade">clade</a> whose other members were "<a href="Damalops">Damalops</a>", "<a href="Numidocapra">Numidocapra</a>", "<a href="Rabaticeras">Rabaticeras</a>", "<a href="Megalotragus">Megalotragus</a>", "<a href="Oreonagor">Oreonagor</a>", and "Connochaetes". An analysis using <a href="Phylogeography">phylogeographic</a> patterns within hartebeest populations suggested a possible origin of "Alcelaphus" in eastern Africa. "Alcelaphus" quickly <a href="evolutionary%20radiation">radiated</a> across the African savannas, replacing several previous forms (such as a relative of the <a href="hirola">hirola</a>). Flagstad and colleagues showed an early split in the hartebeest populations into two distinct lineages around 0.5 million years ago â one to the north and the other to the south of the equator. The northern lineage further diverged into eastern and western lineages, nearly 0.4 million years ago, most probably as a result of the expanding <a href="African%20rainforest">central African rainforest</a> belt and subsequent contraction of <a href="savannah">savannah</a> habitats during a period of global warming. The eastern lineage gave rise to the Coke's, Swayne's, Tora and Lelwel hartebeest; and from the western lineage evolved the Bubal and western hartebeest. The southern lineage gave rise to Lichtenstein's and red hartebeest. These two taxa are phylogenetically close, having diverged only 0.2 million years ago. The study concluded that these major events throughout the hartebeest's evolution are strongly related to climatic factors, and that there had been successive bursts of radiation from a more permanent populationâa <a href="Refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugium</a>âin eastern Africa; this could be vital to understanding the evolutionary history of not only the hartebeest but also other mammals of the African savanna.

The earliest fossil record dates back to nearly 0.7 million years ago. Fossils of the <a href="red%20hartebeest">red hartebeest</a> have been found in Elandsfontein, <a href="Cornelia%2C%20Free%20State">Cornelia (Free State)</a> and <a href="Florisbad%20archaeological%20and%20paleontological%20site">Florisbad</a> in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, as well as in <a href="Kabwe">Kabwe</a> in <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a>. In <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, hartebeest remains have been found in northern <a href="Negev">Negev</a>, <a href="Shephelah">Shephelah</a>, <a href="Sharon%20Plain">Sharon Plain</a> and <a href="Tel%20Lachish">Tel Lachish</a>. This population of the hartebeest was originally limited to the open country of the southernmost regions of the southern <a href="Levant">Levant</a>. It was probably hunted in Egypt, which affected the numbers in the Levant, and disconnected it from its main population in Africa.

A large antelope with a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, the hartebeest stands just over at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of . The weight ranges from . The tail, long, ends in a black tuft. The other distinctive features of the hartebeest are its long legs (often with black markings), short neck, and pointed ears. A study correlated the size of hartebeest species to <a href="primary%20production">habitat productivity</a> and rainfall. The western hartebeest is the largest subspecies, and has a characteristic white line between the eyes. The red hartebeest is also large, with a black forehead and a contrasting light band between the eyes. The large Lelwel hartebeest has dark stripes on the front of its legs. Coke's hartebeest is moderately large, with a shorter forehead and longer tail in comparison to the other subspecies. Lichtenstein's hartebeest is smaller, with dark stripes on the front of the legs, as in the Lelwel hartebeest. The Swayne's hartebeest is smaller than the Tora hartebeest, but both have a shorter forehead and similar appearance.

Generally short and shiny, the coat varies in colour according to subspecies. The western hartebeest is a pale sandy-brown, but the front of the legs are darker. The red hartebeest is a reddish-brown, with a dark face. Black markings can be observed on the chin, the back of the neck, shoulders, hips and legs; these are in sharp contrast with the broad white patches that mark its flanks and lower rump. The Lelwel hartebeest is a reddish tan. Coke's hartebeest is reddish to tawny in the upper parts, but has relatively lighter legs and rump. Lichtenstein's hartebeest is reddish brown, though the flanks are a lighter tan and the rump whitish. The Tora hartebeest is a dark reddish brown in the upper part of the body, the face, the forelegs and the rump, but the hindlegs and the underbelly are a yellowish white. The Swayne's hartebeest is a rich chocolate brown with fine spots of white that are actually the white tips of its hairs. Its face is black save for the chocolate band below the eyes. The shoulders and upper part of the legs are black. Fine textured, the body hair of the hartebeest is about long. The hartebeest has <a href="preorbital%20gland">preorbital gland</a>s (glands near the eyes) with a central duct, that secrete a dark sticky fluid in Coke's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and a colourless fluid in the Lelwel hartebeest.

Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of ; the maximum horn length is , recorded from a Namibian red hartebeest. The horns of the western hartebeest are thick and appear U-shaped from the front and Z-shaped from the sides, growing backward at first and then forward, ending with a sharp backward turn. The horns of the red and the Lelwel hartebeest are similar to those of the western hartebeest, but appear V-shaped when viewed from the front. The Lichtenstein's hartebeest has thick parallel ringed horns, with a flat base. Its horns are shorter than those of other subspecies, curving upward then sharply forward, followed by an inward turn at an angle of about 45Â° and a final backward turn. The horns of Swayne's hartebeest are thin and shaped like parentheses, curving upward and then backward. The horns of the Tora hartebeest are particularly thin and spread out sideways, diverging more than in any other subspecies.

Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus "Damaliscus"), such as an elongated and narrow face, the shape of the horns, the <a href="coat%20%28animal%29">pelage</a> texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The <a href="wildebeest">wildebeest</a> have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual dimorphism varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest dimorphism was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of dimorphism in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.

Active mainly during daytime, the hartebeest grazes in the early morning and late afternoon, and rests in shade around noon. <a href="Gregarious">Gregarious</a>, the species forms herds of up to 300 individuals. Larger numbers gather in places with abundant grass. In 1963, a congregation of 10,000 animals was recorded on the plains near Sekoma Pan in Botswana. However, moving herds are not so cohesive, and tend to disperse frequently. The members of a herd can be divided into four groups: territorial adult males, non-territorial adult males, young males, and the females with their young. The females form groups of five to 12 animals, with four generations of young in the group. Females fight for dominance over the herd. Sparring between males and females is common. At three or four years of age, the males can attempt to take over a <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a> and its female members. A resident male defends his territory and will fight if provoked. The male marks the border of his territory through defecation. 

Hartebeest are remarkably alert and cautious animals with highly developed <a href="brain">brain</a>s. Generally calm in nature, hartebeest can be ferocious when provoked. While feeding, one individual stays on the lookout for danger, often standing on a <a href="termite">termite</a> mound to see farther. At times of danger, the whole herd flees in a single file after an individual suddenly starts off. Adult hartebeest are preyed upon by lions, <a href="leopard">leopard</a>s, <a href="hyena">hyena</a>s and <a href="Lycaon%20pictus">wild dogs</a>; <a href="cheetah">cheetah</a>s and <a href="jackal">jackal</a>s target <a href="juvenile%20%28organism%29">juveniles</a>. Crocodiles may also prey on hartebeest.

The thin long legs of the hartebeest provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used to ward off the predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominance</a> in the breeding season; the clash of the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.

Like the sassabies, hartebeest produce quiet quacking and grunting sounds. Juveniles tend to be more vocal than adults, and produce a quacking call when alarmed or pursued. The hartebeest uses defecation as an <a href="olfactory">olfactory</a> and visual display. Herds are generally sedentary, and tend to migrate only under adverse conditions such as natural calamities. The hartebeest is the least migratory in the <a href="Tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> Alcelaphini (which also includes wildebeest and sassabies), and also consumes the least amount of water and has the lowest <a href="metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a> among the members of the tribe.

Several <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s have been isolated from the hartebeest. These parasites regularly alternate between hartebeest and gazelles or wildebeest. Hartebeest can be infected with <a href="East%20coast%20fever">theileriosis</a> due to "<a href="Rhipicephalus%20evertsi">Rhipicephalus evertsi</a>" and "<a href="Theileria">Theileria</a>" species. South of the <a href="Sahara">Sahara</a>, common parasites include "<a href="Loewioestrus%20variolosus">Loewioestrus variolosus</a>", "<a href="Gedoelstia%20cristata">Gedoelstia cristata</a>" and "<a href="Gedoelstia%20hassleri">G. hassleri</a>". The latter two species can cause serious diseases such as <a href="encephalitis">encephalitis</a>. However, parasites are not always harmful â 252 <a href="Larva%20%28zoology%29">larvae</a> were found in the head of one Zambian individual without any <a href="pathogenicity">pathogenicity</a>. <a href="Nematode">Nematode</a>s, <a href="cestode">cestode</a>s, <a href="Paramphistomum">paramphistome</a>s; and the <a href="roundworm">roundworm</a> "<a href="Setaria%20labiatopapillosa">Setaria labiatopapillosa</a>" have also been isolated from the hartebeest. In 1931, a red hartebeest in <a href="Gobabis">Gobabis</a> (southwestern Africa) was infected with long, thin worms. These were named "<a href="Longistrongylus%20meyeri">Longistrongylus meyeri</a>" after their collector, T. Meyer.
Hartebeest are primarily grazers, and their diets consist mostly of grasses. A study in the <a href="Nazinga%20Game%20Ranch">Nazinga Game Ranch</a> in <a href="Burkina%20Faso">Burkina Faso</a> found that the hartebeest's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods. The hartebeest has much lower food intake than the other members of Alcelaphini. The long thin <a href="Muzzle%20%28animal%29">muzzle</a> of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems. In addition to this, it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses. These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season, which is usually a difficult period for grazers. For instance, in comparison with the <a href="roan%20antelope">roan antelope</a>, the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of <a href="perennial%20grass">perennial grass</a>es at times when forage is least available. These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago, leading to its successful radiation in Africa.

Grasses generally comprise at least 80 percent of the hartebeest's diet, but they account for over 95 percent of their food in the wet season, October to May. "<a href="Jasminum%20kerstingii">Jasminum kerstingii</a>" is part of the hartebeest's diet at the start of the rainy season. Between seasons, they mainly feed on the <a href="Culm%20%28botany%29">culm</a>s of grasses. A study found that the hartebeest is able to digest a higher proportion of food than the topi and the wildebeest. In areas with scarce water, it can survive on melons, roots, and tubers.

In a study of grass selectivity among the wildebeest, zebra, and the Coke's hartebeest, the hartebeest showed the highest selectivity. All animals preferred "<a href="Themeda%20triandra">Themeda triandra</a>" over "<a href="Pennisetum%20mezianum">Pennisetum mezianum</a>" and "<a href="Digitaria%20macroblephara">Digitaria macroblephara</a>". More grass species were eaten in the dry season than in the wet season.

Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year, with one or two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female's genitalia, and follows her if she is in <a href="Estrous%20cycle">oestrus</a>. Sometimes a female in oestrus holds out her tail slightly to signal her receptivity, and the male tries to block the female's way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more in a minute. Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.

<a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf weighing about is born. Births usually peak in the dry season, and take place in thickets â unlike the wildebeest, which give birth in groups on the plains. Though calves can move about on their own shortly after birth, they usually lie in the open in close proximity of their mothers. The calf is weaned at four months, but young males stay with their mothers for two and a half years, longer than in other Alcelaphini. Often the mortality rate of male juveniles is high, as they have to face the aggression of territorial adult males and are also deprived of good forage by them. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

Hartebeest inhabit dry savannas, open plains and wooded grasslands, often moving into more arid places after rainfall. They are more tolerant of wooded areas than other Alcelaphini, and are often found on the edge of woodlands. They have been reported from altitudes on <a href="Mount%20Kenya">Mount Kenya</a> up to . The red hartebeest is known to move across large areas, and females roam home ranges of over , with male territories in size. Females in the <a href="Nairobi%20National%20Park">Nairobi National Park</a> (Kenya) have individual home ranges stretching over , which are not particularly associated with any one female group. Average female home ranges are large enough to include 20 to 30 male territories.

Each hartebeest subspecies is listed under a different conservation status by the IUCN. The species as a whole is classified as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> by the IUCN. The hartebeest is extinct in Algeria, Egypt, Lesotho, Libya, Morocco, Somalia, and Tunisia.


Hartebeest are popular <a href="game%20animal">game</a> and <a href="Trophy%20hunting">trophy</a> animals as they are prominently visible and hence easy to hunt. Pictorial as well as <a href="epigraphy">epigraph</a>ic evidence from <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a> suggests that in the <a href="Upper%20Palaeolithic">Upper Palaeolithic age</a>, Egyptians hunted hartebeest and domesticated them. The hartebeest was a prominent source of meat, but its economic significance was lower than that of gazelles and other desert species. However, from the beginning of the Neolithic age, hunting became less common and consequently the remains of the hartebeest from this period in Egypt, where it is now extinct, are rare.

In a study on the effect of place and sex on carcass characteristics, the average carcass weight of the male red hartebeest was and that of females was . The meat of the animals from Qua-Qua region had the highest <a href="lipid">lipid</a> contentâ per of meat. Negligible differences were found in the concentrations of individual <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s, <a href="amino%20acid">amino acid</a>s, and <a href="dietary%20mineral">mineral</a>s. The study considered hartebeest meat to be healthy, as the ratio of <a href="Polyunsaturated%20fatty%20acid">polyunsaturated</a> to <a href="saturated%20fatty%20acid">saturated fatty acid</a>s was 0.78, slightly more than the recommended 0.7.

Giganotosaurus

Giganotosaurus ( ) is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="theropod">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived in what is now <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>, during the early <a href="Cenomanian">Cenomanian</a> age of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> <a href="period%20%28geology%29">period</a>, approximately 98 to 97 million years ago. The <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> was discovered in the <a href="Candeleros%20Formation">Candeleros Formation</a> of <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a> in 1993, and is almost 70% complete. The animal was named G. carolinii in 1995; the genus name translates as "giant southern lizard" and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> honours the discoverer, RubÃ©n D. Carolini. A <a href="dentary%20bone">dentary bone</a>, a tooth and some tracks, discovered before the holotype, were later assigned to this animal. The genus attracted much interest and became part of a scientific debate about the maximum sizes of theropod dinosaurs.

"Giganotosaurus" was one of the <a href="dinosaur%20size">largest known</a> terrestrial <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>s, but the exact size has been hard to determine due to the incompleteness of the remains found so far. Estimates for the most complete specimen range from a length of , a skull in length, and a weight of . The dentary bone that belonged to a supposedly larger individual has been used to extrapolate a length of . Some researchers have found the animal to be larger than "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>", which has historically been considered the largest theropod, while others have found them to be roughly equal in size, and the largest size estimates for "Giganotosaurus" exaggerated. The skull was low, with rugose (rough and wrinkled) <a href="nasal%20bones">nasal bones</a> and a ridge-like crest on the <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a> in front of the eye. The front of the lower jaw was flattened, and had a downwards projecting process (or "chin") at the tip. The teeth were compressed sideways and had serrations. The neck was strong and the <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral girdle</a> proportionally small.

Part of the family <a href="Carcharodontosauridae">Carcharodontosauridae</a>, "Giganotosaurus" is one of the most completely known members of the group, which includes other very large theropods, such as the closely related "<a href="Mapusaurus">Mapusaurus</a>" and "<a href="Carcharodontosaurus">Carcharodontosaurus</a>". "Giganotosaurus" is thought to have been <a href="homeothermic">homeothermic</a> (a type of "<a href="warm-bloodedness">warm-bloodedness</a>"), with a <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> between that of a mammal and a reptile, which would have enabled fast growth. It may have been relatively fast moving, with a calculated maximal running speed of . It would have been capable of closing its jaws quickly, capturing and bringing down prey by delivering powerful bites. The "chin" may have helped in resisting stress when a bite was delivered against prey. "Giganotosaurus" is thought to have been the <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a> of its <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a>, and it may have fed on juvenile <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> dinosaurs.

"Giganotosaurus" is thought to have been one of the largest <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> dinosaurs, but the incompleteness of its remains have made it difficult to estimate its size reliably. It is therefore impossible to determine with certainty whether it was larger than "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>", for example, which has been considered the largest theropod historically. Different size estimates have been reached by several researchers, based on various methods, and depending on how the missing parts of the skeleton have been reconstructed. Length estimates for the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> have varied between , with a skull between long, a <a href="femur">femur</a> (thigh bone) between long, and a weight between . Fusion of <a href="suture%20%28anatomy%29">sutures</a> (joints) in the braincase indicates the holotype specimen was a mature individual. A second specimen, consisting of a <a href="dentary%20bone">dentary bone</a> (part of the lower jaw) from a supposedly larger individual, has been used to extrapolate a length of , a skull long, and a weight of . Some writers have considered the largest size estimates for both specimens exaggerated. "Giganotosaurus" has been compared to an oversized version of the well-known genus "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>".

Though incompletely known, the skull of "Giganotosaurus" appears to have been low. The <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> of the upper jaw had a long tooth row, was deep from top to bottom, and its upper and lower edges were almost parallel. The maxilla had a pronounced <a href="process%20%28anatomy%29">process</a> (projection) under the nostril, and a small, <a href="ellipse">ellipse</a>-shaped <a href="fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestra</a> (opening), as in "Allosaurus" and "Tyrannosaurus". The <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a> was very rugose (rough and wrinkled), and these rugosities continued backwards, covering the entire upper surface of this bone. The <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a> in front of the eye had a prominent, rugose crest (or horn) that pointed up at a backwards angle. The crest was ridge-like, and had deep grooves. The <a href="postorbital%20bone">postorbital bone</a> behind the eye had a down and backwards directed <a href="jugal">jugal</a> process that projected into the <a href="orbit%20%28anatomy%29">orbit</a> (eye opening), as seen in "Tyrannosaurus", "<a href="Abelisaurus">Abelisaurus</a>", and "<a href="Carnotaurus">Carnotaurus</a>". The supraorbital bone above the eye that contacted between the lacrimal and postorbital bones was <a href="eave">eave</a>-like, and similar to that of "Abelisaurus". The <a href="quadrate%20bone">quadrate bone</a> at the back of the skull was long, and had two <a href="Skeletal%20pneumaticity">pneumatic</a> (air-filled) <a href="foramina">foramina</a> (holes) on the inner side. 
The <a href="skull%20roof">skull roof</a> (formed by the <a href="frontal%20bone">frontal</a> and <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a>s) was broad and formed a "shelf", which overhung the short <a href="supratemporal%20fenestrae">supratemporal fenestrae</a> at the top rear of the skull. The jaw articulated far behind the <a href="occipital%20condyle">occipital condyle</a> (where the neck is attached to the skull) compared to other theropods. The condyle was broad and low, and had pneumatic cavities. "Giganotosaurus" did not have a <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> on the top of the skull, and the jaw muscles did not extend onto the skull roof, unlike in most other theropods (due to the shelf over the supratemporal fenestrae). These muscles would instead have been attached to the lower side surfaces of the shelf. The neck muscles that elevated the head would have attached to the prominent supraoccipital bones on the top of the skull, which functioned like the <a href="nuchal%20crest">nuchal crest</a> of <a href="tyrannosaurs">tyrannosaurs</a>. A latex <a href="endocast">endocast</a> of the brain cavity of "Giganotosaurus" showed that the brain was similar to that of the related genus "<a href="Carcharodontosaurus">Carcharodontosaurus</a>", but larger. The endocast was long, wide, and had a volume of .

The dentary of the lower jaw expanded in height towards the front (by the <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a>), where it was also flattened, and it had a downwards projection at the tip (which has been referred to as a "chin"). The lower side of the dentary was concave, the outer side was convex in upper view, and a groove ran along it, which supported foramina that nourished the teeth. The inner side of the dentary had a row of <a href="interdental%20plates">interdental plates</a>, where each tooth had a foramen. The <a href="Meckelian%20groove">Meckelian groove</a> ran along the lower border. The curvature of the dentary shows that the mouth of "Giganotosaurus" would have been wide. It is possible that each dentary had twelve <a href="dental%20alveolus">alveoli</a> (tooth sockets). Most of the alveoli were about 3.5Â cm (1.3Â in) long from front to back. The teeth of the dentary were of similar shape and size, except for the first one, which was smaller. The teeth were compressed sideways, were oval in cross-section, and had serrations at the front and back borders, which is typical of theropods. The teeth were sigmoid-shaped when seen in front and back view. One tooth had nine to twelve serrations per millimetre (0.039Â in). The side teeth of "Giganotosaurus" had curved ridges of <a href="tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, and the largest teeth in the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> (front of the upper jaw) had pronounced wrinkles (with their highest relief near the serrations).

The neck of "Giganotosaurus" was strong, and the <a href="axis%20bone">axis bone</a> (the neck <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a> that articulates with the skull) was robust. The rear neck (cervical) vertebrae had short, flattened centra (the "bodies" of the vertebrae), with almost <a href="hemispherical">hemispherical</a> articulations (contacts) at the front, and <a href="pleurocoel">pleurocoel</a>s (hollow depressions) divided by laminae (plates). The back (dorsal) vertebrae had high <a href="neural">neural</a> arches and deep pleurocoels. The tail (caudal) vertebrae had neural spines that were elongated from front to back and had robust centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae were long from front to back, and the <a href="Chevron%20%28anatomy%29">chevrons</a> on the front were blade-like. The <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral girdle</a> was proportionally shorter than that of "Tyrannosaurus", with the ratio between the <a href="scapula">scapula</a> (shoulder blade) and the femur being less than 0.5. The blade of the scapula had parallel borders, and a strong tubercle for insertion of the <a href="triceps%20muscle">triceps muscle</a>. The <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a> was small and hook-shaped.

The <a href="Ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a> of the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a> had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the <a href="acetabulum">acetabulum</a>), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a projection where tail muscles attached). The <a href="pubic">pubic</a> foot was pronounced and shorter at the front than behind. The <a href="ischium">ischium</a> was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a <a href="lobe%20%28anatomy%29">lobe</a>-shape. The femur was <a href="sigmoid%20function">sigmoid</a>-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep <a href="sulcus%20%28morphology%29">sulcus</a> (groove). The <a href="lesser%20trochanter">lesser trochanter</a> of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the <a href="greater%20trochanter">greater trochanter</a>, which was short. The <a href="fourth%20trochanter">fourth trochanter</a> was large and projected backwards. The <a href="tibia">tibia</a> of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.

In 1993, the amateur <a href="fossil%20hunter">fossil hunter</a> RubÃ©n D. Carolini discovered the tibia of a theropod dinosaur while driving a <a href="dune%20buggy">dune buggy</a> in the <a href="badlands">badlands</a> near <a href="Villa%20El%20Choc%C3%B3n">Villa El ChocÃ³n</a>, in the <a href="Neuqu%C3%A9n%20province">NeuquÃ©n province</a> of <a href="Patagonia">Patagonia</a>, Argentina. Specialists from the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Comahue">National University of Comahue</a> were sent to excavate the specimen after being notified of the find. The discovery was announced by the palaeontologists <a href="Rodolfo%20Coria">Rodolfo Coria</a> and Leonardo Salgado at a <a href="Society%20of%20Vertebrate%20Paleontology">Society of Vertebrate Paleontology</a> meeting in 1994, where science writer <a href="Don%20Lessem">Don Lessem</a> offered to fund the excavation, after having been impressed by a photo of the leg-bone. The partial skull was scattered over an area of about 10 square metres (110 sq ft), and the postcranial skeleton was disarticulated. The specimen preserved almost 70% of the skeleton, and included most of the <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a>, the pectoral and pelvic girdles, the femora, and the left tibia and fibula. In 1995, this specimen (MUCPv-Ch1) was preliminarily described in <a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">"Nature"</a> by Coria and Salgado, who made it the holotype of the new genus and species "Giganotosaurus carolinii" (parts of the skeleton were still encased in plaster at this time). The generic name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "gigas/Î³Î¯Î³Î±Ï" (meaning "giant"), "notos/Î½ÏÏÎ¿Ï" (meaning "austral/southern", in reference to its provenance) and "-sauros/-ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï" (meaning "lizard"). The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> honours Carolini, the discoverer. The holotype skeleton is now housed in the Ernesto Bachmann Palaeontological Museum in Villa El ChocÃ³n, which was inaugurated in 1995 at the request of Carolini. The specimen is the main exhibition at the museum, and is placed on the sandy floor of a room devoted to the animal, along with tools used by palaeontologists during the excavation. A mounted reconstruction of the skeleton is exhibited in an adjacent room.
One of the features of theropod dinosaurs that has attracted most scientific interest is the fact that the group includes the largest terrestrial predators of the <a href="Mesozoic%20Era">Mesozoic Era</a>. This interest began with the discovery of one of the first known dinosaurs, "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>", named in 1824 for its large size. More than half a century later in 1905, "Tyrannosaurus" was named, and it remained the largest known theropod dinosaur for 90 years, though other large theropods were also known. The discussion of which theropod was the largest was revived in the 1990s by new discoveries in Africa and South America. In their original description, Coria and Salgado considered "Giganotosaurus" at least the largest theropod dinosaur from the <a href="southern%20hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a>, and perhaps the largest in the world. They conceded that comparison with "Tyrannosaurus" was difficult due to the disarticulated state of the cranial bones of "Giganotosaurus", but noted that at , the femur of "Giganotosaurus" was 5Â cm (2Â in) longer than that of "<a href="Sue%20%28dinosaur%29">Sue</a>", the largest known "Tyrannosaurus" specimen, and that the bones of "Giganotosaurus" appeared to be more robust, indicating a heavier animal. They estimated the skull to have been about 1.53Â m (5Â ft) long, and the whole animal to have been 12.5Â m (41Â ft) long, with a weight of about .

In 1996, the palaeontologist <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a> and colleagues described a new skull of the related genus "Carcharodontosaurus" from <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, a theropod described in 1927 but previously known only from fragmentary remains (the original fossils were destroyed in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>). They estimated the skull to have been long, similar to "Giganotosaurus", but perhaps exceeding that of the "Tyrannosaurus" "Sue", with a 1.53Â m (5Â ft) long skull. They also pointed out that carcharodontosaurs appear to have had the proportionally largest skulls, but that "Tyrannosaurus" appears to have had longer hind limbs. In a 1995 interview for a "<a href="Science%20News">Science News</a>" article entitled "New Beast Usurps "T. Rex" as King Carnivore", Sereno noted that these newly discovered theropods from South America and Africa competed with "Tyrannosaurus" as the largest predators, and would help in the understanding of <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> dinosaur faunas, which had otherwise been very "North America-centric". In the same issue of "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>" in which "Carcharodontosaurus" was described, the palaeontologist <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a> cautioned that it was yet to be determined which of the two animals were larger, and that the size of an animal is less interesting to palaeontologists than, for example, adaptations, relationships, and distribution. He also found it remarkable that the two animals were found within a year of each other, and were closely related, in spite of being found on different continents. 
In a 1997 "Science News" interview, Coria estimated "Giganotosaurus" to have been 13.7 (45Â ft) to 14.3 (47Â ft) m long and weighing based on new material, larger than "Carcharodontosaurus". Sereno countered that it would be difficult to determine a size range for a species based on few, incomplete specimens, and both palaeontologists agreed that other aspects of these dinosaurs were more important than settling the "size contest". In 1998, the palaeontologist <a href="Jorge%20O.%20Calvo">Jorge O. Calvo</a> and Coria referred a partial left dentary containing some teeth (MUCPv-95) to "Giganotosaurus". It had been collected by Calvo near Los Candeleros in 1988 (found in 1987), who described it briefly in 1989, while noting it may have belonged to a new theropod <a href="taxon">taxon</a>. Calvo and Coria found the dentary to be identical to that of the holotype, though 8% larger at 62Â cm (24Â in). Though the rear part of it is incomplete, they proposed that the skull of the holotype specimen would have been long, and estimated the skull of the larger specimen to have been long, the longest skull of any theropod.

In 1999, Calvo referred an incomplete tooth, (MUCPv-52), to "Giganotosaurus"; this specimen was discovered near Lake Ezequiel Ramos Mexia in 1987 by A. Delgado, and is therefore the first known fossil of the genus. Calvo further suggested that some theropod <a href="trackways">trackways</a> and isolated tracks (which he made the basis of the <a href="ichnotaxon">ichnotaxon</a> "<a href="Abelichnus%20astigarrae">Abelichnus astigarrae</a>" in 1991) belonged to "Giganotosaurus", based on their large size. The largest tracks are long with a pace of , and the smallest is long with a pace of . The tracks are <a href="tridactyl">tridactyl</a> (three-toed) and have large and coarse digits, with prominent claw impressions. Impressions of the digits occupy most of the track-length, and one track has a thin heel. Though the tracks were found in a higher <a href="stratigraphic">stratigraphic</a> level than the main fossils of "Giganotosaurus", they were from the same <a href="strata">strata</a> as the single tooth and some <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> dinosaurs that are also known from the same strata as "Giganotosaurus".
In 2001, the <a href="physician-scientist">physician-scientist</a> Frank Seebacher proposed a new <a href="polynomial">polynomial</a> method of calculating body-mass estimates for dinosaurs (using body-length, depth, and width), and found "Giganotosaurus" to have weighed (based on the original length estimate). In their 2002 description of the braincase of "Giganotosaurus", Coria and Currie gave a length estimate of for the holotype skull, and calculated a weight of by extrapolating from the circumference of the femur-shaft. This resulted in an <a href="encephalization%20quotient">encephalization quotient</a> (a measure of relative brain size) of 1.9. In 2004, the palaeontologist Gerardo V. Mazzetta and colleagues pointed out that though the femur of the "Giganotosaurus" holotype was larger than that of "Sue", the tibia was shorter at . They found the holotype specimen to have been equal to "Tyrannosaurus" in size at (marginally smaller than "Sue"), but that the larger dentary might have represented an animal of , if geometrically similar to the holotype specimen. By using multivariate <a href="regression%20equations">regression equations</a>, these authors also suggested an alternative weight of for the holotype and for the larger specimen, and that the latter was therefore the largest known terrestrial carnivore. 

In 2005, the palaeontologist <a href="Cristiano%20Dal%20Sasso">Cristiano Dal Sasso</a> and colleagues described new skull material (a snout) of "<a href="Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a>" (the original fossils of which were also destroyed during World War II), and concluded this dinosaur would have been long with a weight , exceeding the maximum size of all other theropods. In 2006, Coria and Currie described the large theropod "Mapusaurus" from Patagonia; it was closely related to "Giganotosaurus" and of approximately the same size. In a 2007, the palaeontologists FranÃ§ois Therrien and Donald M. Henderson found that "Giganotosaurus" and "Carcharodontosaurus" would both have approached in length and in weight (surpassing "Tyrannosaurus"), and estimated the "Giganotosaurus" holotype skull to have been long. They cautioned that these measurements depended on whether the incomplete skulls of these animals had been reconstructed correctly, and that more complete specimens were needed for more accurate estimates. They also found that Dal Sasso and colleagues' reconstruction of "Spinosaurus" was too large, and instead estimated it to have been long, weighing , and possibly as low as in length and in weight. They concluded that these dinosaurs had reached the upper <a href="Biomechanics">biomechanical</a> size limit attainable by a strictly <a href="bipedal">bipedal</a> animal. In 2010, the palaeontologist <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> suggested that the skulls of carcharodontosaurs had been reconstructed as too long in general.

In 2012, the palaeontologist Matthew T. Carrano and colleagues noted that though "Giganotosaurus" had received much attention due to its enormous size, and in spite of the holotype being relatively complete, it had not yet been described in detail, apart from the braincase. They pointed out that many contacts between skull bones were not preserved, which lead to the total length of the skull being ambiguous. They found instead that the skulls of "Giganotosaurus" and "Carcharodontosaurus" were exactly the same size as that of "Tyrannosaurus". They also measured the femur of the "Giganotosaurus" holotype to be long, in contrast to the original measurement, and proposed that the body mass would have been smaller overall. In 2013, the palaeontologist Scott Hartman published a Graphic Double Integration mass estimate (based on drawn skeletal reconstructions), wherein he found "Tyrannosaurus" ("Sue") to have been larger than "Giganotosaurus" overall. He estimated the "Giganotosaurus" holotype to have weighed , and the larger specimen . "Tyrannosaurus" was estimated to have weighed , and Hartman noted that it had a wider torso, though the two seemed similar in side view. He also pointed out that the "Giganotosaurus" dentary that was supposedly 8% larger than that of the holotype specimen would rather have been 6.5% larger, or could simply have belonged to a similarly sized animal with a more robust dentary. He conceded that with only one good "Giganotosaurus" specimen known, it is possible that larger individuals will be found, as it took most of a century to find "Sue" after "Tyrannosaurus" was discovered. In 2014, Nizar Ibrahim and colleagues estimated the length of "Spinosaurus" to have been over , by extrapolating from a new specimen scaled up to match the snout described by Dal Sasso and colleagues. This would make "Spinosaurus" the largest ever carnivorous dinosaur.

Coria and Salgado originally found "Giganotosaurus" to group more closely with the theropod <a href="clade">clade</a> <a href="Tetanurae">Tetanurae</a> than to more <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (or "primitive") theropods such as <a href="Ceratosauria">ceratosaurs</a>, due to shared features (<a href="synapomorphies">synapomorphies</a>) in the legs, skull, and pelvis. Other features showed that it was outside the more derived (or "advanced") clade <a href="Coelurosauria">Coelurosauria</a>. In 1996, Sereno and colleagues found "Giganotosaurus", "Carcharodontosaurus", and "<a href="Acrocanthosaurus">Acrocanthosaurus</a>" to be closely related within the superfamily <a href="Allosauroidea">Allosauroidea</a>, and grouped them in the family <a href="Carcharodontosauridae">Carcharodontosauridae</a>. Features shared between these genera include the lacrimal and postorbital bones forming a broad "shelf" over the orbit, and the squared front end of the lower jaw.

As more carcharodontosaurids were discovered, their interrelationships became clearer. The group was defined as all allosauroids closer to Carcharodontosaurus than "Allosaurus" or "<a href="Sinraptor">Sinraptor</a>" by the palaeontologist <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz">Thomas R. Holtz</a> and colleagues in 2004. In 2006, Coria and Currie united "Giganotosaurus" and "Mapusaurus" in the carcharodontosaurid <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> <a href="Giganotosaurinae">Giganotosaurinae</a> based on shared features of the femur, such as a weak fourth trocanther, and a shallow, broad groove on the lower end. In 2008, Sereno and the palaeontologist <a href="Stephen%20L.%20Brusatte">Stephen L. Brusatte</a> united "Giganotosaurus", "Mapusaurus", and "<a href="Tyrannotitan">Tyrannotitan</a>" in the tribe <a href="Giganotosaurini">Giganotosaurini</a>. In 2010, Paul listed "Giganotosaurus" as ""Giganotosaurus" (or "Carcharodontosaurus") "carolinii"" without elaboration. "Giganotosaurus" is one of the most complete and informative members of Carcharodontosauridae.

The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the placement of "Giganotosaurus" within Carcharodontosauridae according to SebastiÃ¡n ApesteguÃ­a et al., 2016:

Coria and Salgado suggested that the <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a> of gigantism in theropods could have been linked to common conditions in their environments or <a href="ecosystems">ecosystems</a>. Sereno and colleagues found that the presence of carcharodontosaurids in Africa ("Carcharodontosaurus"), North America ("Acrocanthosaurus"), and South America ("Giganotosaurus"), showed the group had a transcontinental distribution by the <a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a> <a href="period%20%28geology%29">period</a>. <a href="Biological%20dispersal">Dispersal routes</a> between the northern and southern continents appear to have been severed by ocean barriers in the Late Cretaceous, which led to more distinct, provincial faunas, by preventing exchange. Previously, it was thought that the Cretaceous world was <a href="biogeographically">biogeographically</a> separated, with the northern continents being dominated by tyrannosaurids, South America by <a href="Abelisauridae">abelisaurids</a>, and Africa by carcharodontosaurids. The subfamily Carcharodontosaurinae, in which "Giganotosaurus" belongs, appears to have been restricted to the southern continent of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> (formed by South America and Africa), where they were probably the <a href="apex%20predator">apex (top) predators</a>. The South American tribe Giganotosaurini may have been separated from their African relatives through <a href="vicariance">vicariance</a>, when Gondwana broke up during the <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a>â<a href="Albian">Albian</a> ages of the Early Cretaceous.

In 1999, the palaeontologist Reese E. Barrick and the geologist William J. Showers found that the bones of "Giganotosaurus" and "Tyrannosaurus" had very similar <a href="oxygen%20isotope">oxygen isotope</a> patterns, with similar heat distribution in the body. These <a href="thermoregulatory">thermoregulatory</a> patterns indicate that these dinosaurs had a <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> intermediate between that of mammals and reptiles, and were therefore <a href="homeothermic">homeothermic</a> (with a stable core body-temperature, a type of "<a href="warm-bloodedness">warm-bloodedness</a>"). The metabolism of an "Giganotosaurus" would be comparable to that of a mammalian carnivore, and would have supported rapid growth.

In 2001, the physicist Rudemar Ernesto Blanco and Mazzetta evaluated the <a href="cursorial">cursorial</a> (running) capability of "Giganotosaurus". They rejected the hypothesis by <a href="James%20Orville%20Farlow">James Orville Farlow</a> that the risk of injuries involved in such large animals falling while on a run, would limit the speed of large theropods. Instead they posed that the imbalance caused by increasing velocity would be the limiting factor. Calculating the time it would take for a leg to gain balance after the retraction of the opposite leg, they found the upper <a href="kinematic">kinematic</a> limit of the running speed to be . They also found comparison between the running capability of "Giganotosaurus" and birds like the <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a> based on the strength of their leg-bones to be of limited value, since theropods, unlike birds, had heavy tails to counterbalance their weight.

In 2002, Coria and Currie found that various features of the rear part of the skull (such as the frontwards slope of the occiput and low and wide occipital condyle) indicate that "Giganotosaurus" would have had a good capability of moving the skull sideways in relation to the front neck vertebrae. These features may also have been related to the increased mass and length of the jaw muscles; the jaw articulation of "Giganotosaurus" and other carcharodontosaurids was moved hindwards to increase the length of the jaw musculature, enabling faster closure of the jaws, whereas tyrannosaurs increased the mass of the lower jaw musculature, to increase the power of their bite.

In 2005 Therrien and colleagues estimated the relative <a href="bite%20force">bite force</a> of theropods (estimates in absolute values like <a href="newton%20%28unit%29">newtons</a> were impossible) and found that "Giganotosaurus" and related taxa had adaptations for capturing and bringing down prey by delivering powerful bites, whereas tyrannosaurs had adaptations for resisting <a href="torsional">torsional</a> stress and crushing bones. The bite force of "Giganotosaurus" was weaker than that of "Tyrannosaurus", and the force decreased hindwards along the tooth row. The lower jaws were adapted for slicing bites, and it probably captured and manipulated prey with the front part of the jaws. These authors suggested that "Giganotosaurus" and other allosaurs may have been generalised predators that fed on a wide spectrum of prey smaller than themselves, such as juvenile sauropods. The ventral process (or "chin") of the lower jaw may have been an adaptation for resisting tensile stress when the powerful bite was delivered with the front of the jaws against the prey.

The first known fossils of the closely related "Mapusaurus" were found in a <a href="bonebed">bonebed</a> consisting of several individuals at different growth stages. In their 2006 description of the genus, Coria and Currie suggested that though this could be due to a long term or coincidental accumulation of carcasses, the presence of different growth stages of the same taxon indicated the aggregation was not coincidental. In a 2006 "<a href="National%20Geographic%20%28magazine%29">National Geographic</a>" article, Coria stated that the bonebed was probably the result of a catastrophic event, and that the presence of mainly medium-sized individuals, with very few young or old, is normal for animals that form packs. Therefore, Coria said, large theropods may have hunted in groups, which would be advantageous when hunting gigantic sauropods.

"Giganotosaurus" was discovered in the <a href="Candeleros%20Formation">Candeleros Formation</a>, which was deposited during the Early <a href="Cenomanian">Cenomanian</a> age of the Late Cretaceous period, approximately 98 to 97 million years ago, although Holtz provided an earlier lower bound for its age of 99.6 million years. This formation is the lowest unit in the <a href="Neuqu%C3%A9n%20Group">NeuquÃ©n Group</a>, wherein it is part of the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Limay%20Subgroup">RÃ­o Limay Subgroup</a>. The formation is composed of coarse and medium-grained <a href="sandstones">sandstones</a> deposited in a <a href="fluvial">fluvial</a> environment (associated with rivers and streams), and in <a href="Aeolian%20processes">aeolian</a> conditions (effected by wind). <a href="Paleosol">Paleosol</a>s (buried soil), <a href="siltstone">siltstone</a>s, and <a href="claystone">claystone</a>s are present, some of which represent <a href="swamp">swamp</a> conditions.

"Giganotosaurus" was probably the apex predator in its ecosystem. It shared its environment with herbivorous dinosaurs such as the <a href="titanosaurian">titanosaurian</a> sauropod "<a href="Andesaurus">Andesaurus</a>", and the <a href="Rebbachisauridae">rebbachisaurid</a> sauropods "<a href="Limaysaurus">Limaysaurus</a>" and "<a href="Nopcsaspondylus">Nopcsaspondylus</a>". Other theropods include the abelisaurid "<a href="Ekrixinatosaurus">Ekrixinatosaurus</a>", the <a href="Dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurid</a> "<a href="Buitreraptor">Buitreraptor</a>", and the <a href="Alvarezsauridae">alvarezsaurid</a> "<a href="Alnashetri">Alnashetri</a>". Other reptiles include the <a href="crocodyliform">crocodyliform</a> "<a href="Araripesuchus">Araripesuchus</a>", <a href="sphenodontians">sphenodontians</a>, snakes, and the turtle "<a href="Prochelidella">Prochelidella</a>". Other vertebrates include <a href="cladotherian">cladotherian</a> mammals, a <a href="pipoid">pipoid</a> frog, and <a href="ceratodontiform">ceratodontiform</a> fishes.

Vampire: The Masquerade â Bloodlines

Vampire: The Masquerade â Bloodlines is a 2004 <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing video game</a> developed by <a href="Troika%20Games">Troika Games</a> and released by <a href="Activision">Activision</a> for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>. Set in <a href="White%20Wolf%20Publishing">White Wolf Publishing</a>'s <a href="World%20of%20Darkness">World of Darkness</a>, the game is based on White Wolf's role-playing game "" and follows either a male or female character who is killed and subsequently revived as a fledgling <a href="vampire">vampire</a>. The game depicts the fledgling's journey through the early 21st-century <a href="Los%20Angeles%20in%20popular%20culture">Los Angeles</a> to uncover the truth behind a recently discovered relic that heralds the end of all vampires.

"Bloodlines" is presented from <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first</a>- and <a href="third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> perspectives. The player assigns their character to one of several vampire clanseach with unique powers, customizes their combat and dialog abilities and progresses through "Bloodlines" using violent and nonviolent methods. The selection of clan affects how the player is perceived in the game world, and which powers and abilities they possess; this opens up different avenues of exploration and methods of interacting with or manipulating other characters. The player is able to complete side missions away from the primary storyline by moving freely between the available hubs: <a href="Santa%20Monica">Santa Monica</a>, <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, <a href="downtown%20Los%20Angeles">downtown Los Angeles</a>, and <a href="Chinatown%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Chinatown</a>.

Troika's 32-member team began development of "Bloodlines" in November 2001, as an indirect sequel to the previous year's "". Troika used <a href="Valve%20Corporation">Valve Corporation</a>'s <a href="Source%20%28game%20engine%29">Source</a> game engine, then in development, which was being used for Valve's own "<a href="Half-Life%202">Half-Life 2</a>". The game's production was turbulent, as the design's scope exceeded the available resources, and the team were left without a producer for nearly a year until Activision appointed <a href="David%20Mullich">David Mullich</a> to the role, where he found designs and <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> unfinished or abandoned. After three years in development with no end in sight and running over budget, Activision set a strict deadline for completion, and "Bloodlines" was released incomplete in November 2004.

Released in competition with "Half-Life 2" and several other titles, "Bloodlines" sold fewer than 80,000 copies during its initial release, which was considered a poor performance. It divided critics at the time; although they praised the game's writing and scale of choice, they criticized its technical flaws. It was Troika Games' last production before its failure in early 2005, when it was unable to secure additional projects. The game has a cult following as a rarely replicated example of gameplay and narrative, and contemporary reception recognises it as a flawed masterpiece. Since its original release in 2004, "Bloodlines" received post-release support from fans, supplying unofficial fixes and re-adding unused content.

"Bloodlines" is an <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing video game</a> optionally presented from the <a href="first-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-</a> or <a href="Third-person%20shooter">third-person</a> perspective. Before the game begins, players create a male or female vampire <a href="Player%20character">character</a> by selecting a vampire clan and configuring available points in three areasâAttributes, Abilities and Disciplines (vampiric powers)âor by answering questions, which create a character for the player. The player can select one of seven vampire clans: the powerful Brujah, the decadent Toreador, the insane Malkavian, the aristocratic Ventrue, the monstrously-deformed Nosferatu, the blood-magic wielding Tremere, or the animalistic Gangrel.

The player builds their character by spending acquired points to increase their ratings in the three areas. The points spent on Attributes and Abilities combine to determine a player's success or effectiveness in performing tasks such as using firearms, brawling, and lock-picking; for example, determining how accurate or how far the player can shoot, or if they can hack a computer. Attributes are represented by physical (strength, dexterity, and stamina), social (charisma, manipulation, and appearance), and mental (perception, intelligence, and wits). Abilities are talents (such as brawling and dodging), skills (such as firearms and melee) and knowledges (such as computers and investigation). The player is initially assigned points to spend in the three areas, with the amount they can spend determined by clan; for example, the Brujah can spend the most points on physical and skill attributes. During character creation, each upgrade costs one point. The upgrade cost increases as the game progresses. Each ability can be raised from zero to five, and it is impossible to accrue enough <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s to complete every skill (allowing the player to specialize or balance their character). Experience points are gained by completing quests, finding items or unlocking secret paths, rather than killing enemies, and are used to increase or unlock the character's <a href="Statistic%20%28role-playing%20games%29%23Character%20points">statistics and abilities</a>. The game features a main story, and optional side quests that can be completed at any time; the player is able to move between the available areas at will to revisit locations, characters, or merchants.

The player's clan affects their skills and powers. Although the attractive Toreadors receive bonuses for seduction and persuasion, opening additional dialog options, they are physically weak; the Nosferatu are forced to travel in the shadows or through sewers to avoid alerting humans, but receive bonuses to their intelligence and computer skills, which enables access to more information. The Malkavians have separate dialog options, reflecting their inherent insanity. Upgrading some skills provides additional dialog options; attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way, aggressive characters threaten, and others persuade their targets to cooperate.
Firearms combat is first-person, with character points assigned to the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy and how long it takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as <a href="katana">katana</a>s and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. If a player sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use <a href="Stealth%20game">stealth</a> in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.

Each clan has specific Disciplines, which can be used in combat and to create approaches to quests. Although some powers overlap clans, no two clans share the same three Disciplines. More physical vampires can enhance themselves to become fast and lethal killers or summon spirit allies to attack their foes; others can mentally dominate their targets to force their cooperation or render themselves invisible to hide from detection; and others can boil their opponent's blood from afar. Some Disciplines, such as Auspex (which boosts perception, highlighting other characters' auras through obstacles) and Blood Buff (which temporarily upgrades strength, dexterity, stamina and lockpicking), are common to all vampires. Several abilities can be active at the same time. <a href="Blood">Blood</a> is a primary currency in "Bloodlines", used to activate Disciplines and abilities. It is drained with each use, and can be replenished by drinking from rats, visiting blood banks or drinking from humans by attacking or seducing them; the player can feed on enemies during combat. Drinking from innocents for too long can kill them, costing a character humanity points.

Players are penalized for using certain vampiric abilities in front of witnesses; exposing their existence loses masquerade points, although additional masquerade points can be earned with quests and other actions. Violating the masquerade five times draws the ire of vampire hunters and loses the game. The player has humanity points, representing the vampire's humanity. Some actions cost humanity points; a low humanity score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive, and increases the chance of entering a frenzied state and embarking on a killing spree, when the vampire's blood is low. This frenzy can also be triggered by a large amount of damage. Like masquerade points, losing all humanity points ends the game, with the vampire becoming a mindless beast. Some areas, known as Elysium, prevent the use of Disciplines or weapons. Players can recruit a female ghoul, Heather, as a customizable servant who gives them blood, gifts, and money.

"Vampire: The Masquerade â Bloodlines" takes place in four areas of 21st-century Los Angeles: <a href="Santa%20Monica">Santa Monica</a>, <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, <a href="Downtown%20Los%20Angeles">Downtown Los Angeles</a>, and <a href="Chinatown%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Chinatown</a>. Set in the <a href="World%20of%20Darkness">World of Darkness</a>, the game depicts a world in which vampires, <a href="werewolf">werewolves</a>, demons, and other creatures shape human history. The vampires are bound by a code to maintain their secrecy (forbidding the use of vampiric abilities in front of humans) and avoid unnecessary killing (to preserve the vampire's last shreds of humanity). The vampires are divided into seven clans of the <a href="Camarilla%20%28World%20of%20Darkness%29">Camarilla</a>, the vampire government, with distinctive traits and abilities. The Toreadors are the closest to humanity, with a passion for culture; the Ventrue are noble, powerful leaders; the Brujah are idealists who excel at fighting; the Malkavians are cursed with insanity, or blessed with insight; the Gangrel are loners, in sync with their animalistic nature; the secretive, untrustworthy Tremere wield blood magic; and the monstrous Nosferatu are condemned to a life in the shadows to avoid humanity. The clans are loosely united by their belief in the Camarilla's goals and opposition to the Sabbat: vampires who revel in their nature, embracing the beast within. The Anarchs are a faction of idealistic vampires opposed to the Camarilla's political structure, believing that power should be shared by all vampires.

The main character of "Bloodlines", whom the player controls, is an unnamed fledgling vampire, transformed at the start of a game and belonging to one of the clans. The fledgling is employed by Sebastian LaCroix (voiced by <a href="Andy%20Milder">Andy Milder</a>), prince of Los Angeles' vampires. The fledgling's travels through the vampire world bring them into contact with other <a href="undead">undead</a> creatures such as the deformed information broker Bertram Tung, the Anarch Smiling Jack, and the mentally-unstable Voerman sisters, Jeanette and Therese. Chinatown is controlled by the Kuei-Jin, Asian vampires led by Ming-Xiao, who do not require blood and consider themselves superior to the other vampires.

The game begins with the <a href="player%20character">player character</a>, an unnamed human, being killed and resurrected as a fledgling vampire. For this unauthorized act, the fledgling and their <a href="Childe">Sire</a> are brought before the Camarilla. The Sire is executed by order of LaCroix; the fledgling is spared the same fate by the intervention of the Anarch, Nines Rodriguez, and employed by the prince.

LaCroix sends the fledgling to Santa Monica to help his ghoul, Mercurio, destroy a Sabbat warehouse. Following their success the fledgling travels to downtown Los Angeles, meeting separately with Nines, LaCroix, and Jack. LaCroix tasks the fledgling with investigating a docked ship, the "Elizabeth Dane", for information about an Ankaran sarcophagus rumored to contain the body of an Antediluvian, one of the oldest and most powerful vampires, whose arrival would herald the vampire apocalypse, <a href="Gehenna%20%28World%20of%20Darkness%29">Gehenna</a>. The fledgling discovers that the sarcophagus seems to have been opened from within.

Increased Sabbat activity coincides with the disappearance of the Malkavian chief, Alistair Grout. At Grout's mansion, the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' presence at the mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. The fledgling is sent to the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%20of%20Los%20Angeles%20County">Museum of Natural History</a> to recover the sarcophagus, but finds that it has been stolen. Jack later suggests to the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within, gaining its power.

Believing that Gary, the Nosferatu chief, has stolen the sarcophagus, the fledgling is sent to Hollywood to find him; after locating a captured Nosferatu for Gary, he reveals that the sarcophagus was stolen by the Giovanni vampire clan. The fledgling infiltrates the Giovanni mansion and finds the sarcophagus guarded by the Kuei-Jin, who claim their leader, Ming-Xiao, has formed an alliance with LaCroix. The locked sarcophagus is returned to LaCroix's tower and Beckett, a vampire scholar, tells the fledgling that the only person who can open it has been abducted by Grunfeld to lure LaCroix. The fledgling kills Grunfeld and learns that the sarcophagus' key has been stolen.

The fledgling returns to LaCroix, learning that the Sabbat tried to steal the sarcophagus to destroy it and prevent Gehenna, and kills the Sabbat leader to disperse his followers. The fledgling is met by Ming-Xiao, who offers to form an alliance. Ming-Xiao reveals that she has the key, and LaCroix killed Grout to prevent his powerful insight from unveiling LaCroix's plans; Ming-Xiao changed into Nines at the mansion to frame him. Denying Ming-Xiao's claims, LaCroix rescinds the blood hunt on Nines and entrusts the fledgling with recruiting the Anarchs to punish the Kuei-Jin for murdering Grout. The fledgling finds Nines hiding in <a href="Griffith%20Park">Griffith Park</a>, and they are then attacked by a werewolf and Nines is badly injured. The fledgling escapes with Jack, who reveals that LaCroix has issued an execution order on the fledgling for framing Nines on orders from Ming-Xiao.

The end varies, depending on whom, if anyone, the fledgling allies with. If the fledgling supports LaCroix or Ming-Xiao, each sends the fledgling to kill the other. LaCroix opens the sarcophagus, to be killed with the fledgling by hidden explosives; Ming-Xiao betrays the fledgling, chaining them to the sarcophagus and sinking it in the ocean. Supporting the Anarchs or no one makes the fledgling kill Ming-Xiao and maim LaCroix, who is killed after he opens the sarcophagus. If the fledgling opens the sarcophagus, they die in the explosion. If the fledgling is a Tremere, they kill Ming-Xiao; LaCroix is replaced by Tremere leader Maximillian Strauss, and the sarcophagus is stored. Each ending has Jack watching from afar with the mummy taken from the coffin and the enigmatic taxi driver who transports the fledgling between locations, who says, "The blood of Caine controls our fateÂ ... Farewell, vampire."

The development of "Vampire: The Masquerade â Bloodlines" began at <a href="Troika%20Games">Troika Games</a> in November 2001. The developers wanted to put a role-playing game in a first-person setting, believing that the genre had become stale. Troika approached publisher <a href="Activision">Activision</a> with its idea; Activision suggested using the "Vampire: The Masquerade" license used a year earlier in <a href="nStigate%20Games">Nihilistic Software</a>'s "", which had experienced sufficient success to merit a sequel. Instead of developing a sequel to "Redemption", the development team researched the White Wolf property, including the game's rules and its storylines. Troika was a small game studio, with five developers and a total staff of thirty-two (including lead writer <a href="Brian%20Mitsoda">Brian Mitsoda</a>, who joined the team less than a year after development began). Although some preliminary design and levels were completed, much of the work was abandoned or redeveloped.

Troika wanted to make a <a href="Video%20game%20graphics%233D">3D game</a>, but was uncertain whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first- or third-person. At that time, the <a href="Source%20%28game%20engine%29">Source</a> game engine was being built by <a href="Valve%20Corporation">Valve Corporation</a>. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached Troika about using the engine, and it was the first external team to use it. Troika chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since it wanted players to speak to the characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with "Bloodlines" and Valve's own "<a href="Half-Life%202">Half-Life 2</a>", Troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, and with only a single source for technical support. Troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for the nighttime setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.

Many of the central plot elements existed before designer Brian Mitsoda's involvement: the prince, the anarchs being upset, aspects of the Gehenna storyline, and Jack and the sarcophagus as a major subplot. The designers broadly tied the overarching story into each hub and level. Each designer controlled their assigned section of the game, and working with a small team enabled quick decision making and ease in keeping plot elements consistent. Mitsoda became the primary writer for many of the characters and their quests, dialog, and side content in the game, such as emails, which helped retain a consistent narrative. He was given freedom with respect to the script, with no restrictions on language or content, and could rewrite characters when he thought his initial draft weak. Although the story was developed by Troika, it is inspired by White Wolf's "<a href="Time%20of%20Judgment">Time of Judgment</a>" novels about a vampire apocalypse. "Bloodlines" story was accepted as <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canonical</a> by White Wolf, with the game serving as a prequel to "Time of Judgment" and including characters from the White Wolf game, such as Jack. Discussing character design, Mitsoda said he tried to disguise the need for characters who simply point a player in an appropriate direction:

You need a character to pose a problem or give out a quest or be a barrier of some kind. I don't like to make the [character] outright say "I need you to do X, then I'll give you Y"Â ...Â â it makes the character into an automated quest kiosk. I like the characters to come off like people actually do â they don't say "hi" when strangers come knocking, they say "who the hell are you?" or they're expecting you and know more than they let on, or they don't care. I don't like my [characters] to be standing around as if their lives begin when the character starts talking to them and end when the player leaves.

Single-purpose characters needed a distinctive personality trait to quickly establish them with the player, rather than serving as a disposable item, while major characters had to reflect the player's progression and actions through the game. Mitsoda wrote the characters by thinking about who each character was, assigning them motivations determining why they were where they were, what they thought about the player and what they wanted from them. In accordance with a suggestion by fellow writer Chad Moore, the Malkavian player character has a dialog script distinct from that of the other eight clans; Mitsoda said it was one of the simpler aspects of the development cycle. He wrote the Malkavian script last, with time running out on development, and the overwork and lack of sleep contributed to what Mitsoda considered an unhealthy state of mind, ideal for writing insane dialog. He wanted to highlight their madness, without making it comical. Since the story is set during the Camarilla's takeover of Los Angeles, the team simplified the plot by only allowing the player to belong to one of the LA-based clans.

Troika co-founder Jason Anderson's research on "Vampire: The Masquerade" source material and fansites found that character interaction and involvement in the vampire societies, not statistics and powers, was the game's main attraction. Troika tried to remain true to the <a href="Tabletop%20role-playing%20game">pen-and-paper role-playing game</a>, hoping not to alienate the game's fans, but rules designed for multiple players did not translate well to single player computer game design. The team attempted to discover which elements could work equally well in pen-and-paper and computer games. Although much of the character system and attributes translated, not all the attributes (such as "knowledge of law") made sense in the computer game. Of 30 pen-and-paper abilities, 15 reached the final design.

Another difficult area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random chance of success or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization was replaced by a degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.

The team's previous experience was with turn-based combat games, and it struggled to develop a real-time combat system affected by customizable attributes and abilities that provided feedback to the player on how those statistics were affecting the battle. It initially found that by adhering too closely to the White Wolf source material rules for guns, where the effectiveness of a shot is determined in a contest between the player's skill and the opponent's defense, the firearms seemed broken; the player would not hit where they aimed. Troika found it difficult to mesh the available factors in a real-time setting. Melee combat had to deal with a variety of melee weapons and animations and adjust for melee-on-melee and melee-on-ranged combat.

Troika used first-person perspective to immerse the player in the setting, interacting face-to-face with the characters and seeing their facial reactions to the player. It chose to follow a single-character to aid the immersion, creating the isolation of a vampire unable to trust any other character. This aided the story and compensated for the technical issues of allowing multiple player characters.

Choice is a significant aspect of the game, requiring a non-linear design to accommodate the customized characters. Level design began with a list of factors such as Disciplines, stealth and feats. Each area had to be viable for a shooting character (sufficient ammunition), a discipline-focused character (sufficient blood sources to keep the powers fueled) and a melee specialist (to reach enemies without being killed), with stealth options and option combinations. Level design began with a focus on stealth, taking into consideration the positioning of guards and the character's potential stealth capability at that point in the game. Then direct, combat-heavy and dialog paths were added. The <a href="amusement%20arcade">amusement arcade</a> area was to feature playable versions of Activision <a href="arcade%20game">arcade game</a>s such as "<a href="Pitfall%21">Pitfall!</a>", though the idea was abandoned due to time constraints.

Director Leonard Boyarsky considered the animation system important in the team's choice of the Source engine. The integrated "faceposer" tool allowed Troika to customize facial animations, expressions, gestures and lip-synching, eliminating the need to explain what a character was doing. Every non-player character required a voiceover, which helped Troika define its characters more quickly. The engine had a physics system permitting new features, such as monsters hurling corpses at the player or dying characters realistically crumbling into pieces, instead of requiring pre-built animations. Although Troika had ignored first-person engines due to technical limitations, such as a low <a href="Polygon%20%28computer%20graphics%29">polygon</a> count and limited <a href="texture%20memory">texture memory</a>, as the technology improved, it thought it could create a real-time action game without sacrificing the immersion and story of a role-playing game.

Describing the choice of developing a game based on the existing White Wolf property over creating their own, Boyarsky said that although an original property lacked the constraints of an existing one, the downside was that it had not been tested and could be rejected by its potential audience; an existing property was proven. Troika tried to stay as close as possible to the White Wolf rules, while reducing the number of abilities and disciplines to those relevant to "Bloodlines" gameplay.

Activision introduced the game in May 2003, but in October, Valve experienced a security breach in which hackers stole the source code for "Half-Life 2". The breach required new security implementations for the engine, delaying both games; the release of "Bloodlines" was postponed until early 2005. Until May 2004, Troika and Activision said that the game would feature a multiplayer component and modes including a team of vampires against a team of vampire hunters, with the ability to upgrade characters between each round. The team was left without a producer by Activision for over a year before <a href="David%20Mullich">David Mullich</a> was assigned to the project. With no producer oversight, Mullich found the game's design incomplete, game levels created and abandoned, and several technical issues, including problems with code for the proposed multiplayer option. The Source multiplayer code was in its infancy, increasing its development time, and the idea was abandoned.

In addition to problems with the Source engine, the designers found that the game's scope exceeded their resources. "Bloodlines" has several styles of gameplay, requiring different interfaces, animations and artificial intelligence for stealth and melee combat, and first- or third-person capability. Compared to contemporary first-person shooters, with 10 to 20 animated character models, "Bloodlines" had over 150 characters with 3,000 unique animations, in addition to boss characters, with their own styles of movement. The designers underestimated the length of time required to develop and improve these systems. The game's scope suffered from content <a href="Cruft">not being removed when necessary</a>; other components would be endlessly refined without being finalized, preventing the developers from focusing on other parts of the game system. All content additionally required approval by White Wolf and Activision.

After three years in development, the game was progressing slowly, and it was unknown when it would be finished. Activision set a series of deadlines for the project's development to ensure Troika would have sufficient time to effectively test the game, though these milestones were repeatedly extended, and "Bloodlines" eventually ran over budget. In 2003 Activision intervened, ordering that the game be ready for release in the next few months, and even advancing more money to Troika to complete its work on "<a href="The%20Temple%20of%20Elemental%20Evil%20%28video%20game%29">The Temple of Elemental Evil</a>" for <a href="Atari">Atari</a>, freeing the Troika team to work on "Bloodlines" exclusively. Activision eventually issued an ultimatum that the project be finished within months, on September 15, 2004. Troika delivered a version of "Bloodlines" on the required date; due to its scale, the game underwent three weeks of testing. Activision decided that the game was suitable for release, but was contractually bound to withhold "Bloodlines" until after the debut of "Half-Life 2" in November 2004. Troika convinced Activision to use the delay to fund further development; the additional budget was not enough to pay all of Troika's staff, and some employees worked unpaid to complete the project. This version underwent another three weeks of testing to become the <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle%23Release%20to%20manufacturing%20.28RTM.29">final release code</a>; the game was still unfinished when Activision forced its release. "Bloodlines" creative director <a href="Jason%20Anderson%20%28artist%29">Jason Anderson</a> blamed Activision, saying that the publisher took the game from Troika without providing enough time to test and polish it. Conversely, Boyarsky defended Activision for supporting Troika as the project exceeded its budget and schedule. During the nearly four years of development, Anderson estimated that the team worked overtime for all but two months.

The game's original score was composed and produced by <a href="Rik%20Schaffer">Rik Schaffer</a>. Troika licensed many songs for the game, and posters for real bands are featured on the walls of the game's clubs. The soundtrack was released as a limited edition CD to customers who pre-ordered the game through <a href="Best%20Buy">Best Buy</a>. It features nine tracks by artists including <a href="Daniel%20Ash">Daniel Ash</a>, <a href="Chiasm%20%28musical%20project%29">Chiasm</a>, <a href="Tiamat%20%28band%29">Tiamat</a>, <a href="Darling%20Violetta">Darling Violetta</a>, <a href="Genitorturers">Genitorturers</a>, and <a href="Lacuna%20Coil">Lacuna Coil</a>. "Bloodlines", performed by <a href="Al%20Jourgensen">Al Jourgensen</a> and <a href="Ministry%20%28band%29">Ministry</a>, was composed and performed specifically for the game. The licensed tracks were chosen by Activision without input from Troika. The song <a href="Angel%20%28Massive%20Attack%20song%29">"Angel"</a> by <a href="Massive%20Attack">Massive Attack</a> was used as a <a href="Temp%20track">placeholder</a> on the game's menu screen. Troika was unable to obtain the rights to use the song in the finished game, and tasked Schaffer with creating something similar.

"Vampire: The Masquerade â Bloodlines" was released on November 16, 2004 in competition with "Half-Life 2", "", "<a href="Halo%202">Halo 2</a>", and several other titles. Valve's contract for Troika's use of the Source engine guaranteed that "Bloodlines" could not be released before "Half-Life 2", and could not be introduced to the public until after the announcement of "Half-Life 2", over eighteen months after development began. In February 2004, the game was scheduled for release in spring 2005, partially to avoid competing with "Half-Life 2" and the competitive Christmas period, before Activision moved the date to November 2004. Activision obtained model Erin Layne to play Jeanette in promotional material for the game. Layne worked with "Bloodlines" artist Tim Bradstreet for a day to provide the poses chosen by Activision to represent Jeanette in the game's posters, clothing, and other items.

Despite generally favorable reviews, "Bloodlines" initial release sold 72,000 copies and earned approximately $3.4 million in sales, below Troika's other games, "" (234,000 units, $8.8 million) and " The Temple of Elemental Evil" (128,000 units, $5.2 million). In comparison, "Bloodlines" release competitor "Half-Life 2" had sold 6.5Â million copies by 2008. "Bloodlinesâ" relative failure contributed to the demise of Troika Games.

Shortly after its debut, most of the development staff were laid off; the remaining staff tried to patch "Bloodlines" and develop game concepts to secure funding to keep Troika in business. Troika, unable to obtain further funding from Activision or other publishers, released its employees in two waves: the first in November 2004, followed by the remaining staff in December, except for its three founders Anderson, Boyarsky, and <a href="Tim%20Cain">Tim Cain</a>. Some employees worked without pay to fix the game. When the company closed in February 2005, it had secured no other game development deals. That month, Boyarsky confirmed that Troika had not been working on a patch for the game since most of its staff were gone since December 2004.

In a 2006 interview, Anderson said that although Troika Games' library had been critically well received, consistent technical issues had marred the perception of the company's games, contributing to Troika's difficulty in obtaining new projects. In 2013, Mitsoda said that "Bloodlines" was released at "the worst possible time - most people didn't even know we were outÂ ... fans and the Troika [developers] are always going to wonder what the game could have been like with another six months." In a 2017 interview, Boyarksy echoed Mitsoda's sentiments, saying that a further three to six months of development time could have allowed Troika to address many technical flaws, but he was unsure that they could have resolved larger issues. He said "I feel the second half of the game isn't as good as the first. I feel like we devolved into relying too much on combat at the end." Boyarsky noted that it was impossible to know if the fixes would have made "Bloodlines" more successful, or if it would have remained a niche product. He said "it might have been too early for people to appreciate it, but we'll never know." The game fared better following its release on Valve's <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> digital distribution service in March 2007, where, as of 2015, it has sold 492,000 copies.

<a href="Unofficial%20patch">Unofficial patch</a>es have been created by the game's fans to address "Bloodlines" technical problems, and restore missing and incomplete content. After experiencing problems with the first versions of an unofficial patch created by Dan Upright, analytical chemist Werner Spahl continued patching the game from version 1.2 with permission and instructions. The game community tested Spahl's patches, providing reports on bugs and spelling errors. Although the game's complexity meant that repairing one aspect often broke another, as work on the patches progressed Spahl began restoring removed and incomplete content in the game files, adding quests, items, weapons, and characters, with fan help to provide voice acting, models, and reinstating whole levels. Spahl contacted former Troika staff for insight into their intentions for cut content. A library area, for example, was restored after Mitsoda told Spahl only that "it was somehow connected to a main character and a Sabbat boss, and was meant to look like the real-world [Los Angeles] library." A fan traveled to the real library to gather notes on its layout, and co-developed the in-game area with Spahl. Schaffer also provided Spahl with unreleased scores from the game. The changes altered the original game so much that Spahl was criticized by some of the game's fans. This resulted in two patch versions: a basic version, fixing the game's technical issues, and a "plus" version with the additional content. As of 2016, the game has over 10 years of post-release support with the release of versions 9.x of the patch, which are also included in the version of the game sold on the <a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a> distribution service.

Boyarsky voiced his support for unofficial patches, saying "they've found the stuff that we hoped people would find about the game, in terms of the different paths you can take and how it played differently for every class." Boyarsky said that while he would have preferred that the game was more successful at launch, that people were still playing and modifying it made Troika's efforts feel more "worthwhile".

"Vampire: The Masquerade â Bloodlines" received a mixed response, with reviewers praising its writing and presentation and criticizing its technical problems. The aggregating review website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> provides a score of 80 out of 100 (based on 61 reviews).

The game has been called a flawed masterpiece by critics. The scale and variety of choice and effect was highlighted by reviewers as "Bloodlines" greatest success, including the variety of clans, with specific dialog options, and the specific reactions from other characters, each with their own clan loyalty and bias. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> called it a nearly flawless classic role-playing game; "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described it as brilliant but unfinished. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> praised its "effortlessly intelligent" script, saying that "no other game has come close. Nothing's even tried". VideoGamer.com opined that at its best, "Bloodlines" stands among the greatest RPGs of the preceding five years, although its technical problems should be remembered. According to HonestGamers, the game "may not be polished and may end with a sigh instead of a shout, but for its ambition alone it deserves stream after stream of compliments." Reviewers compared it to other successful role-playing games, including "<a href="Fallout%20%28series%29">Fallout</a>", "", "", "", "", and "<a href="Deus%20Ex%20%28video%20game%29">Deus Ex</a>"; Eurogamer described "Bloodlines" as "Deus Ex" with vampires.

<a href="IGN">IGN</a> appreciated "Bloodlines" rewarding exploration outside the main story, and the "New York Times" and GameSpy praised its "wonderfully imaginative" missions. Reviewers noted that later parts of the game were disappointing, delivering repetitive combat-focused missions with regenerating enemies, abandoning dialog and stealth and punishing players who build characters with more social skills than combat abilities. GameSpy said that it had never seen a role-playing game so affected by player actions with everything, from clan choice and character build to actions in missions, influencing future options and dialog.

Its writing was consistently praised by reviewers. The narrative was considered deep, successfully using White Wolf's "Vampire: The Masquerade" content. Eurogamer said that it had the best script the website had ever seen in a video game, and others described it as a superbly crafted tale of conspiracies, underworld subterfuge, fun and intrigue. Reviewers appreciated the use of adult themes, such as sex and death, in the storyline of a contemporary video game, which no other games had tackled with similar effectiveness. The mature themes succeeded without being gratuitous or exploitative, and were explored honestly and intelligently by a knowledgeable writer. The game's characters were praised for their memorable, developed personalities, with most major characters possessing their own backstory and presented as living people instead of ciphers. Its ending had a mixed response, with some reviewers appreciating their ability to choose one of the game's four endings (adding an incentive to replay the game) and others considering the ending anti-climatic.

<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> and GameSpy called the dialog sharply written, with many memorable lines. Eurogamer noted that the characters' frequent use of vulgar language worked; written as real people, such language fit their character rather than giving the game an adult veneer. The website appreciated the breadth of dialog options, allowing the player greater control of how to play their character. "<a href="PC%20Zone">PC Zone</a>" opined that the quantity of well-written dialog did not guarantee quality; many player choices seemed to have little effect on a conversation's outcome, and the best response was often the most obvious. The voice acting was repeatedly praised for the actors' quality and the amount of voice work, due to the many dialog options.

Much of "Bloodlines" criticism focused on technical problems when it was released, undermining the game experience or making it unplayable. Several reviewers noted errors which closed the game and typographical errors in on-screen text. Others cited frequent, sometimes-lengthy load times encountered while moving between hubs and entering or exiting buildings and areas. GameSpot called the game's artificial intelligence poor, often causing enemies to rush at an armed player, fire at them from too great a distance to be effective or become immobilized while waiting for the player's next attack. IGN noted that stealth broke the AI, allowing traps to be triggered and leaving the assailants standing still, unable to locate a hidden player. GameSpy said that the Source engine was "Bloodlines" greatest weakness; although the RPG aspects were the game's strong suit, features of the Source engine, such as first-person shooting, were where it stumbled.

Combat was also criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, complaining that "Bloodlines" favors melee combat; firearms were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. "PC Zone", however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons on a first attempt after the repeated failure to do so with a gun. The "New York Times" found the unavoidable combat in the last part of the game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.

In 2004, IGN named "Bloodlines" the Best PC RPG of that year and GameSpy called the "Ocean House Hotel" quest the Level of the Year. In 2005, "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" called it the Role Playing Game of 2004, saying that it offered "a deep, balanced character creation system, a truckload of interesting quests, a good story and great NPCs to interact with." "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" nominated "Bloodlines" for its 2004 "Best Writing" award, which ultimately went to "<a href="Half-Life%202">Half-Life 2</a>".

"Bloodlines" is considered a <a href="Cult%20following">cult classic</a>. Retrospective critiques continue to praise the game's narrative and degree of choice. In 2009, an article in Rock, Paper, Shotgun declared: "The sense of sorrow comes from the realisation that there's nothing like ["Bloodlines"] on the horizonÂ ... why should there be so few games like this? Oh right, because it's so very hard to doÂ ... the lack of games comparable to "Bloodlines" is one of the great tragedies of our time." "Eurogamer" called the game inspirational, with an unmatched level of narrative detail. In 2010, "<a href="The%20Escapist%20%28magazine%29">The Escapist</a>" called "Bloodlines" a flawed masterpiece which could have been a genuine masterpiece with more time, money and staff; although great games may inspire awe, it instead created a devoted fan base which continued to develop the game.

In 2006, "PC Zone" listed "Bloodlines" the seventh-best PC game which people were unlikely to have played, calling it the "best buggy game ever released". In 2007, the game was 80th on "<a href="Computer%20%26amp%3B%20Video%20Games">Computer & Video Games</a>" list of its top 100 games, and 86th on "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>"s 2014 list of the same; it also appeared in "PC Gamer"s 2015 edition (moving to 63rd), and the 2017 edition (moving to 42nd). In 2008, <a href="bit-tech">bit-tech</a> listed Jeanette as the second-best non-player video game character. In 2011, <a href="Rock%2C%20Paper%2C%20Shotgun">Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a> called "Bloodlines" one of the most important PC games of all time ("it signposts a direction to a future of games that we were denied"), listing it as one of the 122 Best PC Games Ever. Cinema Blend called it one of the most underappreciated games of the decade. In 2011, "<a href="Official%20Xbox%20Magazine">Official Xbox Magazine</a>" called it one of the ten PC franchises it wanted on the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> console. In 2013, "PC Gamer" named it one of the 100 Best Horror Games on PC, and PCGamesN called it the seventh-best PC role-playing game. In 2014, "Bloodlines" was 90th in "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>"s readers' poll of the 100 Greatest Video Games of All Time, and "<a href="Maximum%20PC">Maximum PC</a>" chose it as one of the games they wanted to be remastered for contemporary game systems. In 2015, Rock, Paper, Shotgun listed "Bloodlines" as the PC's 19th Best RPG and 15th Best Horror Game. In 2017, the game was listed 42nd on IGN's list of the Top 100 RPGs of all Time, "Den of Geek" named it one of the 20 Video Games that Deserve Remakes, and "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>" named it one of the best role playing games of all time.

In a November 2004 interview Boyarsky said that although the team would like to pursue a "Bloodlines" sequel, the decision was Activision's. Before their closure, Troika had begun development of a workable prototype based on White Wolf's other role-playing game, "", set in the same universe as "Vampire: The Masquerade". According to Boyarsky, the prototype was one small area built using assets taken from "Bloodlines", and allowed the player to play as a Werewolf, or a human capable of turning into one.

<a href="Paradox%20Interactive">Paradox Interactive</a> obtained the rights to "Bloodlines" in 2015, following their purchase of White Wolf. Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester confirmed that a sequel was possible, stating "when the time is right I guess a sequel will find its place in the market."

Rainbow trout

The rainbow trout ("Oncorhynchus mykiss") is a <a href="trout">trout</a> and species of <a href="salmonid">salmonid</a> native to cold-water <a href="tributary">tributaries</a> of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America. The steelhead (sometimes called "steelhead trout") is an <a href="Fish%20migration%23Classification">anadromous</a> (sea-run) form of the coastal rainbow trout or <a href="Columbia%20River%20redband%20trout">Columbia River redband trout</a> that usually returns to fresh water to <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawn</a> after living two to three years in the ocean. Freshwater forms that have been <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced</a> into the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and migrate into tributaries to spawn are also called steelhead.

Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between , while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach . Coloration varies widely based on <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, forms and <a href="habitat">habitat</a>. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the <a href="lateral%20line">lateral line</a>, from <a href="gill">gill</a>s to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.

Wild-caught and <a href="Fish%20hatchery">hatchery</a>-reared forms of this species have been transplanted and introduced for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States (U.S.), <a href="Southern%20Europe">Southern Europe</a>, Australia, New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as <a href="whirling%20disease">whirling disease</a>), or <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridizing</a> with closely related species and subspecies, thus reducing genetic purity. The rainbow trout is included in the <a href="List%20of%20globally%20invasive%20species">list of the top 100 globally invasive species</a>. Nonetheless, other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created <a href="Recreational%20fishing">sport fisheries</a> such as the Great Lakes and <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>'s <a href="Firehole%20River">Firehole River</a>.

Some local populations of specific subspecies, or in the case of steelhead, <a href="distinct%20population%20segment">distinct population segment</a>s, are listed as either <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> or <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> under the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. The steelhead is the official <a href="state%20fish">state fish</a> of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>.

The <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">scientific name</a> of the rainbow trout is . The species was originally named by German <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a> and <a href="taxonomist">taxonomist</a> <a href="Johann%20Julius%20Walbaum">Johann Julius Walbaum</a> in 1792 based on <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimens</a> from the <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a> in Siberia. Walbaum's original species name, "mykiss", was derived from the local <a href="Chukotko-Kamchatkan%20languages">Kamchatkan</a> name used for the fish, "mykizha". The name of the genus is from the Greek "onkos" ("hook") and "rynchos" ("nose"), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the "<a href="kype">kype</a>").

<a href="John%20Richardson%20%28naturalist%29">Sir John Richardson</a>, a Scottish naturalist, named a specimen of this species in 1836 to honor Meredith Gairdner, a <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> surgeon at <a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a> on the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> who provided Richardson with specimens. In 1855, William P. Gibbons, the curator of Geology and Mineralogy at the <a href="California%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">California Academy of Sciences</a>, found a population and named it (Latin: rainbow), later corrected to . These names faded once it was determined that Walbaum's description of type specimens was <a href="Conspecificity">conspecific</a> and therefore had <a href="Principle%20of%20Priority">precedence</a>. In 1989, morphological and genetic studies indicated that trout of the <a href="Pacific%20basin">Pacific basin</a> were genetically closer to Pacific salmon ("<a href="Oncorhynchus">Oncorhynchus</a>" species) than to the "<a href="Salmo">Salmo</a>s" â <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a> or <a href="Atlantic%20salmon">Atlantic salmon</a> of the <a href="Atlantic%20basin">Atlantic basin</a>. Thus, in 1989, taxonomic authorities moved the rainbow, <a href="Cutthroat%20trout">cutthroat</a> and other Pacific basin trout into the genus "Oncorhynchus". Walbaum's name had precedence, so the species name became the scientific name of the rainbow trout. The previous species names "irideus" and "gairdneri" were adopted as subspecies names for the coastal rainbow and Columbia River redband trout, respectively. <a href="Fish%20migration%23Classification">Anadromous forms</a> of the coastal rainbow trout or <a href="redband%20trout">redband trout</a> are commonly known as steelhead.

Subspecies of are listed below as described by fisheries biologist <a href="Robert%20J.%20Behnke">Robert J. Behnke</a> (2002).
Resident freshwater rainbow trout adults average between in riverine environments, while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach . Coloration varies widely between regions and subspecies. Adult freshwater forms are generally blue-green or olive green with heavy black spotting over the length of the body. Adult fish have a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most pronounced in breeding males. The <a href="caudal%20fin">caudal fin</a> is squarish and only mildly forked. Lake-dwelling and anadromous forms are usually more silvery in color with the reddish stripe almost completely gone. Juvenile rainbow trout display parr marks (dark vertical bars) typical of most salmonid juveniles. In some redband and golden trout forms parr marks are typically retained into adulthood. Some coastal rainbow trout and Columbia River redband trout populations and <a href="cutbow">cutbow</a> hybrids may also display reddish or pink throat markings similar to cutthroat trout. In many regions, hatchery-bred trout can be distinguished from native trout via fin clips. Fin clipping the <a href="adipose%20fin">adipose fin</a> is a management tool used to identify hatchery-reared fish.

Rainbow trout, including steelhead forms, generally spawn in early to late spring (January to June in the Northern Hemisphere and September to November in the Southern Hemisphere) when water temperatures reach at least . The maximum recorded lifespan for a rainbow trout is 11Â years.

Freshwater resident rainbow trout usually inhabit and spawn in small to moderately large, well oxygenated, shallow rivers with <a href="gravel">gravel</a> bottoms. They are native to the <a href="River%23Topographical%20classification">alluvial</a> or freestone streams that are typical tributaries of the Pacific basin, but introduced rainbow trout have established wild, self-sustaining populations in other river types such as <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> and <a href="spring%20creek">spring creek</a>s. Lake resident rainbow trout are usually found in moderately deep, cool lakes with adequate shallows and vegetation to support production of sufficient food sources. Lake populations generally require access to gravelly bottomed streams to be self-sustaining.

Spawning sites are usually a bed of fine gravel in a <a href="riffle">riffle</a> above a pool. A female trout clears a <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29%23Brood%20hiders">redd</a> in the gravel by turning on her side and beating her tail up and down. Female rainbow trout usually produce 2000 to 3000 eggs per kilogram of weight. During spawning, the eggs fall into spaces between the gravel, and immediately the female begins digging at the upstream edge of the nest, covering the eggs with the displaced gravel. As eggs are released by the female, a male moves alongside and deposits milt (sperm) over the eggs to fertilize them. The eggs usually hatch in about four to seven weeks although the time of hatching varies greatly with region and habitat. Newly hatched trout are called sac fry or <a href="Juvenile%20fish%23Juvenile%20salmon">alevin</a>. In approximately two weeks, the <a href="yolk%20sac">yolk sac</a> is completely consumed and <a href="Fry%20%28biology%29">fry</a> commence feeding mainly on <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a>. The growth rate of rainbow trout is variable with area, habitat, life history and quality and quantity of food. As fry grow, they begin to develop "parr" marks or dark vertical bars on their sides. In this juvenile stage, immature trout are often called "parr" because of the marks. These small juvenile trout are sometimes called fingerlings because they are approximately the size of a human finger. In streams where rainbow trout are stocked for sport fishing but no natural reproduction occurs, some of the stocked trout may survive and grow or "carryover" for several seasons before they are caught or perish.

The oceangoing (anadromous) form, including those returning for spawning, are known as steelhead in Canada and the U.S. In <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> they are commercially propagated in <a href="Aquaculture%20of%20salmon%23Sea%20cages">sea cages</a> and are known as ocean trout, although they are the same species.

Like <a href="salmon">salmon</a>, steelhead return to their original hatching grounds to <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawn</a>. Similar to Atlantic salmon, but unlike their Pacific "Oncorhynchus" salmonid kin, steelhead are <a href="iteroparous">iteroparous</a> (able to spawn several times, each time separated by months) and make several spawning trips between fresh and salt water, although fewer than 10Â percent of native spawning adults survive from one spawning to another. The survival rate for introduced populations in the Great Lakes is as high as 70Â percent. As young steelhead transition from freshwater to saltwater, a process called "<a href="smoltification">smoltification</a>" occurs where the trout undergoes physiological changes to allow it to survive in sea water. There are genetic differences between freshwater and steelhead populations that may account for the smoltification in steelheads.

Juvenile steelhead may remain in the river for one to three years before smolting and migrating to sea. Individual steelhead populations leave the ocean and <a href="Fish%20migration">migrate</a> into their freshwater spawning tributaries at different times of the year. Two general forms existâ"summer-run steelhead" and "winter-run steelhead". Summer-run fish leave the ocean between May and October, before their reproductive organs are fully mature. They mature in fresh water while en route to spawning grounds where they spawn in the spring. Summer-run fish generally spawn in longer, more inland rivers such as the Columbia River. Winter-run fish are ready to spawn when they leave the ocean, typically between November and April, and spawn shortly after returning to fresh water. Winter-run fish generally spawn in shorter, coastal rivers typically found along the <a href="Olympic%20Peninsula">Olympic Peninsula</a> and British Columbia coastline, and summer-run fish are found in some shorter, coastal streams. Once steelhead enter riverine systems and reach suitable spawning grounds, they spawn just like resident freshwater rainbow trout.
Rainbow trout are predators with a varied diet and will eat nearly anything they can capture. They are not as <a href="Piscivore">piscivorous</a> or aggressive as brown trout or <a href="Salvelinus">chars</a>. Rainbow trout, including juvenile steelhead in fresh water, routinely feed on <a href="larva">larva</a>l, <a href="pupa">pupa</a>l and adult forms of aquatic insects (typically <a href="Caddisfly">caddisflies</a>, <a href="Plecoptera">stoneflies</a>, <a href="mayflies">mayflies</a> and aquatic <a href="fly">diptera</a>). They also eat fish eggs and adult forms of terrestrial insects (typically ants, beetles, grasshoppers and crickets) that fall into the water. Other prey include small fish up to one-third of their length, <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a>, shrimp, and other <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s. As rainbow trout grow, the proportion of fish consumed increases in most populations. Some lake-dwelling forms may become <a href="plankton">plankton</a>ic feeders. In rivers and streams populated with other salmonid species, rainbow trout eat varied fish eggs, including those of salmon, brown and cutthroat trout, <a href="mountain%20whitefish">mountain whitefish</a> and the eggs of other rainbow trout. Rainbows also consume decomposing flesh from carcasses of other fish. Adult steelhead in the ocean feed primarily on other fish, <a href="squid">squid</a> and <a href="Amphipoda">amphipods</a>.

The native range of is in the coastal waters and tributary streams of the Pacific basin, from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, east along the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, throughout southwest Alaska, the Pacific coast of British Columbia and southeast Alaska, and south along the west coast of the U.S. to northern Mexico. It is claimed that the Mexican forms of represent the southernmost native range of any trout or salmon ("Salmonidae"), though the Formosan landlocked salmon () in Asia inhabits a similar latitude. The range of coastal rainbow trout extends north from the Pacific basin into tributaries of the <a href="Bering%20Sea">Bering Sea</a> in northwest Alaska, while forms of the Columbia River redband trout extend east into the upper <a href="Mackenzie%20River">Mackenzie River</a> and <a href="Peace%20River">Peace River</a> watersheds in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, which eventually drain into the <a href="Beaufort%20Sea">Beaufort Sea</a>, part of the Arctic Ocean. Since 1875, the rainbow trout has been widely introduced into suitable <a href="Lake">lacustrine</a> and riverine environments throughout the United States and around the world. Many of these introductions have established wild, self-sustaining populations.

Since 1870, rainbow trout have been artificially propagated in <a href="hatchery">fish hatcheries</a> to restock streams and to introduce them into non-native waters. The first rainbow trout hatchery was established on <a href="San%20Leandro%20Creek">San Leandro Creek</a>, a tributary of <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>, in 1870, and trout production began in 1871. The hatchery was stocked with the locally native rainbow trout, and likely steelhead of the coastal rainbow trout subspecies . The fish raised in this hatchery were shipped to hatcheries out of state for the first time in 1875, to <a href="Caledonia%2C%20New%20York">Caledonia, New York</a>, and then in 1876 to <a href="Northville%2C%20Michigan">Northville, Michigan</a>. In 1877, another California rainbow trout hatchery, the first federal fish hatchery in the <a href="National%20Fish%20Hatchery%20System">National Fish Hatchery System</a>, was established on Campbell Creek, a <a href="McCloud%20River">McCloud River</a> tributary. The McCloud River hatchery indiscriminately mixed coastal rainbow trout eggs with the eggs of local <a href="McCloud%20River%20redband%20trout">McCloud River redband trout</a> . Eggs from the McCloud hatchery were also provided to the San Leandro hatchery, thus making the origin and genetic history of hatchery-bred rainbow trout somewhat diverse and complex. In the U.S., there are hundreds of hatcheries operated by the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> and various state agencies and <a href="Tribal%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">tribal government</a>s propagating rainbow trout for conservation and recreational sport fishing. Six of ten Canadian provinces have rainbow trout farms, with <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> leading production.

Rainbow trout are <a href="fish%20farming">commercially farmed</a> in many countries throughout the world. The practice began in the late 19th century, and since the 1950s commercial production has grown dramatically. Worldwide, in 2007, of farmed rainbow trout were harvested with a value of about US $2.6Â billion. The largest producer is Chile. In Chile and Norway, sea cage production of steelhead has expanded to supply export markets. Inland production of rainbow trout to supply domestic markets has increased in countries such as Italy, France, Germany, Denmark and Spain. Other significant trout-producing countries include the U.S., Iran, the United Kingdom, and <a href="Lesotho">Lesotho</a>. While the U.S. rainbow trout industry as a whole is viewed as ecologically responsible, trout raised elsewhere are not necessarily farmed with the same methods.

About three-quarters of U.S. production comes from Idaho, particularly the <a href="Snake%20River">Snake River</a> area, due in part to the quality and temperature of the water available there. California and Washington also produce significant numbers of farmed trout. In the east, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a> and West Virginia have farming operations. Rainbow trout farming is one of the largest finfish aquaculture industries in the U.S. They are raised inland in facilities where raceways or ponds have continuously flowing water with little pollution and a low risk of escape. The U.S. industry is noted for using <a href="Best%20practice">best management practices</a>. Imports constitute only about 15Â percent of farmed rainbows sold in the U.S., and nearly all domestic production is consumed within the country; very little is exported. The U.S. produces about 7Â percent of the world's farmed trout. Rainbow trout, especially those raised in farms and hatcheries, are susceptible to <a href="enteric%20redmouth%20disease">enteric redmouth disease</a>. A considerable amount of research has been conducted on redmouth disease, given its serious implications for rainbow trout farming. The disease does not infect humans.

Populations of many rainbow trout subspecies, including anadromous forms (steelhead) of (coastal rainbow trout) and (Columbia River redband trout) have declined in their native ranges due to over-harvest, habitat loss, disease, <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>, pollution and hybridization with other subspecies, and some introduced populations, once healthy, have declined for the same reasons. As a consequence, some rainbow populations, particularly anadromous forms within their native range, have been classified as <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a>, <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> or species of special concern by federal or state agencies. Rainbow trout, and subspecies thereof, are currently a <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a>-approved indicator species for acute fresh water <a href="toxicity">toxicity</a> testing.

Many non-profit organizations have formed to protect, conserve and restore native rainbow trout and steelhead populations. Generally, in partnership with various universities, state, federal and tribal agencies and private interests, these organizations sponsor projects to restore habitat, prevent habitat loss and promote awareness of threats to native trout populations. 
<a href="Trout%20Unlimited">Trout Unlimited</a> (TU) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of North American freshwater streams, rivers, and associated upland habitats for trout, salmon, other aquatic species and people. A typical TU project is the Circle Creek Fish Passage Project, in which access to a spawning stream is being improved for steelhead and other salmonid species. The <a href="Wild%20Salmon%20Center">Wild Salmon Center</a>, an international coalition of Russian, Canadian and U.S. scientists, sponsors the Kamchatka Steelhead Project, a 20-year (1994â2014) scientific program to study and conserve the present condition of Kamchatkan steelhead ("mikizha"), a species listed in the <a href="Red%20Data%20Book%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">"Red Data Book of Russia"</a>. Other high-profile organizations involved in rainbow trout conservation include <a href="California%20Trout">California Trout</a>, which protects wild trout and other salmonids in the waters of California. The Steelhead Society of British Columbia promotes the wellbeing of wild salmonids in British Columbia. In 1997, a group of approximately 40 ichthyologists, biologists and naturalists from several U.S. and Mexican institutions formed a collaborative groupâTruchas Mexicanasâto study the diversity of <a href="Mexican%20native%20trout">Mexican native trout</a>, most of which are considered subspecies of .

Rainbow trout, primarily hatchery-raised fish of the coastal rainbow trout subspecies introduced into waters inhabited with cutthroat trout, will breed with cutthroats and produce fertile hybrids called cutbows. In the case of the <a href="westslope%20cutthroat%20trout">westslope cutthroat trout</a> ("O. clarki lewisi"), hybridization with introduced rainbow and <a href="Yellowstone%20cutthroat%20trout">Yellowstone cutthroat trout</a> ("O. clarki bouvieri") is threatening the westslope cutthroat trout with <a href="Genomics">genomic</a> <a href="extinction">extinction</a>. Such introductions into the ranges of redband trout have severely reduced the range of pure stocks of these subspecies, making them "species of concern" in their respective ranges.

Within the range of the Kern River golden trout of Southern California, hatchery-bred rainbows introduced into the Kern River have diluted the genetic purity of the <a href="Kern%20River%20rainbow%20trout">Kern River rainbow trout</a> and <a href="golden%20trout">golden trout</a> through intraspecific breeding. The <a href="Beardslee%20trout">Beardslee trout</a>, , a genetically unique lake-dwelling variety of the coastal rainbow trout that is isolated in <a href="Lake%20Crescent">Lake Crescent</a> (Washington), is threatened by the loss of its only spawning grounds in the <a href="Lyre%20River">Lyre River</a> to <a href="siltation">siltation</a> and other types of habitat degradation.

 is a <a href="myxosporea">myxosporea</a>n <a href="parasite">parasite</a> of salmonids (salmon, trout, and their allies) that causes whirling disease in pen farmed salmon and trout and also in <a href="Wild%20fisheries">wild fish populations</a>. It was first described in rainbow trout introduced to Germany a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of Europe, northern Asia, the U.S., South Africa and other countries. In the 1980s, was found to require "<a href="Tubifex%20tubifex">Tubifex tubifex</a>" (a kind of <a href="segmented%20worm">segmented worm</a>) to complete its <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life cycle</a>. The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with <a href="polar%20filament">polar filament</a>s ejected from <a href="nematocyst">nematocyst</a>-like capsules.

This parasite was originally a mild pathogen of <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a> in central Europe and other salmonids in northeast Asia, and the spread of the rainbow trout has greatly increased its impact. Having no innate <a href="Immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a> to , rainbow trout are particularly susceptible, and can release so many spores that even more resistant species in the same area, such as , can become overloaded with parasites and incur mortalities of 80 to 90Â percent. Where has become well-established, it has caused decline or even elimination of whole <a href="Taxonomic%20rank%23All%20ranks">cohorts</a> of fish.

The parasite was first recorded in North America in 1956 in Pennsylvania, but until the 1990s whirling disease was considered a manageable problem only affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. It eventually became established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (<a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, Wyoming, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>), where it is damaging several sport fishing rivers. Some streams in the western U.S. lost 90Â percent of their trout. Whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which is important for the tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, in 2005 anglers in Montana spent approximately $196,000,000 in activities directly related to trout fishing in the state. Some of the salmonids that infects (<a href="bull%20trout">bull trout</a>, cutthroat trout, and anadromous forms of rainbow troutâsteelhead) are already threatened or endangered, and the parasite could worsen their population decline.

The <a href="New%20Zealand%20mud%20snail">New Zealand mud snail</a> , once <a href="endemism">endemic</a> to New Zealand, has spread widely and has become <a href="Naturalisation%20%28biology%29">naturalised</a> and an invasive species in many areas including Australia, Tasmania, Asia (Japan, in the Garmat Ali River in Iraq since 2008), Europe (since 1859 in England), and North America (U.S. and Canada: <a href="Thunder%20Bay%20%28Ontario%20landform%29">Thunder Bay</a> in Ontario since 2001, British Columbia since July 2007), most likely inadvertently during human activity. It can reach concentrations greater than , endangering the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a> by outcompeting native snails and water insects for food, leading to sharp declines in native populations. There is evidence North American fishes are unable to digest the tiny but hard shells of the mud snail, and that their presence may result in poor growth outcomes for rainbow trout.

The mud snail was first detected in the U.S. in Idaho's Snake River in 1987. Since then, the snail has spread to the <a href="Madison%20River">Madison River</a>, Firehole River, and other watercourses around Yellowstone National Park, and has been discovered throughout the western U.S. The exact means of transmission is unknown, but it is likely that it was introduced in water transferred with live <a href="game%20fish">game fish</a> and has been spread by <a href="ship%20ballast">ship ballast</a> or contaminated recreational equipment such as wading gear.

, commonly known as didymo or rock snot, is a species of <a href="diatom">diatom</a> that produces nuisance growths in freshwater rivers and streams with consistently cold water temperatures. In New Zealand, invasive didymo can form large mats on the bottom of rivers and streams in late winter. It is not considered a significant human health risk, but it can affect stream habitats and sources of food for fish, including rainbow trout, and make recreational activities unpleasant. Even though it is native in North America, it is considered a nuisance organism or invasive species.

Enteric redmouth disease is a <a href="bacterial%20infection">bacterial infection</a> of freshwater and marine fish caused by the pathogen . It is primarily found in rainbow trout and other cultured <a href="salmonids">salmonids</a>. The disease is characterized by <a href="Subcutaneous%20tissue">subcutaneous</a> hemorrhaging of the mouth, fins, and eyes. It is most commonly seen in fish farms with poor water quality. Redmouth disease was first discovered in Idaho rainbow trout in the 1950s.

Some fisheries are focused on removing rainbow trout in order to reestablish native trout populations. This can be done by poisoning rivers with chemicals such as <a href="antimycin">antimycin</a> or <a href="rotenone">rotenone</a> which have been declared safe in the USA by the <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>. Once the chemicals have dissipated, native trout are released into the river. Another method is to use <a href="electrofishing">electrofishing</a> which enable the fish to be caught alive and harvested or re-located. This technique has been used in the Great Smokey Mountains National Park to rid it of rainbow trout that were introduced in the 1930s and have thrived ever since. They are hoping to re-establish native brook trout in at least some of the 2100-mile river system. Neither method of control is 100% effective and are best regarded as methods to change the relative population sizes of fish species.

Steelhead populations in parts of its native range have declined due to a variety of human and natural causes. While populations in Alaska and along the British Columbia coast are considered healthy, populations in Kamchatka and some populations along the U.S. west coast are in decline.
The U.S. <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> has 15 identified <a href="distinct%20population%20segment">distinct population segment</a>s (DPS)s, in <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, and <a href="California">California</a>. Eleven of these DPSs are listed under the U.S. <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>, ten as threatened and one as endangered. One DPS on the Oregon Coast is designated a U.S. <a href="Species%20of%20Concern">Species of Concern</a>.

The <a href="Southern%20California%20Steelhead%20DPS">Southern California DPS</a>, which was listed as endangered in 2011, has been affected by habitat loss due to dams, confinement of streams in concrete channels, <a href="water%20pollution">water pollution</a>, groundwater pumping, <a href="urban%20heat%20island">urban heat island</a> effects, and other byproducts of <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a>. Steelhead in the Kamchatka Peninsula are threatened by over-harvest, particularly from <a href="poaching">poaching</a> and potential development, and are listed in the "Red Data Book of Russia" that documents rare and endangered species.

Several studies have shown that almost all California coastal steelhead are of native origin, despite over a century of hatchery stocking. Genetic analysis shows that the South Central California Coast DPS and Southern California DPS from <a href="Malibu%20Creek">Malibu Creek</a> north, and including the <a href="San%20Gabriel%20River%20%28California%29">San Gabriel River</a>, <a href="Santa%20Ana%20River">Santa Ana River</a> and <a href="San%20Mateo%20Creek%20%28Southern%20California%29">San Mateo Creek</a>, are not hatchery strains. Steelhead from <a href="Topanga%20Creek">Topanga Creek</a> and the <a href="Sweetwater%20River%20%28California%29">Sweetwater River</a> were partly, and those from <a href="San%20Juan%20Creek">San Juan Creek</a> completely, of hatchery origin. Genetic analysis has also shown that the steelhead in the streams of the <a href="Santa%20Clara%20County%2C%20California">Santa Clara County</a> and <a href="Monterey%20Bay">Monterey Bay</a> basins are not of hatchery origin, including the <a href="Coyote%20Creek%20%28Santa%20Clara%20County%29">Coyote Creek</a>, <a href="Guadalupe%20River%20%28California%29">Guadalupe River</a>, <a href="Pajaro%20River">Pajaro River</a>, <a href="Permanente%20Creek">Permanente Creek</a>, <a href="Stevens%20Creek%20%28California%29">Stevens Creek</a>, <a href="San%20Francisquito%20Creek">San Francisquito Creek</a>, <a href="San%20Lorenzo%20River">San Lorenzo River</a>, and <a href="San%20Tomas%20Aquino%20Creek">San Tomas Aquino Creek</a> basins. Natural waterfalls and two major dams have isolated <a href="Russian%20River%20%28California%29">Russian River</a> steelhead from freshwater rainbow trout forms above the impassable barriers; a 2007 genetic study of fin samples collected from steelhead at 20 different sites both above and below passage barriers in the watershed found that although 30Â million hatchery trout were stocked in the river from 1911 to 1925, the steelhead remain of native and not hatchery origin.

Releases of conventionally reared hatchery steelhead pose ecological risks to wild steelhead populations. Hatchery steelhead are typically larger than the wild forms and can displace wild-form juveniles from optimal habitats. Dominance of hatchery steelhead for optimal microhabitats within streams may reduce wild steelhead survival as a result of reduced foraging opportunity and increased rates of predation.

Rainbow trout and steelhead are highly regarded game fish. Rainbow trout are a popular target for <a href="fly%20fishing">fly fishers</a>, and several <a href="angling">angling</a> methods are used. The use of <a href="Fishing%20lure">lures</a> presented via spinning, casting or trolling techniques is common. Rainbow trout can also be caught on various <a href="live%20food">live</a> and dead natural baits. The <a href="International%20Game%20Fish%20Association">International Game Fish Association</a> recognizes the world record for rainbow trout as a fish caught on <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>'s <a href="Lake%20Diefenbaker">Lake Diefenbaker</a> by Sean Konrad on SeptemberÂ 5, 2009. The fish weighed and was a genetically modified hatchery escapee. Many anglers consider the rainbow trout the hardest-fighting trout species, as this fish is known for leaping when hooked and putting up a powerful struggle. It is considered one of the top five sport fish in North America and the most important game fish west of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>.

There are tribal commercial fisheries for steelhead in <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a>, the Washington coast and in the Columbia River, but there has been controversy regarding over-harvesting of native stocks.

The highly desirable sporting qualities and adaptability of the rainbow trout to hatchery rearing and new habitats resulted in it being introduced to many countries around the world by or at the behest of sport fishermen. Many of these introductions have resulted in environmental and ecological problems, as the introduced rainbow trout disrupt local ecosystems and outcompete or eat indigenous fishes. Other introductions to support sport angling in waters either devoid of fish or with seriously depleted native stocks have created world-class fisheries such as in the Firehole River in Yellowstone National Park, and in the Great Lakes. 

Rainbow trout is popular in Western cuisine; both wild-caught and farmed fish are eaten. It has tender flesh and a mild, somewhat nutty flavor. Wild fish has a stronger, gamier taste than farmed fish. While the taste of wild-caught trout is often promoted as superior, rainbow trout and "steelhead" sold in American restaurants is farmed. Farmed rainbow are considered one of the safest fish to eat and are noted for high levels of <a href="B%20vitamins">vitamin B</a> and a generally appealing flavor. <a href="Seafood%20Watch">Seafood Watch</a> ranks farmed rainbow as a "Best Choice" fish for human consumption. In Montana, it is illegal to sell or market wild-caught rainbow trout, which are legally classified as game fish.

The color and flavor of the flesh depends on the diet and freshness of the trout. Farmed trout and some populations of wild trout, especially anadromous steelhead, have reddish or orange flesh as a result of high <a href="astaxanthin">astaxanthin</a> levels in their diets. Astaxanthin is a powerful <a href="antioxidant">antioxidant</a> that may be from a natural source or a synthetic trout feed. Rainbow trout raised to have pinker flesh from a diet high in astaxanthin are sometimes sold in the U.S. with labeling calling them "steelhead". As wild steelhead are in decline in some parts of their range, farmed rainbow are viewed as a preferred alternative. In Chile and Norway, rainbow trout farmed in saltwater sea cages are sold labeled as steelhead.

Trout can be cooked as soon as they are cleaned, without scaling, skinning or filleting. If cooked with the skin on, the meat tends to hold together better. While trout sold commercially in Europe is often prepared and served this way, most trout sold commercially in the U.S. have had heads removed and have been fully or partially deboned and filleted. Medium to heavy bodied white wines, such as <a href="chardonnay">chardonnay</a>, <a href="sauvignon%20blanc">sauvignon blanc</a> or <a href="pinot%20gris">pinot gris</a> are typical wine pairings for trout.

Canadian Indian residential school system

In <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, the Indian residential school system was a network of <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a>s for <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Canada">Indigenous peoples</a>. The network was funded by the <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">Canadian government</a>'s <a href="Aboriginal%20Affairs%20and%20Northern%20Development%20Canada">Department of Indian Affairs</a> and administered by Christian churches. The school system was created for the purpose of removing Indigenous children from the influence of their own culture and <a href="Cultural%20assimilation">assimilating</a> them into the dominant Canadian culture. Over the course of the system's more than hundred-year existence, about 30 per cent of Indigenous children (around 150,000) were placed in residential schools nationally. The number of school-related deaths remains unknown due to an incomplete historical record, though estimates range from 3,200 upwards of 6,000.

The system had its origins in laws enacted before <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Confederation</a>, but it was primarily active from the passage of the <a href="Indian%20Act">Indian Act</a> in 1876. An amendment to the Indian Act in 1884 made attendance at <a href="day%20school">day school</a>s, <a href="industrial%20school">industrial school</a>s, or residential schools compulsory for First Nations children. Due to the remote nature of many communities, school locations meant that for some families residential schools were the only way to comply. The schools were intentionally located at substantial distances from Indigenous communities to minimize contact between families and their children. Indian Commissioner <a href="Hayter%20Reed">Hayter Reed</a> argued for schools at greater distances to reduce family visits, which he thought counteracted efforts to civilize Indigenous children. Parental visits were further restricted by the use of a <a href="Pass%20system%20%28Canadian%20history%29">pass system</a> designed to confine Indigenous peoples to <a href="Indian%20reserve">reserves</a>. The last federally operated residential school closed in 1996, called Gordon Indian Residential School and was located in <a href="Punnichy">Punnichy, Saskatchewan</a>. Schools operated in every province and territory with the exception of <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> and <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a>.

The residential school system harmed Indigenous children significantly by <a href="Child%20displacement">removing them from their families</a>, depriving them of their <a href="indigenous%20languages">ancestral languages</a>, exposing many of them to <a href="child%20abuse">physical</a> and <a href="child%20sexual%20abuse">sexual abuse</a>, and <a href="Indian%20enfranchisement%20in%20Canada">forcibly enfranchising</a> them. Disconnected from their families and culture and forced to speak English or French, students who attended the residential school system often graduated unable to fit into either their communities and still subject to racist attitudes in mainstream Canadian society. The system ultimately proved successful in disrupting the transmission of Indigenous practices and beliefs across generations. The legacy of the system has been linked to an increased prevalence of <a href="post-traumatic%20stress">post-traumatic stress</a>, <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a>, <a href="substance%20abuse">substance abuse</a>, and suicide, which persist within Indigenous communities today. 

On June 11, 2008, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Stephen%20Harper">Stephen Harper</a> offered a public apology on behalf of the Government of Canada and the leaders of the other <a href="List%20of%20federal%20political%20parties%20in%20Canada">federal parties</a> in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons</a>. Nine days prior, the <a href="Truth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20%28Canada%29">Truth and Reconciliation Commission</a> (TRC) was established to uncover the truth about the schools. The commission gathered about 7,000 statements from residential school survivors through public and private meetings at various local, regional and national events across Canada. Seven national events held between 2008 and 2013 commemorated the experience of former students of residential schools. In 2015, the TRC concluded with the establishment of the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, and the publication of a multi-volume report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time. The TRC report found that the school system amounted to <a href="cultural%20genocide">cultural genocide</a>.

Attempts to assimilate <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">Indigenous peoples</a> were rooted in <a href="imperialism">imperial colonialism</a>, which centred around a European worldview of cultural practice and an understanding of land ownership based on the <a href="Discovery%20doctrine">doctrine of Discovery</a>. As explained in the executive summary of the <a href="Truth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20%28Canada%29">Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's</a> (TRC) final report: "Underlying these arguments was the belief that the colonizers were bringing civilization to savage people who could never civilize themselves. The 'civilizing mission' rested on a belief of racial and cultural superiority."

Assimilation efforts began as early as the 17th century with the arrival of French colonists in <a href="New%20France">New France</a>. They were resisted by Indigenous communities who were unwilling to leave their children for extended periods and who came to associate <a href="missionary">missionaries</a> with the <a href="Native%20American%20disease%20and%20epidemics">diseases devastating Indigenous populations</a>. The establishment of day and boarding schools by groups including the <a href="R%C3%A9collets">RÃ©collets</a>, <a href="Jesuit%20Missions%20amongst%20the%20Huron">Jesuits</a> and <a href="Ursulines%20of%20Quebec">Ursulines</a> was largely abandoned by the 1690s. The political instability and realities of colonial life also played a role in the decision to halt the education programs. An increase in orphaned and foundling colonial children limited church resources, and colonists benefited from favourable relations with Indigenous peoples in both the <a href="North%20American%20fur%20trade">fur trade</a> and military pursuits.

After a failure to assimilate Indigenous children by early missionaries in the 17th century, educational programs were not widely attempted again by religious officials until the 1820s, prior to the introduction of state-sanctioned operations. Included among them was a school established by <a href="John%20West%20%28missionary%29">John West</a>, an Anglican missionary, at the <a href="Red%20River%20Colony">Red River Colony</a> in what is today <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>. Protestant missionaries also opened residential schools in the current <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> region, spreading Christianity and working to encourage Indigenous peoples to adopt <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a> as a way to ensure they would not return to their original, nomadic ways of life upon graduation.

Although many of these early schools were open for only a short time, efforts persisted. The <a href="Mohawk%20Institute%20Residential%20School">Mohawk Institute Residential School</a>, the oldest, continuously operated residential school in Canada, opened in 1834 on <a href="Six%20Nations%20of%20the%20Grand%20River">Six Nations of the Grand River</a> near <a href="Brantford">Brantford</a>, Ontario. Administered by the Anglican Church, the facility opened as the Mechanics' Institute, a day school for boys, in 1828 and became a boarding school four years later when it accepted its first boarders and began admitting female students. It remained in operation until June 30, 1970.

The renewed interest in residential schools in the early 1800s has been linked to the decline in military hostility faced by British settlers, particularly after the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. With the threat of invasion by American forces minimized, Indigenous communities were no longer viewed as allies but as barriers to permanent settlement. This perspective was further underscored by the transfer of affairs with Indigenous communities from military officials, familiar with and sympathetic to their customs and way of life, to civilian representatives concerned only with permanent colonial settlement.

Beginning in the late 1800s, the Canadian government's Department of Indian Affairs (DIA) officially encouraged the growth of the residential school system as a valuable component in a wider policy of integrating Indigenous people into <a href="European-Canadian">European-Canadian</a> society. Responsible for separating Indigenous children from their families and communities, this process was found by the TRC to be <a href="cultural%20genocide">cultural genocide</a>, a conclusion that echoed the words of historian John S. Milloy, who argued that the system's aim was to "kill the Indian in the child". As the system was designed as an immersion program, Indigenous children were in many schools prohibited from, and sometimes punished for, speaking their own languages or practising their own faiths. The primary stated goal was to convert Indigenous children to Christianity and to civilize them.

Many of the government-operated residential schools were run by churches of various denominations, with the majority administered by <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>s. Between 1867 and 1939, the number of schools operating at one time peaked at 80 in 1931. Of those schools, 44 were operated by Roman Catholics; 21 were operated by the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> / <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Canada">Anglican Church of Canada</a>; 13 were operated by the <a href="United%20Church%20of%20Canada">United Church of Canada</a>, and 2 were operated by <a href="Presbyterianism%23Canada">Presbyterians</a>. The approach of using established school facilities set up by missionaries was employed by the federal government for economic expedience: the government provided facilities and maintenance, while the churches provided teachers and their own lesson-planning. As a result, the number of schools per denomination was less a reflection of their presence in the general population, but rather their legacy of missionary work.

Although <a href="education%20in%20Canada">education in Canada</a> was made the jurisdiction of the provincial governments by the <a href="Constitution%20Act%2C%201867">British North America Act</a>, Indigenous peoples and their treaties were under the jurisdiction of the federal government. Residential schools were funded under the <a href="Indian%20Act">Indian Act</a> by what was then the federal <a href="Aboriginal%20Affairs%20and%20Northern%20Development%20Canada">Department of the Interior</a>. Adopted in 1876 as "An Act to amend and consolidate the laws respecting Indians", it consolidated all previous laws placing Indigenous communities, land and finances under federal control. As explained by the TRC, the Act "made Indians wards of the state, unable to vote in provincial or federal elections or enter the professions if they did not surrender their status, and severely limited their freedom to participate in spiritual and cultural practices".

The by Governor General <a href="Charles%20Bagot">Charles Bagot</a>, entitled "Report on the affairs of the Indians in Canada". Referred to as the Bagot Report, it is seen as the foundational document for the federal . It was supported by <a href="James%20Bruce%2C%208th%20Earl%20of%20Elgin">James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin</a>, who had been impressed by industrial schools in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, and <a href="Egerton%20Ryerson">Egerton Ryerson</a>, who was then the Chief Superintendent of Education in <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a>.

On May 26, 1847, Ryerson wrote a letter for George Vardon, Assistant Superintendent of Indian Affairs, asserting that "the North American Indian cannot be civilized or preserved in a state of civilization (including habits of industry and sobriety) except in connection with, if not by the influence of, not only religious instruction and sentiment but of religious feelings". He expressly recommended that Indigenous students be educated in a separate, denominational, English-only system with a focus on industrial training.

The <a href="Gradual%20Civilization%20Act">Gradual Civilization Act</a> of 1857 and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act of 1869 formed the foundations for this system prior to Confederation. These acts assumed the inherent superiority of French and British ways, and the need for Indigenous peoples to become French or English speakers, Christians, and farmers. At the time, many Indigenous leaders argued to have these acts overturned. The Gradual Civilization Act awarded of land to any Indigenous male deemed "sufficiently advanced in the elementary branches of education" and would automatically "enfranchise" him, removing any tribal affiliation or treaty rights. With this legislation, and through the creation of residential schools, the government believed Indigenous peoples could eventually become assimilated into the general population. For graduates to receive individual allotments of farmland would require changes in the communal <a href="Indian%20reserve">reserve</a> system, something fiercely opposed by First Nations governments.

In January 1879, <a href="John%20A.%20Macdonald">Sir John A. Macdonald</a>, Prime Minister of what was now <a href="post-Confederation%20Canada%20%281867%E2%80%931914%29">post-Confederation Canada</a>, commissioned politician <a href="Nicholas%20Flood%20Davin">Nicholas Flood Davin</a> to write a report regarding the industrial boarding-school system in the United States. Now known as the Davin Report, the "Report on Industrial Schools for Indians and Half-Breeds" was submitted to Ottawa in March 14, 1879, and made the case for a cooperative approach between the Canadian government and the church to implement the "aggressive assimilation" pursued by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>. Davin's report relied heavily on findings he acquired through consultations with government officials and representatives of the <a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, and church officials in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, Manitoba. He visited only one industrial day school, in <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>, before submitting his findings. In his report Davin concluded that the best way to civilize Indigenous peoples was to start with children in a residential setting, away from their families, so that they could be "kept constantly within the circle of civilized conditions".

Davin's findings were supported by <a href="Vital-Justin%20Grandin">Vital-Justin Grandin</a>, who felt that while the likelihood of civilizing adults was low, there was hope when it came to Indigenous children. He explained in a letter to Public Works Minister <a href="Hector-Louis%20Langevin">Hector-Louis Langevin</a> that the best course of action would be make children "lead a life different from their parents and cause them to forget the customs, habits & language of their ancestors". In 1883 Parliament approved $43,000 for three industrial schools and the first, <a href="Battleford%20Industrial%20School">Battleford Industrial School</a>, opened on December 1 of that year. By 1900 there were 61 schools in operation.

The government began purchasing church run boarding schools in the 1920s. During this period capital costs associated with the schools were assumed by the government, leaving administrative and instructional duties to church officials. The hope was that minimizing facility expenditures would allow church administrators to provide higher quality instruction and support to the students in their care. Although the government was willing to, and did, purchase schools from the churches, many were acquired for free given that the rampant disrepair present in the buildings resulted in their having no economic value. Schools continued to be maintained by churches in instances where they failed to reach an agreement with government officials with the understanding that the government would provide support for capital costs. The understanding ultimately proved complicated due to the lack of written agreements outlining the extent and nature of that support or the approvals required to undertake expensive renovations and repairs.

By the 1930s it was recognized by government officials that the residential school system was financially unsustainable and failing to meet the intended goal of training and assimilating Indigenous children into European-Canadian society. <a href="Robert%20Hoey">Robert Hoey</a>, superintendent of welfare and training at Indian Affairs, opposed the expansion of new schools, noting in 1936 that "to build educational institutions, particularly residential schools, while the money at our disposal is insufficient to keep the schools already erected in a proper state of repair, is, to me, very unsound and a practice difficult to justify". He proposed the expansion of day schools, an approach to educating Indigenous children that he would continue to pursue after being promoted to director of the welfare and training branch in 1945. The proposal was resisted by the United Church, the Anglican Church, and the <a href="Missionary%20Oblates%20of%20Mary%20Immaculate">Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate</a>, who believed that the solution to the system's failure was not restructuring but intensification.

Between 1945 and 1955, the number of day schools run by Indian Affairs expanded from 9,532 to 17,947. The growth in day schools was accompanied by an amendment to the Indian Act in 1951 that allowed federal officials to establish agreements with provincial and territorial governments and school boards regarding the education of Indigenous students in the public school system. These changes were indicative of the government's shift in policy from assimilation-driven education at residential schools to the integration of Indigenous students into public schools. It was believed that Indigenous children would receive a better education as a result of their transition into the public school system.

Despite the shift in policy from educational assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued through much of the 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of <a href="Indian%20Act%23Section%2088">section 88</a> to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of <a href="Child%20protection">child welfare</a>. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the <a href="Sixties%20Scoop">Sixties Scoop</a> by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report "Native Children and the Child Welfare System". Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.

In 1969, after years of sharing power with churches, the DIA took sole control of the residential school system. The last residential school operated by the Canadian government, <a href="Gordon%20First%20Nation">Gordon Indian Residential School</a> in <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, was closed in 1996. Residential schools operated in every Canadian province and territory with the exception of <a href="New%20Brunswick">New Brunswick</a> and <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Island">Prince Edward Island</a>. It is estimated that the number of residential schools reached its peak in the early 1930s with 80 schools and more than 17,000 enrolled students. About 150,000 children are believed to have attended a residential school over the course of the system's existence.

The parents and families of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including the increase of centrally located day schools to improve access to their children, and made repeated requests for improvements to the quality of education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep their children at home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.

In 1884, amendments to the Indian Act made school attendance compulsory for Indigenous children between 7 and 16 years of age. The changes included a series of exemptions regarding school location, the health of the children and their prior completion of school examinations. It was changed to children between 6 and 15 years of age in 1908. The introduction of mandatory attendance was the result of pressure from missionary representatives. Reliant on student enrollment quotas to secure funding, they were struggling to attract new students due to increasingly poor school conditions.

Compulsory attendance ended in 1948, following the 1947 report of a special joint committee and subsequent amendment of the Indian Act. Government officials were still able to influence student attendance. The introduction of the <a href="Family%20Allowance%20Act">Family Allowance Act</a> in 1945 stipulated that school-aged children had to be enrolled in school for families to qualify for the "<a href="Baby%20bonus%23Canada">baby bonus</a>", further coercing Indigenous parents into having their children attend residential schools.

Students in the residential school system were faced with a multitude of abuses from teachers and administrators, including sexual and physical assault. They suffered from malnourishment and harsh discipline that would not have been tolerated in any other school system. <a href="Corporal%20punishment">Corporal punishment</a> was often justified by a belief that it was the only way to save souls, civilize the savage, or punish and deter runawaysÂ â whose injuries or death sustained in their efforts to return home would become the legal responsibility of the school. Overcrowding, poor sanitation, inadequate heating, and a lack of medical care led to high rates of influenza and <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>; in one school, the death rate reached 69 per cent. Federal policies that tied funding to enrollment numbers led to sick children being enrolled in order to boost numbers, thus introducing and spreading disease. The problem of unhealthy children was further exacerbated by the conditions of the schools themselves â overcrowding and poor ventilation, water quality and sewage systems.

Until the late 1950s, when the federal government shifted to a day school integration model, residential schools were severely underfunded and often relied on the <a href="forced%20labour">forced labour</a> of their students to maintain their facilities, although it was presented as training for artisan skills. The work was arduous, and severely compromised the academic and social development of the students. School books and textbooks were drawn mainly from the curricula of the provincially funded public schools for non-Indigenous students, and teachers at the residential schools were often poorly trained or prepared. During this same period, Canadian government scientists performed nutritional tests on students and knowingly kept some students undernourished to serve as the control sample.

Details of the mistreatment of students were published numerous times throughout the 20th century by both government officials, reporting on the condition of schools, and by the proceedings of civil cases brought forward by survivors seeking compensation for the abuse they endured. Attention to the conditions and impacts of residential schools were also brought to light in popular culture as early as 1967 with the publication of "The Lonely Death of <a href="Chanie%20Wenjack">Chanie Wenjack</a>" by <a href="Ian%20Adams">Ian Adams</a> in "<a href="Maclean%27s">Maclean's</a>" and the <a href="Indians%20of%20Canada%20Pavilion">Indians of Canada Pavilion</a> at <a href="Expo%2067">Expo 67</a>. In the 1990s, investigations and memoirs by former students revealed that many students at residential schools were subjected to severe physical, <a href="psychological%20abuse">psychological</a>, and <a href="sexual%20abuse">sexual abuse</a> by school staff members and by older students. Among the former students to come forward was <a href="Phil%20Fontaine">Phil Fontaine</a>, then Grand Chief of the <a href="Assembly%20of%20Manitoba%20Chiefs">Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs</a>, who in October 1990 publicly discussed the abuse he and others suffered while attending Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.

Following the government's closure of most of the schools in the 1960s, the work of Indigenous activists and historians led to greater awareness by the public of the damage the schools had caused, as well as to official government and church apologies, and a legal settlement. These gains were achieved through the persistent organizing and advocacy by Indigenous communities to draw attention to the residential school system's legacy of abuse, including their participation in hearings of the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Aboriginal%20Peoples">Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</a>.

Parents and family members regularly travelled to the schools, often camping outside to be closer to their children. The number of parents who made the trip prompted Indian Commissioner Hayter Reed to argue that industrial schools, like residential schools, be moved greater distances from reserves to make visiting more difficult. He also objected to allowing children to return home during school breaks and holidays because he believed the trips interrupted the civilizing of school attendees. As Reed explained in 1894, the problem with day schools was that students returned home each night where they were influenced by life on the reserve, whereas "in the boarding or industrial schools the pupils are removed for a long period from the leadings of this uncivilized life and receive constant care and attention".

Visitation, for those able to make the journey, was strictly controlled by school officials in a manner similar to the procedures enforced in the prison system. In some cases visitors were altogether denied access to their children, while in others families were required to meet in the presence of school officials and forced to communicate in English. For parents unable to speak the language, verbal communication with their children was impossible. The obstacles families faced to visit their children were further exacerbated by the <a href="Pass%20system%20%28Canadian%20history%29">pass system</a>. Introduced by Reed without legislative authority to do so, the system restricted and closely monitored the movement of Indigenous peoples off reserves. Launched in 1885 as a response to the <a href="North-West%20Rebellion">North-West Rebellion</a>, and later replaced by permits, the system was designed to prevent Indigenous people from leaving reserves without a pass issued by a local Indian agent.

 Instruction provided to students was rooted in an institutional and European approach to education. It differed dramatically from child rearing in <a href="traditional%20knowledge">traditional knowledge</a> systems that are generally based on 'look, listen, and learn' models. Unlike the corporal punishment and loss of privileges that characterized the residential school system, traditional approaches to education favour positive guidance toward desired behaviour through the use of game-based play, story-telling, and formal ritualized ceremonies. While at school, many children had no contact with their families for up to 10 months at a time because of the distance between their home communities and schools, and in some cases had no contact for years. The impact of the disconnect from their families was furthered by students being discouraged or prohibited from speaking <a href="Native%20American%20languages">Indigenous languages</a>, even among themselves and outside the classroom, so that English or French would be learned and their own languages forgotten. In some schools, they were subject to physical violence for speaking their own languages or for practicing non-Christian faiths.

Most schools operated with the goal of providing students with the <a href="Vocational%20education">vocational training</a> and <a href="social%20skills">social skills</a> required to obtain employment and integrate into Canadian society after graduation. In actuality, these goals were poorly and inconsistently achieved. Many graduates were unable to land a job due to poor educational training. Returning home was equally challenging due to an unfamiliarity with their culture and, in some cases, an inability to communicate with family members using their traditional language. Instead of intellectual achievement and advancement, it was often physical appearance and dress, like that of <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>, urban teenagers, or the promotion of a Christian ethic, that was used as a sign of successful assimilation. There was no indication that school attendees achieved greater financial success than those who did not go to school. As the father of a pupil who attended Battleford Industrial School, in Saskatchewan, for five years explained: "he cannot read, speak or write English, nearly all his time having been devoted to herding and caring for cattle instead of learning a trade or being otherwise educated. Such employment he can get at home."

Residential school deaths were common and have been linked to the persistence of poorly constructed and maintained facilities. The actual number of deaths remains unknown due to inconsistent reporting by school officials and the destruction of medical and administrative records in compliance with <a href="Information%20governance%23Records%20management">retention and disposition policies</a> for government records. Research by the TRC revealed that at least 3,201 students had died, mostly from disease. TRC chair, Justice Murray Sinclair, has suggested that the number of deaths may be closer to more than 6,000.

The 1906 Annual Report of the Department of Indian Affairs, submitted by chief medical officer <a href="Peter%20Bryce">Peter Bryce</a>, highlighted that the "Indian population of Canada has a mortality rate of more than double that of the whole population, and in some provinces more than three times". Among the list of causes he noted tuberculosis and the role residential schools played in spreading the disease by way of poor ventilation and medical screening.

In 1909, Bryce reported that, between 1894 and 1908, mortality rates at some residential schools in western Canada ranged from 30 to 60 per cent over five years (that is, five years after entry, 30 to 60 per cent of students had died, or 6 to 12 per cent per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published "The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921." In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates could have been avoided if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. <a href="Streptomycin">Streptomycin</a>, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.

In 1920 and 1922, <a href="Regina%2C%20Saskatchewan">Regina</a> physician F.A. Corbett was commissioned to visit the schools in the west of the country, and found similar results to those reported by Bryce. At the Ermineskin school in <a href="Maskwacis">Hobbema</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, he found 50 per cent of the children had tuberculosis. At Sarcee Boarding School near <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>, he noted that all 33 students were "much below even a passable standard of health" and but four were infected with tuberculosis". In one classroom, he found 16 ill children, many near death, who were being made to sit through lessons.

In 2011, reflecting on the TRC's research, Justice <a href="Murray%20Sinclair">Murray Sinclair</a> told the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>": "Missing childrenÂ â that is the big surprise for meÂ ... That such large numbers of children died at the schools. That the information of their deaths was not communicated back to their families."

The TRC concluded that it may be impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, in part because of the habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the number of children who died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.

The fourth volume of the TRC's final report, dedicated to missing children and unmarked burials, was developed after the original TRC members realized, in 2007, that the issue required its own working group. In 2009, the TRC requested $1.5million in extra funding from the federal government to complete this work, but was denied. The researchers concluded, after searching land near schools using satellite imagery and maps, that, "for the most part, the cemeteries that the Commission documented are abandoned, disused, and vulnerable to accidental disturbance".

When the government revised the Indian Act in the 1940s and 1950s, some bands, along with regional and national Indigenous organizations, wanted to maintain schools in their communities. Motivations for support of the schools included their role as a social service in communities that were suffering from extensive family breakdowns; the significance of the schools as employers; and the inadequacy of other opportunities for children to receive education. 

In the 1960s, a major confrontation took place at the <a href="Saddle%20Lake%20Cree%20Nation">Saddle Lake Reserve</a> in Alberta. After several years of deteriorating conditions and administrative changes, parents protested against the lack of transparency at the <a href="University%20nuhelot%E2%80%99%C4%AFne%20thaiyots%E2%80%99%C4%AF%20nistameyim%C3%A2kanak%20Blue%20Quills">Blue Quills Indian School</a> in 1969. In response, the government decided to close the school, convert the building into a residence, and enroll students in a public school away in <a href="St.%20Paul%2C%20Alberta">St. Paul</a>, Alberta. The TRC report pertaining to this period states:Fearing their children would face racial discrimination in St. Paul, parents wished to see the school transferred to a private society that would operate it both as a school and a residence. The federal government had been open to such a transfer if the First Nations organization was structured as a provincial school division. The First Nations rejected this, saying that a transfer of First Nations education to the provincial authority was a violation of Treaty rights. In the summer of 1970, members of the Saddle Lake community occupied the building and demanded the right to run it themselves. More than 1,000 people are believed to have participated over the course of the 17-day sit-in, which lasted from July 14 to 31. Their efforts resulted in Blue Quills becoming the first Indigenous-administered school in the country. It continues to operate today as <a href="University%20nuhelot%E2%80%99%C4%AFne%20thaiyots%E2%80%99%C4%AF%20nistameyim%C3%A2kanak%20Blue%20Quills">University nuhelotâÄ¯ne thaiyotsâÄ¯ nistameyimÃ¢kanak Blue Quills</a>, the first <a href="Tribal%20colleges%20and%20universities">Indigenous-governed university</a> in Canada. Following the success of the Blue Quills effort the <a href="Assembly%20of%20First%20Nations">National Indian Brotherhood</a> (NIB) released the 1972 paper "Indian Control of Indian Education" that responded, in part, to the Canadian Government's <a href="1969%20White%20Paper">1969 White Paper</a> calling for the abolishment of the <a href="Numbered%20Treaties">land treaties</a> and the Indian Act. The NIB paper underscored the right of Indigenous communities to locally direct how their children are educated and served as the integral reference for education policy moving forward.

Few other former residential schools have transitioned into independently-operated community schools for Indigenous children. <a href="Qu%27Appelle%20Indian%20Residential%20School">White Calf Collegiate</a> in Lebret, Saskatchewan, was run by the <a href="Star%20Blanket%20Cree%20Nation">Star Blanket Cree Nation</a> from 1973 until its closure in 1998, after being run by the Oblates from 1884 to 1969. <a href="Old%20Sun%20Community%20College">Old Sun Community College</a> is run by the <a href="Siksika%20Nation">Siksika Nation</a> in Alberta in a building designed by architect Roland Guerney Orr. From 1929 to 1971 the building housed Old Sun residential school, first run by the Anglicans and taken over by the federal government in 1969. It was converted to adult learning and stood as a campus of <a href="Mount%20Royal%20University">Mount Royal College</a> from 1971 to 1978, at which point the Siksika Nation took over operations. In 1988, the Old Sun College Act was passed in the Alberta Legislature recognizing Old Sun Community College as a First Nations College.

Survivors of residential schools and their families have been found to suffer from historic trauma that has had a lasting and adverse effect on the transmission of Indigenous culture between generations. Passed on <a href="intergenerationality">intergenerationally</a>, a 2010 study led by Gwen Reimer explains historic trauma as the process through which "cumulative stress and grief experienced by Aboriginal communities is translated into a collective experience of cultural disruption and a collective memory of powerlessness and loss". It has been used to explain the persistent negative social and cultural impacts of colonial rule and residential schools, including the prevalence of sexual abuse, alcoholism, drug addiction, lateral violence, mental illness and suicide among Indigenous peoples.

The 2012 national report of the First Nations Regional Health Study found that of respondents who attended residential schools were more likely than those who did not to have been diagnosed with at least one <a href="Chronic%20condition">chronic medical condition</a>. A sample of 127 survivors revealed that half have criminal records; 65 per cent have been diagnosed with <a href="posttraumatic%20stress%20disorder">posttraumatic stress disorder</a>; 21 per cent have been diagnosed with major depression; 7 per cent have been diagnosed with <a href="anxiety%20disorder">anxiety disorder</a>; and 7 per cent have been diagnosed with <a href="borderline%20personality%20disorder">borderline personality disorder</a>.

Although encouragement to keep Indigenous languages alive was present in some schools, a key tactic used to assimilate Indigenous children into Canadian society was to suppress <a href="Indigenous%20languages%20of%20the%20Americas">Indigenous languages</a> and culture. Many students spoke the language of their families fluently when they first entered residential schools. Teachers responded by strictly prohibiting the use of these languages despite many students having little or no understanding of English or French. The practice of traditional and spiritual activities including the <a href="Potlatch">Potlatch</a> and <a href="Sun%20Dance">Sun Dance</a> were also banned. Some survivors reported being <a href="Strapping%20%28punishment%29">strapped</a> or forced to <a href="Washing%20out%20mouth%20with%20soap">eat soap</a> when they were caught speaking their own language. The inability to communicate was further affected by their families' inabilities to speak English or French. Upon leaving residential school some survivors felt ashamed for being Indigenous as they were made to view their traditional identities as ugly and dirty.

The stigma created by the residential school system regarding transmission of Indigenous culture by elders to younger generations has been linked to the over-representation of Indigenous languages on the <a href="list%20of%20endangered%20languages%20in%20Canada">list of endangered languages in Canada</a>. The TRC noted that the majority of 90 Indigenous languages still in existence are "under serious threat of extinction". With great-grandparents representing the only speakers of many Indigenous languages, it was concluded that a failure of governments and Indigenous communities to prioritize the teaching and preservation of traditional languages would ensure that, despite the closure of resident schools, the eradication of Indigenous culture desired by government officials and administrators would inevitably be fulfilled "through a process systemic neglect". In addition to the forceful eradication of elements of Indigenous culture, the schools trained students in patriarchal dichotomies useful to state institutions, such as the domesticization of female students through imbuing âstay-at-homeâ values and the militarization of male students through soldierlike regimentation. Â 

Acknowledgment of the wrongs done by the residential school system began in the 1980s. In 1986, at its 31st General Council, the <a href="United%20Church%20of%20Canada">United Church of Canada</a> responded to the request of Indigenous peoples that it apologize to them for its part in colonization and in 1998 apologized expressly for the role it played in the residential school system.

Archbishop <a href="Michael%20Peers">Michael Peers</a> apologized to residential school survivors, on behalf of the Anglican Church of Canada, on August 6, 1993, at the National Native Convocation in <a href="Minaki">Minaki</a>, Ontario. The following year the <a href="Presbyterian%20Church%20in%20Canada">Presbyterian Church in Canada</a> adopted a confession at its 120th General Assembly in Toronto on June 5, recognizing its role in residential schools and seeking forgiveness. The confession was presented on October 8 during a ceremony in Winnipeg.

In 2004, immediately before signing the first Public Safety Protocol with the Assembly of First Nations, <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mounted%20Police">Royal Canadian Mounted Police</a> (RCMP) Commissioner <a href="Giuliano%20Zaccardelli">Giuliano Zaccardelli</a> issued an apology on behalf of the RCMP for its role in the Indian residential school system: "We, I, as Commissioner of the RCMP, am truly sorry for what role we played in the residential school system and the abuse that took place in the residential system."

On June 11, 2008, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Stephen%20Harper">Stephen Harper</a> issued a formal apology, on behalf of the sitting <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Canada">Cabinet</a>, in front of an audience of Indigenous delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the <a href="CBC%20Television">CBC</a>, for the past governments' policies of assimilation. The Prime Minister apologized not only for the known excesses of the residential school system, but for the creation of the system itself. Harper delivered the speech in the House of Commons; the procedural device of a <a href="Committee%20of%20the%20Whole">Committee of the Whole</a> was used, so that Indigenous leaders, who were not Members of Parliament, could be allowed to respond to the apology on the floor of the House.

Harper's apology excluded <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a> as it was argued that the government should not be held accountable for pre-Confederation actions. Residential schools in Newfoundland and Labrador were located in <a href="St.%20Anthony%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. Anthony</a>, <a href="Cartwright%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Cartwright</a>, <a href="North%20West%20River">North West River</a>, <a href="Nain%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Nain</a> and <a href="Makkovik">Makkovik</a>. These schools were run by the <a href="International%20Grenfell%20Association">International Grenfell Association</a> and the German Monrovian Missionaries. The government argued that because these schools were not created under the auspices of the Indian Act, they were not true residential schools. More than 1,000 survivors disagreed and filed a class action lawsuit against the government for compensation in 2007. By the time the suit was settled in 2016, almost a decade later, dozens of plaintiffs had died. It was expected that up to 900 former students would be compensated.

On November 24, 2017, Prime Minister <a href="Justin%20Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a> issued a formal apology to former <a href="Innu">Innu</a>, <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a> and <a href="NunatuKavut%20people">NunatuKavut</a> school survivors and their families during a ceremony in <a href="Happy%20Valley-Goose%20Bay">Happy Valley-Goose Bay</a>, <a href="Labrador">Labrador</a>. He acknowledged that students experienced multiple forms of abuse linking their treatment to the colonial thinking that shaped the school system. Trudeau's apology was received on behalf of residential school survivors by Toby Obed who framed the apology as a key part of the healing process that connected survivors from Newfoundland and Labrador with school attendees from across the country. Members of the Innu Nation were less receptive, rejecting the apology ahead of the ceremony. Grand Chief Gregory Rich noted in a released statement that he was "not satisfied that Canada understands yet what it has done to Innu and what it is still doing", indicating that members felt they deserved an apology for more than their experiences at residential schools.

On June 22, 2015, <a href="Rachel%20Notley">Rachel Notley</a>, <a href="Premier%20of%20Alberta">Premier of Alberta</a>, issued a formal apology as a ministerial statement in a bid to begin to address the wrongs done by the government to the Indigenous peoples of Alberta and the rest of Canada. Notley's provincial government called on the federal government to hold an inquiry on the <a href="Missing%20and%20Murdered%20Indigenous%20Women%20%28Canada%29">missing and murdered Indigenous women</a> in Canada at the same time. They also stated their intent to build relationships with provincial leaders of Indigenous communities, and sought to amend the provincial curriculum to include the history of Indigenous culture.

On June 18, 2015, <a href="Premier%20of%20Manitoba">Manitoba Premier</a> <a href="Greg%20Selinger">Greg Selinger</a> became the first politician to issue a formal apology for the government's role in the Sixties Scoop. Class action lawsuits have been brought against the Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario governments for the harm caused to victims of the large-scale adoption scheme that saw thousands of Indigenous children forcibly removed from their parents in the 1960s. Indigenous leaders responded by insisting that while apologies were welcomed, action â including a federal apology, reunification of families, compensation and counselling for victims â must accompany words for them to have real meaning.

Ontario Premier <a href="Kathleen%20Wynne">Kathleen Wynne</a> apologized on behalf of the provincial government for the harm done at residential schools at <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Ontario">Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a> on May 30, 2016. Affirming Ontario's commitment to reconciliation with Indigenous peoples she acknowledged the school system as "one of the most shameful chapters in Canadian history". In a 105-minute ceremony, Wynne announced that the Ontario government would spend $250million on education initiatives and renamed the Ministry of Aboriginal Affairs the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Indigenous%20Relations%20and%20Reconciliation%20%28Ontario%29">Ministry of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation</a>. It was further announced that the first week of November would be known as Treaties Recognition Week.

On October 27, 2011, <a href="University%20of%20Manitoba">University of Manitoba</a> president David Barnard apologized to the TRC for the institution's role in educating people who operated the residential school system. This is believed to be the first time a Canadian university has apologized for playing a role in residential schools.

In 2009, Chief Fontaine had a private meeting with <a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XVI">Pope Benedict XVI</a> to obtain an apology for abuses that occurred in the residential school system. Fontaine was accompanied at the meeting by a delegation of Indigenous peoples from Canada funded by <a href="Indian%20and%20Northern%20Affairs%20Canada">Indian and Northern Affairs Canada</a>. Following the meeting, the Vatican released an official expression of sorrow on the church's role in residential schools:

His Holiness [i.e. the Pope] recalled that since the earliest days of her presence in Canada, the Church, particularly through her missionary personnel, has closely accompanied the Indigenous peoples.

Given the sufferings that some Indigenous children experienced in the Canadian Residential School system, the Holy Father expressed his sorrow at the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church and he offered his sympathy and prayerful solidarity. His Holiness emphasized that acts of abuse cannot be tolerated in society. He prayed that all those affected would experience healing, and he encouraged First Nations Peoples to continue to move forward with renewed hope.
Fontaine later stated at a news conference that, at the meeting, he sensed the Pope's "pain and anguish" and that the acknowledgement was "important to [him] and that was what [he] was looking for".

On May 29, 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked the current <a href="Pope%20Francis">Pope Francis</a> for a public apology to all survivors of the residential school system, rather than the expression of sorrow issued in 2009. The request aligned with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's call for "a formal apology issued by the Pope to the survivors of the residential school system for the spiritual, cultural, emotional, physical and sexual abuse of Canada's First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis peoples". Trudeau invited the Pope to issue the apology in Canada. Although no commitment for such an apology followed the meeting, he noted that the Pope pointed to a lifelong commitment of supporting marginalized people and an interest in working collaboratively with Trudeau and Canadian bishops to establish a way forward.

In the summer of 1990, the <a href="Kanesatake%2C%20Quebec">Mohawks of Kanesatake</a> confronted the government about its failure to honour Indigenous land claims and recognize traditional Mohawk territory in <a href="Oka%2C%20Quebec">Oka</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>. Referred to by media outlets as the <a href="Oka%20Crisis">Oka Crisis</a>, the land dispute sparked a critical discussion about the Canadian government's complacency regarding relations with Indigenous communities and responses to their concerns. The action prompted then Prime Minister <a href="Brian%20Mulroney">Brian Mulroney</a> to underscore four government responsibilities: "resolving land claims; improving the economic and social conditions on reserves; defining a new relationship between aboriginal peoples and governments; and addressing the concerns of Canada's aboriginal peoples in contemporary Canadian life." The actions of the Mohawk community members led to, in part, along with objections from Indigenous leaders regarding the <a href="Meech%20Lake%20Accord">Meech Lake Accord</a>, the creation of the <a href="Royal%20Commission%20on%20Aboriginal%20Peoples">Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples</a> to examine the status of Indigenous peoples in Canada. In 1996, the Royal Commission presented a final report which first included a vision for meaningful and action-based reconciliation.

In January 1998, the government made a "statement of reconciliation"Â â including an apology to those people who were sexually or physically abused while attending residential schoolsÂ â and established the <a href="Aboriginal%20Healing%20Foundation">Aboriginal Healing Foundation</a> (AHF). The foundation was provided with $350million to fund community-based healing projects addressing the legacy of physical and sexual abuse. In <a href="2005%20Canadian%20federal%20budget">its 2005 budget</a>, the Canadian government committed an additional $40million to support the work of the AHF. Federal funding for the foundation was cut in 2010 by the Stephen Harper government, leaving 134 national healing-related initiatives without an operating budget. The AHF closed in 2014. Former AHF executive director Mike DeGagne has said that the loss of AHF support has created a gap in dealing with mental health crises such as suicides in the Attawapiskat First Nation.

In June 2001, the government established Indian Residential Schools Resolution Canada as an independent government department to manage the residential school file. In 2003, the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process was launched as part of a larger National Resolution Framework which included health supports, a commemoration component and a strategy for litigation. As explained by the TRC, the ADR was designed as a "voluntary process for resolution of certain claims of sexual abuse, physical abuse, and forcible confinement, without having to go through the civil litigation process". It was created by the Canadian government without consultation with Indigenous communities or former residential school students. The ADR system also made it the responsibility of the former students to prove that the abuse occurred and was intentional, resulting in former students finding the system difficult to navigate, re-traumatizing, and discriminatory. Many survivor advocacy groups and Indigenous political organizations such as the <a href="Assembly%20of%20First%20Nations">Assembly of First Nations</a> (AFN) worked to have the ADR system dissolved. In 2004 the Assembly of First Nations released a report critical of the ADR underscoring, among other issues, the failure of survivors to automatically receive the full amount of compensation without subsequent ligation against the church and failure to compensate for lost family, language and culture. The <a href="Canadian%20House%20of%20Commons%20Standing%20Committee%20on%20Indigenous%20and%20Northern%20Affairs">Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development</a> released its own report in April 2005 finding the ADR to be "an excessively costly and inappropriately applied failure, for which the Minister and her officials are unable to raise a convincing defence". Within a month of the report's release a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> decision granted school attendees the right to pursue class-action suits, which ultimately led to a government review of the compensation process.

On November 23, 2005, the Canadian government announced a $1.9-billion compensation package to benefit tens of thousands of former students. National Chief of the AFN, <a href="Phil%20Fontaine">Phil Fontaine</a>, said the package was meant to cover "decades in time, innumerable events and countless injuries to First Nations individuals and communities". <a href="Justice%20Minister">Justice Minister</a> <a href="Irwin%20Cotler">Irwin Cotler</a> applauded the compensation decision noting that the placement of children in the residential school system was "the single most harmful, disgraceful and racist act in our history". At an Ottawa news conference, <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Deputy Prime Minister</a> <a href="Anne%20McLellan">Anne McLellan</a> said: "We have made good on our shared resolve to deliver what I firmly believe will be a fair and lasting resolution of the Indian school legacy."

The compensation package led to the <a href="Indian%20Residential%20Schools%20Settlement%20Agreement">Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement</a> (IRSSA), announced on May 8, 2006, and implemented in September 2007. At the time, there were about 86,000 living victims. The IRSSA included funding for the AHF, for commemoration, for health support, and for a Truth and Reconciliation program, as well as an individual Common Experience Payment (CEP). Any person who could be verified as having resided at a federally run Indian residential school in Canada was entitled to a CEP. The amount of compensation was based on the number of years a particular former student resided at the residential schools: $10,000 for the first year attended (from one night residing there to a full school year) plus $3,000 for every year thereafter.

The IRSSA also included the Independent Assessment Process (IAP), a case-by-case, out-of-court resolution process designed to provide compensation for sexual, physical and emotional abuse. The IAP process was built on the ADR program and all IAP claims from former students are examined by an adjudicator. The IAP became available to all former students of residential schools on September 19, 2007. Former students who experienced abuse and wished to pursue compensation had to apply by themselves or through a lawyer of their choice to receive consideration. The deadline to apply for the IAP was September 19, 2012. This gave former students of residential schools four years from the implementation date of the IRSSA to apply for the IAP. Claims involving physical and sexual abuse were compensated up to $275,000. By the end of January 2017, the IAP had resolved 36,538 claims and paid $3.1billion in compensation.

The IRSSA also proposed an advance payment for former students alive and who were 65 years old and over as of May 30, 2005. The deadline for reception of the advance payment form by IRSRC was December 31, 2006. Following a legal process, including an examination of the IRSSA by the courts of the provinces and territories of Canada, an "opt-out" period occurred. During this time, the former students of residential schools could reject the agreement if they did not agree with its dispositions. This opt-out period ended on August 20, 2007, with about 350 former students opting out. The IRSSA was the largest <a href="class%20action%20lawsuit">class action</a> settlement in Canadian history. By December 2012, a total of $1.62billion was paid to 78,750 former students, 98 per cent of the 80,000 who were eligible. In 2014, the IRSSA funds left over from CEPs were offered for educational credits for survivors and their families.

In 2008, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to travel across Canada collecting the testimonies of people affected by the residential school system. About 7,000 Indigenous people told their stories. The TRC concluded in 2015 with the publication of a six volume, 4,000-plus-page report detailing the testimonies of survivors and historical documents from the time. It focused on the importance of moving "from apology to action" to achieve true reconciliation and resulted in the establishment of the <a href="National%20Centre%20for%20Truth%20and%20Reconciliation">National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation</a>.

The executive summary of the TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that would be difficult to prove. As a result, the debate about whether the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.

Among the 94 <a href="Truth%20and%20Reconciliation%20Commission%20%28Canada%29%23Calls%20to%20action">Calls to Action</a> that accompanied the conclusion of the TRC were recommendations to ensure that all Canadians are educated and made aware of the residential school system. Justice <a href="Murray%20Sinclair">Murray Sinclair</a> explained that the recommendations were not aimed solely at prompting government action, but instead a collective move toward reconciliation in which all Canadians have a role to play: "Many of our elements, many of our recommendations and many of the Calls to Action are actually aimed at Canadian society."

Preservation of documentation of the legacy of residential schools was also highlighted as part of the TRC's Calls to Action. Community groups and other stakeholders have variously argued for documenting or destroying evidence and testimony of residential school abuses. On April 4, 2016, the <a href="Ontario%20Court%20of%20Appeal">Ontario Court of Appeal</a> ruled that documents pertaining to IAP settlements will be destroyed in 15 years if individual claimants do not request to have their documents archived. This decision was fought by the TRC as well as the federal government, but argued for by religious representatives.

In March 2017, <a href="Lynn%20Beyak">Lynn Beyak</a>, a <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada">Conservative</a> member of the <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Senate</a> <a href="Standing%20committee%20%28Canada%29">Standing Committee</a> of Aboriginal Peoples, voiced disapproval of the final TRC report, saying that it had omitted an "abundance of good" that was present in the schools. Although Beyak's right to free speech was defended by some Conservative senators, her comments were widely criticized by members of the opposition, among them <a href="Minister%20of%20Indigenous%20and%20Northern%20Affairs">Minister of Indigenous and Northern Affairs</a>, <a href="Carolyn%20Bennett">Carolyn Bennett</a>, and leader of the <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party">New Democratic Party</a>, <a href="Tom%20Mulcair">Tom Mulcair</a>. The Anglican Church also raised concerns stating in a release co-signed by bishops <a href="Fred%20Hiltz">Fred Hiltz</a> and <a href="Mark%20MacDonald%20%28bishop%29">Mark MacDonald</a>: "There was nothing good about children going missing and no report being filed. There was nothing good about burying children in unmarked graves far from their ancestral homes." In response, the Conservative Party leadership removed Beyak from the Senate committee underscoring that her comments did not align with the views of the party.

The four churches of the Indian Residential Schools Settlement AgreementÂ â the United, Roman Catholic, Anglican and Presbyterian churchesÂ â agreed to participate in the reconciliation process between Indigenous and settler Canadians. They have been involved in funding various projects and services that assist former residential school students and their families in healing from the trauma caused by the schools. The Anglican Church of Canada set up the Anglican Healing Fund in the 1990s to respond to the ongoing need for healing related to residential schools. In the 2000s the United Church established the Justice and Reconciliation Fund to support healing initiatives and the Presbyterian Church has established a Healing & Reconciliation Program.

The churches have also engaged in reconciliation initiatives such as the Returning to Spirit: Residential School Healing and Reconciliation Program, a workshop that aims to unite Indigenous and non-Indigenous people through discussing the legacy of residential schools and fostering an environment for them to communicate and develop mutual understanding. In 2014, the federal government ceased to contribute funds to Indigenous health organizations such as the AHF and the National Aboriginal Health Organization. Since then, more pressure has been placed on churches to sustain their active participation in these healing efforts.

For many communities the existence of buildings that formerly housed residential schools is a traumatic reminder of the system's legacy, and there has been much discussion about demolition, heritage status and how the possibility of incorporating sites into the healing process.
In July 2016, it was announced that the building of the former <a href="Mohawk%20Institute%20Residential%20School">Mohawk Institute Residential School</a> would be converted into an educational centre with exhibits on the legacy of residential schools. Ontario's Minister of Indigenous Relations and Reconciliation, <a href="David%20Zimmer">David Zimmer</a>, noted: "Its presence will always be a reminder of colonization and the racism of the residential school system; one of the darkest chapters of Canadian history."

Reconciliation efforts have also been undertaken by several Canadian universities. In 2015 <a href="Lakehead%20University">Lakehead University</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Winnipeg">University of Winnipeg</a> introduced a mandatory course requirement for all undergraduate students focused on Indigenous culture and history. The same year the <a href="University%20of%20Saskatchewan">University of Saskatchewan</a> hosted a two-day national forum at which Canadian university administrators, scholars and members of Indigenous communities discussed how Canadian universities can and should respond to the TRC's Calls to Action. 

On April 1, 2017, a pole, titled "Reconciliation Pole", was raised on the grounds of the <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a> (UBC) Vancouver campus, which sits on the unceded territory of the <a href="Musqueam%20Indian%20Band">Musqueam</a> people. Carved by <a href="Haida%20people">Haida</a> master carver and hereditary chief, 7idansuu (Edenshaw), <a href="Jim%20Hart%20%28artist%29">James Hart</a>, the pole tells the story of the residential school system prior to, during and after its operation. It features thousands of copper nails, used to represent the children who died in Canadian residential schools, and depictions of residential school survivors carved by artists from multiple Indigenous communities. Included among them are Canadian <a href="Inuit">Inuk</a> director <a href="Zacharias%20Kunuk">Zacharias Kunuk</a>, <a href="Maliseet">Maliseet</a> artist Shane Perley-Dutcher, and Muqueam <a href="Coast%20Salish%20peoples">Coast Salish</a> artist <a href="Susan%20Point">Susan Point</a>.

In October 2016, Canadian singer-songwriter <a href="Gord%20Downie">Gord Downie</a> released "<a href="Secret%20Path">Secret Path</a>", a concept album about <a href="Chanie%20Wenjack">Chanie Wenjack</a>'s escape and death. It was accompanied by a graphic novel and animated film, aired on <a href="CBC%20Television">CBC Television</a>. All proceeds go to the <a href="University%20of%20Manitoba">University of Manitoba</a>'s Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. Following his death in October 2017, Downie's brother Mike said he was aware of 40,000 teachers who had used the material in their classrooms, and hoped to continue this. In December 2017, Downie was posthumously named <a href="Canadian%20Newsmaker%20of%20the%20Year">Canadian Newsmaker of the Year</a> by the <a href="Canadian%20Press">Canadian Press</a>, in part because of his work with reconciliation efforts for survivors of residential schools.

The Catlins

The Catlins (sometimes referred to as The Catlins Coast) comprises an area in the southeastern corner of the <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a> of New Zealand. The area lies between <a href="Balclutha%2C%20New%20Zealand">Balclutha</a> and <a href="Invercargill">Invercargill</a>, straddling the boundary between the <a href="Otago">Otago</a> and <a href="Southland%2C%20New%20Zealand">Southland</a> regions. It includes the South Island's southernmost point, <a href="Slope%20Point">Slope Point</a>.

A rugged, sparsely populated area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense <a href="Temperate%20rain%20forest">temperate rainforest</a>, both of which harbour many <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> of birds, most notably the rare <a href="yellow-eyed%20penguin">yellow-eyed penguin</a>. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them <a href="New%20Zealand%20fur%20seal">New Zealand fur seal</a>s and <a href="Hooker%27s%20sea%20lion">Hooker's sea lion</a>s. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to <a href="big%20wave%20surfing">big-wave surfers</a>, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.

People have lived in the area since around 1350 AD. Prior to European settlement, the region was sparsely inhabited by nomadic groups of <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">MÄori</a>, most of whom lived close to river mouths. In the early days of European settlement the area was frequented by whalers and sealers, and saw milling became a major local industry from the mid-19th century until the 1930s.

Tourism has become of growing importance in the Catlins economy, which otherwise relies heavily on dairy farming and fishing.

The region's population has fallen to less than half its peak in the early 20th century. Some 1,200Â people now live in the Catlins, many of them in the settlement of <a href="Owaka">Owaka</a>. This is linked to population centres to the north and southwest via the area's only major road, part of the <a href="Southern%20Scenic%20Route">Southern Scenic Route</a>. Owaka contains the area's main school,The Catlins Area School, catering for students from year 1 to year 13. There are three other small primary schools throughout the Catlins district. Owaka also has a medical centre, the nearest hospital being in Balclutha. The Catlins is governed at local level as part of the <a href="Clutha%20District">Clutha</a> and <a href="Southland%20District">Southland District</a>s and is represented at national level as part of the <a href="Clutha-Southland">Clutha-Southland</a> electorate.

The Catlins area covers some and forms a rough triangular shape, extending up to inland and along a stretch of coast in extent. The mouths of two large rivers, the <a href="Clutha%20River">Clutha River</a> in the northeast and the <a href="Mataura%20River">Mataura River</a> in the west, mark its coastal limits. To the north and northwest, the rough <a href="The%20Bush">bush</a>-clad hills give way to rolling pastoral countryside drained and softened by the actions of tributaries of these two rivers such as the <a href="Pomahaka%20River">Pomahaka River</a>.

The rugged, scenic coastline of the Catlins features sandy beaches, <a href="blowhole%20%28geology%29">blowhole</a>s, a <a href="petrified%20wood">petrified forest</a> at <a href="Curio%20Bay">Curio Bay</a>, and the <a href="Cathedral%20Caves">Cathedral Caves</a>, which visitors can reach at low tide. Much of the coastline consists of high cliffs, up to in height, and the land rises sharply from the coast at most points. For this reason, many of the area's rivers cascade over waterfalls as they approach the ocean (notably the iconic <a href="Purakaunui%20Falls">Purakaunui Falls</a> on the short Purakaunui River).

The South Island's southernmost point, <a href="Slope%20Point">Slope Point</a>, projects near the southwestern corner of the Catlins. To the west of this lies <a href="Waipapa%20Point">Waipapa Point</a>, often considered the boundary of the Catlins region, beyond which lies the swampy land around the mouth of the Mataura River at the eastern end of <a href="Toetoes%20Bay">Toetoes Bay</a>. But various people place the western boundary of the Catlins region in different places, and some more stringent definitions exclude even Slope Point. A proposed boundary circulated in 2009 by the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Geographic%20Board">New Zealand Geographic Board</a> ran roughly north from Slope Point, then inland around the Catlins Ranges and east to Nugget Point. Tourist organisations objected, asking that the boundary be moved further west to include <a href="Fortrose%2C%20New%20Zealand">Fortrose</a>.

Several parallel ranges of hills dominate the interior of the Catlins, separated by the valleys of the <a href="Owaka%20River">Owaka</a>, <a href="Catlins%20River">Catlins</a> and <a href="Tahakopa%20River">Tahakopa River</a>s, which all drain southeastwards into the Pacific Ocean. The most notable of these ranges is the Maclennan Range. Between them, these hills are often simply referred to as the <a href="Catlins%20Ranges">Catlins Ranges</a>. Their northwestern slopes are drained by several tributaries of the Clutha and Mataura Rivers, most notably the <a href="Mokoreta%20River">Mokoreta River</a>, which flows mainly westwards, reaching the Mataura close to the town of <a href="Wyndham%2C%20New%20Zealand">Wyndham</a>.

The highest point in the Catlins, <a href="Mount%20Pye%2C%20New%20Zealand">Mount Pye</a> () stands north-northeast of <a href="Waikawa%2C%20Southland">Waikawa</a> and close to the source of the Mokoreta River, and marks part of the Otago-Southland border. Other prominent peaks above include Mount Rosebery, Catlins Cone, Mount Tautuku, and Ajax Hill. The Catlins has several small lakes, notably scenic <a href="Lake%20Wilkie">Lake Wilkie</a> close to the <a href="Tautuku%20Peninsula">Tautuku Peninsula</a>. Catlins Lake, near Owaka, actually consists of the tidal <a href="estuary">estuary</a> of the Catlins River.

Shipping has found the Catlins coast notoriously dangerous, and many shipwrecks have occurred on the headlands that jut into the Pacific Ocean here. Two lighthouses stand at opposite ends of the Catlins to help prevent further mishaps. The <a href="Nugget%20Point%20Lighthouse">Nugget Point Lighthouse</a> stands above the water at the end of <a href="Nugget%20Point">Nugget Point</a>, casting its light across a series of eroded <a href="Stack%20%28geology%29">stacks</a> (the "nuggets" which give the point its name). It was built in 1869â70. The <a href="Waipapa%20Point%20Lighthouse">Waipapa Point light</a>, which stands only above sea level, was the last wooden lighthouse to be built in New Zealand, and was constructed in 1884 in response to the tragic 1881 wreck of the "<a href="SS%20Tararua">Tararua</a>". Both of these lighthouses are now fully automated.
Due to its position at the southern tip of New Zealand, the Catlins coastline lies exposed to some of the country's largest <a href="swell%20%28ocean%29">ocean swell</a>s, often over . The region has enjoyed a growing reputation for <a href="big%20wave%20surfing">big wave surfing</a>, with regular competitions, award-winning rides, and coverage on the <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a> gathering publicity for the sport. The Department of Conservation proposed protecting the <a href="Papatowai">Papatowai</a> surf break in 2008, citing its national significance for surfing.

The landscape of the Catlins features in many poems by celebrated poet <a href="Hone%20Tuwhare">Hone Tuwhare</a>. Born in <a href="Northland%20Region">Northland</a>, Tuwhare lived in Kaka Point from 1992 until his death in 2008, and became one of the area's best-known inhabitants. His family plan to establish a writers' retreat at his <a href="bach%20%28New%20Zealand%29">crib</a> there. The film "Two Little Boys", starring comedians <a href="Bret%20McKenzie">Bret McKenzie</a> and <a href="Hamish%20Blake">Hamish Blake</a>, was filmed in the Catlins early in 2011.

The Catlins has a cool <a href="oceanic%20climate">maritime</a> <a href="Temperateness">temperate</a> climate, somewhat cooler than other parts of the South Island, and strongly modified by the effect of the Pacific Ocean. Winds can reach considerable strength, especially on the exposed coast; most of the South Island's storms develop to the south or southwest of the island, and thus the Catlins catches the brunt of many of these weather patterns.

The Catlinsâand especially its central and southern areasâexperiences considerably higher precipitation than most of the South Island's east coast; heavy rain occurs infrequently, but drizzle is common and the region averages around 150Â days of rain per year. Rain days are spread fairly evenly throughout the year; there is no particularly rainy season in the northern Catlins, and only a slight tendency towards more autumn rain in the southwest. The average annual rainfall recorded at the Tautuku Outdoor Education Centre is about , with little variation from year to year.

Fine days can be sunny and warm, and daily maxima may exceed in mid-summer (January/February). A more usual daily maximum in summer would be . Snow is rare except on the peaks even in the coldest part of winter, though frost is quite common during the months of June to September. Typical daily maximum temperatures in winter are .

The first people known to live in the Catlins, <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">MÄori</a> of the <a href="K%C4%81ti%20M%C4%81moe">KÄti MÄmoe</a>, <a href="Waitaha%20%28South%20Island%20iwi%29">Waitaha</a>, and <a href="Ng%C4%81i%20Tahu">KÄi Tahu</a> <a href="iwi">iwi</a> (tribes), merged via marriage and conquest into the iwi now known as KÄi Tahu. Archaeological evidence of human presence dates back to approximately 1350 AD. The area's inhabitants were semi-nomadic, travelling from <a href="Stewart%20Island/Rakiura">Stewart Island/Rakiura</a> in the south and inland to <a href="Central%20Otago">Central Otago</a>. They generally dwelt near river mouths for easy access to the best food resources. In legend, the Catlins forests further inland were inhabited by "Maeroero" (wild giants).

The Catlins may have offered one of the last places where the giant flightless bird, the <a href="Moa%20%28bird%29">moa</a>, could be hunted, and the timber of the forest proved ideal for canoe construction (the name of the settlement "Owaka" means "Place of the canoe"). No formal MÄori <a href="Pa%20%28M%C4%81ori%29">pa</a> (villages) were located in the Catlins, but there were many hunting camps, notably at Papatowai, near the mouth of the Tahakopa River.

Europeans first sighted the area in 1770 when the crew of <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>'s "Endeavour" sailed along the coast. Cook named a bay in the Catlins area "Molineux's Harbour" after his ship's master Robert Molineux. Although this was almost certainly the mouth of the <a href="Waikawa%20River">Waikawa River</a>, later visitors applied the name to a bay to the northeast, close to the mouth of the <a href="Clutha%20River">Clutha River</a>, which itself was for many years known as the Molyneux River. The town of <a href="Port%20Molyneux">Port Molyneux</a>, located on this bay, was a busy harbour during the 19th century. Its location at the mouth of the Clutha made it a good site for trade both from the interior and for coastal and ocean-going shipping. A major flood in 1878 shifted the mouth of the Clutha to the north and silted up the port, after which the town gradually dwindled.

Sealers and whalers founded the first European settlements in the early years of the 19th century, at which time the hunting of marine mammals dominated European economic activity in New Zealand. A whaling station was established on the Tautuku Peninsula in 1839, with smaller stations at Waikawa and close to the mouth of the Clutha River.

The Catlins take their name from the Catlins River, itself named for whaling captain Edward Cattlin (sometimes spelt Catlin). He purchased an extensive block of land along Catlins River on 15 February 1840 from KÄi Tahu chief <a href="T%C5%ABhawaiki">Hone TÅ«hawaiki</a> (also known as "Bloody Jack") for <a href="musket">musket</a>s and Â£30 (roughly NZ$3000 in 2005 dollars). New Zealand's land commissioners declined to endorse the purchase, however, and the MÄori received much of the land back after long negotiations ending more than a decade after Cattlin's death.

During the mid-19th century the area developed into a major saw-milling region, supplying the newly developing town of <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a> with timber shipped from the ports of Waikawa and Fortrose. A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has long since disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along the treacherous coastline during this period. Most notably, one of New Zealand's worst shipping disasters occurred here: the wreck of the passenger-steamer "<a href="SS%20Tararua">Tararua</a>", en route from <a href="Bluff%2C%20New%20Zealand">Bluff</a> to <a href="Port%20Chalmers">Port Chalmers</a>, which foundered off <a href="Waipapa%20Point">Waipapa Point</a> on 29 April 1881 with the loss of all but 20 of the 151 people aboard.

Another noted shipwreck, that of the "Surat", occurred on New Year's Day in 1874. This ship, holed on rocks near Chasland's Mistake eight kilometres southeast of Tautuku Peninsula, limped as far as the mouth of the <a href="Catlins%20River">Catlins River</a> before its 271Â immigrants abandoned ship. A beach at the mouth of the Catlins River is named Surat Bay in commemoration of this wreck. The schooner "Wallace" and steamer "Otago" were also both wrecked at or near Chasland's Mistake, in 1866 and 1876 respectively, and a 4534-ton steamer, the "Manuka", ran aground at Long Point north of Tautuku in 1929. In all there were eight shipwrecks of note between 1839 and 1892.

After a decline in the 1890s, the logging of native timber expanded into new areas made accessible by an extension of the railway, before petering out in the mid-20th century. One nail in the industry's coffin came with a series of bushfires which destroyed several mills in 1935. The cleared land was used primarily for pastoral <a href="sheep%20farming">sheep</a> and <a href="dairy%20farming">dairy farming</a>, which continues to be a mainstay of the Catlins' economy. Much of the remaining forest is now protected by the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Department%20of%20Conservation">Department of Conservation</a> as part of the Catlins Conservation Park.

Medical pioneer Dr <a href="Truby%20King">Truby King</a> established a farm at Tahakopa and a Catlins timber mill from the 1890s to the 1920s, and gave some of his mental patients vocational training there.

From the time of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> until the formation of the New Zealand Rabbit Board in 1954, rabbits became a major pest in the area, and rabbiters were employed to keep the creatures under control. The trapping of rabbits and auctioning of their skins in Dunedin became a minor but important part of the Catlins area's economy during this time.

The area's population has declined from a peak of around 2700 in 1926 to its current level of around 1200. This decline has halted in recent decades, with 2008 figures being very similar to those of 1986.

The Catlins coast often hosts <a href="New%20Zealand%20fur%20seal">New Zealand fur seal</a>s and <a href="Hooker%27s%20sea%20lion">Hooker's sea lion</a>s, and occasionally <a href="southern%20elephant%20seal">southern elephant seal</a>s can be seen. Several species of <a href="penguin">penguin</a> also nest along the coast, notably the rare <a href="yellow-eyed%20penguin">yellow-eyed penguin</a> ("hoiho"), as do other seabirds including <a href="mollymawk">mollymawk</a>s and <a href="Australasian%20gannet">Australasian gannet</a>s, and the estuaries of the rivers are home to <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="stilt">stilt</a>s, <a href="godwit">godwit</a>s and <a href="oystercatcher">oystercatcher</a>s. <a href="Bittern">Bittern</a>s and the threatened <a href="fernbird">fernbird</a> ("matata") can also occasionally be seen along the reedy riverbanks.

In the forests, <a href="endangered">endangered</a> birds such as the <a href="Yellowhead%20%28bird%29">yellowhead</a> ("mohua") and <a href="kakariki">kakariki</a> (New Zealand parakeet) occur, as do other birds such as the <a href="tui%20%28bird%29">tui</a>, <a href="fantail">fantail</a> ("piwakawaka"), and <a href="kereru">kereru</a> (New Zealand pigeon). One of New Zealand's only two native species of non-marine mammal, the <a href="Chalinolobus">long-tailed bat</a>, lives in small numbers within the forests, and several species of <a href="lizard">lizard</a> are also found locally, including the <a href="Hoplodactylus">southern forest gecko</a>.

Many species of fish, shellfish, and crustaceans frequent both the local rivers and sea, notably <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> and <a href="paua">paua</a>. <a href="Nugget%20Point">Nugget Point</a> in the northern Catlins hosts a particularly rich variety of marine wildlife. The establishment of a <a href="marine%20reserve">marine reserve</a> off the coast here, discussed in 1992, 2004 and 2015, has been controversial. <a href="Hector%27s%20dolphin">Hector's dolphin</a>s can often be seen close to the Catlins coast, especially at <a href="Porpoise%20Bay%2C%20New%20Zealand">Porpoise Bay</a> near Waikawa, which is protected as part of the Catlins Coast Marine Mammal Sanctuary, established in 2008. Migratory <a href="southern%20right%20whale">southern right whale</a>s and <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a>s can be spotted along the coastline during winter.

The Catlins features dense <a href="temperate%20rain%20forest">temperate rainforest</a>, dominated by <a href="Podocarpaceae">podocarps</a>. This is the largest area of native forest remaining on the South Island's east coast, with over of forest and neighbouring subalpine areas being protected in Catlins Conservation Park. The forest is thick with trees such as <a href="Dacrydium%20cupressinum">rimu</a>, <a href="Podocarpus%20totara">totara</a>, <a href="Nothofagus">silver beech</a>, <a href="Prumnopitys%20taxifolia">matai</a> and <a href="Dacrycarpus%20dacrydioides">kahikatea</a>. Of particular note are the virgin rimu and totara forest remaining in those areas which were too rugged or steep to have been milled by early settlers, and an extensive area of silver beech forest close to the Takahopa River. This is New Zealand's most southerly expanse of beech forest. Many native species of forest plant can be found in the undergrowth of the Catlins forest, including young <a href="Pseudopanax%20crassifolius">lancewood</a>s, orchids such as the <a href="Corybas%20%28plant%29">spider orchid</a> and <a href="Earina">perching Easter orchid</a>, and many different native <a href="fern">fern</a>s.

Settlers cleared much of the Catlins' coastal vegetation for farmland, but in some areas the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges and some of the bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the forest. Plant life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy ("Celmisia lindsayii") is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. <a href="Tussock%20grass">Tussocks</a>, <a href="Hebe%20%28plant%29">hebe</a>s, and <a href="New%20Zealand%20flax">flax</a>es are common, as are native <a href="gentian">gentian</a>s, though sadly the endangered native <a href="Cyperaceae">sedge</a> <a href="pingao">pingao</a> can now rarely be found. In years when the <a href="Metrosideros%20umbellata">southern rÄtÄ</a> flowers well, the coastal forest canopy turns bright red. The rÄtÄ also thrives in some inland areas.

The geology of the Catlins dates back to over 150 million years ago, when the bedrock of the <a href="Zealandia%20%28continent%29">New Zealand continent</a> was being assembled by thick sediments and <a href="volcanic%20arc">volcanic arc</a>s accreting onto the edge of the <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> in a series of long thin <a href="terranes">terranes</a>. The parallel hill ranges of the Catlins form part of the Murihiku terrane, which extends inland through the <a href="Hokonui%20Hills">Hokonui Hills</a> as far west as <a href="Mossburn">Mossburn</a>. This itself forms part of a larger system known as the <a href="Southland%20Syncline">Southland Syncline</a>, a <a href="fold%20%28geology%29">fold</a> system which links to similar formations in <a href="Tasman%20District">Tasman District</a> (offset by the <a href="Alpine%20Fault">Alpine Fault</a>), the <a href="North%20Island">North Island</a> and even <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>, away.

The north-eastern boundary of this geologic region is marked by the Murihiku escarpment, which runs along the southern edge of the dormant Hillfoot fault line. The Catlins ranges are <a href="strike%20ridge">strike ridge</a>s composed of <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> and <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>s, <a href="mudstone">mudstone</a>s and other related sedimentary rocks, often with a high incidence of <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a>. Fossils of the late and middle Triassic <a href="New%20Zealand%20geologic%20time%20scale">Warepan and Kaihikuan</a> stages are found in the area.

<a href="Curio%20Bay">Curio Bay</a> features the petrified remains of a forest 160 million years old. This represents a remnant of the subtropical woodland that once covered the region, only to become submerged by the sea. The fossilised remnants of trees closely related to modern <a href="kauri">kauri</a> and <a href="Norfolk%20pine">Norfolk pine</a> can be seen here.

The Catlins area has very few inhabitants; the region as a whole has a population of only some 1200 people. Almost all of the Catlins' population lies either close to the route of the former <a href="New%20Zealand%20state%20highway%20network">state highway</a> running from <a href="Balclutha%2C%20New%20Zealand">Balclutha</a> to <a href="Invercargill">Invercargill</a> (which now forms part of the <a href="Southern%20Scenic%20Route">Southern Scenic Route</a>), or in numerous tiny coastal settlements, most of which have only a few dozen inhabitants.

The largest town in the Catlins, <a href="Owaka">Owaka</a>, has a population of about 400. It is located southwest of Balclutha. The only other settlements of any great size are <a href="Kaka%20Point">Kaka Point</a> (populationÂ 200), Waikawa, <a href="Tokanui">Tokanui</a>, and Fortrose, which lies at the western edge of the Catlins on the estuary of the <a href="Mataura%20River">Mataura River</a>. Most of the area's other settlements are either little more than farming communities (such as <a href="Romahapa">Romahapa</a>, <a href="Maclennan%2C%20New%20Zealand">Maclennan</a>, and <a href="Glenomaru">Glenomaru</a>) or seasonally populated holiday communities with few permanent residents. An outdoor education centre, run by the Otago Youth Adventure Trust is located at Tautuku, almost exactly halfway between Owaka and Waikawa.

The area's population has predominantly European ancestry, with 94.2% of Owaka's population belonging to the European ethnic group according to the 2001 Census, compared to 93.7% for the Otago region and 80.1% for New Zealand as a whole. The median income in the same census ranked considerably lower than for most of the country, although the unemployment rate was very low (3.2%, compared with 7.5% nationwide).

The early European economy of the Catlins during the 1830s and 1840s centred on <a href="whaling">whaling</a> and <a href="seal%20hunting">sealing</a>. The exploitation of the forests for timber started in the 1860s with the rapid growth of the city of Dunedin as a result of the <a href="Central%20Otago%20Goldrush">goldrush of 1861â62</a>. In the early 1870s more timber cargo was loaded at Owaka than at any other New Zealand port. Forestry and sawmilling declined in the late 1880s once the easily accessible timber had been removed. The extension of the railway beyond Owaka breathed new life into these industries, however, with activity peaking during the 1920s.

The land cleared of trees largely became pasture. From the 1880s, clearing of land for dairy farming increased, especially in the areas around Tahakopa and the Owaka River valley. Considerable sheep and dairy farming continues on the cleared hills on the periphery of the region, and this accounts for much of the Catlins' income. A rural polytechnic specialising in agricultural science (<a href="Telford%20Rural%20Polytechnic">Telford Rural Polytechnic</a>) is located south of Balclutha close to the northeastern edge of the Catlins.

Fishing and tourism now account for much of the area's economy. The rugged natural scenery, sense of isolation, and natural attractions such as <a href="Cathedral%20Caves">Cathedral Caves</a> makes the Catlins a popular destination for weekend trips by people from Dunedin and Invercargill, the two nearest cities. A large number of <a href="Bach%20%28New%20Zealand%29">crib</a>s (holiday cottages) occur at places such as <a href="Jack%27s%20Bay">Jack's Bay</a> and <a href="Pounawea">Pounawea</a>. <a href="Ecotourism">Ecotourism</a> is becoming increasingly important to the area's economy, with many of the visitors coming from overseas. Tourism added an estimated $2.4 million to the region's economy in 2003.

The <a href="Southern%20Scenic%20Route">Southern Scenic Route</a> links <a href="Fiordland">Fiordland</a> and Dunedin via the Catlins. Here it runs northeast to southwest as an alternative road to <a href="New%20Zealand%20State%20Highway%201">State Highway 1</a>, which skirts the Catlins to the northwest. This section of the Southern Scenic Routeâformerly designated <a href="New%20Zealand%20State%20Highway%2092">State Highway 92</a> but no longer listed as a state highwayâwinds through most of the small settlements in the area, and was only completely <a href="chipseal">sealed</a> during the late 1990s (a stretch of about southwest of Tautuku was <a href="gravel%20road">surfaced with gravel</a> prior to that time). The settlements of Owaka, Maclennan, Papatowai, Tokanui, and Fortrose all lie on this route. A coastal route also parallels the inland highway between Waikawa and Fortrose, but only about two thirds of this road is sealed.

The remaining small roads in the district, all of which link with the former State Highway, have <a href="gravel%20road">gravel surfaces</a>. These roads mainly link the main route with small coastal settlements, although gravel roads also extend along the valleys of the Owaka and Tahakopa Rivers, linking the main Catlins route with the small towns of <a href="Clinton%2C%20New%20Zealand">Clinton</a> and Wyndham respectively. The gravelled Waikawa Valley Road crosses the hills to join the Tahakopa-Wyndham route.

Several of the area's coastal settlements have facilities for small boats, but generally only fishing and holiday craft use them; no regular passenger or freight-boat service runs to the Catlins. A railway line, the <a href="Catlins%20River%20Branch">Catlins River Branch</a>, linked the area with the <a href="South%20Island%20Main%20Trunk%20Line">South Island Main Trunk Line</a> from the late 19th century. Construction of this line began in 1879, but it did not reach Owaka until 1896. Construction progressed slowly due to the difficult terrain, and the final terminus of the line at Tahakopa was not completed until 1915.
The economic viability of the line declined with the sawmills that it was built to serve, and the line was eventually closed in 1971. Parts of the line's route are now accessible as walkways, among them a long tunnel ("Tunnel Hill") between Owaka and Glenomaru.

The Catlins forms part of the <a href="Clutha-Southland">Clutha-Southland</a> <a href="New%20Zealand%20electorates">electorate</a> in the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Parliament">New Zealand Parliament</a>. Between 1996 and 2014, the electorate was represented by <a href="Bill%20English">Bill English</a> of the <a href="New%20Zealand%20National%20Party">National Party</a>, who was <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20New%20Zealand">Prime Minister of New Zealand</a> and a former <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Leader of the Opposition</a>. The Catlins area is split between the <a href="Clutha%20District">Clutha</a> and <a href="Southland%20District">Southland District</a>s for local government purposes.

Most of the Catlins falls in the Clutha District, based in Balclutha, and one of the council's fourteen representatives is elected directly from a Catlins Ward which is roughly coterminous with this area. The Clutha District is itself part of the Otago Region, controlled administratively by the <a href="Otago%20Regional%20Council">Otago Regional Council</a> (ORC) in Dunedin, to the northeast of Balclutha. The Molyneux Constituency of the ORC, which covers roughly the same area as the Clutha District, elects two councillors to the 12-member Regional Council.

Approximately the westernmost one-third of the Catlins area lies in the Southland District, based in Invercargill, to the west of Fortrose. One of the council's 12 elected members represents the Toetoes Ward, which contains this part of the Catlins, along with an area around Wyndham and extending along <a href="Toetoes%20Bay">Toetoes Bay</a> towards the <a href="Awarua%20Plain">Awarua Plain</a>. The Southland District is itself part of the Southland Region, controlled administratively by the <a href="Southland%20Regional%20Council">Southland Regional Council</a> (SRC; also known as "Environment Southland"), which is also based in Invercargill. The Southern Constituency of the SRC, which covers the entire Toetoes Ward and extends across the Awarua Plain almost as far as <a href="Bluff%2C%20New%20Zealand">Bluff</a> in the west and <a href="Mataura">Mataura</a> in the north, elects one councillor to the 12-member Regional Council.

The Catlins area hosts four co-educational schools: Tahakopa School, Tokanui School, and Romahapa School, all of which are primary schools; The Catlins Area School, Owaka is a combined primary and secondary school. It is the only one of the four with more than 100 pupils. The nearest dedicated secondary schools are <a href="South%20Otago%20High%20School">South Otago High School</a> in Balclutha and <a href="Menzies%20College">Menzies College</a> in Wyndham.

The nearest tertiary institution is <a href="Telford%20Rural%20Polytechnic">Telford Rural Polytechnic</a>, located at the edge of the Catlins at <a href="Otanomomo">Otanomomo</a>, south of Balclutha. Other than this, the nearest tertiary establishments are in Invercargill and Dunedin, the nearest university being the <a href="University%20of%20Otago">University of Otago</a> in Dunedin.

A hospital opened in Owaka in 1924, offering a decreasing range of services until its closure during the 1980s. The building and grounds now host a youth hostel and holiday park. Today, Owaka is served by a medical centre and a pharmacy. The Southern <a href="District%20Health%20Board">District Health Board</a> is responsible for most publicly funded health services in Otago and Southland, including the Catlins.

The nearest hospital to most of the area is the community owned Clutha Health First, in Balclutha. There is another small hospital in Gore, a secondary level hospital in Invercargill, and a tertiary level hospital (<a href="Dunedin%20Public%20Hospital">Dunedin Public Hospital</a>) in Dunedin. The last two are also university teaching hospitals.

Canadian National Vimy Memorial

The Canadian National Vimy Memorial is a <a href="war%20memorial">war memorial</a> site in <a href="France">France</a> dedicated to the memory of <a href="Canadian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Canadian Expeditionary Force</a> members killed during the <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Canada%20during%20World%20War%20I">First World War</a>. It also serves as the place of commemoration for Canadian soldiers of the First World War killed or presumed dead in France who have no known grave. The monument is the centrepiece of a preserved battlefield park that encompasses a portion of the ground over which the <a href="Canadian%20Corps">Canadian Corps</a> made their assault during the initial <a href="Battle%20of%20Vimy%20Ridge">Battle of Vimy Ridge</a> offensive of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a>.

The Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first time all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, and it became a Canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice. France ceded to Canada perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge on the understanding that Canada use the land to establish a battlefield park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, <a href="trench%20warfare">trenches</a>, craters, and <a href="unexploded%20ordnance">unexploded munitions</a> still honeycomb the grounds of the site, which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park.

The project took designer <a href="Walter%20Seymour%20Allward">Walter Seymour Allward</a> eleven years to build. King <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a> unveiled it on 26 July 1936 in the presence of <a href="President%20of%20France">French President</a> <a href="Albert%20Lebrun">Albert Lebrun</a> and a crowd of over 50,000 people, including 6,200 attendees from Canada. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> re-dedicated the monument on 9 April 2007 at a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. The site is maintained by <a href="Veterans%20Affairs%20Canada">Veterans Affairs Canada</a>. The Vimy Memorial is one of only two <a href="National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada">National Historic Sites of Canada</a> located outside the country, the other being the <a href="Beaumont-Hamel%20Newfoundland%20Memorial">Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial</a>.

Vimy Ridge is a gradually rising <a href="escarpment">escarpment</a> on the western edge of the Douai Plains, northeast of <a href="Arras">Arras</a>. The ridge gradually rises on its western side, dropping more quickly on the eastern side. The ridge is approximately in length, wide at its narrowest point, and culminates at an elevation of above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, or above the Douai Plains, providing a natural unobstructed view for tens of kilometres in all directions.

The ridge fell under <a href="German%20Empire">German</a> control in October 1914, during the <a href="Race%20to%20the%20Sea">Race to the Sea</a>, as the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Franco-British</a> and German forces continually attempted to outflank each other through northeastern France. The <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28France%29">French Tenth Army</a> attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Artois">Second Battle of Artois</a> in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and <a href="Notre%20Dame%20de%20Lorette">Notre Dame de Lorette</a>. During the attack, the French <a href="Moroccan%20Division%20%28France%29">1st Moroccan Division</a> briefly captured the height of the ridge, where the Vimy memorial is currently located, but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. The French made another attempt during the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Artois">Third Battle of Artois</a> in September 1915, but were once again unsuccessful in capturing the top of the ridge. The French suffered approximately 150,000 casualties in their attempts to gain control of Vimy Ridge and surrounding territory.

The British <a href="XVII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XVII Corps</a> relieved the French Tenth Army from the sector in February 1916. On 21 May 1916, the German infantry attacked the British lines along a front in an effort to force them from positions along the base of the ridge. The Germans captured several British-controlled tunnels and <a href="Mining%20%28military%29">mine</a> craters before halting their advance and entrenching their positions. Temporary Lieutenant <a href="Richard%20Basil%20Brandram%20Jones">Richard Basil Brandram Jones</a> was posthumously awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> for his ultimately unsuccessful defence of the Broadmarsh Crater during the attack. British counter-attacks on 22 May did not manage to change the situation. The Canadian Corps relieved the British <a href="IV%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">IV Corps</a> stationed along the western slopes of Vimy Ridge in October 1916.

The Battle of Vimy Ridge was the first instance in which all four Canadian divisions participated in a battle together, as a cohesive formation. The nature and size of the planned Canadian Corps assault necessitated support and resources beyond its normal operational capabilities. Consequently, the British <a href="5th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">5th Infantry Division</a> and supplementary artillery, engineer and labour units reinforced the four Canadian divisions already in place. The <a href="24th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">24th British Division</a> of <a href="I%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">I Corps</a> supported the Canadian Corps along its northern flank while the XVII Corps did so to the south. The ad hoc formation, based under <a href="I%20Royal%20Bavarian%20Reserve%20Corps">I Bavarian Reserve Corps</a> commander <a href="Karl%20von%20Fasbender">Karl Ritter von Fasbender</a>, was the principal defending formation with three divisions responsible for manning the frontline defences opposite the Canadian Corps.
The attack began at 5:30Â am on <a href="Easter%20Monday">Easter Monday</a>, 9 April 1917. Light <a href="field%20gun">field gun</a>s laid down a <a href="barrage%20%28artillery%29">barrage</a> that advanced in predetermined increments, often every three minutes, while medium and heavy <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a>s established a series of standing barrages against known defensive systems further ahead. The <a href="1st%20Canadian%20Division">1st</a>, <a href="2nd%20Canadian%20Division">2nd</a>, and <a href="3rd%20Canadian%20Division">3rd Canadian Division</a>s quickly captured their first objectives. The <a href="4th%20Canadian%20Division">4th Canadian Division</a> encountered a great deal of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Canadian Divisions captured their second objective by approximately 7:30Â am. The failure of the 4th Canadian Division to capture the top of the ridge delayed further advances and forced the 3rd Canadian Division to expend resources establishing a defensive line to its north. Reserve units from the 4th Canadian Division renewed the attack on the German positions on the top of the ridge and eventually forced the German troops holding the southwestern portion of HillÂ 145 to withdraw.

On the morning of 10 April, Canadian Corps commander <a href="Lieutenant-General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Julian%20H.G.%20Byng%2C%20Viscount%20Byng%20of%20Vimy">Julian Byng</a> moved up three fresh <a href="brigade">brigade</a>s to support the continued advance. The fresh units leapfrogged units already in place and captured the third objective line, including Hill 135 and the town of <a href="Th%C3%A9lus">ThÃ©lus</a>, by 11:00Â am. By 2:00Â pm both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reported capturing their final objectives. By this point the "Pimple", a heavily defended knoll west of the town of <a href="Givenchy-en-Gohelle">Givenchy-en-Gohelle</a>, was the only German position remaining on Vimy Ridge. On 12 April, the <a href="10th%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Brigade">10th Canadian Brigade</a> attacked and quickly overcame the hastily entrenched German troops, with the support of artillery and the 24th British Division. By nightfall on 12 April, the Canadian Corps was in firm control of the ridge. The Canadian Corps suffered 10,602 casualties: 3,598 killed and 7,004 wounded. The German <a href="6th%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">Sixth Army</a> suffered an unknown number of casualties, and around 4,000 men became <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war%23World%20War%20I">prisoners of war</a>.

Although the battle is not generally considered Canada's greatest military achievement, the image of national unity and achievement imbued the battle with considerable national significance for Canada. According to Pierce, "the historical reality of the battle has been reworked and reinterpreted in a conscious attempt to give purpose and meaning to an event that came to symbolize Canada's coming of age as a nation." The idea that Canada's identity and nationhood were born out of the battle is an opinion that is widely held in military and general histories of Canada.

In 1920, the Government of Canada announced that the <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> had awarded Canada eight sitesâfive in France and three in Belgiumâon which to erect memorials. Each site represented a significant Canadian engagement, and the Canadian government initially decided that each battlefield be treated equally and commemorated with identical monuments. In September 1920, the Canadian government formed the <a href="Canadian%20Battlefields%20Memorials%20Commission">Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission</a> to discuss the process and conditions for holding a memorial competition for the sites in Europe. The commission held its first meeting on 26 November 1920 and during this meeting decided that the <a href="architectural%20design%20competition">architectural design competition</a> would be open to all Canadian architects, designers, sculptors, and artists. The jury consisted of <a href="Charles%20Herbert%20Reilly">Charles Herbert Reilly</a> representing the <a href="Royal%20Institute%20of%20British%20Architects">Royal Institute of British Architects</a>, <a href="Paul%20Philippe%20Cret">Paul Philippe Cret</a> representing the <a href="Soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9%20centrale%20des%20architectes%20fran%C3%A7ais">SociÃ©tÃ© centrale des architectes franÃ§ais</a> and <a href="Frank%20Darling%20%28architect%29">Frank Darling</a> representing the <a href="Royal%20Architectural%20Institute%20of%20Canada">Royal Architectural Institute of Canada</a>. Each jury member was a leader in the architectural field; Reilly was training students in design and development of war memorials, and Cret had been selected by the United States to design national monuments in Europe. Interested parties submitted 160 design drawings, and the jury selected 17Â submissions for consideration, commissioning each finalist to produce a plaster <a href="maquette">maquette</a> of their respective design. The jury recommended in a 10 September 1921 report to the commission that two of the designs be executed. In October 1921, the commission formally selected the submission of <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> sculptor and designer <a href="Walter%20Seymour%20Allward">Walter Seymour Allward</a> as the winner of the competition; the design submitted by Frederick Chapman Clemesha was selected as runner-up. The complexity of Allward's design precluded the possibility of duplicating the design at each site. The approach of selecting one primary memorial ran counter to the recommendation of Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission architectural advisor <a href="Percy%20Erskine%20Nobbs">Percy Erskine Nobbs</a>, who had consistently expressed his preference for a series of smaller monuments. The consensus went in Allward's favour, his design receiving both public and critical approval. The commission revised its initial plans and decided to build two distinctive memorialsâthose of Allward and Clemeshaâand six smaller identical memorials.
At the outset, members of the commission debated where to build Allward's winning design. The jury's assessment was that Allward's submission was best suited to a "low hill rather than to a continuous and lofty bluff or cliff like Vimy Ridge". The commission committee initially recommended placing the monument in Belgium on <a href="Hill%2062%20Memorial">Hill 62</a>, near the location of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mont%20Sorrel">Battle of Mont Sorrel</a>, as the site provided an imposing view. This ran counter to the desires of Prime Minister <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a> who, while speaking in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons of Canada</a> in May 1922, argued in favour of placing the memorial at Vimy Ridge. King's position received the unanimous support of the House and, in the end, the commission selected Vimy Ridge as the preferred site. The government announced its desire to acquire a more considerable tract of land along the ridge after the commission selected Vimy Ridge as the preferred location for Allward's design. In the interval between the 1st and 2nd session of the <a href="14th%20Canadian%20Parliament">14th Canadian Parliament</a>, <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada</a> <a href="Rodolphe%20Lemieux">Rodolphe Lemieux</a> went to France to negotiate the acquisition of more land. On 5 December 1922, Lemieux concluded an agreement with France in which France granted Canada "freely and for all time" the use of of land on Vimy Ridge, inclusive of Hill 145, in recognition of Canada's war effort. The only condition placed on the donation was that Canada use the land to erect a monument commemorating Canadian soldiers killed during the First World War and assume the responsibility for the maintenance of the memorial and the surrounding battlefield park.

Following the competition, Allward spent the remainder of 1921 and the spring of 1922 preparing for his move to Europe. After selling his home and studio, Allward finally departed for Belgium on 6 June 1922 and spent several months seeking a suitable studio in Belgium and then Paris, though he eventually set up a studio in <a href="London">London</a>.

Allward had initially hoped to use white <a href="marble">marble</a> for the memorial's facing stone, but Percy Nobbs suggested this would be a mistake because marble was unlikely to weather well in northern France and the memorial would have a "ghost like" appearance. Allward undertook a tour of almost two years to find stone of the right colour, texture, and luminosity. He found it in the ruins of <a href="Diocletian%27s%20Palace">Diocletian's Palace</a> at <a href="Split%2C%20Croatia">Split, Croatia</a>; he observed that the palace had not weathered over the years, which Allward took as evidence of the stone's durability. His choiceâSeget <a href="limestone">limestone</a>âcame from an ancient Roman quarry located near <a href="Seget%2C%20Croatia">Seget, Croatia</a>. The difficulties with the quarrying process, coupled with complicated transportation logistics, delayed delivery of the limestone and thus construction of the memorial. The first shipment did not arrive at the site until 1927, and the larger blocks, intended for the human figures, did not begin to arrive until 1931.

On Allward's urging the Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission hired Oscar Faber, a Danish structural engineer, in 1924 to prepare foundation plans and provide general supervision of the foundation work. Faber had recently designed the substructure for the <a href="Menin%20Gate">Menin Gate</a> at Ypres, and he selected a design that employed cast-in-place reinforced concrete to which the facing stone would be bonded. Major Unwin Simson served as the principal Canadian engineer during the construction of the memorial and oversaw much of the daily operations at the site. Allward moved to Paris in 1925 to supervise construction and the carving of the sculptures. Construction commenced in 1925 and took eleven years to complete. The Imperial War Graves Commission concurrently employed French and British veterans to carry out the necessary roadwork and site landscaping.

While awaiting the first delivery of stone, Simson noticed that the battlefield landscape features were beginning to deteriorate. Seeing an opportunity to not only preserve a portion of the battlefield but also keep his staff occupied, Simson decided to preserve a short section of trench line and make the Grange Subway more accessible. Labourers rebuilt and preserved sections of sandbagged trench wall, on both the Canadian and German sides of the Grange crater group, in concrete. The workforce also built a new concrete entrance for the Grange Subway and, after excavating a portion of the tunnel system, installed electric lighting.
Allward chose a relatively new construction method for the monument: limestone bonded to a cast concrete frame. A foundation bed of 11,000 tonnes of concrete, reinforced with hundreds of tonnes of steel, served as the support bed for the memorial. The memorial base and twin pylons contained almost 6,000 tonnes of Seget limestone. Sculptors carved the 20 approximately double life-sized human figures on site from large blocks of stone. The carvers used half-size plaster models produced by Allward in his studio, now on display at the <a href="Canadian%20War%20Museum">Canadian War Museum</a>, and an instrument called a <a href="pantograph">pantograph</a> to reproduce the figures at the proper scale. The carvers conducted their work year-round inside temporary studios built around each figure. The inclusion of the names of those killed in France with no known grave was not part of the original design, and Allward was unhappy when the government asked him to include them. Allward argued that the inclusion of names was not part of the original commissioning. Through a letter to Canadian Battlefields Memorials Commission in October 1927, Allward indicated his intention to relegate the names of the missing to pavement stones around the monument. The collective dismay and uproar of the commission forced Allward to relent and incorporate the names of the missing on the memorial walls. The task of inscribing the names did not begin until the early 1930s and employed a typeface that Allward designed for the monument.
In 1919, the year after the war ended, around 60,000 British tourists and mourners made <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>s to the Western Front. The transatlantic voyage was longer and more expensive from Canada; many attempts to organize large pilgrimages failed, and journeys overseas were largely made individually or in small, unofficial groups. The delegates of the 1928 national convention of the <a href="Canadian%20Legion">Canadian Legion</a> passed a unanimous resolution asking that a pilgrimage be organized to the Western Front battlefields. A plan began to take form wherein the Legion aimed to coordinate the pilgrimage with the unveiling of the Vimy memorial, which at the time was expected to be completed in 1931 or 1932. Due to construction delays with the memorial, it was not until July 1934 that the Canadian Legion announced a pilgrimage to former battlefield sites in conjunction with the unveiling of the memorial. Although the exact date of the memorial unveiling was still not set, the Legion invited former service members to make tentative reservations with their headquarters in Ottawa. The response from veterans and their families was enthusiasticâ1,200 inquiries by November 1934. The Legion presumptuously announced that the memorial would be unveiled on <a href="Canada%20Day">Dominion Day</a>, 1 July 1936, even though the government still did not know when it would be completed.

For event planning purposes, the Legion and the government established areas for which each was responsible. The government was responsible for selection of the official delegation and the program for the official unveiling of the memorial. The Legion was responsible for the more challenging task of organizing the pilgrimage. For the Legion this included planning meals, accommodations and transportation for what was at the time the largest single peacetime movement of people from Canada to Europe. The Legion took the position that the pilgrimage would be funded by its members without subsidies or financial aid from Canadian taxpayers, and by early 1935 they had established that the price of the 3Â½-week trip, inclusive of all meals, accommodation, health insurance, and sea and land transportation would be per person ($ as of 2016). Indirect assistance came in a number of forms. The government waived passport fees and made a special Vimy passport available to pilgrims at no extra cost. The government and private sector also provided paid leave for their participating employees. It was not until April 1936 that the government was prepared to publicly commit to an unveiling date, 26 July 1936. On 16 July, the five transatlantic liners, escorted by and , departed the <a href="Port%20of%20Montreal">Port of Montreal</a> with approximately 6,200 passengers and arrived in <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a> on 24 and 25 July. The limited accommodation made it necessary for the Legion to lodge pilgrims in nine cities throughout northern France and Belgium and employ 235 buses to move the pilgrims between various locations.

On 26 July, the day of the ceremony, pilgrims spent the morning and early afternoon exploring the landscape of the memorial park before congregating at the monument. For the ceremony, sailors from HMCS "Saguenay" provided the <a href="guard%20of%20honour">guard of honour</a>. Also present were The Royal Canadian Horse Artillery Band, French army engineers, and French-Moroccan cavalry who had fought on the site during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Artois">Second Battle of Artois</a>. The ceremony itself was broadcast live by the <a href="Canadian%20Radio%20Broadcasting%20Commission">Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission</a> over <a href="shortwave%20radio">shortwave radio</a>, with facilities of the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> transmitting the ceremony to Canada. Senior Canadian, British, and European officials, including French President <a href="Albert%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lebrun">Albert Lebrun</a>, and a crowd of over 50,000 attended the event. Absent, though, was Canadian Prime Minister <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a>, it being well understood that he was generally not comfortable around veterans and felt it more appropriate for a war veteran in Cabinet to act as minister in attendance.

Before the ceremony began, King <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a>, present in his capacity as <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Canada">king of Canada</a>, inspected the guard of honour, was introduced to the honoured guests, and spent approximately half an hour speaking with veterans in the crowd. Two <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> and two <a href="French%20Air%20Force">French Air Force</a> squadrons flew over the monument and dipped their wings in salute. The ceremony itself began with prayers from chaplains representing the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, the <a href="United%20Church%20of%20Canada">United Church of Canada</a>, and the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. <a href="Ernest%20Lapointe">Ernest Lapointe</a>, <a href="Minister%20of%20Justice%20%28Canada%29">Canadian Minister of Justice</a>, spoke first, followed by Edward VIII who, in both French and English, thanked France for its generosity and assured those assembled that Canada would never forget its war missing and dead. The King then pulled the <a href="Union%20Flag">Royal Union Flag</a> from the central figure of "Canada Bereft" and the military band played the <a href="Last%20Post">Last Post</a>. The ceremony was one of the King's few official duties before he <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">abdicated the throne</a>. The pilgrimage continued, and most participants toured <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a> before being taken to London to be hosted by the <a href="British%20Legion">British Legion</a>. One-third of the pilgrims left from London for Canada on 1 August, while the majority returned to France as guests of the government for another week of touring before going home.

In 1939, the increased threat of conflict with <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> amplified the Canadian government's level of concern for the general safety of the memorial. Canada could do little more than protect the sculptures and the bases of the pylons with sandbags and await developments. When war did break out in September 1939, the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF) deployed to France and assumed responsibility for the Arras sector, which included Vimy. In late May 1940, following the British <a href="Battle%20of%20Dunkirk">retreat to Dunkirk</a> after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281940%29">Battle of Arras</a>, the status and condition of the memorial became unknown to <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied forces</a>. The Germans took control of the site and held the site's caretaker, George Stubbs, in an <a href="Ilag">Ilag</a> internment camp for Allied civilians in <a href="Ilag%23St.Denis">St. Denis</a>, France. The rumoured destruction of the Vimy Memorial, either during the fighting or at the hands of the Germans, was widely reported in Canada and the United Kingdom. The rumours led the German <a href="Reich%20Ministry%20of%20Public%20Enlightenment%20and%20Propaganda">Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda</a> to formally deny accusations that Germany had damaged or desecrated the memorial. To demonstrate the memorial had not been desecrated, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, who reportedly admired the memorial for its peaceful nature, was photographed by the press while personally touring it and the preserved trenches on 2 June 1940. The undamaged state of the memorial was not confirmed until September 1944 when British troops of the 2nd Battalion, <a href="Welsh%20Guards">Welsh Guards</a> of the <a href="Guards%20Armoured%20Division">Guards Armoured Division</a> recaptured Vimy Ridge.

Immediately following the Second World War, very little attention was paid to the Battle of Vimy Ridge or the Vimy Memorial. The "<a href="Winnipeg%20Free%20Press">Winnipeg Free Press</a>" and "The Legionary", the magazine of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Legion">Royal Canadian Legion</a>, were the only publications to note the 35th anniversary of the battle in 1952. The 40th anniversary in 1957 received even less notice, with only the "<a href="Halifax%20Herald">Halifax Herald</a>" making any mention. Interest in commemoration remained low in the early 1960s but increased in 1967 with the 50th anniversary of the battle, paired with the <a href="Canadian%20Centennial">Canadian Centennial</a>. A heavily attended ceremony at the memorial in April 1967 was broadcast live on television. Commemoration of the battle decreased once again throughout the 1970s and only returned in force with the 125th anniversary of <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Canadian Confederation</a> and the widely covered 75th anniversary of the battle in 1992. The 1992 ceremony at the memorial was attended by Canadian Prime Minister <a href="Brian%20Mulroney">Brian Mulroney</a> and at least 5,000 people. Subsequent smaller-scale ceremonies were held at the memorial in 1997 and 2002.

By the end of the century, the many repairs undertaken since the memorial's construction had left a patchwork of materials and colours, and a disconcerting pattern of damage from water intrusion at the joints. In May 2001, the Government of Canada announced the <a href="Canadian%20Battlefield%20Memorials%20Restoration%20Project">Canadian Battlefield Memorials Restoration Project</a>, a major <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>30Â million restoration project to restore Canada's memorial sites in France and Belgium, in order to maintain and present them in a respectful and dignified manner. In 2005, the Vimy memorial closed for major restoration work. Veterans Affairs Canada directed the restoration of the memorial in cooperation with other Canadian departments, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, consultants and specialists in military history.

Time, wear, and severe weather conditions led to many identified problems, the single most pervasive being <a href="water%20damage">water damage</a>. In building a memorial made of cast concrete covered in stone, Allward had failed to take into account how these materials would shift over time. The builders and designer failed to incorporate sufficient space between the concrete and stones, which resulted in water infiltrating the structure through its walls and platforms, dissolving lime in the concrete foundation and masonry. As the water exited, it deposited the lime on exterior surfaces, obscuring many of the names inscribed thereon. Poor drainage and water flows off the monument also caused significant deterioration of the platform, terrace, and stairs. The restoration project intended to address the root causes of damage and included repairs to the stone, walkways, walls, terraces, stairs, and platforms. In order to respect Allward's initial vision of a seamless structure, the restoration team were required to remove all foreign materials employed in patchwork repairs, replace damaged stones with material from the original quarry in Croatia, and correct all minor displacement of stones caused by the freeze-thaw activity. Underlying structural flaws were also corrected.

Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, escorted by <a href="Prince%20Philip%2C%20Duke%20of%20Edinburgh">Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh</a>, rededicated the restored memorial on 9 April 2007 in a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle. Other senior Canadian officials, including Prime Minister <a href="Stephen%20Harper">Stephen Harper</a>, and senior French representatives, <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20France">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Dominique%20de%20Villepin">Dominique de Villepin</a> among them, attended the event, along with thousands of Canadian students, veterans of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> and of more recent conflicts, and descendants of those who fought at Vimy. The crowd attending the rededication ceremony was the largest crowd on the site since the 1936 dedication.

The centennial commemoration of the Battle of Vimy Ridge took place at the memorial on 9 April 2017, coincidentally during the <a href="150th%20anniversary%20of%20Canada">Canadian sesquicentennial celebrations</a>. Estimates before the event indicated that an audience of up to 30,000 would be present. The Mayor of <a href="Arras">Arras</a>, FrÃ©dÃ©ric Leturque, thanked Canadians, along with Australians, Britons, New Zealanders and South Africans, for their role in the First World War battles in the area.

Attending dignitaries for Canada included <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General</a> <a href="David%20Johnston">David Johnston</a>; <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince Charles</a>; <a href="Prince%20William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Prince William, Duke of Cambridge</a>; <a href="Prince%20Harry">Prince Harry</a>; and Prime Minister <a href="Justin%20Trudeau">Justin Trudeau</a>. <a href="President%20of%20France">President</a> <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Hollande">FranÃ§ois Hollande</a> and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20France">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Bernard%20Cazeneuve">Bernard Cazeneuve</a> represented France. Elizabeth II issued a statement via the Governor General, remarking "[Canadians] fought courageously and with great ingenuity in winning the strategic high point of Vimy Ridge, though victory came at a heavy cost".

Two postage stamps are being released jointly by <a href="Canada%20Post">Canada Post</a> and France's <a href="La%20Poste%20%28France%29">La Poste</a> featuring the memorial, one designed by each country, to commemorate the centennial of the Battle of Vimy Ridge.

The Canadian National Vimy Memorial site is located approximately north of Arras, France, circled by the small towns and communes of <a href="Vimy">Vimy</a> to the east, <a href="Givenchy-en-Gohelle">Givenchy-en-Gohelle</a> to the north, <a href="Souchez">Souchez</a> to the northwest, <a href="Neuville-Saint-Vaast">Neuville-Saint-Vaast</a> to the south and <a href="Th%C3%A9lus">ThÃ©lus</a> to the southeast. The site is one of the few places on the former <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> where a visitor can see the <a href="trench%20warfare">trench lines</a> of a First World War battlefield and the related terrain in a preserved natural state. The total area of the site is , much of which is forested and off limits to visitors to ensure public safety. The site's rough terrain and buried <a href="unexploded%20ordnance">unexploded munitions</a> make the task of grass cutting too dangerous for human operators. Instead, sheep graze the open meadows of the site.

The site was established to honour the memory of the Canadian Corps, but it also contains other memorials. These are dedicated to the French Moroccan Division, <a href="Lions%20Club%20International">Lions Club International</a>, and Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins. There are also two Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries on site: <a href="Canadian%20Cemetery%20No.%202">Canadian Cemetery No. 2</a> and <a href="Givenchy%20Road%20Canadian%20Cemetery">Givenchy Road Canadian Cemetery</a>. Beyond being a popular location for battlefield tours, the site is also an important location in the burgeoning field of First World War <a href="battlefield%20archaeology">battlefield archaeology</a>, because of its preserved and largely undisturbed state. The site's interpretive centre helps visitors fully understand the Vimy Memorial, the preserved battlefield park, and the history of the Battle of Vimy within the context of Canada's participation in the First World War. The Canadian National Vimy Memorial and <a href="Beaumont-Hamel%20Newfoundland%20Memorial">Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial</a> sites comprise close to 80Â percent of conserved First World War battlefields in existence and between them receive over one million visitors each year.

Allward constructed the memorial on the vantage point of Hill 145, the highest point on the ridge. The memorial contains many stylized features, including 20 human figures, which help the viewer in contemplating the structure as a whole. The front wall, normally mistaken for the rear, is high and represents an impenetrable wall of defence. There is a group of figures at each end of the front wall, next to the base of the steps. The "Breaking of the Sword" is located at the southern corner of the front wall while "Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless" is located at the northern corner. Collectively, the two groups are "The Defenders" and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in <a href="laurel%20wreath">laurel</a> and <a href="olive%20branch">olive branch</a>es carved into the wall above each group, to symbolize victory and peace. In "Breaking of the Sword", three young men are present, one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword. This statue represents the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. This grouping of figures is the most overt image to <a href="pacifism">pacifism</a> in the monument, the breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials. The original plan for the sculpture included one figure crushing a German helmet with his foot. It was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In "Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless", one man stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, are crouched and kneeling around him. The standing man represents Canada's sympathy for the weak and oppressed.

The figure of a cloaked young woman stands on top and at the centre of the front wall and overlooks the Douai Plains. She has her head bowed, her eyes cast down, and her chin resting in one hand. Below her at ground level is a sarcophagus, bearing a <a href="Brodie%20helmet">Brodie helmet</a> and a sword, and draped in laurel branches. The saddened figure of "Canada Bereft", also known as "Mother Canada", is a <a href="national%20personification">national personification</a> of the young nation of Canada, mourning her dead. The statue, a reference to traditional images of the and presented in a similar style to that of <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s <a href="Piet%C3%A0%20%28Michelangelo%29">PietÃ </a>, faces eastward looking out to the dawn of the new day. Unlike the other statues on the monument, stonemasons carved "Canada Bereft" from a single 30Â tonne block of stone. The statue is the largest single piece in the monument and serves as a focal point. The area in front of the memorial was turned into a grassed space, which Allward referred to as the amphitheatre, that fanned out from the monument's front wall for a distance of while the battle-damaged landscape around the sides and back of the monument were left untouched.
The twin pylons rise to a height 30Â metres above the memorial's stone platform; one bears the <a href="maple%20leaf">maple leaf</a> for Canada and the other the <a href="fleur-de-lis">fleur-de-lis</a> for France, and both symbolize the unity and sacrifice of the two countries. At the top of the pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the "Chorus". The most senior figures represent "Justice" and "Peace"; "Peace" stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. The pair is in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of "Truth" and "Justice", located outside the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Canada">Supreme Court of Canada</a> in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>. The remainder of the "Chorus" is located directly below the senior figures: "Faith", "Hope" and "Truth" on the eastern pylon; and "Honour", "Charity" and "Knowledge" on the western pylon. Around these figures are shields of Canada, Britain, and France. Large <a href="memorial%20cross">crosses</a> adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments, and a dedicatory message to Canada's war dead in both French and English are located at the base of the pylons. The "Spirit of Sacrifice" is located at the base between the two pylons. In the display, a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem "<a href="In%20Flanders%20Fields">In Flanders Fields</a>" by <a href="John%20McCrae">John McCrae</a>, the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.

The Mourning Parents, one male and one female figure, are reclining on either side of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the <a href="Basilica%20of%20San%20Lorenzo%2C%20Florence%23Cappelle%20Medicee">Medici Tomb</a> in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; <a href="Robert%20Grierson%20Combe">Robert Grierson Combe</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Hobson">Frederick Hobson</a>, <a href="William%20Johnstone%20Milne">William Johnstone Milne</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Spall">Robert Spall</a>.

The Moroccan Division Memorial is dedicated to the memory of the French and Foreign members of the <a href="Moroccan%20Division%20%28France%29">Moroccan Division</a>, killed during the Second Battle of Artois in May 1915. The monument was raised by veterans of the division and inaugurated on 14 June 1925, having been built without planning permission. Excluding the various commemorative plaques at the bottom front facade of the memorial, campaign battles are inscribed on the left- and right-hand side corner view of the memorial. The veterans of the division later funded the April 1987 installation of a marble plaque that identified the Moroccan Division as the only division where all subordinate units had been awarded the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a>.

The Moroccan Division was initially raised as the <a href="Marching%20Division%20of%20Morocco">Marching Division of Morocco</a>. The division comprised units of varying origins and although the name would indicate otherwise, it did not in fact contain any units originating from <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>. <a href="Moroccans">Moroccans</a> were part of the <a href="Marching%20Regiment%20of%20the%20Foreign%20Legion">Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion</a> which was formed from the merger of the 2nd Marching Regiment of the <a href="1st%20Foreign%20Regiment">1st Foreign Regiment</a> with the 2nd Marching Regiment of the <a href="2nd%20Foreign%20Infantry%20Regiment">2nd Foreign Regiment</a>, both also part of the Moroccan Division Brigades. The division contained <a href="Tirailleur">Tirailleur</a>s and <a href="Zouave">Zouave</a>s, of principally <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>n and <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>n origin, and most notably <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">Legionnaires</a> from the <a href="2nd%20Marching%20Regiment%20of%20the%201st%20Foreign%20Regiment">2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment</a> and the 7th Algerian Tirailleurs Regiment. The French Legionnaires came, as attested to by a plaque installed on the memorial, from 52 different countries and included amongst them American, Polish, Russian, Italian, Greek, German, Czechoslovakian, Swedish, Armenian, various nationals of the Jewish faith (http://monumentsmorts.univ-lille3.fr/monument/2892/givenchyengohelle-autre/), and Swiss volunteers such as writer <a href="Blaise%20Cendrars">Blaise Cendrars</a>.

In the battle, General <a href="Victor%20d%27Urbal">Victor d'Urbal</a>, commander of the <a href="Tenth%20Army%20%28France%29">French Tenth Army</a>, sought to dislodge the Germans from the region by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and <a href="Notre%20Dame%20de%20Lorette">Notre Dame de Lorette</a>. When the attack began on 9 May 1915, the French XXXIII Army Corps made significant territorial gains. The Moroccan Division, which was part of the XXXIII Army Corps, quickly moved through the German defences and advanced into German lines in two hours. The division managed to capture the height of the ridge, with small parties even reaching the far side of the ridge, before retreating due to a lack of reinforcements. Even after German counter-attacks, the division managed to hold a territorial gain of . The division did however suffer heavy casualties. Those killed in the battle and commemorated on the memorial include both of the division's brigade commanders, Colonels <a href="Gaston%20Cros">Gaston Cros</a> and Louis Augustus Theodore Pein.

The First World War's Western Front included an extensive system of underground tunnels, subways, and dugouts. The Grange Subway is a tunnel system that is approximately in length and once connected the reserve lines to the front line. This permitted soldiers to advance to the front quickly, securely, and unseen. A portion of this tunnel system is open to the public through regular guided tours provided by Canadian student guides.

The Arras-Vimy sector was conducive to tunnel excavation owing to the soft, porous yet extremely stable nature of the <a href="chalk">chalk</a> underground. As a result, pronounced underground warfare had been a feature of the Vimy sector since 1915. In preparation for the Battle of Vimy Ridge, five British tunnelling companies excavated 12Â subways along the Canadian Corps' front, the longest of which was in length. The tunnellers excavated the subways at a depth of 10Â metres to ensure protection from large calibre howitzer shellfire. The subways were often dug at a pace of four metres a day and were often two metres tall and one metre wide. This underground network often incorporated or included concealed light rail lines, hospitals, command posts, water reservoirs, ammunition stores, mortar and machine gun posts, and communication centres.

Near the Canadian side of the restored trenches is a small memorial plaque dedicated to <a href="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> Mike Watkins <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">MBE</a>. Watkins was head of <a href="11%20Explosive%20Ordnance%20Disposal%20and%20Search%20Regiment%20RLC">Explosive Ordnance Disposal</a> at the Directorate of Land Service Ammunition, <a href="Royal%20Logistic%20Corps">Royal Logistic Corps</a>, and a leading British <a href="bomb%20disposal">explosive ordnance disposal</a> expert. In August 1998, he died in a roof collapse near a tunnel entrance while undertaking a detailed investigative survey of the British tunnel system on the grounds of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial site. Watkins was no stranger to the tunnel system at Vimy Ridge. Earlier the same year, he participated in the successful disarming of 3 tonnes of deteriorated <a href="ammonal">ammonal</a> explosives located under a road intersection on the site.

The site has a visitors' centre, staffed by Canadian student guides, which is open seven days a week. During the memorial restoration, the original visitors' centre near the monument was closed and replaced with a temporary one, which remains in use today. The visitors' centre is now near the preserved forward trench lines, close to many of the craters created by underground mining during the war and near the entrance of the Grange Subway. Construction of a new educational visitors' centre is expected to be completed by April 2017, in advance of the 100th anniversary of the battle. The new million visitor centre is a <a href="public-private%20partnership">public-private partnership</a> between government and the <a href="Vimy%20Foundation">Vimy Foundation</a>. In order to raise funds the Vimy Foundation granted naming rights in various halls of the visitor centre to sponsors, an approach which has met some level of controversy due to the site being a memorial park.

The Canadian National Vimy Memorial site has considerable sociocultural significance for Canada. The idea that Canada's national identity and nationhood were born out of the Battle of Vimy Ridge is an opinion that is widely repeated in military and general histories of Canada. Historian Denise Thomson suggests that the construction of the Vimy memorial represents the culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in Canada during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>. Hucker suggests that the memorial transcends the Battle of Vimy Ridge and now serves as an enduring image of the whole First World War, while expressing the enormous impact of war in general, and also considers that the 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation's determination to remember Canada's contribution and sacrifice during the First World War.

The <a href="Historic%20Sites%20and%20Monuments%20Board%20of%20Canada">Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada</a> recognized the importance of the site by recommending its designation as one of the <a href="National%20Historic%20Sites%20of%20Canada">National Historic Sites of Canada</a>; it was so designated in 1996, and is one of only two outside of Canada. The other is the <a href="Beaumont-Hamel%20Newfoundland%20Memorial">Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial</a>, also in France. Remembrance has also taken other forms: the <a href="Vimy%20Foundation">Vimy Foundation</a>, having been established to preserve and promote Canada's First World War legacy as symbolized by the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge, and <a href="Vimy%20Ridge%20Day">Vimy Ridge Day</a>, to commemorate the deaths and casualties during the battle. Local Vimy resident Georges Devloo spent 13 years until his death in 2009 offering car rides to Canadian tourists to and from the memorial at no charge, as a way of paying tribute to the Canadians who fought at Vimy.

The memorial is not without its critics. Alana Vincent has argued that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, and as a result the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures at the top of the pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.
The memorial is regularly the subject or inspiration of other artistic projects. In 1931, <a href="Will%20Longstaff">Will Longstaff</a> painted "Ghosts of Vimy Ridge", depicting ghosts of men from the Canadian Corps on Vimy Ridge surrounding the memorial, though the memorial was still several years away from completion. The memorial has been the subject of stamps in both France and Canada, including a French series in 1936 and a Canadian series on the 50th anniversary of the <a href="Armistice%20of%2011%20November%201918">Armistice of 11 November 1918</a>. The Canadian "<a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier">Unknown Soldier</a>" was selected from a cemetery in the vicinity of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and the design of the <a href="Canadian%20Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier">Canadian Tomb of the Unknown Soldier</a> is based upon the stone sarcophagus at the base of the Vimy memorial. The <a href="Never%20Forgotten%20National%20Memorial">Never Forgotten National Memorial</a> was intended to be a statue inspired by the "Canada Bereft" statue on the memorial, before the project was cancelled in February 2016. A 2001 Canadian <a href="historical%20novel">historical novel</a> "<a href="The%20Stone%20Carvers">The Stone Carvers</a>" by <a href="Jane%20Urquhart">Jane Urquhart</a> involves the characters in the design and creation of the memorial. In 2007, the memorial was a short-listed selection for the <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20Canada">Seven Wonders of Canada</a>. The <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mint">Royal Canadian Mint</a> released commemorative coins featuring the memorial on several occasions, including a 5Â cent sterling silver coin in 2002 and a 30Â dollar sterling silver coin in 2007. The <a href="Sacrifice%20Medal">Sacrifice Medal</a>, a Canadian <a href="military%20awards%20and%20decorations">military</a> <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Canada">decoration</a> created in 2008, features the image of "Mother Canada" on the reverse side of the medal.

Isabeau of Bavaria

Isabeau of Bavaria (or Isabelle; also Elisabeth of Bavaria-Ingolstadt; c. 1370Â â 24 September 1435) was born into the <a href="House%20of%20Wittelsbach">House of Wittelsbach</a> as the eldest daughter of <a href="Stephen%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Duke Stephen III of Bavaria-Ingolstadt</a> and <a href="Taddea%20Visconti">Taddea Visconti</a> of <a href="Milan">Milan</a>. She became <a href="List%20of%20French%20consorts">Queen of France</a> when she married <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">King Charles VI</a> in 1385. At age 15 or 16, Isabeau was sent to <a href="France">France</a> on approval to the young French king; the couple wed three days after their first meeting.

Isabeau was honored in 1389 with a lavish coronation ceremony and entry into Paris. In 1392 Charles suffered the first attack of what was to become a lifelong and progressive mental illness, resulting in periodic withdrawal from government. The episodes occurred with increasing frequency, leaving a court both divided by political factions and steeped in social extravagances. A 1393 <a href="masque">masque</a> for one of Isabeau's <a href="lady-in-waiting">ladies-in-waiting</a>âan event later known as "<a href="Bal%20des%20Ardents">Bal des Ardents</a>"âended in disaster with the King almost burning to death. Although the King demanded Isabeau's removal from his presence during his illness, he consistently allowed her to act on his behalf. In this way she became <a href="Regency">regent</a> to the <a href="Dauphin%20of%20France">Dauphin of France</a> (<a href="heir%20apparent">heir apparent</a>), and sat on the regency council, allowing far more power than was usual for a medieval queen.

Charles' illness created a power vacuum that eventually led to the <a href="Armagnac%E2%80%93Burgundian%20Civil%20War">ArmagnacâBurgundian Civil War</a> between supporters of his brother, <a href="Louis%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Louis of OrlÃ©ans</a> and the royal <a href="House%20of%20Valois-Burgundy">dukes of Burgundy</a>. Isabeau shifted allegiances as she chose the most favorable paths for the heir to the throne. When she followed the <a href="Armagnac%20%28party%29">Armagnac</a>s, the <a href="Burgundian%20%28party%29">Burgundians</a> accused her of adultery with Louis of OrlÃ©ans; when she sided with the Burgundians the Armagnacs removed her from Paris and she was imprisoned. In 1407 <a href="John%20the%20Fearless">John the Fearless</a> assassinated OrlÃ©ans, sparking hostilities between the factions. The war ended soon after Isabeau's eldest son, <a href="Charles%20VII%20of%20France">Charles</a>, had John the Fearless assassinated in 1419âan act that saw him disinherited. Isabeau attended the 1420 signing of the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Troyes">Treaty of Troyes</a>, which decided that the English king should inherit the French crown after the death of her husband, Charles VI. She lived in English-occupied Paris until her death in 1435.

Isabeau was popularly seen as a spendthrift and irresponsible philanderess. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries historians re-examined the extensive chronicles of her lifetime, concluding that many elements of her reputation were unearned and stemmed from factionalism and propaganda.

Isabeau's parents were <a href="Stephen%20III%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Duke Stephen III of Bavaria-Ingolstadt</a> and <a href="Taddea%20Visconti">Taddea Visconti</a>, whom he married for a 100,000 <a href="ducat">ducat</a> dowry. She was most likely born in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> where she was baptized as Elisabeth at the <a href="Munich%20Frauenkirche">Church of Our Lady</a>. She was great-granddaughter to the Wittelsbach <a href="Louis%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Louis IV</a>. At that period Bavaria counted amongst the most powerful German states and divided between members of the House of Wittelsbach.

Isabeau's uncle, <a href="Frederick%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Duke Frederick of Bavaria-Landshut</a>, suggested in 1383 that she be considered as a bride to <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">King Charles VI of France</a>. The match was proposed again at the lavish Burgundian double wedding in <a href="Cambrai">Cambrai</a> in April 1385â<a href="John%20the%20Fearless">John the Fearless</a> and his sister <a href="Margaret%20of%20Burgundy%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Bavaria">Margaret of Burgundy</a> married <a href="Margaret%20of%20Bavaria">Margaret</a> and <a href="William%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria-Straubing">William of Bavaria-Straubing</a> respectively. Charles, then 17, rode in the <a href="tourney">tourney</a>s at the wedding. He was an attractive, physically fit young man, who enjoyed <a href="jousting">jousting</a> and hunting and was excited to be married.
Charles VI's uncle, <a href="Philip%20the%20Bold">Philip the Bold</a>, Duke of Burgundy, thought the proposed marriage ideal to build an alliance with the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and against the English. Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to <a href="Amiens">Amiens</a>. He was adamant that she was not to know she was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to be examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler <a href="Jean%20Froissart">Jean Froissart</a>, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 at the time of the marriage in 1385, suggesting a birth date of around 1370.

Before her presentation to Charles, Isabeau visited <a href="County%20of%20Hainaut">Hainaut</a> for about a month, staying with her granduncle <a href="Albert%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Duke Albert I</a>, ruler of some of <a href="Bavaria-Straubing">Bavaria-Straubing</a> and <a href="Count%20of%20Holland">Count of Holland</a>. Albert's wife, <a href="Margaret%20of%20Brieg">Margaret of Brieg</a>, replaced Isabeau's Bavarian style of dress, deemed unsuitable as French courtly attire, and taught her etiquette suitable to the French court. She learned quickly, suggestive of an intelligent and quick-witted character. On 13Â July 1385 she traveled to Amiens to be presented to Charles.

Froissart writes of the meeting in his <a href="Froissart%27s%20Chronicles">"Chronicles"</a>, saying that Isabeau stood motionless while being inspected, exhibiting perfect behavior by the standards of her time. Arrangements were made for the two to be married in <a href="Arras">Arras</a>, but on the first meeting Charles felt "happiness and love enter his heart, for he saw that she was beautiful and young, and thus he greatly desired to gaze at her and possess her". She did not yet speak French and may not have reflected the idealized beauty of the period, perhaps inheriting her mother's dark Italian features, then unfashionable, but Charles most certainly approved of her because the couple were married three days later. Froissart documented the royal wedding, joking about the lascivious guests at the feast and the "hot young couple".

Charles seemingly loved his young wife, lavishing gifts on her. On the occasion of their first New Year in 1386, he gave her a red velvet <a href="palfrey">palfrey</a> saddle, trimmed with copper and decorated with an intertwined K and E (for "Karol and Elisabeth"), and he continued to give her gifts of rings, tableware and clothing. The uncles too, apparently, were pleased with the match, which contemporary chroniclers, notably Froissart and <a href="Michel%20Pintoin">Michel Pintoin</a> (the Monk of St. Denis), describe similarly as a match rooted in desire and based on her beauty. The day after the wedding, Charles went on a military campaign against the English, and Isabeau went to <a href="Creil">Creil</a> to live with his step great-grandmother <a href="Blanche%20of%20Navarre%2C%20Queen%20of%20France">Queen Dowager Blanche</a>, who taught her courtly traditions. In September she took up residence at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Vincennes">ChÃ¢teau de Vincennes</a>, where in the early years of their marriage Charles frequently joined her, and which became her favorite home.

Isabeau's coronation was celebrated on 23 August 1389 with a lavish <a href="Royal%20Entry">ceremonial entry</a> into Paris. Her second cousin and sister-in-law <a href="Valentina%20Visconti">Valentina Visconti</a>, who had married her own cousin <a href="Louis%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Louis of OrlÃ©ans</a> (Charles' younger brother) two years earlier by <a href="Proxy%20marriage">proxy</a> and papal dispensation, arrived in style, escorted across the Alps from <a href="Duchy%20of%20Milan">Milan</a> by 1,300 knights carrying personal luxuries such as books and a harp. The noblewomen in the coronation procession were dressed in lavish costumes with <a href="Goldwork%20%28embroidery%29">thread-of-gold</a> embroidery, and rode in <a href="Litter%20%28vehicle%29">litters</a> escorted by knights. Philip the Bold wore a doublet embroidered with 40 sheep and 40 swans, each decorated with a bell made of pearls.

The procession lasted from morning to night. The streets were lined with <a href="tableaux%20vivants">tableaux vivants</a> displaying scenes from the <a href="Crusades">Crusades</a>, <a href="Deesis">DeÃ«sis</a> and the Gates of Paradise. More than a thousand burghers stood along the route; those on one side were dressed in green facing, those on the opposite in red. The procession began at the <a href="Porte%20Saint-Denis">Porte de St. Denis</a> and passed under a canopy of sky-blue cloth beneath which children dressed as angels sang, winding into the <a href="Rue%20Saint-Denis%20%28Paris%29">Rue Saint-Denis</a> before arriving at the <a href="Notre%20Dame%20de%20Paris">Notre Dame</a> for the coronation ceremony. As Tuchman describes the event, "So many wonders were to be seen and admired that it was evening before the procession crossed the bridge leading to Notre Dame and the climactic display."

As Isabeau crossed the <a href="Pont%20Notre-Dame">Grand Pont</a> to Notre Dame, a person dressed as an angel descended from the church by mechanical means and "passed through an opening of the hangings of blue taffeta with golden <a href="Fleur-de-lis">fleurs-des-lis</a>, which covered the bridge, and put a crown on her head." The angel was then pulled back up into the church. An acrobat carrying two candles walked along a rope suspended from the spires of the cathedral to the tallest house in the city.

After Isabeau's crowning, the procession made its way back from the cathedral along a route lit by 500 candles. They were greeted by a royal feast, and a progression of <a href="Medieval%20pageant">narrative pageants</a> complete with a depiction of the <a href="Trojan%20War">Fall of Troy</a>. Isabeau, seven months pregnant, nearly fainted from heat on the first of the five days of festivities. To pay for the extravagant event, taxes were raised in Paris two months later.

Charles suffered the first of what was to become a lifelong series of bouts of insanity in 1392 when, on a hot August day outside <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a>, he attacked his household knights, including his brother OrlÃ©ans, killing four men. After the attack he fell into a coma that lasted four days. Few believed he would recover; his uncles, the dukes of Burgundy and <a href="John%2C%20Duke%20of%20Berry">Berry</a>, took advantage of his illness and quickly seized power, re-establishing themselves as <a href="Regency%20%28government%29">regents</a> and dissolving the Marmouset council.

The King's sudden onset of insanity was seen by some as a sign of divine anger and punishment, and by others as the result of <a href="magic%20%28paranormal%29">magic</a>. Modern historians speculate that he may have suffered from the onset of <a href="paranoid%20schizophrenia">paranoid schizophrenia</a>. The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where <a href="Guillaume%20de%20Harsigny">Guillaume de Harsigny</a>âa venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physicianâwas summoned to treat him. Charles regained consciousness and his fever subsided; he was gradually returned to Paris in September.

The physician recommended a program of amusements. A member of the court suggested that Charles surprise Isabeau and the other ladies by joining a group of courtiers who would disguise themselves as <a href="wild%20men">wild men</a> and invade the masquerade celebrating the remarriage of Isabeau's lady-in-waiting, Catherine de Fastaverin. This came to be known as the "<a href="Bal%20des%20Ardents">Bal des Ardents</a>". Charles was almost killed and four of the dancers burned to death, when a spark from a torch brought by OrlÃ©ans lit one of the dancer's costumes. The disaster undermined confidence in Charles' capacity to rule. Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and OrlÃ©ans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted <a href="regicide">regicide</a> and <a href="Maleficium%20%28sorcery%29">sorcery</a>, into offering penance for the event.

Charles suffered a second and more prolonged attack of insanity the following June; it removed him for about six months and set a pattern that would hold for the next three decades as his condition deteriorated. Froissart described the bouts of illness as so severe that the King was "far out of the way; no medicine could help him", although he had recovered from the first attack within months. For the first 20 years of his illness he sustained periods of lucidity, enough that he continued to rule. Suggestions were made to replace him with a regent, although there was uncertainty and debate as to whether a regency could assume the full role of a living monarch. When he was incapable of ruling, his brother OrlÃ©ans, and their cousin John the Fearless, the new Duke of Burgundy, were chief among those who sought to take control of the government.

When Charles became ill in the 1390s, Isabeau was 22; she had three children and had already lost two infants. During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize her, and caused her great distress by demanding her removal when she entered his chamber. The Monk of St Denis wrote in his chronicle, "What distressed her above all was to see how on all occasionsÂ ... the king repulsed her, whispering to his people, 'Who is this woman obstructing my view? Find out what she wants and stop her from annoying and bothering me. As his illness worsened at the turn of the century, she was accused of abandoning him, particularly when she moved her residence to the HÃ´tel Barbette. Historian Rachel Gibbons speculates that Isabeau wanted to distance herself from her husband and his illness, writing, "it would be unjust to blame her if she did not want to live with a madman."

Since the King often did not recognize her during his psychotic episodes and was upset by her presence, it was eventually deemed advisable to provide him with a mistress, <a href="Odette%20de%20Champdivers">Odette de Champdivers</a>, the daughter of a horse-dealer; according to Tuchman, Odette is said to have resembled Isabeau and was called "the little Queen". She had probably assumed this role by 1405 with Isabeau's consent, but during his remissions the King still had sexual relations with his wife, whose last pregnancy occurred in 1407. Records show that Isabeau was in the King's chamber on 23 November 1407, the night of OrlÃ©ans' assassination, and again in 1408.

Charles' bouts of illness continued unabated until his death. The two may have still felt mutual affection, and Isabeau exchanged gifts and letters with him during his periods of lucidity, but distanced herself during the prolonged attacks of insanity. Historian <a href="Tracy%20Adams">Tracy Adams</a> writes that Isabeau's attachment and loyalty is evident in the great efforts she made to retain the crown for his heirs in the ensuing decades.

Isabeau's life is well documented, most likely because Charles' illness placed her in an unusual position of power. Nevertheless, not much is known about her personal characteristics, and historians even disagree about her appearance. She is variously described as "small and brunette" or "tall and blonde". The contemporaneous evidence is contradictory: chroniclers said of her either that she was "beautiful and hypnotic, or so obese through dropsy that she was crippled." Despite living in France after her marriage, she spoke with a heavy German accent that never diminished, which Tuchman describes as giving her an "alien" cast at the French court.

Adams describes Isabeau as a talented diplomat who navigated court politics with ease, grace and charisma. Charles had been crowned in 1387, aged 20, attaining sole control of the monarchy. His first acts included the dismissal of his uncles and the reinstatement of the so-called <a href="Marmousets">Marmousets</a>âa group of councilors to his father, <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V</a>âand he gave OrlÃ©ans more responsibility. Some years later, after Charles' first attack of illness, tensions mounted between OrlÃ©ans and the royal unclesâPhilip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy; John, Duke of Berry; and <a href="Louis%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bourbon">Louis II, Duke of Bourbon</a>. Forced to assume a greater role in maintaining peace amidst the growing power struggle, which was to persist for many years, Isabeau succeeded in her role as peacekeeper among the various court factions.

As early as the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau demonstrated that she possessed diplomatic influence when the <a href="Florence">Florentine</a> delegation requested her political intervention in the <a href="Gian%20Galeazzo%20Visconti">Gian Galeazzo Visconti</a> affair. OrlÃ©ans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, <a href="Louis%20VII%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria</a>, and <a href="John%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Armagnac">John III, Count of Armagnac</a>. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to effect change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, <a href="Isabella%20of%20Valois">Isabella</a>, to <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II of England</a> (an event at which Charles attacked a <a href="herald">herald</a> for wearing Galeazzo's <a href="livery">livery</a>), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with Florentine ambassador <a href="Buonaccorso%20Pitti">Buonaccorso Pitti</a>.

In the 1390s <a href="Jean%20Gerson">Jean Gerson</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">University of Paris</a> formed a council to eliminate the <a href="Western%20Schism">Western Schism</a>, and in recognition of her negotiating skills he placed Isabeau on the council. The French wanted both the <a href="Avignon%20Papacy">Avignon</a> and Roman popes to abdicate in favor of a single papacy in Rome; <a href="Antipope%20Clement%20VII">Clement VII</a> in Avignon welcomed Isabeau's presence given her record as an effective mediator. However, the effort faded when Clement VII died.

During his short-lived recovery in the 1390s, Charles made arrangements for Isabeau to be "principal guardian of the <a href="Dauphin%20of%20France">Dauphin</a>", their son, until he reached 13 years of age, giving her additional political power on the regency council. Charles appointed Isabeau co-guardian of their children in 1393, a position shared with the royal dukes and her brother, Louis of Bavaria, while he gave OrlÃ©ans full power of the regency. In appointing Isabeau, Charles acted under laws enacted by his father, Charles V, which gave the Queen full power to protect and educate the heir to the throne. These appointments separated power between OrlÃ©ans and the royal uncles, increasing ill-will among the factions. The following year, as Charles' bouts of illness became more severe and prolonged, Isabeau became the leader of the regency council, giving her power over the royal dukes and the <a href="Constable%20of%20France">Constable of France</a>, while at the same time making her vulnerable to attack from various court factions.

During Charles' illness, OrlÃ©ans became financially powerful as the official tax collector, and in the following decade Isabeau and OrlÃ©ans agreed to raise the level of taxation. In 1401, during one of the King's absences, OrlÃ©ans installed his own men to collect royal revenues, angering Philip the Bold who in retaliation raised an army, threatening to enter Paris with 600 men-at-arms and 60 knights. At that time Isabeau intervened between OrlÃ©ans and Burgundy, preventing bloodshed and the outbreak of civil war.

Charles trusted Isabeau enough by 1402 to allow her to arbitrate the growing dispute between the OrlÃ©anists and <a href="Burgundian%20%28party%29">Burgundian</a>s, and he turned control of the treasury over to her. After Philip the Bold died in 1404 and his son John the Fearless became Duke of Burgundy, the new duke continued the political strife in an attempt to gain access to the royal treasury for Burgundian interests. OrlÃ©ans and the royal dukes thought John was usurping power for his own interests and Isabeau, at that time, aligned herself with OrlÃ©ans to protect the interests of the crown and her children. Furthermore, she distrusted John the Fearless who she thought overstepped himself in rankâhe was cousin to the King whereas OrlÃ©ans was Charles' brother.

Rumors that Isabeau and OrlÃ©ans were lovers began to circulate, a relationship that was considered incestuous. Whether the two were intimate has been questioned by contemporary historians, including Gibbons who believes the rumor may have been planted as propaganda against Isabeau as retaliation against tax increases she and OrlÃ©ans ordered in 1405. An Augustinian friar, Jacques Legrand, preached a long sermon to the court denouncing excess and depravity, in particular mentioning Isabeau and her fashionsâwith exposed necks, shoulders and dÃ©colletage. The monk presented his sermon as allegory so as not to offend Isabeau overtly, but he cast her and her ladies-in-waiting as "furious, vengeful characters". He said to Isabeau, "If you don't believe me, go out into the city disguised as a poor woman, and you will hear what everyone is saying." Thus he accused Isabeau as having lost touch with the commoners and the court with its subjects. At about the same time a satirical political pamphlet, "Songe Veritable", now considered by historians to be pro-Burgundian propaganda, was released and widely distributed in Paris. The pamphlet hinted at the Queen's relations with OrlÃ©ans.

John the Fearless accused Isabeau and OrlÃ©ans of fiscal mismanagement and again demanded money for himself, in recompense for the loss of royal revenues after his father's death; an estimated half of Philip the Bold's revenues had come from the French treasury. John raised a force of 1,000 knights, and entered Paris in 1405. OrlÃ©ans hastily retreated with Isabeau to the fortified castle of <a href="Melun">Melun</a>, with her household and children a day or so behind. John immediately left in pursuit, intercepting the party of chaperones and royal children. He took possession of the Dauphin, and returned him to Paris under control of Burgundian forces; however, the boy's uncle, the duke of Berry, quickly took control of the child at the orders of the Royal Council. At that time Charles was lucid for about a month and able to help with the crisis. The incident, that came to be known as the "enlÃ¨vement of the dauphin", almost caused full-scale war, but it was averted. OrlÃ©ans quickly raised an army while John encouraged Parisians to revolt. They refused, claiming loyalty to the King and his son; Berry was made captain general of Paris and the city's gates were locked. In October Isabeau became active in mediating the dispute, in response to a letter from <a href="Christine%20de%20Pizan">Christine de Pizan</a> and an ordinance from the Royal Council.

In 1407 John the Fearless ordered OrlÃ©ans' assassination. On 23 November hired killers attacked the duke as he returned to his Paris residence, cut off his hand holding the horse's reins, and "hacked [him] to death with swords, axes, and wooden clubs". His body was left in a gutter. John first denied involvement in the assassination, but quickly admitted that the act was done for the Queen's honor, claiming he acted to "avenge" the monarchy of the alleged adultery between Isabeau and OrlÃ©ans. His royal uncles, shocked at his confession, forced him to leave Paris while the Royal Council attempted a reconciliation between the Houses of Burgundy and OrlÃ©ans.

In March 1408 <a href="Jean%20Petit%20%28theologian%29">Jean Petit</a> presented a lengthy and well-attended <a href="Justification%20%28jurisprudence%29">justification</a> at the royal palace before a large courtly audience. Petit argued convincingly that in the King's absence OrlÃ©ans became a tyrant, practiced sorcery and <a href="necromancy">necromancy</a>, was driven by greed, and had planned to commit fratricide at the "Bal des Ardents". John should be exonerated, Petit argued, because he had defended the King and monarchy by assassinating OrlÃ©ans. Charles, "insane during the oration", was convinced by Petit's argument and pardoned John the Fearless, only to rescind the pardon in September.

Violence again broke out after the assassination; Isabeau had troops patrol Paris and, to protect the <a href="Louis%2C%20Dauphin%20of%20France%2C%20Duke%20of%20Guyenne">Dauphin Louis, Duke of Guyenne</a>, she again left the city for Melun. In August she staged an entry to Paris for the Dauphin, and early in the new year Charles signed an ordinance giving the 13-year-old the power to rule in the Queen's absence. During these years Isabeau's greatest concern was the Dauphin's safety as she prepared him to take up the duties of the King; she formed alliances to further those aims. At this point the Queen and her influence were still crucial to the power struggle. Physical control of Isabeau and her children became important to both parties and she was frequently forced to change sides, for which she was criticized and called unstable. She joined the Burgundians from 1409 to 1413, and switched sides to form an alliance with the OrlÃ©anists from 1413 to 1415.

At the Peace of Chartres in March 1409, John the Fearless was reinstated to the Royal Council after a public reconciliation with OrlÃ©ans' son, <a href="Charles%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Charles, Duke of OrlÃ©ans</a>, at <a href="Chartres%20Cathedral">Chartres Cathedral</a>, although the feuding continued. In December that year Isabeau bestowed the "tutelle" (guardianship of the Dauphin) upon John the Fearless, made him the master of Paris, and allowed him to mentor the Dauphin, after he had Jehan de Montagu, Grand Master of the King's household, executed. At that point the Duke essentially controlled the Dauphin and Paris, and was popular in the city because of his opposition to taxes levied by Isabeau and OrlÃ©ans. Isabeau's actions with respect to John the Fearless angered the Armagnacs, who in the fall of 1410 marched to Paris to "rescue" the Dauphin from the Duke's influence. At that time members of the University of Paris, Jean Gerson in particular, proposed that all feuding members of the Royal Council step down and be immediately removed from power.

To defuse tension with the Burgundians a second double marriage was arranged in 1409. Isabeau's daughter <a href="Michelle%20of%20Valois">Michelle</a> married John the Fearless' son <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a>; Isabeau's son, Dauphin Louis, married John's daughter <a href="Margaret%20of%20Burgundy%2C%20Dauphine%20of%20France">Margaret</a>. Before the wedding, Isabeau negotiated a treaty with John the Fearless in which she clearly defined family hierarchy and her position in relation to the throne.

Despite Isabeau's efforts to keep the peace, the <a href="Armagnac%E2%80%93Burgundian%20Civil%20War">ArmagnacâBurgundian Civil War</a> broke out in 1411. John gained the upper hand during the first year, but the Dauphin began to build a power base; Christine de Pizan wrote of him that he was the savior of France. Still only 15, he lacked the power or backing to defeat John, who fomented revolt in Paris. In retaliation against John the Fearless' actions, Charles of OrlÃ©ans denied funds from the royal treasury to all members of the royal family. In 1414, instead of allowing her son, then 17, to lead, Isabeau allied herself with Charles of OrlÃ©ans. The Dauphin, in return, changed allegiance and joined John, which Isabeau considered unwise and dangerous. The result was continued civil war in Paris. Parisian commoners joined forces with John the Fearless in the <a href="Cabochien%20Revolt">Cabochien Revolt</a>, and at the height of the revolt a group of butchers entered Isabeau's home in search of traitors, arresting and taking away up to 15 of her ladies-in-waiting. In his chronicles Pintoin wrote that Isabeau was firmly allied with the OrlÃ©anists and the 60,000 Armagnacs who invaded Paris and <a href="Picardy">Picardy</a>.

<a href="Henry%20V%20of%20England">King Henry V of England</a> took advantage of the internal strife in France, invading the northwest coast, and in 1415 he delivered a crushing defeat to the French at <a href="Battle%20of%20Agincourt">Agincourt</a>. Nearly an entire generation of military leaders died or were taken prisoner in a single day. John, still feuding with the royal family and the Armagnacs, remained neutral as Henry V went on to conquer towns in northern France.

In December 1415 Dauphin Louis died suddenly at age 18 of illness, leaving Isabeau's political status unclear. Her 17-year-old fourth-born son, <a href="John%2C%20Dauphin%20of%20France%2C%20Duke%20of%20Touraine">John of Touraine</a>, now the Dauphin, had been raised since childhood in the household of <a href="William%20II%2C%20Duke%20of%20Bavaria">Duke William II of Bavaria</a> in Hainaut. Married to <a href="Jacqueline%2C%20Countess%20of%20Hainaut">Countess Jacqueline of Hainaut</a>, Dauphin John was a Burgundian sympathizer. William of Bavaria refused to send him to Paris during a period of upheaval as Burgundians plundered the city and Parisians revolted against another wave of tax increases initiated by <a href="Bernard%20VII%2C%20Count%20of%20Armagnac">Count Bernard VII of Armagnac</a>; in a period of lucidity, Charles had raised the Count to be the Constable of France. Isabeau attempted to intervene by arranging a meeting with Jacqueline in 1416, but Armagnac refused to allow Isabeau to reconcile with the House of Burgundy, while William II continued to prevent the young Dauphin from entering Paris.

In 1417 Henry V invaded Normandy with 40,000 men. In April that year Dauphin John died and another shift in power occurred when Isabeau's sixth and last son, <a href="Charles%20VII%20of%20France">Charles</a>, age 14, became Dauphin. He was married to Armagnac's daughter <a href="Marie%20of%20Anjou">Marie of Anjou</a> and favored the Armagnacs. At that time Armagnac imprisoned Isabeau in <a href="Tours">Tours</a>, confiscating her personal property (clothing, jewels and money), dismantling her household, and separating her from the younger children as well as her ladies-in-waiting. She secured her freedom in November through the help of the Duke of Burgundy. Accounts of her release vary: Monstrelet writes that Burgundy "delivered" her to Troyes, and Pintoin that the Duke negotiated Isabeau's release to gain control of her authority. Isabeau maintained her alliance with Burgundy from that period until the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Troyes">Treaty of Troyes</a>.

Isabeau at first assumed the role of sole regent but in January 1418 yielded her position to John the Fearless. Together Isabeau and John abolished parliament ("Chambre des comptes") and turned to securing control of Paris and the King. John took control of Paris by force on 28 May 1418, slaughtering Armagnacs. The Dauphin fled the city. According to Pintoin's chronicle, the Dauphin refused Isabeau's invitation to join her in an entry to Paris. She entered the city with John on 14 July.

Shortly after he assumed the title of Dauphin, Charles negotiated a truce with John in Pouilly. Charles then requested a private meeting with John, on 10 September 1419 at a bridge in <a href="Montereau-Fault-Yonne">Montereau</a>, promising his personal guarantee of protection. The meeting, however, was a ploy to <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20the%20Fearless">assassinate John</a>, whom Charles "hacked to death" on the bridge. His father, King Charles, immediately disinherited his son. The civil war ended after John's death. The Dauphin's actions fueled more rumor about his legitimacy, and his disinheritance set the stage for the Treaty of Troyes.
By 1419 Henry V occupied much of Normandy and demanded an oath of allegiance from the residents. The new Duke of Burgundy, <a href="Philip%20the%20Good">Philip the Good</a>, allied with the English, putting enormous pressure on France and Isabeau, who remained loyal to the King. In 1420 Henry sent an emissary to confer with the Queen, after which according to Adams, Isabeau "ceded to what must have been a persuasively posed argument by Henry V's messenger". France had effectively been left without an heir to the throne, even before the Treaty of Troyes. Charles VI had disinherited the Dauphin, whom he considered responsible for "breaking the peace for his involvement in the assassination of the duke of Burgundy"; he wrote in 1420 of the Dauphin that he had "rendered himself unworthy to succeed to the throne or any other title". Charles of OrlÃ©ans, next in line as heir under <a href="Salic%20law">Salic law</a>, had been taken prisoner at the Battle of Agincourt and was kept in captivity in London.

In the absence of an official heir to the throne, Isabeau accompanied King Charles to sign the Treaty of Troyes in May 1420; Gibbons writes that the treaty "only confirmed [the Dauphin's] outlaw status". The King's malady prevented him from appearing at the signing of the treaty, forcing Isabeau to stand in for him, which according to Gibbons gave her "perpetual responsibility in having sworn away France". For many centuries Isabeau stood accused of relinquishing the crown because of the Treaty. Under the terms of the Treaty, Charles remained as King of France but HenryÂ V, who married Charles' and Isabeau's daughter, <a href="Catherine%20of%20Valois">Catherine</a>, kept control of the territories he conquered in Normandy, would govern France with the Duke of Burgundy, and was to be Charles' successor. Isabeau was to live in English-controlled Paris.

Charles VI died in October 1422. As Henry V had died earlier the same year, his infant son by Catherine, <a href="Henry%20VI%20of%20England">HenryÂ VI</a>, was proclaimed King of France, according to the terms of the Treaty of Troyes, with the <a href="John%20of%20Lancaster%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">Duke of Bedford</a> acting as regent. Rumors circulated about Isabeau again; some chronicles describe her living in a "degraded state". According to Tuchman, Isabeau had a farmhouse built in <a href="Saint-Ouen%2C%20Seine-Saint-Denis">St. Ouen</a> where she looked after livestock, and in her later years, during a lucid episode, Charles arrested one of her lovers whom he tortured, then drowned in the <a href="Seine">Seine</a>. <a href="Desmond%20Seward">Desmond Seward</a> writes it was the disinherited Dauphin who had the man killed. Described as a former lover of Isabeau as well as a "poisoner and wife-murderer", Charles kept him as a favorite at his court until ordering his drowning.

Rumors about Isabeau's promiscuity flourished, which Adams attributes to English propaganda intended to secure England's grasp on the throne. An allegorical pamphlet, called "Pastorelet", was published in the mid-1420s painting Isabeau and Orleans as lovers. During the same period Isabeau was contrasted with <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a>, considered virginally pure, in the allegedly popular saying "Even as France had been lost by a woman it would be saved by a woman". Adams writes that Joan of Arc has been attributed with the words "France, having been lost by a woman, would be restored by a virgin", but neither saying can be substantiated by contemporary documentation or chronicles.

In 1429, when Isabeau lived in English-occupied Paris, the accusation was again put forth that CharlesÂ VII was not the son of CharlesÂ VI. At that time, with two contenders for the French throneâthe young HenryÂ VI and disinherited Charlesâthis could have been propaganda to prop up the English claim. Furthermore, gossip spread that Joan of Arc was Isabeau and Orleans' illegitimate daughterâa rumor Gibbons finds improbable because Joan of Arc almost certainly was not born for some years after OrlÃ©ans' assassination. Stories circulated that the dauphins were murdered, and attempts were made to poison the other children, all of which added to Isabeau's reputation of one of history's great villains.

Isabeau was removed from political influence and retired to live in the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Saint-Pol">HÃ´tel Saint-Pol</a> with her brother's second wife, Catherine of AlenÃ§on. She was accompanied by her ladies-in-waiting Amelie von Orthenburg and Madame de Moy, the latter of whom had traveled from Germany and had stayed with her as "<a href="dame%20d%27honneur">dame d'honneur</a>" since 1409. Isabeau died there in 1435. Her death and funeral were documented by Jean Chartier (member of <a href="Basilica%20of%20St%20Denis">St Denis Abbey</a>) who may well have been an eyewitness.

Isabeau was dismissed by historians in the past as a wanton, weak and indecisive leader. Modern historians now see her as taking an unusually active leadership role for a queen of her period, forced to take responsibility as a direct result of Charles' illness. Her critics accepted skewed interpretations of her role in the negotiations with England, resulting in the Treaty of Troyes, and in the rumors of her marital infidelity with OrlÃ©ans. Gibbons writes that a queen's duty was to secure the succession to the crown and look after her husband; historians described Isabeau as having failed in both respects, and she came to be seen as one of the great villains of history. Gibbons goes on to say that even her physical appearance is uncertain; depictions of her vary depending on whether she was to be portrayed as good or evil.

Rumored to be a bad mother, she was accused of "incest, moral corruption, treason, avarice and profligacyÂ ... political aspirations and involvements". Adams writes that historians reassessed her reputation in the late 20th century, exonerating her of many of the accusations, seen particularly in Gibbons' scholarship. Furthermore, Adams admits she believed the allegations against Isabeau until she delved into contemporary chronicles: there she found little evidence against the Queen except that many of the rumors came from only a few passages, and in particular from Pintoin's pro-Burgundian writing.

After the onset of the King's illness, a common belief was that Charles' mental illness and inability to rule were due to Isabeau's witchcraft; as early as the 1380s rumors spread that the court was steeped in sorcery. In 1397 OrlÃ©ans' wife, Valentina Visconti, was forced to leave Paris because she was accused of using magic. The court of the "mad king" attracted magicians with promises of cures who were often used as political tools by the various factions. Lists of people accused of bewitching Charles were compiled, with Isabeau and OrlÃ©ans both listed.

The accusations of adultery were rampant. According to Pintoin's chronicle, "[OrlÃ©ans] clung a bit too closely to his sister-in-law, the young and pretty Isabeau of Bavaria, the queen. This ardent brunette was twenty-two; her husband was insane and her seductive brother-in-law loved to dance, beyond that we can imagine all sorts of things". Pintoin said of the Queen and OrlÃ©ans that they neglected Charles, behaved scandalously and "lived on the delights of the flesh", spending large amounts of money on court entertainment. The alleged affair, however, is based on a single paragraph from Pintoin's chronicles, according to Adams, and is no longer considered proof.

Isabeau was accused of indulging in extravagant and expensive fashions, jewel-laden dresses and elaborate <a href="braid">braid</a>ed hairstyles coiled into tall shells, covered with wide double <a href="hennin">hennin</a>s that, reportedly, required widened doorways to pass through. In 1406 a pro-Burgundian satirical pamphlet in verse allegory listed Isabeau's supposed lovers. She was accused of leading France into a civil war because of her inability to support a single faction; she was described as an "empty headed" German; of her children it was said that she "took pleasure in a new pregnancy only insofar as it offered her new gifts"; and her political mistakes were attributed to her being fat.

In the 18th and 19th centuries historians characterized Isabeau as "an adulterous, luxurious, meddlesome, scheming, and spendthrift queen", overlooking her political achievements and influence. A popular book written by Louise de Karalio (1758â1822) about the "bad" French queens prior to <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> is, according to Adams, where "Isabeau's black legend attains its full expression in a violent attack on the French royalty in general and queens in particular." Karalio wrote: "Isabeau was raised by the furies to bring about the ruin of the state and to sell it to its enemies; Isabeau of Bavaria appeared, and her marriage, celebrated in Amiens on 17 July 1385, would be regarded as the most horrifying moment in our history". Isabeau was painted as OrlÃ©ans' passionate lover, and the inspiration for the <a href="Marquis%20de%20Sade">Marquis de Sade</a>'s unpublished 1813 novel "<a href="Histoire%20secrete%20d%27Isabelle%20de%20Baviere%2C%20reine%20de%20France">Histoire secrete d'Isabelle de Baviere, reine de France</a>", about which Adams writes, "submitting the queen to his ideology of gallantry, [the Marquis de Sade] gives her rapaciousness a cold and calculating violenceÂ ... a woman who carefully manages her greed for maximum gratification." She goes on to say that de Sade admitted to "being perfectly aware that the charges against the queen are without ground."

Like many of the Valois, Isabeau was an appreciative art collector. She loved jewels and was responsible for the commissions of particularly lavish pieces of "<a href="ronde-bosse">ronde-bosse</a>"âa newly developed technique of making enamel-covered gold pieces. Documentation suggests she commissioned several fine pieces of "<a href="tableaux%20d%27or">tableaux d'or</a>" from Parisian goldsmiths.
In 1404, Isabeau gave Charles a spectacular "ronde-bosse", known as the "Little Golden Horse Shrine", (or "Goldenes RÃ¶ssl"), now held in a convent church in <a href="Alt%C3%B6tting">AltÃ¶tting</a>, Bavaria. Contemporary documents identify the statuette as a New Year's giftâan "Ã©trennes"âa <a href="Strenua">Roman custom</a> Charles revived to establish rank and alliances during the period of factionalism and war. With the exception of manuscripts, the Little Golden Horse is the single surviving documented "Ã©trennes" of the period. Weighing the gold piece is encrusted with rubies, sapphires and pearls. It depicts Charles kneeling on a platform above a double set of stairs, presenting himself to the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin Mary</a> and child Jesus, who are attended by <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a> and <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a>. A jewel encrusted trellis or bower is above; beneath stands a squire holding the golden horse. Isabeau also exchanged New Year's gifts with the Duke of Berry; one extant piece is the "ronde-bosse" statuette <a href="Catherine%20of%20Alexandria">Saint Catherine</a>.

Medieval author Christine de Pizan solicited the Queen's patronage at least three times. In 1402 she sent a compilation of her literary argument "Querelle du Roman de la Rose"âin which she questions the concept of <a href="courtly%20love">courtly love</a>âwith a letter exclaiming "I am firmly convinced the feminine cause is worthy of defense. This I do here and have done with my other works." In 1410 and again in 1411, Pizan solicited the Queen, presenting her in 1414 an illuminated copy of her works. In "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20the%20City%20of%20Ladies">The Book of the City of Ladies</a>", Pizan praised Isabeau lavishly, and again in the illuminated collection, "The Letter of Othea", which scholar Karen Green believes for de Pizan is "the culmination of fifteen years of service during which Christine formulated an ideology that supported Isabeau's right to rule as regent in this time of crisis."

Isabeau showed great piety, essential for a queen of her period. During her lifetime, and in her will, she bequeathed property and personal possessions to Notre Dame, St. Denis, and the convent in <a href="Poissy">Poissy</a>.
The birth of each of Isabeau's 12 children is well chronicled; even the decoration schemes of the rooms in which she gave birth are described. She had six sons and six daughters. The first son, born in 1386, died as an infant and the last, Philip, born in 1407, lived a single day. Three others died young with only her youngest son, Charles VII, living to adulthood. Five of the six daughters survived; four were married and one, <a href="Marie%20of%20Valois%2C%20Prioress%20of%20Poissy">Marie</a> (1393â1438), was sent at age four to be raised in a convent, where she became prioress.

Her first son, Charles (b. 1386) died in infancy. A daughter, Joan, born two years later lived until 1390. The second daughter, Isabella (b. 1389), born in 1389, was married at age seven to RichardÂ II of England and after his death to Charles, Duke of OrlÃ©ans. The third daughter, <a href="Joan%20of%20France%20%281391%E2%80%931433%29">Joan</a> (1391â1433), who lived to age 42, married <a href="John%20VI%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">John VI, Duke of Brittany</a>. The fourth daughter, <a href="Michelle%20of%20Valois">Michelle</a> (1395â1422), first wife to Philip the Good, died childless at age 27. Catherine of Valois, Queen of England, (1401â1438) married HenryÂ V of England; on his death she took Sir <a href="Owen%20Tudor">Owen Tudor</a> as her second husband. 

Of her sons, the first to survive infancy and become Dauphin, Charles, (1392â1401), died at age eight of a "wasting illness". <a href="Louis%2C%20Dauphin%20of%20France%20%281397%E2%80%931415%29">Louis, Dauphin of France (1397â1415)</a>, and Duke of Guyenne, married to <a href="Margaret%20of%20Burgundy%20%281393%E2%80%931441%29">Margaret of Burgundy</a>, died at age 19. <a href="John%2C%20Dauphin%20of%20France%20%281398%E2%80%931417%29">John, Dauphin of France (1398â1417)</a>, and Duke of Touraine, first husband to <a href="Jacqueline%2C%20Countess%20of%20Hainault">Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut</a>, died without issue. CharlesÂ VII, (1403â1461) married Marie of Anjou.

According to modern historians Isabeau stayed in close proximity to the children during their childhood, had them travel with her, bought them gifts, wrote letters, bought devotional texts, and arranged for her daughters to be educated. She resisted separation and reacted against having her sons sent to other households to live (as was the custom at the time). Pintoin records she was dismayed at the marriage contract that stipulated her third surviving son, John, be sent to live in Hainaut. She maintained relationships with her daughters after their marriages, writing letters to them frequently. She sent them out of Paris during an outbreak of plague, staying behind herself with the youngest infant, Jean, too young to travel. The <a href="Celestines">Celestines</a> allowed "whenever and as often as she liked, she and her could enter the monastery and churchÂ ... their vineyards and gardens, both for devotion and for entertainment and pleasure of herself and her children."

France national rugby union team

The France national rugby union team competes annually against <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a>, <a href="Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ireland</a>, <a href="Italy%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Italy</a>, <a href="Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Scotland</a> and <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a> in the <a href="Six%20Nations%20Championship">Six Nations Championship</a>. They have won the championship outright seventeen times, shared it a further eight times, and have completed nine <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28rugby%20union%29%23Six%20Nations%20Championship">grand slams</a>. Ten former French players have been inducted into the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Rugby Hall of Fame</a>.

Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by the British, and on New Years Day 1906 the national side played its first <a href="Test%20match%20%28rugby%20union%29">Test match</a> â against <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a> in Paris. France played sporadically against the <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a> until they joined them to form a Five Nations tournament (now the Six Nations Championship) in 1910. France also competed in the rugby competitions at early <a href="Rugby%20union%20at%20the%20Summer%20Olympics">Summer Olympics</a>, winning the gold medal in 1900 and two silver medals in the 1920s. The national team came of age during the 1950s and 1960s, winning their first Five Nations title outright in 1959. They won their first <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28rugby%20union%29%23Six%20Nations%20Championship">Grand Slam</a> in 1968. Since the <a href="1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">inaugural World Cup</a> in 1987, France have qualified for the knock-out stage of every tournament. They have reached the final three times, losing to the All Blacks in 1987 and <a href="2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2011</a> and to <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> in <a href="1999%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1999</a>. France hosted the <a href="2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2007 Rugby World Cup</a>, where, as in <a href="2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2003</a>, they were beaten in the semi-finals by <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a> and will once again host the tournament in <a href="2023%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2023</a>.

France traditionally play in blue shirts with white shorts and red socks, and are commonly referred to as "les tricolores" or "les bleus". The French emblem is a golden <a href="rooster">rooster</a> imposed upon a red shield. Their alternative strip is composed of a white shirt and navy blue <a href="Rugby%20shorts">shorts</a> and socks. French international matches are played at several venues across the country; the <a href="Stade%20de%20France">Stade de France</a> in the Paris suburb of <a href="Saint-Denis%2C%20Seine-Saint-Denis">Saint-Denis</a> is used for their games during the Six Nations, and they have a formidable home record at the <a href="Stade%20V%C3%A9lodrome">Stade VÃ©lodrome</a> in <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> where they have only lost twice, to <a href="Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Argentina</a> in 2004 and to New Zealand in 2009.

Rugby was introduced to France in 1872 by English merchants and students. On 26 February 1890, a French rugby team recruited from the <a href="Lyc%C3%A9e%20Janson%20de%20Sailly">Janson Desailly Lyceum</a> defeated an international team at the <a href="Bois%20de%20Boulogne">Bois de Boulogne</a>.

Although France were represented at the <a href="1900%20Summer%20Olympics">1900 Summer Olympics</a>, their first official test match did not take place till New Year's Day, 1906 against the <a href="All%20Blacks">New Zealand All Blacks</a> in Paris. France then played intermittently against the <a href="Home%20Nations">Home Nations</a> until they joined them to form the Five Nations tournament in <a href="1910%20Five%20Nations%20Championship">1910</a>. In 1913 France faced South Africa's <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Springboks</a> for the first time; losing 38â5. France also competed at the <a href="1920%20Summer%20Olympics">1920</a> and <a href="1924%20Summer%20Olympics">1924 Summer Olympics</a>, and on both occasions lost to the <a href="United%20States%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">United States</a> in the gold medal match.

France were ejected from the Five Nations in 1932 after being accused of professionalism in the French leagues at a time when rugby union was strictly amateur. Forced to play against weaker opposition, France went on a winning streak; winning ten games in a row during the years from 1931 to 1936. France was invited to rejoin the Five Nations in 1939 but did not compete until 1947 as international rugby was suspended during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

French rugby came of age during the 1950s and 1960s: they won their first Five Nations championship and completed a successful tour of South Africa. Their first championship was won in 1954 when they shared the title with England and Wales. France won their first outright Five Nations championship in 1959; they won with two wins, a draw (against England) and a defeat (against Ireland).

France first toured South Africa winning the test series in 1958. The Springboks also visited Paris in 1961, the test was not completed due to onfield fighting amongst the players. France also toured <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and Australia in 1961 losing both tests against the All Blacks but defeating Australia's <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wallabies</a>. They won their first <a href="Grand%20Slam%20%28rugby%20union%29%23Six%20Nations%20Championship">Five Nations Grand Slam</a> in 1968 by beating all four other competing teams, and won numerous titles in the following years.
In 1977, France won their second Grand Slam, fielding an unchanged side throughout the tournament and conceding no tries. They also defeated the All Blacks in <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> that year, but lost the return match in Paris. On <a href="Bastille%20Day">Bastille Day</a>, 1979 they defeated the All Blacks in New Zealand for the first time, at <a href="Eden%20Park">Eden Park</a> in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>.

In 1981 the French clinched their third Grand Slam; at <a href="Twickenham%20Stadium">Twickenham</a> against England. They again completed a Grand Slam in 1987 on the eve of the first <a href="Rugby%20World%20Cup">Rugby World Cup</a> hosted by Australia and New Zealand. In that tournament they came from behind numerous times to defeat the Wallabies in their semi-final, and faced the All Blacks in final at Eden Park, Auckland; France lost 29â9. They shared the Five Nations with Wales the next year, and also won it in 1989.

France hosted some of the tests during the <a href="1991%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1991 World Cup</a>, but made their exit from the after being knocked out by England at the Parc des Princes (Paris) in their quarter-final. One Five Nations championship was won in the early 1990s, in 1993. The following year France won <a href="1994%20France%20rugby%20union%20tour%20of%20Canada%20and%20New%20Zealand">a test series</a> 2â0 in New Zealand. They were knocked out of the <a href="1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1995 World Cup</a> semi-finals by eventual champions the Springboks, but did win their third place play-off match against England. France played the All blacks in two tests, winning the first 22â15 at Toulouse and lost the second 37â12 at Paris. France won back-to-back Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998. At the <a href="1999%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1999 World Cup</a> they defeated tournament favourites the All Blacks in the semi-finals, but lost to the Wallabies in the final.

The Five Nations Championship was expanded in 2000 to include Italy. In the now Six Nations Championship France won a Grand Slam in 2002. At the <a href="2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2003 World Cup</a> in Australia they qualified for the semi-finals where they were defeated by eventual champions England. In 2004, they won a second Six Nations Grand Slam, which was followed by a Championship win in 2006 and a successful defence in 2007.

During the opener of the <a href="Rugby%20World%20Cup%202007">World Cup 2007</a>, <a href="Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Argentina</a> defeated France 17â12. However, after defeating <a href="Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ireland</a> 25â3, France qualified for the quarter-finals. After defeating the New Zealand <a href="All%20Blacks">All Blacks</a> 20â18, they lost to England 14â9 in the semi-final. France then lost for a second time to <a href="Argentina%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Argentina</a> 34â10 in the third-place match. In 2010, France won its ninth Grand Slam.

During the <a href="2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2011 Rugby World Cup</a>, France defeated <a href="Welsh%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a> 9â8 in the semi-final at <a href="Eden%20Park">Eden Park</a> in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, on 15 October 2011 and in the following week they lost 8â7 to the All Blacks at the final to make it three final defeats.

During the <a href="2015%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2015 Rugby World Cup</a> France lost 62â13 to New Zealand in the Quarter Finals

Until 1912, the <a href="Uniform%23Sports">strip</a> (uniform) of the French team was white with two rings, one red and one blue. After the first game won by France against Scotland in 1911, France's captain Marcel Communeau asked that the team adopt the "coq gaulois" (Gallic rooster), historical emblem of France, as its symbol. The Gallic rooster was probably chosen partly because it is considered as a proud and combative animal that can be sometimes aggressive, although it had been used previously as a symbol by French teams â a former <a href="association%20football">association football</a> player, Jean Rigal, wore a uniform with this emblem as early as May 1910. The badge was initially white and red, but was altered to a multicoloured, embroidered image after 1945, and has been golden since 1970.

The symbol used by the French rugby team was a great success, and was later adopted by the French delegation at the Olympic Games of 1920 where the rooster was perched on five Olympic rings. The rooster has since become a well-known symbol of French teams. French players are sometimes called "les coqs" and some French supporters have been known to release roosters on the playing field before games.

The French team traditionally played in blue shirts, white shorts, and red socks, the colors of the national flag, and as such were nicknamed "les tricolores". Due to the mostly blue strip the French team currently wears, the team is now often referred to as "les Bleus" (the Blues), like many other French sporting teams. When this strip clashes with that of their opponents, such as in games against Scotland and Italy, French players wear white. New strips were developed for the 2007 World Cup, one of which is a darker blue. In June 2011 they relaunched another kit which they wear blue shirt, blue shorts and blue socks for their home kit and they wear white shirt, white shorts and white socks for their away kit.

In 2011 the <a href="French%20Rugby%20Federation">French Rugby Federation</a> (FFR) announced that Adidas would be their new partner for a period of six years, with them taking over production of the French national rugby shirt from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2018.

Led by newly elected president <a href="Bernard%20Laporte">Bernard Laporte</a>, the federation intended on selling the jersey to a sponsor. The <a href="French%20Rugby%20Federation">FFR</a> announced on 24 January 2017 that they had started the commercialisation of the jersey. In February, it was decided that the jersey would first be used to support France's bid for the <a href="2023%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2023 Rugby World Cup</a> by showing "#France2023" on the front of the kit. In March 2017, the <a href="Mohed%20Altrad">Groupe Altrad</a> showed its support for France's bid for the <a href="2023%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> and the company's logo accompanied "#France2023" on the jersey. The group became the first private company in history that appeared on the French national team kits. As of 2017 and France's successful bid to host the World Cup, Groupe Altrad signed a contract with the FFR, appearing solely on the jerseys.

In 2017 the FFR announced that <a href="Le%20Coq%20Sportif">Le Coq Sportif</a> would once again be their partner for a period of six years, with them taking over production of the French national rugby shirt from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2024.

Historically, France played internationals at venues such as <a href="Parc%20des%20Princes">Parc des Princes</a> and the <a href="Stade%20Olympique%20Yves-du-Manoir">Stade Olympique de Colombes</a>, both in Paris. The <a href="Stade%20Olympique%20Yves-du-Manoir">Stade Olympique de Colombes</a> was the main venue for the <a href="1924%20Summer%20Olympics">1924 Summer Olympics</a>, where rugby was a sport.

Ever since moving out of Parc des Princes at the end of 1997, France's main home venue has been the <a href="Stade%20de%20France">Stade de France</a> in <a href="Saint-Denis%2C%20Seine-Saint-Denis">Saint-Denis</a>, where their home Six Nations matches are played. It has a capacity of 80,000. Since 2005, France has also played home internationals at the following venues around the country: <a href="Stade%20Chaban-Delmas">Stade Chaban-Delmas</a>, <a href="Stade%20Pierre-Mauroy">Grand Stade Lille MÃ©tropole</a> (now known as Stade Pierre-Mauroy), <a href="Stade%20Gerland">Stade Gerland</a>, <a href="Stade%20V%C3%A9lodrome">Stade VÃ©lodrome</a>, <a href="Stade%20de%20la%20Mosson">Stade de la Mosson</a>, <a href="Stade%20de%20la%20Beaujoire">Stade de la Beaujoire</a>, <a href="Stade%20Bonal">Stade Bonal</a>, <a href="Stadium%20Municipal">Stadium Municipal</a> (<a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>) and <a href="U%20Arena">U Arena</a>.

In June 2012, the FFR announced that plans were under way for a new rugby-dedicated stadium to be constructed in <a href="%C3%89vry%2C%20Essonne">Ãvry</a>, south of Paris. The stadium was projected to cost â¬600M and have a seating capacity of 82,000. It was originally scheduled for completion by 2017, but later delayed to 2021 or 2022. In December 2016, FFR officially abandoned the stadium project.

During the <a href="1991%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1991 World Cup</a>, Pool D (which included France) matches were played throughout France including <a href="B%C3%A9ziers">BÃ©ziers</a>, <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a>, <a href="Grenoble">Grenoble</a>, <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>, <a href="Brive">Brive</a> and <a href="Agen">Agen</a>. Parc des Princes and Stadium Lille-Metropole also hosted a quarter-final each. Pool C fixtures at the <a href="1999%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1999 World Cup</a> were played throughout France in <a href="B%C3%A9ziers">BÃ©ziers</a>, <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> and <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a>. A second round match was held at <a href="Stade%20F%C3%A9lix%20Bollaert">Stade FÃ©lix Bollaert</a>, and one quarter final was held at the Stade de France, both 2007 venues.

For the <a href="2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2007 World Cup</a>, France was the primary host, and there were ten venues used for matches throughout the country (<a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> in Wales and <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> in Scotland also hosted some games). The French cities that hosted matches were <a href="Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a> (Stade Chaban-Delmas), <a href="Lens%2C%20Pas-de-Calais">Lens</a> (Stade FÃ©lix Bollaert), Lyon (Stade Gerland), <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> (Stade VÃ©lodrome), <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a> (Stade de la Mosson), Nantes (Stade de la Beaujoire), Paris (Stade de France, Saint-Denis and Parc des Princes), <a href="Saint-%C3%89tienne">Saint-Ãtienne</a> (<a href="Stade%20Geoffroy-Guichard">Stade Geoffroy-Guichard</a>), and <a href="Toulouse">Toulouse</a> (Stadium de Toulouse). The final was played at Stade de France. They will host it again in <a href="2023%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2023</a>.

France competes annually in the <a href="Six%20Nations%20Championship">Six Nations Championship</a>, which is played against five other European nations: <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a>, <a href="Ireland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Ireland</a>, <a href="Italy%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Italy</a>, <a href="Scotland%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Scotland</a> and <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a>. France first contested the tournament in 1910 when the Home Nations became the Five Nations. France were expelled from the tournament due to rumours of professionalism in the then-amateur sport in 1932, but rejoined in 1947. They first won the competition in 1954, sharing the championship with both England and Wales. France shared with Wales again the following season, and won it outright for the first time in 1959. France's longest wait for a championship spanned 37 tournaments (1910â1954). The <a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi%20Trophy">Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy</a> is also contested between France and Italy during the Six Nations. Over the whole history of the Tournament, they are the third most-winning nation, ten wins behind England. However, it should be taken into account that France have been present in 33 fewer tournaments than the Home Nations. France has won almost exactly the same proportion of Six Nations Tournaments in which it has competed as England, and is the most successful nation in the post-<a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> era (1945âpresent).

The French have competed at every <a href="Rugby%20World%20Cup">World Cup</a> since the inaugural tournament in <a href="1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1987</a>. Although they have yet to win a World Cup, they have participated in the play-off stage of every tournament, and have reached the final three times.

In 1987 France took on pre-tournament favourites <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> at <a href="Concord%20Oval">Concord Oval</a> for a place in the final. In one of the greatest World Cup matches, the Australians appeared to be in control, leading 9â0, 15â12 and 24â21 at various stages of the match, only for the French to keep coming back. With the scores locked at 24â24 and the prospect of extra time looming, the French scored one of the most memorable tries in rugby history. Starting an attack from inside their own half, the French passed the ball through 11 pairs of hands before fullback <a href="Serge%20Blanco">Serge Blanco</a> beat Wallabies hooker <a href="Tom%20Lawton">Tom Lawton</a> to score a try in the corner. France won 30â24, and would face co-hosts <a href="All%20Blacks">New Zealand</a> in the final at <a href="Eden%20Park">Eden Park</a>. The French had not fully recovered from their magnificent effort in the semi-final, and New Zealand won the anti-climactic decider 29â9.

In <a href="1991%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1991</a> France met eternal arch-rivals <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a> in the quarterfinal at <a href="Parc%20des%20Princes">Parc des Princes</a>. Earlier in the year at <a href="Twickenham%20Stadium">Twickenham</a> the two sides had played off for the Five Nations Grand Slam. The French scored three magnificent tries but were denied by the fearsome English forward pack. In a very tense and brutally physical match, the scores were tied at 10-all when the French were awarded a scrum five metres out from the tryline. French number eight <a href="Marc%20Cecillon">Marc Cecillon</a> looked set to score the try that would have won the game for the French. Suddenly he was hit and driven back in a tackle from opponent <a href="Michael%20Skinner%20%28rugby%20union%29">Mick Skinner</a>, a tackle which changed the momentum of the match. England went on to win 19â10 and eventually reached the Final. At the end of the match, France coach <a href="Daniel%20Dubroca">Daniel Dubroca</a> angrily assaulted New Zealand referee <a href="David%20Bishop%20%28referee%29">David Bishop</a> in the players tunnel. He resigned soon afterwards.

In <a href="1995%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1995</a> France finished third overall, defeating England 19â9 in the third/fourth place play-off after their defeat to South Africa in the semi-finals. After coming from behind to defeat the All Blacks in their <a href="1999%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1999</a> semi-final, France lost to Australia 35â12 in the final. In <a href="2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2003</a> they finished fourth, losing the third/fourth place game to the All Blacks. At the <a href="2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">World Cup 2007</a>, after defeating New Zealand 20â18 in the quarter-final, France lost out to England in the semi-finals losing 14â9 after finishing the break 5â6 ahead. France lost to Argentina in the bronze final to finish the tournament fourth.

France's <a href="2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2011</a> campaign was marked by turmoil within the camp; reports before the tournament indicated as many as 25 of the 30-member squad had turned against head coach <a href="Marc%20Li%C3%A8vremont">Marc LiÃ¨vremont</a>. In pool play, France had unimpressive wins over <a href="Japan%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Japan</a> and <a href="Canada%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Canada</a>, an expected loss to <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand</a>, and a shock loss to <a href="Tonga%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Tonga</a>. During this stage, LiÃ¨vremont heavily criticized the team in the media, further angering many of his players, with veteran back-rower <a href="Imanol%20Harinordoquy">Imanol Harinordoquy</a> publicly critical of LiÃ¨vremont. Despite the losses, they qualified for the knockout stage. At this time, the players effectively rebelled against LiÃ¨vremont; after the tournament, Harinordoquy would tell the French rugby publication "<a href="Midi%20Olympique">Midi Olympique</a>", "We had to free ourselves from his supervision." The team responded by defeating <a href="England%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">England</a> 19â12 in the quarter final and controversially beating <a href="Wales%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Wales</a> 9â8 in the semi-final after Welsh captain <a href="Sam%20Warburton">Sam Warburton</a> was sent off. The French proved admirable opponents in the final, however, losing out to New Zealand 8â7 to finish second for the third time in a <a href="Rugby%20World%20Cup">Rugby World Cup</a>

France are the third-highest World Cup points scorers of all time, with 1195 points. They are also the third-highest try scorers, and the second-highest penalty scorers. France's <a href="Thierry%20Lacroix">Thierry Lacroix</a> was the top points scorer at the 1995 tournament with 112 points, and <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lafond">Jean-Baptiste Lafond</a> was the joint top try scorer in 1991 with six tries (equal with <a href="David%20Campese">David Campese</a>).

France were named <a href="World%20Rugby%20Team%20of%20the%20Year">World Rugby Team of the Year</a> in 2002. When the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Rankings">World Rankings</a> were introduced by World Rugby (then the International Rugby Board) in 2003, France were ranked fifth. During November 2003 France briefly occupied third place before falling to fourth by December that year. After falling to fifth during November 2004, France rose again to fourth by April 2005. During early 2006, France rose again, peaking at second in July that year. France were ranked number two in the world until falling to third in June 2007 after two successive defeats to the All Blacks. They then fell to fifth after losing to Argentina in the opening match of the 2007 World Cup.

France have won 404 of their 752 test matches, a win record of 54.00%

In December 2016, when World Rugby was considering a change in the eligibility rules for international selection, FFR president <a href="Bernard%20Laporte">Bernard Laporte</a> announced that the body would require that all France national team members hold French passports. This requirement is in addition to then-current WR rules mandating three years' residency for international selection, a period which WR increased to five years effective from 31 December 2020. Players who represented France prior to Laporte's announcement <a href="Grandfather%20clause">remain eligible for selection</a> even if they do not hold French passports. Thus, since 2016 France have had the lowest number of foreign-born players in their Six Nations's squads.

Ten former French national team players have been inducted into the <a href="World%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">World Rugby Hall of Fame</a>. Its direct predecessor is the IRB Hall of Fame, founded in 2006 by the sport's international governing body, <a href="World%20Rugby">World Rugby</a>, when it was known as the International Rugby Board. In late 2014, the IRB Hall merged with the separate <a href="International%20Rugby%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Rugby Hall of Fame</a>, with all International Hall inductees becoming members of the World Rugby Hall of Fame.

<a href="Marcel%20Communeau">Marcel Communeau</a> (1885â1971), a back-rower for <a href="Stade%20Fran%C3%A7ais">Stade FranÃ§ais</a> at club level, played in France's first official international match against New Zealand's <a href="The%20Original%20All%20Blacks">Original All Blacks</a> in 1906. He went on to earn 21 caps for France, serving as captain for the country's first Five Nations appearance in 1910 and leading France to its first-ever win in that competition in 1911 against Scotland. Communeau is also credited with suggesting that France adopt the rooster as its team emblem. He entered the World Rugby Hall in 2015.

<a href="Jean%20Prat">Jean Prat</a> (1923â2005) earned 51 caps playing for France from 1945 to 1955, and captained France to their first wins over Wales and the All Blacks. He was also France's captain in 1954 when they won their first ever Five Nations (shared with Wales and England). Prat was inducted to the International Hall of Fame in 2001 and the IRB Hall of Fame in 2011.

<a href="Lucien%20Mias">Lucien Mias</a> (born 1930), nicknamed "Docteur Pack", was credited with inventing the concept of the advantage line in forward play. When inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2011, he was called "one of the most influential captains of his country". He was most noted for captaining France to a Test series win over South Africa in 1958, the first such feat in the 20th century for a touring team.

<a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Boniface">AndrÃ© Boniface</a> (born 1934) also played in France's win over the All Blacks in 1954; it was only his second test for France. Boniface went on to play 48 tests for France before retiring in 1966. He was inducted to the International Hall in 2005 and the IRB Hall in 2011.

<a href="Guy%20Boniface">Guy Boniface</a> (1937â1968) emerged on the international scene shortly after his older brother AndrÃ©, although the two did not play together in the same France side until 1961. According to the IRB, the Boniface brothers "redefined the concept of back play through their unique blend of skill and creativity." Guy won 35 caps for France before his death in an auto accident in 1968. He was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame alongside his brother in 2011.

<a href="Jo%20Maso">Jo Maso</a> (born 1944) first played for France between 1966 and 1973; mainly at <a href="Centre%20%28rugby%20union%29">centre</a>. He played in France's first ever Five Nations Grand Slam in 1968, and that year toured New Zealand and Australia. He represented France in 25 tests and also played for the <a href="Barbarian%20F.C.">Barbarians</a> and the World XV that beat England in 1971. Maso entered the International Hall in 2003 and became a member of the World Rugby Hall with the merger of the two halls of fame. He is now the manager of the French national team.

<a href="Jean-Pierre%20Rives">Jean-Pierre Rives</a> (born 1952), a 1997 inductee of the International Hall who entered the World Rugby Hall with the merger, played 59 tests for France between 1975 and 1984; including 34 as captain. He played in Five Nations Grand Slams in 1977 and 1981, and captained France to their first ever win over the All Blacks in New Zealand. Rives is now a sculptor, and designed the <a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi%20Trophy">Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy</a> (Italian: Trofeo Garibaldi; French: TrophÃ©e Garibaldi), which is competed for every year by France and Italy in the 6 Nations championship.

<a href="Serge%20Blanco">Serge Blanco</a> (born 1958) played in 93 tests for France between 1980 and 1991. Playing at <a href="Fullback%20%28rugby%20union%29">fullback</a> Blanco won Five Nations Grand Slams with France in 1981 and 1987, and scored the match-winning try in France's semi-final against Australia in the <a href="1987%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">1987 World Cup</a>. He is past president both of his longtime club, <a href="Biarritz%20Olympique">Biarritz Olympique</a>, and France's national professional league, <a href="National%20Rugby%20League%20%28France%29">Ligue Nationale de Rugby</a>. Blanco was inducted to the International Hall in 1997 and the IRB Hall in 2011.

Centre <a href="Philippe%20Sella">Philippe Sella</a> (born 1962), who was also in the 1987 team, played 111 times for France between 1982 and 1995, setting an appearances record that stood until Fabien Pelous, who himself would be indicted into the World Rugby Hall in 2017, broke it during the <a href="2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2007 Rugby World Cup</a>. In 1986, he achieved the rare feat of scoring a try in each of France's Five Nations matches. Sella entered the International Hall in 1999 and the IRB Hall in 2005.

Lock <a href="Fabien%20Pelous">Fabien Pelous</a> (born 1973) was inducted into the World Rugby Hall in 2017 at a ceremony at the Hall's physical location in <a href="Rugby%2C%20Warwickshire">Rugby</a>. He appeared 118 times for France from 1995 to 2007, surpassing Sella as France's most-capped player. According to World Rugby, "Pelousâ spirit and robustness in the heat of battle made him perfect captaincy material", and he would captain "Les Bleus" 42 times, with only <a href="Thierry%20Dusautoir">Thierry Dusautoir</a> serving as captain on more occasions. In his 18-season club career, 12 of which were with his hometown club <a href="Stade%20Toulousain">Toulouse</a>, he helped Toulouse to two <a href="European%20Rugby%20Champions%20Cup">European</a> and three <a href="Bouclier%20de%20Brennus">French</a> titles.

The record for points scored for France is 422, held by <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Michalak">FrÃ©dÃ©ric Michalak</a>, who surpassed previous record holder <a href="Christophe%20Lamaison">Christophe Lamaison</a> on 22 August 2015. Lamaison continues to hold the record for conversions with 59. The record for penalties scored is 89 by <a href="Thierry%20Lacroix">Thierry Lacroix</a>, and the drop goal record of 15 is held by <a href="Jean-Patrick%20Lescarboura">Jean-Patrick Lescarboura</a>. The record for French appearances is held by <a href="Fabien%20Pelous">Fabien Pelous</a> with 118. The record for tries scored for France is with 38 held by <a href="Serge%20Blanco">Serge Blanco</a>.

Historically the role of French rugby coach (or "trainer") has varied considerably. Due to the status of rugby union as an amateur sport for most of its history, the job of deciding tactics and running team trainings has often been that of the captain or senior players. Therefore, a comprehensive list of national coaches is impossible.

Although coached by <a href="Jean%20Desclaux">Jean Desclaux</a> between 1973 and 1980, the French team's main influence during the late 1970 was captain <a href="Jacques%20Fouroux">Jacques Fouroux</a>. Fouroux played <a href="Scrum-half%20%28rugby%20union%29">scrum-half</a> and captained France to their 1977 Five Nations Grand Slam, during which France played a very forward-oriented style of rugby. Although the style of "Fouroux's Gang" was successful, it was criticised because it contrasted with the traditional open attacking style of French rugby. Fouroux was given the nickname "the little Corporal" â the same as <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. Fouroux was named as Desclaux's successor in 1981 at the age of just 33. He continued to promote a forward-oriented style of play, and France won six Five Nations titles â including two Grand Slams â while he was coach. After nearly ten years in the role he resigned in 1990 after a defeat to Romania.

Fouroux was succeeded by <a href="Daniel%20Dubroca">Daniel Dubroca</a>, who coached the team to the 1991 Rugby World Cup. Dubroca's tenure as coach did not last long, however, as he resigned after violently confronting referee David Bishop following France's World Cup quarter-final against England. Dubroca was replaced by <a href="Pierre%20Berbizier">Pierre Berbizier</a>, who coached the team until after the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Berbizier's replacement, <a href="Jean-Claude%20Skrela">Jean-Claude Skrela</a>, coached France to Five Nations Grand Slams in 1997 and 1998 before they came last in the tournament in 1999. He officially resigned following France's loss to Australia in the 1999 Rugby World Cup final. <a href="Bernard%20Laporte">Bernard Laporte</a> was appointed as Skrela's successor in November. Laporte guided France through the <a href="2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2003</a> and <a href="2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2007 Rugby World Cup</a>s before stepping down to become Secretary of State for Sport. After <a href="Philippe%20Saint-Andr%C3%A9">Philippe Saint-AndrÃ©</a> turned down the offer to replace Laporte, French Rugby Federation president <a href="Bernard%20Lapasset">Bernard Lapasset</a> appointed <a href="Marc%20Li%C3%A8vremont">Marc LiÃ¨vremont</a> to guide France to the 2011 World Cup. LiÃ¨vremont's tenure as coach was marked by inconsistent and puzzling squad selection choices, and player discontent. There were some bright moments, notably wins against New Zealand in Dunedin and South Africa in Toulouse, and the 2010 Six Nations Grand Slam. But there was also a 59â16 loss to Australia in Paris, a 22â21 loss to Italy in the 2011 Six Nations, and a 19â14 loss to Tonga during the <a href="2011%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2011 World Cup</a>. In August 2011, before the World Cup, it was announced that Philippe Saint-AndrÃ© would replace LiÃ¨vremont and guide France to the 2015 World Cup. This came as no surprise to LiÃ¨vremont, as he had announced as early as May 2010 that he would not continue as the coach of France after the World Cup.

France did not impress under Saint-AndrÃ©, finishing no higher than fourth in the Six Nations during his tenure and even claiming the <a href="Wooden%20spoon%20%28award%29">wooden spoon</a> in 2013. Following the 2015 Six Nations, he announced his resignation effective after that year's World Cup and was replaced by <a href="Guy%20Nov%C3%A8s">Guy NovÃ¨s</a>. France was even less impressive under NovÃ¨s, with "Les Bleus" winning fewer than one-third of their matches during his tenure, capped off by a run of seven winless matches. NovÃ¨s was dismissed in December 2017, becoming the first France head coach ever to be fired before the end of his contract, and was replaced by former Italy head coach <a href="Jacques%20Brunel%20%28rugby%20player%29">Jacques Brunel</a>, who arrived from the same position with <a href="Union%20Bordeaux%20B%C3%A8gles">Bordeaux BÃ¨gles</a>. NovÃ¨s' assistants were dismissed as well.

France's autumn internationals and <a href="Six%20Nations%20Championship">Six Nations Championship</a> are currently televised by the public national broadcaster <a href="France%20T%C3%A9l%C3%A9visions">France TÃ©lÃ©visions</a> (especially by the main channel <a href="France%202">France 2</a>) which lasts until 2015.

AirTrain JFK

AirTrain JFK is an elevated <a href="people%20mover">people mover</a> system and <a href="airport%20rail%20link">airport rail link</a> serving <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">John F. Kennedy International Airport</a> (JFK Airport) in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. The driverless system operates <a href="24/7%20service">24/7</a> and consists of three lines and ten stations. It connects the airport's six terminals with the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Subway">New York City Subway</a> in <a href="Howard%20Beach%2C%20Queens">Howard Beach, Queens</a>, and with the <a href="Long%20Island%20Rail%20Road">Long Island Rail Road</a> and subway in <a href="Jamaica%2C%20Queens">Jamaica, Queens</a>. <a href="Bombardier%20Transportation">Bombardier Transportation</a> operates AirTrain JFK under contract to the airport's owner, the <a href="Port%20Authority%20of%20New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a>.

A railroad link to JFK Airport was first recommended in 1968. Various plans surfaced to build a JFK Airport rail connection until the 1990s, though these were not carried out because of a lack of funding. The <a href="JFK%20Express">JFK Express</a> subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. In-depth planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990, but was ultimately cut back from a direct rail link to an intra-borough people mover. Construction of the current people-mover system began in 1998. During construction, AirTrain JFK was the subject of several lawsuits, and an operator died during one of the system's test runs. The system opened on December 17, 2003, after many delays. Since then, several improvements have been proposed for AirTrain JFK, including an extension to <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>.

All passengers entering or exiting at either Jamaica or Howard Beach pay a $5 fare, while people traveling within the airport can ride for free. The system was originally projected to carry 4 million annual paying passengers and 8.4 million annual inter-terminal passengers every year. The AirTrain has consistently exceeded these projections since opening. In 2017 the system had nearly 7.7 million paying passengers and 12.6 million inter-terminal passengers.

The first proposal for a direct rail link to JFK Airport was made in 1968, when the <a href="Metropolitan%20Transportation%20Authority">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a> (MTA) suggested extending the <a href="Long%20Island%20Rail%20Road">Long Island Rail Road</a> (LIRR) to the airport as part of the <a href="Program%20for%20Action">Program for Action</a>, an ambitious transportation expansion program for the New York City area. Ultimately, the rail link was canceled altogether due to the <a href="New%20York%20City%20fiscal%20crisis">New York City fiscal crisis</a> of 1975. Another proposal, made by the <a href="Port%20Authority%20of%20New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a> in 1987, called for a rail line to connect all of JFK Airport's terminals with a new $500 million transportation center. The Port Authority withdrew its plans in 1990 after airlines objected that they could not fund the proposal.

The MTA operated the <a href="JFK%20Express">JFK Express</a>, a premium-fare New York City Subway service that connected Midtown Manhattan to the <a href="Howard%20Beach%E2%80%93JFK%20Airport%20%28IND%20Rockaway%20Line%29">Howard BeachâJFK Airport</a> subway station, from 1978 to 1990. The route carried subway passengers to the Howard Beach station, where passengers would ride shuttle buses to the airport. The shuttle buses transported passengers between the different airport terminals within JFK's Central Terminal Area, as well as between Howard Beach and the terminals. The JFK Express service was unpopular with passengers because of its high cost, and because the buses often got stuck in traffic.

By the 1990s, there was demand for a direct link between <a href="Midtown%20Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a> and JFK Airport, which are apart by road. During rush hour, the travel time from JFK to Manhattan could average up to 80 minutes by bus; during off-peak hours, a <a href="Taxicabs%20of%20New%20York%20City">New York City taxi</a> could make that journey in 45 minutes, while a bus could cover the same distance in an hour. The Port Authority, foreseeing economic growth for the New York City area and increased air traffic at JFK, began planning for a direct rail link from the airport to Manhattan. In 1991, the Port Authority introduced a <a href="Airport%20improvement%20fee">Passenger Facility Charge</a> (PFC), a $3 tax on every passenger departing from JFK, which would provide $120 million annually.

In 1990, the MTA proposed a $1.6 billion rail link to <a href="LaGuardia%20Airport">LaGuardia</a> and JFK airports, which would be funded jointly by federal, state, and city government agencies. The rail line was to begin in Midtown Manhattan, crossing the <a href="East%20River">East River</a> into Queens via the <a href="Queensboro%20Bridge">Queensboro Bridge</a>. It would travel to LaGuardia Airport, then make two additional stops at <a href="Shea%20Stadium">Shea Stadium</a> and <a href="Jamaica%2C%20Queens">Jamaica</a> before proceeding to JFK. After the Port Authority found that the ridership demand might not justify the cost of the rail link, the MTA downgraded the project's priority. The proposal was supported by Governor <a href="Mario%20Cuomo">Mario Cuomo</a> and Queens Borough President <a href="Claire%20Shulman">Claire Shulman</a>. The transport advocacy group <a href="Regional%20Plan%20Association">Regional Plan Association</a> (RPA) called the plan "misguided", and the East Side Coalition on Airport Access's executive director said, "We are going to end up with another [...] uncompleted project in this city."

The Port Authority started reviewing blueprints for the JFK rail link in 1992. At the time, it was thought that the link could be partially open within six years. In 1994, the Port Authority set aside $40 million for engineering and marketing of the new line, and created an <a href="environmental%20impact%20statement">environmental impact statement</a> (EIS). The project's budget had grown to $2.6 billion by that year. The EIS, conducted by the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation">New York State Department of Transportation</a> and the <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA), found the plan to be feasible, though the project attracted opposition from area residents and advocacy groups.
The project was to start in 1996, but there were disputes over where the Manhattan terminal should be located. The Port Authority had suggested the heavily-trafficked corner of <a href="Lexington%20Avenue">Lexington Avenue</a> and <a href="59th%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">59th Street</a>, though many nearby residents opposed the Manhattan terminal outright. The Port Authority did not consider a connection to the more-highly used <a href="Grand%20Central%20Terminal">Grand Central Terminal</a> or <a href="Pennsylvania%20Station%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Penn Station</a> because such a connection would be too expensive and complicated. To pay for the project, the Port Authority would charge a one-way ticket price of between $9 and $12. By February 1995, the cost of the planned link had increased to over $3 billion in the previous year alone. As a result, the Port Authority considered abridging the rail link plan, seeking federal and state funding, partnering with private investors, or terminating the line at a Queens subway station.

The direct rail connection between Manhattan, LaGuardia Airport, and JFK Airport was canceled outright in May 1995. The plan had failed to become popular politically, as it would have involved increasing road tolls and <a href="PATH%20%28rail%20system%29">PATH</a> train fares to pay for the new link. In addition, the <a href="Early%201990s%20recession%20in%20the%20United%20States">1990s economic recession</a> meant that there was little chance that the Port Authority could fund the project's rising price. Following the cancellation, the planned connection to JFK Airport was downsized to a <a href="monorail">monorail</a> or <a href="people%20mover">people mover</a>, which would travel between Howard Beach and the JFK terminals. The Port Authority initially proposed building a $827 million monorail (similar to <a href="AirTrain%20Newark">AirTrain Newark</a> at <a href="Newark%20Liberty%20International%20Airport">Newark Airport</a> that would open the following year). In August 1995, the FAA approved the Port Authority's request to use the PFC funds for the monorail plan (the agency had already collected $114 million, and was planning to collect another $325 million). After the monorail was approved, the Port Authority hoped to begin construction in 1997 and open the line by 2002.

The Port Authority voted to proceed with the scaled-down system in 1996. Its final environmental impact statement (FEIS) for the JFK people mover, released in 1997, examined eight possibilities. Ultimately, the Port Authority opted for a <a href="light%20rail">light rail</a> system with the qualities of a people mover, tentatively called the "JFK Light Rail System". It would replace the shuttle buses, running from the airport terminals to either Jamaica or Howard Beach. The FEIS determined that an automated system with frequent <a href="headway">headway</a>s was the best design. According to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", in the 30 years between the first proposal and the approval of the light rail system, 21 recommendations for direct rail links to New York-area airports had been canceled.

While Governor Pataki supported the revised people-mover plan, Mayor <a href="Rudy%20Giuliani">Rudy Giuliani</a> voiced his opposition on the grounds that the city would have to contribute $300 million, and that it was not a direct rail link from Manhattan, and thus would not be profitable because of the need to transfer from Jamaica. The Port Authority was originally planning to pay for only $1.2 billion of the project, and use the other $300 million to pay the rent at the airport instead. In order to give his agreement, Giuliani wanted the Port Authority to study extending the <a href="BMT%20Astoria%20Line">Astoria elevated</a> to LaGuardia Airport, as well as making the light-rail system compatible with the subway or LIRR to allow possible future interoperability. He agreed to the plan in 1997 when the state agreed to reimburse the city for its share of the system's cost. As part of the agreement, the state would also conduct a study on a similar train link to LaGuardia Airport. By that time, the Port Authority had collected $441 million in PFC funds.

In 1999, the RPA published a report in which it recommended the construction of new lines and stations for the New York City Subway. The plan included one service that would travel from Grand Central Terminal to JFK Airport via the JFK Light Rail. Ultimately, the MTA rejected the RPA's proposal.

The Port Authority could only use the funds from the Passenger Facility Charge to make improvements that exclusively benefited airport passengers. As a result, only the sections linking Jamaica and Howard Beach to JFK Airport were approved and built, since it was expected that airport travelers would be the sole users of the system. The federal government approved the use of PFC funds for the new light rail system in February 1998. Some $200 million of the project's cost was not eligible to be funded from the PFC tax because, according to the FAA, the tax funds could not be used to pay for "any costs resulting from an over-designed system", such as fare collection systems.

Construction of the system began in May 1998. Most of the system was built one span at a time, using cranes mounted on temporary structures that erected new spans as they progressed linearly along the structures. Several sections were built using a balanced <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a> design, where two separate spans were connected to each other using the span-by-span method. The Jamaica branch's location above the median of the busy Van Wyck Expressway, combined with the varying length and curves of the track spans, caused complications during construction. One lane of the Van Wyck had to be closed in each direction during off-peak hours, causing congestion.

The route ran mostly along existing <a href="Right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">rights-of-way</a>, but three commercial properties were expropriated and demolished to make way for new infrastructure. Members of the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20City%20Planning">New York City Planning Commission</a> approved the condemnation of several buildings along the route in May 1999 but voiced concerns about the logistics of the project. These concerns included the projected high price of the tickets, ridership demand, and unwieldy transfers at Jamaica.

Though community leaders supported the project because of its connections to the Jamaica and Howard Beach station, almost all the civic groups along the Jamaica branch's route opposed it due to concerns about nuisance, noise, and traffic. There were multiple protests against the AirTrain project; during one such protest in 2000, a crane caught fire in a suspected <a href="arson">arson</a>. Homeowners in the vicinity believed the concrete supports would lower the value of their houses. Residents were also concerned about the noise that an elevated structure would create, and according to a 2012 study, the majority of residents' complaints were due to "nuisance violations". The Port Authority responded to residents' concerns by imposing strict rules regarding disruptive or loud construction activity, as well as implementing a streamlined damage claim process to compensate homeowners. Through 2002, there were 550 nuisance complaints over the AirTrain's construction, of which 98% had been resolved by April of that year. Not all community boards saw a high level of complaints; <a href="Queens%20Community%20Board%2012">Queens Community Board 12</a>, which includes the neighborhood of <a href="South%20Jamaica%2C%20Queens">South Jamaica</a> along the AirTrain's route, recorded few complaints about the construction process.

The <a href="Airlines%20for%20America">Air Transportation Association of America</a> (ATA) filed a federal lawsuit in January 1999 alleging misuse of PFC funds. In March, a federal judge vacated the project's approval because the FAA had incorrectly continued to collect and make use of comments posted after the deadline for public comment, but found that the PFC funds had not been misused. The FAA opened a second request for public comment and received a second approval. In 2000, two local advocacy groups filed a second federal lawsuit, claiming that the FEIS had published misleading statements about the effects of the elevated structure on southern Queens neighborhoods. The ATA and the two advocacy groups appealed the funding decision. The ATA later withdrew from the lawsuit, but one of the advocacy groups proceeded with the appeal and lost.

By the time the appeal was decided in October 2000, two-thirds of the system's viaduct structures had been erected. Construction progressed quickly, and the system was ready for its first test trains by that December. In May 2001, a $75 million renovation of the Howard Beach station was completed; the rebuilt station contained an ADA-compliant transfer to and from the AirTrain. The same month, work started on a $387 million renovation of the Jamaica LIRR station, which entailed building a transfer passageway to the AirTrain. Though the Jamaica station's rehabilitation was originally supposed to be finished by 2005, it was not actually completed until September 2006. Two AirTrain cars were delivered and tested after the system's <a href="Automated%20guideway%20transit">guideway</a> rails were complete by March 2001. The guideways themselves, located between the rails, were completed in August 2001.

The Port Authority predicted that the AirTrain's opening would create 118 jobs at JFK Airport. Service was originally planned to begin on the Howard Beach branch in October 2002, followed by the Jamaica branch in 2003, but was delayed because of several incidents during testing. In July 2002, three workers were injured during an AirTrain derailment, and in September 2002, a train operator died in another derailment. The <a href="National%20Transportation%20Safety%20Board">National Transportation Safety Board</a>'s investigation of the second crash found that the train had sped excessively on a curve. As a result, the opening was postponed until June 2003, and then to December 17, 2003, its eventual opening date.

Southeast Queens residents feared the project could become a <a href="boondoggle">boondoggle</a>, as the construction cost of the system had increased to $1.9 billion. Like other Port Authority properties, the AirTrain did not receive subsidies from the state or city for its operating costs. This was one of the reasons cited for the system's relatively high $5 fare, which was more than twice the subway's fare at the time of the AirTrain's opening.

Several projects were developed in anticipation of the AirTrain. By June 2003, a , 16-story building was being planned for Sutphin Boulevard across from the Jamaica station. Other nearby projects built in the preceding five years included the Jamaica Center Mall, Joseph P. Addabbo Federal Building, the Civil Court, and the <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> Laboratory and Offices. After AirTrain JFK began operations, Jamaica saw a boom in commerce. A 15-screen <a href="movie%20theater">movie theater</a> opened in the area in early 2004, and developers were also planning a 13-floor building in the area. A proposed hotel above the AirTrain terminal was canceled after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks</a>.

In 2004, the city proposed rezoning 40 blocks of Jamaica, centered around the AirTrain station, as a commercial area. The <a href="Mixed-use%20development">mixed-use</a> "airport village" was to consist of of space. According to the RPA, the rezoning was part of a proposal to re-envision Jamaica as a "regional center" because of the area's high usage as a transit hub. During the average weekday, 100,000 LIRR riders and 53,000 subway riders traveled to or from Jamaica. In addition, the Port Authority had estimated that the AirTrain JFK would carry 12.4 million passengers a year.

Plans to extend the AirTrain to Manhattan were examined even before the system's opening. Between September 2003 and April 2004, several agencies, including the MTA and the Port Authority, conducted a feasibility study of the <a href="Lower%20Manhattan%E2%80%93Jamaica/JFK%20Transportation%20Project">Lower ManhattanâJamaica/JFK Transportation Project</a>, which would allow subway or LIRR trains to travel directly from JFK Airport to Manhattan. The study examined forty alternatives, but the project was halted in 2008 before an environmental impact statement could be created.

On January 4, 2017, the office of New York Governor <a href="Andrew%20Cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a> announced a $7â10 billion plan to renovate JFK Airport. As part of the project, the AirTrain JFK would either see lengthened trainsets or a direct track connection to the rest of New York City's transportation system, and a direct connection between the AirTrain, LIRR, and subway would be built at Jamaica station. Shortly after Cuomo's announcement, the Regional Plan Association published an unrelated study for a possible direct rail link between Manhattan and JFK Airport.

In July 2017, Cuomo's office began accepting submissions for master plans to renovate the airport. A year later, in October 2018, Cuomo released details of the project, whose cost had grown to $13 billion. The improvements included lengthening AirTrains as well as adding lanes to the Van Wyck Expressway. Work would begin in 2020 if the plan were approved.

AirTrain JFK connects the airport's <a href="airport%20terminal">terminals</a> and parking areas with the Howard Beach and Jamaica stations. It is located entirely within the New York City borough of <a href="Queens">Queens</a>. The system consists of three routes: two connecting the terminals with either the Howard Beach or Jamaica stations, and one route looping continuously around the central terminal area. It is operated by Bombardier under contract to the Port Authority.

The Howard Beach Train route (colored green on the official map) begins and ends at the <a href="Howard%20Beach%E2%80%93JFK%20Airport%20%28IND%20Rockaway%20Line%29">Howard BeachâJFK Airport station</a>, where there is a direct transfer to the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Subway">New York City Subway</a>'s . It makes an additional stop at Lefferts Boulevard, where passengers can transfer to parking lot shuttle buses; the <a href="B15%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29">B15</a> bus to Brooklyn; and the limited-stop <a href="Q10%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29">Q10</a> bus. The segment from Howard Beach to Federal Circle, which is about long, passes over the long-term and employee parking lots.

The Jamaica Station Train route (colored red on the official map) begins and ends at the <a href="Jamaica%20station">Jamaica station</a>, adjacent to the <a href="Long%20Island%20Rail%20Road">Long Island Rail Road</a> platforms there. The Jamaica station contains a connection to the <a href="Sutphin%20Boulevard%E2%80%93Archer%20Avenue%E2%80%93JFK%20Airport%20%28Archer%20Avenue%20Line%29">Sutphin BoulevardâArcher AvenueâJFK Airport station</a> on the New York City Subway's . The AirTrain and LIRR stations contain transfers to the subway, as well as to ground-level bus routes. West of Jamaica, the line travels above the north side of 94th Avenue before curving southward onto the Van Wyck Expressway. The segment from Jamaica to Federal Circle is about long.

The Howard Beach Train and Jamaica Station Train routes merge at Federal Circle for car rental companies and shuttle buses to hotels and the airport's cargo areas. South of Federal Circle, the routes share track for and enter a tunnel before the tracks separate in two directions for the terminal loop. Both routes continue counterclockwise around the loop, stopping at Terminals 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8 in that order. Connections to the <a href="Q3%20%28New%20York%20City%20bus%29">Q3</a>, Q10, and B15 local buses are available at Terminal 5. The travel time from either Jamaica or Howard Beach to the JFK terminals is about eight minutes.

The Airline Terminals Train (colored gold on the official map), an <a href="List%20of%20airport%20circulators">airport terminal circulator</a>, serves the six terminals. It makes a continuous clockwise loop around the terminals, operating in the opposite direction to the Howard Beach Train and Jamaica Station Train routes. The terminal-area loop is long.

Trains to and from Jamaica and Howard Beach were originally planned to run every two minutes during peak hours, with alternate trains traveling to each branch. The final environmental impact statement projected that trains in the central terminal area would run every ninety seconds. By 2014 actual frequencies were much lower: each branch was served by one train every seven to 12 minutes during peak hours. Trains arrived every 10 to 15 minutes on each branch during weekdays; every 15 to 20 minutes during late nights; and every 16 minutes during weekends.

All AirTrain JFK stations contain elevators and are compliant with the <a href="Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201990">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</a> (ADA). Each platform is long and can fit up to four cars. The stations include air conditioning, as well as <a href="platform%20screen%20doors">platform screen doors</a> to increase passenger safety and ensure safe operation of the unmanned trains. Each station also contains safety systems such as <a href="closed-circuit%20television">CCTV cameras</a>, alarms, and emergency contact points, and is staffed by attendants.

All the stations have <a href="island%20platform">island platform</a>s except for Federal Circle, which has a bi-level <a href="split%20platform">split platform</a> layout. The Jamaica and Howard Beach stations are designed as "gateway stations" to give passengers the impression of entering the airport. There are also stations at Lefferts Boulevard, as well as Terminals 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Three former terminals, numbered 3, 6, and 9, were respectively served by the stations that are now named Terminals 2, 5, and 8. The four stations outside the Central Terminal Area were originally designated with letters AâD alongside their names; the lettering was later dropped.

Except for Terminal 4, all stations in the airport are freestanding structures, and most are connected to their respective terminal buildings by an aerial walkway. Access to Terminal 2 requires passengers to use crosswalks at street level, while the Terminal 4 station is located inside the terminal building itself.

The AirTrain has a total route length of . The system consists of of single-track <a href="Automated%20guideway%20transit">guideway</a> viaducts and of double-track guideway viaducts. AirTrain JFK is mostly elevated, though there are short segments that run underground or at ground level. The elevated sections were built with precast single and dual guideway spans, while the underground sections used <a href="cut-and-cover">cut-and-cover</a>, and the ground-level sections used concrete <a href="railroad%20tie">ties</a> and <a href="ballast">ballast</a> <a href="trackbed">trackbed</a>s. The single guideway viaducts carry one track each and are wide, while the double guideway viaducts carry two tracks each and are wide. Columns support the <a href="precast%20concrete">precast concrete</a> elevated sections at intervals of up to . The elevated structures use <a href="seismic%20isolation">seismic isolation</a> bearings and <a href="Soundproofing">soundproof barriers</a> to protect from small earthquakes as well as prevent <a href="noise%20pollution">noise pollution</a>.

The AirTrain runs on steel <a href="track%20%28rail%20transport%29">tracks</a> that are <a href="Continuously%20welded%20rail">continuously welded</a> across all joints except at the terminals; the guideway viaducts are also continuously joined. Trains use <a href="Railroad%20switch%23Crossover">double crossovers</a> at the Jamaica and Howard Beach terminals in order to switch to the track going in the opposite direction. There are also crossover switches north and south of Federal Circle, counterclockwise from Terminal 8, and clockwise from Terminal 1.

The tracks are set at a <a href="Track%20gauge">gauge</a> of . This enables possible future conversion to LIRR or subway use, or a possible connection to LIRR or subway tracks for a one-trip ride into Manhattan, since these systems use the same track gauge. AirTrain's current <a href="rolling%20stock">rolling stock</a>, or train cars, are not able to use either LIRR or subway tracks due to the cars' inadequate structural strength and the different methods of propulsion used on each system. In particular, the <a href="linear%20induction%20motor">linear induction motor</a> system that <a href="propulsion">propels</a> the AirTrain vehicles is incompatible with the <a href="traction%20motor">traction motor</a> manual-propulsion system used by LIRR and subway rolling stock. If a one-seat ride is ever implemented, a hybrid-use vehicle would be needed to operate on both subway/LIRR and AirTrain tracks.

There are seven <a href="electrical%20substation">electrical substation</a>s. The redundancy allows trains to operate even if there are power outages at one substation. Since there are no emergency exits between stations, a control tower can automatically guide the train to its next stop in case of an emergency.

AirTrain JFK is free to use for travel within the terminal area, as well as at the stations for Lefferts Boulevard, next to the long-term parking, and Federal Circle, where there are car-rental shuttle buses and transfers to and from the airport hotels. Passengers entering or leaving the system only via the Jamaica or Howard Beach stations must pay using <a href="MetroCard">MetroCard</a>.

As it has done since its opening, AirTrain accepts pay-per-ride MetroCards for $5. This is for transiting through either the Jamaica or Howard Beach gates. The MetroCards are preloaded with monetary value and $5 is deducted for each use. Cash and other forms of payment are not accepted. A $1 fee is charged for any new MetroCards.

In addition, two types of AirTrain JFK MetroCards can be purchased from <a href="vending%20machines">vending machines</a> at Jamaica and Howard Beach. The 30-Day AirTrain JFK MetroCard costs $40 and can be used for unlimited rides on the AirTrain for 30 days after first use. The AirTrain JFK 10-Trip MetroCard costs $25 and can be used for ten trips on the AirTrain for six months after first use. Both cards are only accepted on the AirTrain, and one trip is deducted for each use of the 10-Trip MetroCard. Other types of unlimited MetroCards are not accepted on the AirTrain.

Transferring to the Q3, Q10, or B15 buses from Terminal 5, or to the subway at Howard Beach and Jamaica, requires an additional $2.75 fare, since the MTA does not offer free transfers from the AirTrain. Passengers pay a total of $7.75 if they transfer between the AirTrain and MTA subways or buses at either Howard Beach or Jamaica. Patrons transferring from the AirTrain to a <a href="Pennsylvania%20Station%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Penn Station</a>-bound LIRR train at Jamaica pay $15.25 during peak hours, or $9.25 during off-peak periods, using the <a href="CityTicket">CityTicket</a>.

The fare to enter or exit at Howard Beach and Jamaica was originally planned to be $5, with a discount to $2 for airport and airline employees. The original proposal also called for fare-free travel between airport terminals, a recommendation that was ultimately implemented.

AirTrain JFK uses <a href="Bombardier%20Transportation">Bombardier Transportation</a>'s <a href="Bombardier%20Innovia%20Metro">Innovia Metro</a> rolling stock and technology. Similar systems are used on the <a href="SkyTrain%20%28Vancouver%29">SkyTrain</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Canada, and on the <a href="Kelana%20Jaya%20Line">Kelana Jaya Line</a> in <a href="Kuala%20Lumpur">Kuala Lumpur</a>, <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. The computerized trains are fully <a href="Automatic%20train%20operation">automated</a> and use a <a href="communications-based%20train%20control">communications-based train control</a> system with <a href="moving%20block">moving block</a> signals to dynamically determine the locations of the trains. AirTrain JFK is a wholly <a href="List%20of%20driverless%20trains">driverless system</a>, and it uses <a href="SelTrac">SelTrac</a> train-signaling technology manufactured by <a href="Thales%20Group">Thales Group</a>. Trains are operated from and maintained at a train yard between Lefferts Boulevard and Federal Circle, atop a former employee parking lot. The system uses pre-recorded announcements by New York City traffic reporter <a href="Bernie%20Wagenblast">Bernie Wagenblast</a>, a longtime employee of the Port Authority.

The 32 individual, non-<a href="Articulated%20train">articulated</a> Mark II vehicles operating on the line draw power from a 750 V DC top-running <a href="third%20rail">third rail</a>. A linear induction motor pushes magnetically against an <a href="aluminum">aluminum</a> strip in the center of the track. The vehicles also have steerable trucks that can navigate sharp curves and <a href="Grade%20%28slope%29">steep grades</a>, as well as align precisely with the platform doors at the stations. The cars can run at up to , and they can operate on trackage with a <a href="minimum%20railway%20curve%20radius">minimum railway curve radius</a> of .

Each car is long and wide, which is similar to the dimensions of rolling stock used on the New York City Subway's <a href="B%20Division%20%28New%20York%20City%20Subway%29">B Division</a>. Trains can run in either direction and can consist of between one and four cars. The cars contain two pairs of doors on each side. An individual car has 26 seats and can carry up to 97 passengers with luggage, or 205 without luggage. But because most passengers carry luggage, the actual operating capacity is between 75 and 78 passengers per car.

When AirTrain JFK was being planned, it was expected that 11,000 passengers per day would pay to ride the system between the airport and either Howard Beach or Jamaica, and that 23,000 more daily passengers would use the AirTrain to travel between terminals. This would amount to about 4 million paying passengers and 8.4 million in-airport passengers per year. According to the FEIS, the system could accommodate over 3,000 daily riders from Manhattan, and its opening would result in approximately 75,000 fewer vehicle miles ( kilometers) being driven each day.

During the first month of service, an average of 15,000 passengers rode the system each day. Though this figure was less than the expected daily ridership of 34,000, the AirTrain JFK had become the second-busiest airport transportation system in the United States. Within its first six months, AirTrain JFK had transported 1 million riders.

The AirTrain's ridership has risen each year since then. In 2017, there were 7,655,901 passengers who paid to travel between JFK Airport and either Howard Beach or Jamaica. This represents a 292% increase over 2004, the first full year of operation, when 2,623,791 riders paid. An additional 12.6 million people are estimated to have ridden the AirTrain for free in 2017. One possible factor in the AirTrain's increasing ridership is the $7.75 fare for AirTrain and subway, which is cheaper than the $45 taxi ride between Manhattan and JFK.

HMAS Australia (1911)

HMAS "Australia" was one of three s built for the defence of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. Ordered by the Australian government in 1909, she was launched in 1911, and commissioned as <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the fledgling <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN) in 1913. "Australia" was the only <a href="capital%20ship">capital ship</a> ever to serve in the RAN.

At the start of World War I, "Australia" was tasked with finding and destroying the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">German East Asia Squadron</a>, which was prompted to withdraw from the Pacific by the battlecruiser's presence. Repeated diversions to support the capture of German colonies in <a href="German%20New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> and <a href="German%20Samoa">Samoa</a>, as well as an overcautious <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>, prevented the battlecruiser from engaging the German squadron before the latter's destruction. "Australia" was then assigned to <a href="Naval%20warfare%20of%20World%20War%20I%23North%20Sea">North Sea operations</a>, which consisted primarily of patrols and exercises, until the end of the war. During this time, "Australia" was involved in early attempts at <a href="naval%20aviation">naval aviation</a>, and 11 of her personnel participated in the <a href="Zeebrugge%20Raid">Zeebrugge Raid</a>. The battlecruiser was not at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>, as she was undergoing repairs following a collision with sister ship . "Australia" only ever <a href="fired%20in%20anger">fired in anger</a> twice: at a German merchant vessel in January 1915, and at a suspected submarine contact in December 1917.

On her return to Australian waters, several sailors aboard the warship <a href="mutiny">mutinied</a> after a request for an extra day's <a href="leave%20%28military%29">leave</a> in <a href="Fremantle%2C%20Western%20Australia">Fremantle</a> was denied, although other issues played a part in the mutiny, including minimal leave during the war, problems with pay, and the perception that <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> personnel were more likely to receive promotions than Australian sailors. Post-war budget cuts saw "Australia"s role downgraded to a training ship before she was placed in reserve in 1921. The <a href="disarmament">disarmament</a> provisions of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> required the destruction of "Australia" as part of the British Empire's commitment, and she was scuttled off <a href="Sydney%20Heads">Sydney Heads</a> in 1924.

The "Indefatigable" class of battlecruisers were based heavily on the preceding . The main difference was that the "Indefatigable"s design was enlarged to give the ships' two wing turrets a wider arc of fire. As a result, the "Indefatigable" class was not a significant improvement on the "Invincible" design; the ships were smaller and not as well protected as the contemporary German battlecruiser and subsequent German designs. While "Von der Tann"s characteristics were not known when the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of the class, , was laid down in February 1909, the Royal Navy obtained accurate information on the German ship before work began on "Australia" and her sister ship .

"Australia" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> of , and a maximum <a href="draft%20%28hull%29">draught</a> of . The ship displaced at load and at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She had a crew of 818 officers and <a href="naval%20rating">ratings</a> in 1913.

The ship was powered by two sets of <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> <a href="direct-drive">direct-drive</a> <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving two <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s, using steam provided by 31 coal-burning <a href="Babcock%20%26amp%3B%20Wilcox%20boiler">Babcock & Wilcox boiler</a>s. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . However, during trials in 1913, "Australia" turbines provided , allowing her to reach . "Australia" carried enough coal and <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> to give her a range of at a cruising speed of .

"Australia" carried eight <a href="BL%2012%20inch%20Mk%20X%20naval%20gun">BL 12-inch Mark X guns</a> in four BVIII* twin <a href="turret">turret</a>s; the largest guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were <a href="wing%20turret">wing turret</a>s mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had some limited ability to fire to the opposite side. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen <a href="BL%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20VII">BL 4-inch Mark VII guns</a> positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two submerged <a href="torpedo%20tube">tubes</a> for <a href="British%2018%20inch%20torpedo">18-inch torpedoes</a>, one on each side aft of 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.

The "Indefatigable"s were protected by a <a href="waterline">waterline</a> <a href="armoured%20belt">armoured belt</a> that extended between and covered the end <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s. Their armoured <a href="deck%20%28ship%29">deck</a> ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The <a href="main%20battery">main battery</a> turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes of the same thickness.

"Australia"s 'A' turret was fitted with a <a href="rangefinder">rangefinder</a> at the rear of the turret roof. It was also equipped to control the entire main armament, in case normal fire control positions were knocked out or rendered inoperable.

"Australia" received a single <a href="QF%203-inch%2020%20cwt">QF 3-inch 20 cwt</a> (76Â mm) <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> (AA) gun on a high-angle Mark II mount that was added in March 1915. This had a maximum depression of 10Â° and a maximum elevation of 90Â°. It fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 12â14 rounds per minute. It had a maximum effective ceiling of . It was provided with 500 rounds. The 4-inch guns were enclosed in <a href="casemate">casemate</a>s and given blast shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, and two aft guns were removed at the same time. An additional 4-inch gun was fitted in during 1917 as an AA gun. It was mounted on a Mark II high-angle mounting with a maximum elevation of 60Â°. It had a reduced propellant charge with a muzzle velocity of only ; 100 rounds were carried for it.
"Australia" received a <a href="Fire-control%20system%23Naval%20fire%20control">fire-control director</a> sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently. "Australia" was also fitted with an additional inch of armour around the midships turrets following the Battle of Jutland.

By 1918, "Australia" carried a <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a> and a <a href="Sopwith%201%C2%BD%20Strutter">Sopwith 1Â½ Strutter</a> on platforms fitted to the top of 'P' and 'Q' turrets. The first flying off by a 1Â½ Strutter was from "Australia"s 'Q' turret on 4 April 1918. Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather. At the end of World War I, "Australia" was described as "the least obsolescent of her class".

After the war, both anti-aircraft guns were replaced by a pair of <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20V%20naval%20gun">QF 4-inch Mark V guns</a> on manually operated high-angle mounts in January 1920. Their elevation limits were â5Â° to 80Â°. The guns fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 10â15 rounds per minute. They had a maximum effective ceiling of .

At the start of the 20th century, the British <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> maintained that naval defence of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, including the <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a>s, should be unified under the Royal Navy. Attitudes on this matter softened during the first decade, and at the 1909 Imperial Conference, the Admiralty proposed the creation of 'Fleet Units': forces consisting of a battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines. Although some were to be operated by the Royal Navy at distant bases, particularly in the Far East, the Dominions were encouraged to purchase fleet units to serve as the core of new national navies: Australia and Canada were both encouraged to do so at earliest opportunity, New Zealand was asked to partially subsidise a fleet unit for the <a href="China%20Station">China Station</a>, and there were plans for South Africa to fund one at a future point. Each fleet unit was designed as a "navy in miniature", and would operate under the control of the purchasing Dominion during peacetime. In the event of widespread conflict, the fleet units would come under Admiralty control, and would be merged to form larger fleets for regional defence. Australia was the only Dominion to purchase a full fleet unit, and while the New Zealand-funded battlecruiser was donated to the Royal Navy outright, no other nation purchased ships under the fleet unit plan.

On 9 December 1909, a cable was sent by <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a> <a href="William%20Ward%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Dudley">Lord Dudley</a> to the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Colonies">Secretary of State for the Colonies</a>, <a href="Robert%20Crewe-Milnes%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Crewe">The Earl of Crewe</a>, requesting that construction of three cruisers and an "Indefatigable"-class battlecruiser start at earliest opportunity. It is unclear why this design was selected, given that it was known to be inferior to the battlecruisers entering service with the <a href="German%20Imperial%20Navy">German Imperial Navy</a> ("Kaiserliche Marine"). Historian John Roberts has suggested that the request may have been attributable to the Royal Navy's practice of using small battleships and large cruisers as flagships of stations far from Britain, or it might have reflected the preferences of the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a> and Admiral of the Fleet <a href="John%20Fisher%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fisher">John Fisher</a>, preferences not widely shared.

The Australian Government decided on the name "Australia", as this would avoid claims of favouritism or association with a particular state. The <a href="ship%27s%20badge">ship's badge</a> depicted the <a href="Federation%20Star">Federation Star</a> overlaid by a <a href="naval%20crown">naval crown</a>, and her motto was "Endeavour", reflecting both an idealisation of Australians' national spirit and attitude, and a connection to <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> and <a href="HM%20Bark%20Endeavour">HM Bark "Endeavour"</a>. On 6 May 1910, <a href="George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29">George Reid</a>, Australia's <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20High%20Commissioners%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">high commissioner to the United Kingdom</a>, sent a telegram cable to the Australian Government suggesting that the ship be named after the newly crowned <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a>, but this was rebuffed.

Bids for construction were forwarded to the Australian Government by Reid on 7 March 1910, and Prime Minister <a href="Alfred%20Deakin">Alfred Deakin</a> approved the submission by <a href="John%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Company">John Brown & Company</a> to construct the hull and machinery, with separate contracts awarded to <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong</a> and <a href="Vickers">Vickers</a> for the battlecruiser's armament. The total cost of construction was set at Â£2Â million. Contracts were signed between the Admiralty and the builders to avoid the problems of distant supervision by the Australian Government, and a close watch on proceedings was maintained by Reid and Captain <a href="Francis%20Haworth-Booth">Francis Haworth-Booth</a>, the Australian Naval Representative in London.

"Australia"s <a href="keel">keel</a> was laid at John Brown & Company's Clydebank yard on 23 June 1910, and was assigned the yard number 402. The ship was launched by Lady Reid on 25 October 1911, in a ceremony which received extensive media coverage. "Australia"s design was altered during construction to incorporate improvements in technology, including the newly developed nickel-steel armour plate. While it was intended that the entire ship be fitted with the new armour, manufacturing problems meant that older armour had to be used in some sections: the delay in sourcing the older armour plates set construction back half a year. Despite this, John Brown & Company delivered the ship Â£295,000 under budget.

During construction, First Lord of the Admiralty <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> attempted to arrange for "Australia" to remain in British waters on completion. Although the claim was made on strategic grounds, the reasoning behind it was so the Australian-funded ship could replace one to be purchased with British defence funds. This plan was successfully resisted by Admiral <a href="George%20King-Hall">George King-Hall</a>, then Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Navy's <a href="Australia%20Squadron">Australia Squadron</a>.
"Australia" sailed for <a href="Devonport%2C%20Devon">Devonport, Devon</a> in mid-February 1913 to begin her <a href="Sea%20trial">acceptance trials</a>. Testing of the guns, torpedoes, and machinery was successful, but it was discovered that two hull plates had been damaged during the launch, requiring the battlecruiser to dock for repairs. "Australia" was commissioned into the RAN at <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> on 21 June 1913. Two days later, Rear Admiral <a href="George%20Edwin%20Patey">George Patey</a>, the first <a href="Rear%20Admiral%20Commanding%20Australian%20Fleet">Rear Admiral Commanding Australian Fleet</a>, raised his <a href="flag%20officer">flag</a> aboard "Australia".

At launch, the standard ship's company was 820, over half of which were Royal Navy personnel; the other half was made up of Australian-born RAN personnel, or Britons transferring from the Royal Navy to the RAN. Accommodation areas were crowded, with each man having only of space to sling his hammock when "Australia" was fully manned. Moreover, the ventilation system was designed for conditions in Europe, and was inadequate for the climate in and around Australia. On delivery, "Australia" was the largest warship in the Southern Hemisphere.

Following her commissioning, "Australia" hosted several official events. On 30 June, <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> and <a href="Edward%20VIII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Edward</a>, Prince of Wales, visited "Australia" to farewell the ship. During this visit, King George knighted Patey on the ship's quarterdeckâthe first time a naval officer was knighted aboard a warship since <a href="Francis%20Drake">Francis Drake</a>. On 1 July, Patey hosted a luncheon which was attended by imperial dignitaries, including Reid, the <a href="Agent-General">Agents-General</a> of the Australian states, First Lord of the Admiralty <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, Secretary of State for the Colonies <a href="Lewis%20Vernon%20Harcourt%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Harcourt">Lewis Harcourt</a>, and the <a href="High%20Commissioner%20%28Commonwealth%29">High Commissioners</a> of other British Dominions. That afternoon, 600 Australian expatriates were invited to a ceremonial farewelling, and were entertained by shows and fireworks. Journalists and cinematographers were allowed aboard to report on "Australia" prior to her departure, and an official reporter was embarked for the voyage to Australia: his role was to promote the ship as a symbol of the bond between Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Australia" was escorted by the light cruiser during the voyage to Australia. On 25 July, the two ships left England for South Africa: the visit was part of an agreement between the Prime Ministers of Australia and South Africa to promote the link between the two nations, along with the nations' links to the rest of the British Empire. The two ships were anchored in <a href="Table%20Bay">Table Bay</a> from 18 to 26 August, during which the ships' companies participated in parades and receptions, while tens of thousands of people came to observe the ships. The two ships also visited <a href="Simon%27s%20Town">Simon's Town</a>, while "Australia" additionally called into <a href="Durban">Durban</a>. No other major ports were visited on the voyage, and the warships were instructed to avoid all major Australian ports.

"Australia" and "Sydney" reached <a href="Jervis%20Bay">Jervis Bay</a> on 2 October, where they rendezvoused with the rest of the RAN fleet (the cruisers and , and the destroyers , , and ). The seven warships prepared for a formal fleet entry into Sydney Harbour. On 4 October, "Australia" led the fleet into Sydney Harbour, where responsibility for Australian naval defence was passed from the Royal Navy's Australia Squadron, commanded by King-Hall aboard , to the RAN, commanded by Patey aboard "Australia".

In her first year of service, "Australia" visited as many major Australian ports as possible, to expose the new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that these visits did more to break down state rivalries and promote the unity of Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event. During late 1913, footage for the film "<a href="Sea%20Dogs%20of%20Australia">Sea Dogs of Australia</a>" was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn almost immediately after first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.
During July 1914, "Australia" and other units of the RAN fleet were on a training cruise in Queensland waters. On 27 July, the <a href="Australian%20Commonwealth%20Naval%20Board">Australian Commonwealth Naval Board</a> learned through press telegrams that the British Admiralty thought that there would be imminent and widespread war in Europe following the <a href="July%20Crisis">July Crisis</a>, and had begun to position its fleets as a precaution. Three days later, the Board learned that the official warning telegram had been sent: at 22:30, "Australia" was recalled to Sydney to take on coal and stores.

On 3 August, the RAN was placed under Admiralty control. Orders for RAN warships were prepared over the next few days: "Australia" was assigned to the concentration of British naval power on the <a href="China%20Station">China Station</a>, but was allowed to seek out and destroy any armoured warships (particularly those of the <a href="German%20East%20Asia%20Squadron">German East Asia Squadron</a>) in the <a href="Australian%20Station">Australian Station</a> before doing so. Vice Admiral <a href="Maximilian%20von%20Spee">Maximilian von Spee</a>, commander of the German squadron, was aware of "Australia"s presence in the region and her superiority to his entire force; the German admiral's plan was to harass British shipping and colonies in the Pacific until the presence of "Australia" and the China Squadron forced his fleet to relocate to other seas.

The British Empire declared war on Germany on 5 August, and the RAN swung into action. "Australia" had departed Sydney the night before, and was heading north to rendezvous with other RAN vessels south of <a href="German%20New%20Guinea">German New Guinea</a>. The German colonial capital of <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> was considered a likely base of operations for von Spee, and Patey put together a plan to clear the harbour. "Australia"s role was to hang back: if the armoured cruisers and were present, the other RAN vessels would lure them into range of the battlecruiser. The night-time operation was executed on 11 August, and no German ships were found in the harbour. Over the next two days, "Australia" and the other ships unsuccessfully searched the nearby bays and coastline for the German ships and any wireless stations, before returning to Port Moresby to refuel.

In late August, "Australia" and escorted a New Zealand <a href="Occupation%20of%20German%20Samoa">occupation force</a> to <a href="German%20Samoa">German Samoa</a>. Patey believed that the German fleet was likely to be in the eastern Pacific, and Samoa would be a logical move. Providing protection for the New Zealand troopships was a beneficial coincidence, although the timing could have been better, as an Australian expedition to <a href="Occupation%20of%20German%20New%20Guinea">occupy German New Guinea</a> departed from Sydney a few days after the New Zealand force left home watersâ"Australia" was expected to support both, but Patey only learned of the expeditions after they had commenced their journeys. The battlecruiser left Port Moresby on 17 August and was met by "Melbourne" en route on 20 August. The next day, they reached NoumÃ©a and the New Zealand occupation force, consisting of the troopships "Moeraki" and "Monowai", the French cruiser , and three s. The grounding of "Monowai" delayed the expedition's departure until 23 August; the ships reached <a href="Suva">Suva, Fiji</a> on 26 August, and arrived off <a href="Apia">Apia</a> early in the morning of 30 August. The city surrendered without a fight, freeing "Australia" and "Melbourne" to depart at noon on 31 August to meet the Australian force bound for Rabaul.
The <a href="Australian%20Naval%20and%20Military%20Expeditionary%20Force">Australian invasion force</a> had mustered off the <a href="Louisiade%20Archipelago">Louisiade Archipelago</a> by 9 September; the assembled ships included "Australia", the cruisers , and , the destroyers , , and , the submarines and , the auxiliary cruiser , the storeship , three <a href="Collier%20%28ship%20type%29">collier</a>s and an oiler. The force sailed north, and at 06:00 on 11 September, "Australia" deployed two <a href="picket%20boat">picket boat</a>s to secure <a href="Karavia%20Bay">Karavia Bay</a> for the expeditionary force's transports and supply ships. Later that day, "Australia" captured the German steamer "Sumatra" off Cape Tawui. After this, the battlecruiser stood off, in case she was required to shell one of the two wireless stations the occupation force was attempting to capture. The German colony was captured, and on 15 September, "Australia" departed for Sydney.

The presence of "Australia" around the former German colonies, combined with the likelihood of Japan declaring war on Germany, prompted von Spee to withdraw his ships from the region. On 13 August, the East Asia Squadronâwith the exception of , which was sent to prey on British shipping in the Indian Oceanâhad begun to move eastwards. After appearing off Samoa on 14 September, then <a href="Bombardment%20of%20Papeete">attacking Tahiti</a> eight days later, von Spee led his force to South America, and from there planned to sail for the Atlantic. Patey was ordered on 17 September to head back north with "Australia" and "Sydney" to protect the Australian expeditionary force. On 1 October, "Australia", "Sydney", "Montcalm", and "Encounter" headed north from Rabaul to find the German ships, but turned around to return at midnight, after receiving an Admiralty message about the Tahiti attack. Although Patey suspected that the Germans were heading for South America and wanted to follow with "Australia", the Admiralty was unsure that the intelligence was accurate, and tasked the battlecruiser with patrolling around Fiji in case they returned. "Australia" reached Suva on 12 October, and spent the next four weeks patrolling the waters around Fiji, Samoa, and New Caledonia: despite Patey's desires to range out further, Admiralty orders kept him chained to Suva until early November.

As Patey predicted, von Spee had continued east, and it was not until his force inflicted the first defeat on the Royal Navy in 100 years at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Coronel">Battle of Coronel</a> that "Australia" was allowed to pursue. Departing on 8 November, the battlecruiser replenished coal from a pre-positioned collier on 14 November, and reached Chamela Bay (near <a href="Manzanillo%2C%20Mexico">Manzanillo, Mexico</a>) 12 days later. Patey was made commander of a multinational squadron tasked with preventing the German squadron from sailing north to Canadian waters, or following them if they attempted to enter the Atlantic via the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> or around <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>. Patey's ships included "Australia", the British light cruiser and the Japanese cruisers , , and the ex-Russian battleship <a href="Russian%20battleship%20Retvizan">"Hizen"</a>. The ships made for the <a href="Galapagos%20Islands">Galapagos Islands</a>, which were searched from 4 to 6 December. After finding no trace of von Spee's force, the Admiralty ordered Patey to investigate the South American coast from <a href="Perlas%20Island">Perlas Island</a> down to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Guayaquil">Gulf of Guayaquil</a>. The German squadron had sailed for the Atlantic via <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a>, and was defeated by a British fleet after <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Falkland%20Islands">attempting to raid the Falkland Islands</a> on 8 December. Patey's squadron learned of this 10 December, while off the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Panama">Gulf of Panama</a>; "Australia"s personnel were disappointed that they did not have the chance to take on "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau". Nevertheless, the battlecruiser's presence in the Pacific during 1914 had provided an important counter to the German armoured cruisers, and enabled the RAN to participate in the Admiralty's global strategy. Moreover, it is unlikely that the attack on Rabaul would have gone ahead had "Australia" not been available to protect the landing force.

As the threat of a German naval attack had been removed by the destruction of the East Asia Squadron, "Australia" was free for deployment elsewhere. Initially, the battlecruiser was to serve as flagship of the <a href="North%20America%20and%20West%20Indies%20Station">West Indies Squadron</a>, with the task of pursuing and destroying any German vessels that evaded <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> blockades. "Australia" was ordered to sail to Jamaica via the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>, but as it was closed to heavy shipping, she was forced to sail down the coast of South America and pass through the <a href="Strait%20of%20Magellan">Strait of Magellan</a> during 31 December 1914 and 1 January 1915â"Australia" is the only ship of the RAN to cross from the Pacific to the Atlantic by sailing under South America. During the crossing, one of the warship's propellers was damaged, and she had to limp to the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a> at half speed. Temporary repairs were made, and "Australia" departed on 5 January. A vessel well clear of the usual shipping routes was spotted on the afternoon of the next day, and the battlecruiser attempted to pursue, but was hampered by the damaged propeller. Unable to close the gap before sunset, a warning shot was fired from 'A' turret, which caused the shipâthe former German passenger liner, now naval auxiliary "Eleonora Woermann"âto stop and be captured. As "Australia" could not spare enough personnel to secure and operate the merchant ship, and "Eleonora Woermann" was too slow to keep pace with the battlecruiser, the German crew were taken aboard and the ship was sunk.
Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dogger%20Bank%20%281915%29">Battle of Dogger Bank</a>, the Admiralty saw the need for dedicated battlecruiser squadrons in British waters, and earmarked "Australia" to lead one of them. On 11 January, while en route to Jamaica, "Australia" was diverted to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. Reaching there on 20 January, the battlecruiser was ordered to proceed to Plymouth, where she arrived on 28 January and paid off for a short refit. The docking was completed on 12 February, and "Australia" reached <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> on 17 February after sailing through a gale. She was made flagship of the <a href="2nd%20Battlecruiser%20Squadron%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">2nd Battlecruiser Squadron</a> (2nd BCS) of the Battlecruiser Fleet, part of the British <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, on 22 February. Vice Admiral Patey was appointed to command this squadron. In early March, to avoid a conflict of seniority between Patey and the leader of the Battlecruiser Fleet, Vice Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>, Patey was reassigned to the West Indies, and Rear Admiral <a href="William%20Christopher%20Pakenham">William Pakenham</a> raised his flag aboard "Australia". British and Allied ships deployed to the North Sea were tasked with protecting the British Isles from German naval attack, and keeping the <a href="German%20High%20Seas%20Fleet">German High Seas Fleet</a> penned in European waters through a <a href="distant%20blockade">distant blockade</a> while trying to lure them into a decisive battle. During her time with the 2nd BCS, "Australia"s operations primarily consisted of training exercises (either in isolation or with other ships), patrols of the North Sea area in response to actual or perceived German movements, and some escort work. These duties were so monotonous, one sailor was driven insane.

"Australia" joined the Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, in response to intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation. By the next night, the German ships had withdrawn, and "Australia" returned to Rosyth. On 11 April, the British fleet was again deployed on the intelligence that a German force was planning an operation. The Germans intended to lay <a href="Sea%20mine">mines</a> at the <a href="Swarte%20Bank">Swarte Bank</a>, but after a scouting <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> located a British light cruiser squadron, they began to prepare for what they thought was a British attack. Heavy fog and the need to refuel caused "Australia" and the British vessels to return to port on 17 August, and although they were redeployed that night, they were unable to stop two German light cruisers from laying the minefield. From 26 to 28 January 1916, the 2nd BCS was positioned off the <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> while the <a href="1st%20Light%20Cruiser%20Squadron">1st Light Cruiser Squadron</a> swept the strait in an unsuccessful search of a possible minelayer.
On the morning of 21 April, "Australia" and her sister ships sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the transport of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a> was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed to coincide with the Irish <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a>), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point in the middle of the North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the <a href="Long%20Forties">Long Forties</a>. On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of <a href="Horn%20Reefs">Horn Reefs</a> when heavy fog came down. The ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack, which, combined with the weather conditions, caused "Australia" to collide with sister ship twice in three minutes. Procedural errors were found to be the cause of the collisions, which saw "Australia" (the more heavily damaged of the two ships) docked for six weeks of repairs between April and June 1916. Initial inspections of the damage were made in a floating dock on the <a href="River%20Tyne">River Tyne</a>, but the nature of the damage required a diversion to <a href="Devonport%2C%20Devon">Devonport, Devon</a> for the actual repair work. The repairs were completed more quickly than expected, and "Australia" rejoined the 2nd BCS Squadron at Rosyth on 9 June, having missed the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jutland">Battle of Jutland</a>.

On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by <a href="Room%2040">Room 40</a>, which indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard <a href="Sunderland%2C%20Tyne%20and%20Wear">Sunderland</a> on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and 6 battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence, with the result that having reached its rendezvous in the North Sea, the Grand Fleet steered north in the erroneous belief that it had entered a minefield before turning south again. Scheer steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the <a href="Harwich%20Force">Harwich Force</a> under Commodore <a href="Reginald%20Tyrwhitt">Tyrwhitt</a>. Having realised their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off. Both the British and German fleets returned home, with two British cruisers sunk by submarines and a German dreadnought battleship damaged by a torpedo.

The year 1917 saw a continuation of the battlecruiser's routine of exercises and patrols into the North Sea, with few incidents. During this year "Australia"s activities were limited to training voyages between Rosyth and <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> and occasional patrols to the north-east of Britain in search of German raiders. In May, while preparing the warship for <a href="action%20stations">action stations</a>, a 12-inch shell became jammed in the shell hoist when its fuze became hooked onto a projection. After the magazines were evacuated, <a href="Lieutenant-Commander">Lieutenant-Commander</a> F. C. Darley climbed down the hoist and successfully removed the fuze. On 26 June, King George V visited the ship. On 12 December, "Australia" was involved in a second collision, this time with the battlecruiser . Following this accident, she underwent three weeks of repairs from December 1917 until January 1918. During the repair period, "Australia" became the first RAN ship to launch an aircraft, when a <a href="Sopwith%20Pup">Sopwith Pup</a> took off from her quarterdeck on 18 December. On 30 December, "Australia" shelled a suspected submarine contact, the only time during her deployment with the 2nd BCS that she fired on the enemy.
In February 1918, the call went out for volunteers to participate in a special mission to close the port of <a href="Zeebrugge%20Raid">Zeebrugge</a> using <a href="blockship">blockship</a>s. Although many aboard "Australia" volunteered their services in an attempt to escape the drudgery of North Sea patrols, only 11 personnelâ10 sailors and an engineering lieutenantâwere selected for the raid, which occurred on 23 April. The lieutenant was posted to the engine room of the requisitioned ferry , and was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Medal%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Service Medal</a> (DSM) for his efforts. The other Australians were assigned to the boiler rooms of the blockship , or as part of a storming party along the <a href="Mole%20%28architecture%29">mole</a>. All ten sailors survivedâ"Australia" was the only ship to have no casualties from the raidâand three were awarded the DSM, while another three were <a href="mentioned%20in%20dispatches">mentioned in dispatches</a>. One of the sailors was listed in the ballot to receive a <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, but he did not receive the award.

During 1918, "Australia" and the Grand Fleet's other capital ships on occasion escorted convoys travelling between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent the period from 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron to support <a href="minelayer">minelayer</a>s. From 8 March on, the battlecruiser tested the capabilities of aircraft launched from platforms mounted over 'P' and 'Q' turrets. "Australia", along with the rest of the Grand Fleet, sortied on the afternoon of 23 March 1918 after radio transmissions had revealed that the High Seas Fleet was at sea after a failed attempt to intercept the regular British convoy to Norway. However, the Germans were too far ahead of the British and escaped without firing a shot. The 2nd BCS sailed again on 25 April to support minelayers, then cover one of the Scandinavian convoys the next day. Following the successful launch of a fully laden <a href="Sopwith%201%C2%BD%20Strutter">Sopwith 1Â½ Strutter</a> scout plane on 14 May, "Australia" started carrying two aircraftâa Strutter for reconnaissance, and a <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> fighterâand operated them until the end of the war. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea between 25â26 June and 29â30 July. During September and October, "Australia" and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>.

When the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">armistice with Germany</a> was signed on 11 November 1918 to end World War I, one of the conditions was that the <a href="German%20High%20Seas%20Fleet">German High Seas Fleet</a> was to be interred at Scapa Flow. The German fleet crossed the North Sea, and on 21 November, the British Grand Fleet sailed out to meet it; "Australia" led the port division of the fleet. "Australia" then escorted the battlecruiser to Scapa Flow, and was assigned as the German vessel's guardship. "Australia" subsequently formed part of the force which guarded the High Seas Fleet during late 1918 and early 1919, and spent much of her time either at anchor at Scapa Flow, or conducting patrols in the North Sea. This monotonous duty contributed to low morale among some sections of the ship's crew.
After being formally farewelled by the Prince of Wales and First Sea Lord <a href="Rosslyn%20Wemyss%2C%201st%20Baron%20Wester%20Wemyss">Rosslyn Wemyss</a> on 22 April 1919, "Australia" departed from Portsmouth for home the next day. She sailed in company with for the first part of the voyage, but the light cruiser later had to detach to tow the submarine . "Australia" arrived in Fremantle on 28 May 1919, the first time the ship had seen home waters in four and a half years. Despite returning home, the battlecruiser remained under Admiralty control until 1 August 1919.

"Australia" was not awarded any official <a href="battle%20honours">battle honours</a>, although personnel aboard the battlecruiser and <a href="HMAS%20Australia%20%28D84%29">her successor</a> claimed the operations in the Pacific, the North Sea patrol duties, and the battlecruiser's presence at the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet as unofficial honours. Following a reorganisation of RAN battle honours in 2010, the honours "Rabaul 1914" and "North Sea 1915â18" were retroactively awarded on 1 March 2010.

"Australia"s ship's company had consistently suffered from low morale since the battlecruiser entered service, and the proportion of "Australia"s sailors who were placed on disciplinary charges during World War I was among the highest in the RAN. Many of the Australian sailors were chafing under the severity of naval discipline and what they saw as excessive punishment for minor breaches; one example was of a sailor who was charged with desertion, imprisoned for three months, and lost all pay for staying out too late on <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>. Factors which contributed to low morale and poor discipline included frustration at not participating in the Battle of Jutland, high rates of illness, limited opportunities for leave, delays or complete lack of deferred pay, and poor-quality food. The continuation of strict wartime routines and discipline after the armistice frustrated the ship's crew. There was also the perception that "Australia"s British personnel were being promoted faster than their Australian counterparts and were dominating leadership positions. The battlecruiser's arrival in Fremantle on 28 May was met with extensive hospitality, which was reciprocated where possible by the sailors with invitations and tours of their vessel. There were opportunities for shore leave, but these were limited as "Australia" was only in port for three days, and had to sail early on 1 June for Melbourne.
Representatives of the ship's company approached Captain Claude Cumberlege to ask for a one-day delay on departure; this would allow the sailors to have a full weekend of leave, give Perth-born personnel the chance to visit their families, and give personnel another chance to invite people aboard. Cumberlege replied that as "Australia" had a tight schedule of "welcome home" port visits, such delays could not even be considered. The next morning, at around 10:30, between 80 and 100 sailors gathered in front of 'P' turret, some in working uniform, others who had just returned from shore leave still in libertyman rig. Cumberlege sent the executive officer to find out why the men had assembled, and on learning that they were repeating the previous day's request for a delay in departure, went down to address them. In a strict, legalistic tone, he informed the sailors that delaying "Australia"s departure was impossible, and ordered them to disperse. The group obeyed this order, although some were vocal in their displeasure. Shortly after, "Australia" was ready to depart, but when the order to release the <a href="Mooring%20%28watercraft%29">mooring lines</a> and get underway was given, Cumberlege was informed that the <a href="stoker%20%28occupation%29">stokers</a> had abandoned the boiler rooms. After the assembly on deck, some sailors had masked themselves with black handkerchiefs, and encouraged or intimidated the stokers on duty into leaving their posts, leaving the navy's flagship stranded at the buoy, in full view of dignitaries and crowds lining the nearby wharf. The senior <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s, along with sailors drafted from other departments, were sent to the boiler room to get "Australia" moving, and departure from Fremantle was only delayed by an hour.

Australian naval historians David Stevens and <a href="Tom%20Frame%20%28Bishop%29">Tom Frame</a> disagree on what happened next. Stevens states that Cumberledge assembled the ship's company in the early afternoon, read the "<a href="Articles%20of%20War">Articles of War</a>", lectured them on the seriousness of refusing duty, then ordered the stokers to go to their stations, which they did meekly. Frame claims the stokers returned to duty freely once the battlecruiser was underway, before Cumberledge <a href="clear%20lower%20deck">cleared lower deck</a> and spoke to the sailors. After addressing the sailors, Cumberledge gathered the ship's senior officers for an inquiry. Five men, including the Victoria Cross nominee from the Zeebrugge raid, were charged with inciting a <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> and arrested pending a <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>, which was held aboard on 20 June, after "Australia" arrived in Sydney. The ruling was that the five men had "joined a mutiny, not accompanied by violence", and they were sentenced to imprisonment in <a href="Goulburn%20Gaol">Goulburn Gaol</a>: two for a year, one for eighteen months, and two for two years with hard labour. A number of other sailors were charged with participating in a mutiny, but again, Stevens and Frame disagree on details: the former claims 7 men were successfully charged, while the latter says 32 sailors were subsequently acquitted of mutiny, but then successfully charged with refusing duty. Both authors agree that these men were tried by the captain while "Australia" was still at sea, and punished with 90 days each in cells.

Following the court-martial of the five ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within government over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured the government and the Admiralty to <a href="pardon">pardon</a> the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the <a href="Australian%20Commonwealth%20Naval%20Board">Naval Board</a> in appealing to the Admiralty without consulting the Board first. The <a href="Chief%20of%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">First Naval Member</a>, Rear Admiral <a href="Percy%20Grant%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Percy Grant</a> and <a href="Commander%20Australian%20Fleet">Commander of the Fleet</a>, Commodore <a href="John%20Saumarez%20Dumaresq">John Dumaresq</a>, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without consulting the Board, it would undermine the Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.

In May 1920, "Australia" participated in celebrations and naval activities associated with the visit of the Prince of Wales. From July to November 1920, an <a href="Avro%20504">Avro 504</a> floatplane of the <a href="Australian%20Air%20Corps">Australian Air Corps</a> was embarked aboard "Australia" as part of a series of trials intended to cumulate in the creation of a naval aviation branch. The aircraft was stored on the quarterdeck next to 'Q' turret, and was deployed and recovered by derrick. Inter-service rivalry and the ship's reduction to non-seagoing status in September prevented further operations.

Following the demise of German naval power in the Pacific the fleet unit concept was no longer seen as being relevant, and "Australia" did not have a clear role. As a result, post-war budget cuts prompted the RAN to take the battlecruiser out of active service, as the large share of resources and manpower consumed by "Australia" could be better used elsewhere in the RAN. In August 1920 the battlecruiser was rated by the Naval Board as 11th out of the RAN's 12 priorities. Accordingly, the ship's company was reduced later that year and she was assigned to <a href="Flinders%20Naval%20Depot">Flinders Naval Depot</a> as a gunnery and torpedo training ship. In the event of a major conflict, "Australia" was to serve in a role akin to <a href="coastal%20artillery">coastal artillery</a>. She was not considered to have been placed in reserve at this time, however, as it was not possible for the RAN to provide a trained complement at short notice.

"Australia" returned to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, and there is no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, it is unlikely that the Australian Government would have agreed to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace "Australia"s main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.

The 1922 <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a> was a mutual <a href="Arms%20control">naval arms limitation</a> and <a href="disarmament">disarmament</a> treaty between the five major naval powers of the time: the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Japan, Italy, and France. One of the main aspects of the treaty was the limitation on the number and size of capital ships each nation possessed; as the RAN was counted as part of the Royal Navy for the purposes of the treaty, "Australia" was one of the battlecruisers nominated for disposal to meet the British limit. The battlecruiser had to be made unusable for warlike activities within six months of the treaty's ratification, then disposed of by <a href="scuttling">scuttling</a>, as Australia did not have the facilities to <a href="Ship%20breaking">break her up for scrap</a>, and the British share of <a href="target%20ship">target ship</a>s was taken up by Royal Navy vessels. This was the only time the Australian military has been affected by a disarmament treaty until the 1997 <a href="Ottawa%20Treaty">Ottawa Treaty</a> banning the use of <a href="anti-personnel%20mine">anti-personnel mine</a>s.
When "Australia" was decommissioned in 1921, some of her equipment was removed for use in other ships, but after the November 1923 <a href="Cabinet%20of%20Australia">Cabinet</a> decision confirming the scuttling, RAN personnel and private contractors began to remove piping and other small fittings. Between November 1923 and January 1924, Â£68,000 of equipment was reclaimed; over half was donated to <a href="Tertiary%20education%20in%20Australia">tertiary education centres</a> (some of which was still in use in the 1970s), while the rest was either marked for use in future warships, or sold as souvenirs. Some consideration was given to reusing "Australia"s 12-inch guns in coastal fortifications, but this did not occur as ammunition for these weapons was no longer being manufactured by the British, and the cost of building suitable structures was excessive. It was instead decided to sink the gun turrets and spare barrels with the rest of the ship. There was also a proposal to remove "Australia"s conning tower and install it on the Sydney Harbour foreshore; although this did not go ahead, the idea was later used when the foremast of was erected as a monument at <a href="Bradleys%20Head%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bradleys Head</a>. The ship's outer port propeller is on display at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, while other artefacts are in the collections of the War Memorial, the <a href="Australian%20National%20Maritime%20Museum">Australian National Maritime Museum</a>, and the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy%20Heritage%20Centre">Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre</a>.
The scuttling was originally scheduled for <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> (25 April) 1924, but was brought forward to 12 April, so the visiting <a href="British%20Special%20Service%20Squadron">British Special Service Squadron</a> could participate. On the day of the sinking, "Australia" was towed out to a point north east of <a href="Sydney%20Heads">Sydney Heads</a>. Under the terms of the Washington Treaty, the battlecruiser needed to be sunk in water that was deep enough to make it infeasible to refloat her at a future date. The former flagship was escorted by the Australian warships "Melbourne", "Brisbane", "Adelaide", "Anzac", and "Stalwart", the ships of the Special Service Squadron, and several civilian ferries carrying passengers. Many personnel volunteered to be part of the scuttling party, but only those who had served aboard her were selected. At 14:30, the scuttling party set the charges, opened all <a href="seacock">seacock</a>s, and cleared the ship. Explosive charges blew a hole in the hull a few minutes later, but it took 20 minutes for the intake of water to bring holes cut in the battlecruiser's upper flanks to the waterline. The angle of <a href="Angle%20of%20list">list</a> increased significantly, causing the three spare 12-inch barrels lashed to the deck to break free and roll overboard, before "Australia" inverted completely and began to sink stern-first. "Australia" submerged completely at 14:51; a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> aircraft dropped a <a href="wreath">wreath</a> where the warship had sunk, while "Brisbane" fired a rolling <a href="21-gun%20salute">21-gun salute</a>. The wreck was <a href="gazetted">gazetted</a> as being at , below. However, there were discrepancies with other sources, and the exact location of "Australia" was unknown.
There are two schools of thought surrounding the decision to scuttle the battlecruiser. The first is that sinking "Australia" was a major blow to the nation's ability to defend herself. Following the battlecruiser's scuttling, the most powerful warships in the RAN were four old light cruisers. The battlecruiser had served as a deterrent to German naval action against Australia during the war, and with growing tensions between Japan and the United States of America, that deterrence might have been required if the nations had become openly hostile towards each other or towards Australia. The opposing argument is that, while an emotive and symbolic loss, the ship was obsolete, and would have been a drain on resources. Operating and maintaining the warship was beyond the capabilities of the RAN's post-war budgets, necessitating the ship's reduction in status in 1920 and assignment to reserve in 1921. Ammunition and replacement barrels for the main guns were no longer manufactured. To remain effective, "Australia" required major modernisation (including new propulsion machinery, increased armour and armament, and new fire control systems) at a cost equivalent to a new .

In 1990, a large, unknown shipwreck was encountered by the Fugro Seafloor Surveys vessel MV "Moana Wave 1" while surveying the path of the <a href="PacRimWest">PacRimWest</a> communications cable. One of the survey ship's crew theorised that the wreck, located at in of water, was "Australia", but Fugro kept the information to themselves until 2002, when the company's Australian branch mentioned the discovery during a conference. This piqued the interest of a member of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Heritage%20Office">New South Wales Heritage Office</a>, who requested copies of the company's data. The size and location of the ship pointed towards it being "Australia", but the depth meant verification through inspection could only be achieved with a <a href="remote%20operated%20vehicle">remote operated vehicle</a> (ROV). The RAN was approached in 2007 for assistance, but although they supported the project, the RAN did not have the equipment to assist. In March 2007, the United States Navy loaned the deep-sea ROV "<a href="CURV-21">CURV-21</a>" to the Australian Government, to locate and recover a <a href="Sikorsky%20S-70">Black Hawk</a> helicopter which crashed during the <a href="Operation%20Quickstep">Australian response</a> to the <a href="2006%20Fijian%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">2006 Fijian coup d'Ã©tat</a>. While en route back to Australia, the ROV, carried aboard <a href="Defence%20Maritime%20Services">Defence Maritime Services</a> vessel , was directed to Fugro's coordinates at the request of the NSW Heritage Office to verify and inspect the wreck. Video footage captured by the ROV allowed the NSW Heritage Office to confirm that the wreck was "Australia" by matching features like the superstructure and masts to historical photographs. Although initially sinking stern-first, the battlecruiser levelled out as she sank, with the aft mast the first to strike the bottom. After hitting the seabed, "Australia" slid about to her final resting place. The wreck site is protected under the federal "<a href="Historic%20Shipwrecks%20Act%201976">Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976</a>".

Superliner (railcar)

The Superliner is a type of <a href="Bilevel%20rail%20car">bilevel</a> intercity railroad <a href="passenger%20car%20%28rail%29">passenger car</a> used by <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a>, the national rail passenger carrier in the United States. Amtrak ordered the cars to replace older single-level cars on its long-distance trains in the <a href="Western%20United%20States">Western United States</a>. The design was based on the <a href="Budd%20Company">Budd</a> <a href="Hi-Level">Hi-Level</a> vehicles, employed by the <a href="Atchison%2C%20Topeka%20and%20Santa%20Fe%20Railway">Santa Fe</a> Railway on its "<a href="El%20Capitan%20%28train%29">El Capitan</a>" trains. <a href="Pullman-Standard">Pullman-Standard</a> built 284 cars, known as Superliner I, in 1975â1981; <a href="Bombardier%20Transportation">Bombardier Transportation</a> built 195, known as Superliner II, in 1991â1996. The Superliner I cars were the last passenger cars built by Pullman.

Car types include coaches, <a href="dining%20car">dining car</a>s, <a href="lounge%20car">lounges</a>, and <a href="sleeping%20car">sleeping car</a>s. Most passenger spaces are on the upper level, which feature a row of windows on both sides. The Sightseer Lounge observation cars have distinctive floor-to-ceiling windows on the upper level. Boarding is on the lower level; passengers climb up a center stairwell to access the upper level.

The first Superliner I cars entered service in February 1979, with deliveries continuing through 1981. Amtrak assigned the cars to both long-distance and short-distance trains in the Western United States. The first permanent assignment, in October 1979, was to the <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>â<a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> "<a href="Empire%20Builder">Empire Builder</a>". Superliner II deliveries began in 1993; the additional cars enabled the retirement of the aging Hi-Level cars and the assignment of Superliners to trains in the <a href="Eastern%20United%20States">Eastern United States</a>. <a href="Structure%20gauge">Tunnel clearances</a> prevent their use on the <a href="Northeast%20Corridor">Northeast Corridor</a>.

On May 1, 1971, <a href="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> assumed control of almost all private sector intercity passenger rail service in the United States, with a mandate to reverse decades of decline. It retained about 184 of the 440 trains which had run the day before. To operate these trains, Amtrak inherited a fleet of 300 locomotives and 1,190 passenger cars, most of which dated from the 1940s and 1950s. No new sleeping cars had been built for service in the United States since 1955.

Conventional single-level cars made up most of Amtrak's inherited fleet, but it also included 73 <a href="Hi-Level">Hi-Level</a> cars from the Santa Fe. The Budd Company built these between 1954 and 1964; the bilevel design, with its superior views and smooth riding characteristics, was well-suited to the long distances in the west. Michael R. Weinman, who worked at the design firm Louis T. Klauder & Associates, recalled that when Amtrak issued a <a href="request%20for%20proposal">request for proposal</a> (RFP) in 1973 for a "totally new" passenger car, it "was assumed" that the design would be bilevel. Thirteen companies responded to the RFP; Amtrak selected the Klauder proposal. The design was finished by mid-1974 and Amtrak invited four companies to bid on its construction: <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a>, <a href="Budd%20Company">Budd</a>, <a href="Pullman-Standard">Pullman-Standard</a>, and <a href="Rohr%2C%20Inc.">Rohr</a>. Pullman-Standard won the contract.

Amtrak ordered 235 Superliner I cars from <a href="Pullman%20Company">Pullman-Standard</a> on April 2, 1975, with deliveries scheduled for between January 1977 and June 1978. The order then consisted of 120 coaches, 55 sleepers, 34 diners, and 26 lounges. Amtrak soon increased the order to 284 cars: it added 30 coaches, 15 sleepers, 5 diners, and deleted 1 lounge. The initial order cost $143.6Â million; with the additional cars and other payments the cost rose to $250Â million.

The railroad asked its employees to name the new cars, and announced the winning entry in its internal newsletter of June 1, 1977: "Vistaliner," harkening back to the <a href="dome%20car">Vista-Domes</a> of the <a href="Chicago%2C%20Burlington%20and%20Quincy%20Railroad">Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad</a>. But the newsletter went on to note that the name was already under copyright by another company, and so the cars would be dubbed "Superliners," a name created by <a href="Needham%2C%20Harper%20%26amp%3B%20Steers">Needham, Harper & Steers</a>, then Amtrak's advertising agency.

As the cars arrived in 1978 and 1979, Amtrak put them into use on short-haul routes radiating from Chicago. The first coaches entered regular service on February 26, 1979, running from <a href="Hiawatha%20Service">Chicago to Milwaukee</a>. The coaches, led by an <a href="EMD%20F40PH">EMD F40PH</a> locomotive, displaced the regular <a href="Turboliner">Turboliner</a> equipment. The equipment continued to operate on the run for several weeks. The "<a href="Illini%20%28train%29">Illini</a>" and "<a href="Shawnee%20%28train%29">Shawnee</a>" trains received Superliner coaches soon after; the first Superliner dining car ran on the "Shawnee" as a lounge.

A public unveiling took place at <a href="Union%20Station%20%28Chicago%29">Union Station</a> in Chicago on October 11, 1979, followed by a short trip over the <a href="Burlington%20Northern%20Railroad">Burlington Northern Railroad</a> to <a href="Lisle%20station">Lisle</a>. The following day, the "<a href="Shawnee%20%28train%29">Shawnee</a>" had the dubious distinction of the first Superliner accident, a <a href="Harvey%2C%20Illinois%20train%20collision">collision</a> with an <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Gulf%20Railroad">Illinois Central Gulf Railroad</a> freight train at Harvey, IL, which claimed the lives of 2 crew members of the freight train.

Amtrak's first choice for Superliner assignments had been the financially-troubled "<a href="Floridian%20%28train%29">Floridian</a>", a <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>â<a href="Florida">Florida</a> long-distance train, but the two years' delay in delivery scuppered these plans. Amtrak turned next to the "<a href="Empire%20Builder">Empire Builder</a>". This long-distance train ran between Chicago and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> through the plains of <a href="Montana">Montana</a> and <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a>. Winters in that part of the United States are harsh, featuring both <a href="blizzard">blizzard</a>s and cold temperatures. Traditional steam-heated equipment often broke down, causing Amtrak to cancel service. The Superliners, with their electrical head-end power, were far better suited for the conditions. The "Empire Builder" became the first long-distance train to use Superliners, and the first train permanently assigned them, on October 28, 1979. Amtrak's new national timetable depicted a Superliner coach on the front cover, and the listing for the "Empire Builder" carried a heading which read "Amtrak's Superliner is Special." At the same time, Superliners entered service on the short-haul "<a href="Pacific%20International">Pacific International</a>" and "<a href="Mount%20Rainier%20%28train%29">Mount Rainier</a>" in the Pacific Northwest.

With the "Empire Builder" in operation, Amtrak began re-equipping the remaining long-distance trains in the west. The second permanent Superliner train was the "<a href="Desert%20Wind">Desert Wind</a>", then a day train between <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Ogden%2C%20Utah">Ogden, Utah</a>, which gained coaches on June 30, 1980. The "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Zephyr">San Francisco Zephyr</a>", a long-distance train on the traditional <a href="Overland%20Route%20%28Union%20Pacific%20Railroad%29">Overland Route</a> between Chicago and <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, followed on July 7, 1980; it received the first of the Sightseer lounges on January 6, 1981. Amtrak assigned Superliners to another long-distance train, the Los AngelesâChicago "<a href="Southwest%20Chief">Southwest Limited</a>", in October 1980. The "Southwest Limited", formerly the "<a href="Super%20Chief">Super Chief</a>", traveled the same route as the "El Capitan", whose Hi-Level cars had inspired the design. The management of the Santa Fe, impressed by the design, permitted Amtrak to restore the name "Chief" to the train, and Amtrak renamed it the "<a href="Southwest%20Chief">Southwest Chief</a>" on October 28, 1984. The "Chief" was the first train to receive Superliner II sleeping cars in September 1993.

The "<a href="Coast%20Starlight">Coast Starlight</a>" began operating with Superliners in January 1981. The "<a href="Sunset%20Limited">Sunset Limited</a>", a long-distance train running along the southern border of the United States between Los Angeles and <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, gained them in February, resulting in a commendation from the <a href="Texas%20State%20Legislature">Texas State Legislature</a>. The "<a href="Pioneer%20%28train%29">Pioneer</a>" gained Superliner coaches on April 26. The "<a href="Texas%20Eagle">Eagle</a>", an overnight train between San Antonio and Chicago, began carrying Superliners in October on those days it connected with the "Sunset Limited" in San Antonio. Superliner assignments became permanent in the 1990s. Amtrak estimated that reequipping a train with Superliners boosted ridership on it by 25%. The last car of the order, a sleeper delivered in July 1981, was also the last car ever built by Pullman, and was named in honor of the company's founder, <a href="George%20Mortimer%20Pullman">George Mortimer Pullman</a>.

In the mid-1980s Canada's <a href="Via%20Rail">Via Rail</a> contemplated replacing its aging <a href="List%20of%20Via%20Rail%20rolling%20stock%23Stainless%20steel">Budd-built steam-heated cars</a> with Superliners. The order would have consisted of 130 cars, valued at , to be built by a consortium of Bombardier Transportation and the <a href="Urban%20Transportation%20Development%20Corporation">Urban Transportation Development Corporation</a>. Via tested several Amtrak Superliners in revenue service between Edmonton and Winnipeg in 1984â85. Ultimately Via chose to rebuild its Budd cars to use HEP instead of ordering new equipment.

Amtrak ordered 140 Superliner II cars from <a href="Bombardier%20Transportation">Bombardier Transportation</a> in 1991; Bombardier had acquired the Superliner patents after Pullman-Standard's closure. The order consisted of 55 sleeping cars, 38 coaches, 20 dining cars, 15 lounges, and 12 transition-dormitory cars. The initial order cost $340Â million, and included an option for 39 additional cars. In late 1993 Amtrak exercised the option for 55 cars at a cost of $110Â million, bringing the total order of Superliner II cars to 195. The option included ten dining cars, ten lounges, and 35 transdorms. Bombardier built the order in <a href="Barre%2C%20Vermont%20%28city%29">Barre, Vermont</a>.

The new order allowed the displacement of the remaining Hi-Level cars as well as the employment of Superliners on trains running with single-level cars. Amtrak converted three eastern long-distance trains to Superliners: the ChicagoâNew Orleans "<a href="City%20of%20New%20Orleans%20%28train%29">City of New Orleans</a>" (March 1994); the ChicagoâWashington, D.C. "<a href="Capitol%20Limited%20%28Amtrak%20train%29">Capitol Limited</a>" (October); and the VirginiaâFlorida "<a href="Auto%20Train">Auto Train</a>" (March 1, 1995). A project to enlarge the <a href="First%20Street%20Tunnel">First Street Tunnel</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, enabled the ChicagoâWashington "<a href="Cardinal%20%28train%29">Cardinal</a>" to begin using Superliners in September 1995; these were withdrawn in 2002 because of equipment shortages. Superliners were used on the Chicagoâ<a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> "<a href="International%20%28Amtrak%20train%29">International</a>" from November 1995 until early 2000. In 2017, Amtrak identified a need to replace the Superliners, noting that each car traveled the equivalent of "seven trips around the world" every year.

The Superliners generally resembled the Hi-Level design, though at , they were taller. The Superliners also used Amtrak's new 480-volt <a href="head-end%20power">head-end power</a> for heating and electricity. This was more reliable than the steam heat used by the Hi-Levels, whose own heaters and diesel generators would eventually be replaced by HEP equipment. 

Initially, the cars could not be worked east of Chicago because of limited overhead clearances, but by the 1980s many eastern railroads had raised clearances on their tracks to permit tri-level auto carriers and double-stack container trains, which also permitted the operation of the Superliners. To this day, tunnel clearances around <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and elsewhere prevent their use on the <a href="Northeast%20Corridor">Northeast Corridor</a>.

The Superliner I cars ride on <a href="Waggon%20Union">Waggon Union</a> MD-76 <a href="Bogie">trucks</a>, which require more frequent overhauls than comparable domestic designs and are "notorious for their rough riding characteristics." The Superliner IIs ride on <a href="General%20Steel%20Industries">GSI-G70</a> outboard bearing trucks, also found on the <a href="Horizon%20%28railcar%29">Horizon</a> single-level cars. Both models have a maximum speed of .

The Superliner I cars originally <a href="waste%20disposal">stored waste</a> in tanks, then <a href="Maceration%20%28sewage%29">macerated</a> and dumped it along the tracks once the train had attained a preset speed. This was an improvement on the Hi-Levels, which dumped directly to the tracks. Growing public concern about such dumping led Amtrak to order its Superliner IIs with a full-retention system. The Superliner I cars were retrofitted with a full-retention system in the early 1990s.

The "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" described the Superliner I interior color scheme as "soft hues of beige, rust, brown and green." For the Superliner IIs, Amtrak introduced a new scheme incorporating gray, aquamarine, and salmon.

Pullman-Standard built 102 Superliner I coaches and 48 coach-baggage <a href="combine%20car">combine car</a>s. Bombardier built 38 Superliner II coaches. As built, Superliner coaches could carry 62 passengers in the upper level and 15 passengers on the lower level. The lower level's capacity would later be reduced to 12. The coach-baggage cars had a baggage compartment in lieu of the lower level seating area, and squeezed 78 seats into the upper level. The total capacity of 75 to 78 represented a small increase over the 68 to 72 seats on the <a href="Hi-Level">Hi-Level</a> coaches, which lacked seating on the lower level. The Superliner I coach weighs ; the Superliner II coach weighs .

Seating on the upper and lower levels is 2Ã2 with reclining seats. The seats are wide with a <a href="seat%20pitch">pitch</a> of . Included are adjustable footrests and retractable legrests, but no center armrest. There are overhead luggage racks on the upper level and a luggage storage area on the lower level across from the stairs. There are four unisex toilets per coach, all on the lower level. A <a href="shower">shower</a> was included in the original design, to be locked when the coaches were used in short-haul service, but deleted from the final design. After a <a href="grade%20crossing%20accident">grade crossing accident</a> in 1999, the <a href="Transportation%20Safety%20Board%20of%20Canada">Transportation Safety Board of Canada</a> faulted the layout on the lower level; the exterior door, when opened and locked in position, prevented egress from the wheelchair-accessible bathroom.

Two-piece windows are located at each seat row. Each window is . Integral <a href="Window%20blind">blinds</a> were rejected in favor of <a href="curtain">curtain</a>s on maintenance grounds, while an upper level of "skylight" windows, similar to those on the <a href="Sun%20Lounge%20%28railcar%29">Sun Lounge</a> cars, was rejected as too expensive. Full-height windows were incorporated into the <a href="%23Lounges">lounge cars</a>.

Eleven Superliner I coaches were rebuilt as "snack coaches". These retained the 62 seats on the upper level but removed the lower level seating in favor of a <a href="snack%20bar">snack bar</a> and lounge seats.

Amtrak rebuilt 34 of the coach-baggage cars as "smoking coaches" in 1996 and 1997. The baggage room was converted to a self-contained specially ventilated smoking lounge. After Amtrak banned smoking on long-distance trains in 2004, the cars were reconverted.

Five Superliner II coaches were rebuilt in 1996 and 1997 as "family coaches" or "Kiddie Cars". These cars featured a children's play area on the lower level instead of seating and were assigned to the "<a href="Coast%20Starlight">Coast Starlight</a>", a long-distance train between <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> along the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast of the United States</a>. Amtrak rebuilt these five cars again in 2008 and 2009 as "arcade cars" with video game machines in the lower level. The cars were converted once more in 2015 to provide <a href="business%20class">business class</a> service on the "Coast Starlight". The service began in June 2015.

The <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans) paid to rebuild six Superliner I coaches and one baggage-coach, which had been wrecked in various accidents, for use in <a href="Amtrak%20California">Amtrak California</a> service. The seating capacity was increased to 76 on the upper level and 20 on the lower level.

Pullman-Standard built 70 Superliner I <a href="sleeping%20car">sleeping car</a>s; Bombardier built 49 "standard" Superliner II sleepers and six "deluxe" sleepers. The standard Superliner sleeping car contains 14 <a href="roomette">roomette</a>s, five bedrooms, a family bedroom, and an accessible bedroom. The deluxe sleeping car contains ten bedrooms, four roomettes, a family bedroom, and an accessible bedroom. As built, the standard sleeping car could hold a maximum of 44 passengers. The Superliner I sleeping car weighs ; the Superliner II sleeping car weighs . The Superliner II deluxe sleeper is slightly heavier at .

Roomettes measure Ã . In daytime configuration each features two facing seats; these are combined to form a bed. A second bed is folded down from the ceiling. Bedrooms measure Ã . Like the roomette, there are two berths; during the day the lower berth acts as a <a href="sofa">sofa</a>. The room also contains a chair which faces the beds. Unlike the roomette, a bedroom includes a private <a href="toilet">toilet</a>, <a href="shower">shower</a>, and <a href="sink">sink</a>.

The family bedroom is located at one end of the car's lower level and measures Ã . It can hold up to two adults and two children in four berths. During the day the berths form a sofa and two seats. At the opposite end of the car from the family bedroom is the accessible bedroom, which measures Ã . It sleeps two people in two berths and includes a <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a>-accessible toilet, but no shower.

The standard sleeping car has five bedrooms and ten roomettes on the upper level. The bedrooms are set against one side of the car with a hallway along the edge, while the roomettes are located to each side with the hallway running down the centerline. At the center of the car are the stairs to the lower level and a bathroom. A hallway runs through the centerline of the lower level with the accessible bedroom at one end and the family bedroom at the other. To one side of the stairs are three bathrooms and one shower, and to the other are four more roomettes. Luggage racks are located opposite the stairs. The layout of the deluxe sleeping car is similar. There are ten bedrooms on the upper level with a continuous hallway along one edge. The lower level contains opposed family and accessible bedrooms, four toilets, four roomettes, and a luggage rack. Two bedrooms may be combined to form a "bedroom suite".

As delivered, the Superliner I sleeping cars had five bathrooms, all on the lower level, and no public shower. Roomettes were termed "economy bedrooms" and bedrooms "deluxe bedrooms". During the 1980s Amtrak retrofitted the cars to add a bathroom on the upper level and a public shower on the lower level, at the expense of one bathroom. The Superliner II cars incorporated these improvements into their design.

Pullman-Standard and Bombardier each built 25 dedicated <a href="lounge%20car">lounge car</a>s, dubbed "Sightseer" lounges. Windows wrap upward into the ceiling, providing lateral views of scenery along the train's route. This design element was drawn from the <a href="Hi-Level">Hi-Level</a> lounges and the <a href="Seaboard%20Air%20Line">Seaboard Air Line</a>'s <a href="Sun%20Lounge%20%28railcar%29">Sun Lounges</a>. The Superliner I lounge weighs ; the Superliner II lounge weighs .

The upper level contains a mix of seating options. At one end are eight tables, four to each side, each seating four passengers. In the center is a lounge area with a <a href="wet%20bar">wet bar</a> and several groups of seats. The stairs to the lower level are located here as well. At the other end are swivel chairs. The lower level contains a bathroom, additional tables, and a snack bar. As built, the lounges had seating for 73. The cars were built with an <a href="electric%20piano">electric piano</a> in the lower level, which has since been removed.

In addition to the Sightseer lounges, Amtrak converted five Superliner I <a href="dining%20car">dining car</a>s to lounge cars in 1998 for use on the "<a href="Auto%20Train">Auto Train</a>", an automobile-carrying overnight train between <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. These cars may be distinguished from the Sightseer lounges by their conventional windows.

Pullman-Standard built 30 dining cars; Bombardier built another 39. The dining cars can seat a maximum of 72 people on the upper level in tables of four. The <a href="galley%20%28kitchen%29">galley</a> occupies the entire lower level. At the center of the car are stairs down to the kitchen. A <a href="dumbwaiter%20%28elevator%29">dumbwaiter</a> is used to bring food and drink to the dining level, as well as to return <a href="Dishware">dishes</a>, <a href="glass%20%28drinkware%29">glasses</a>, and <a href="cutlery">cutlery</a> for washing. A late 2010s overhaul added a refrigerator on the upper level for easy access and replaced incandescent lights with <a href="LED%20lamp">LED lighting</a>. As built, the Superliner I dining car weighs ; the Superliner II dining car weighs .

Amtrak rebuilt 17 Superliner I dining cars as diner-lounges in the late 2000s. Dubbed the "Cross-Country Cafe", they were intended to reduce food service losses by replacing both a traditional dining car and the Sightseer lounge on long-distance trains. One end of the car was converted into a cafÃ© area, with tables and a small serving area near the stairs to the kitchen. The other side remained dedicated to traditional diner seating, but the standard two-by-two tables were replaced by booths.

Bombardier built 47 "transition sleeper" or dormitory cars. The car had two purposes: to provide sleeping accommodations for train personnel; and to provide access to single level equipment from bi-level Superliner and <a href="Hi-Level">Hi-Level</a> cars. Hi-Level "step-down" coaches previously performed the latter role. Most transition dormitory ("transdorm") cars have 16 roomettes on the upper level for crew accommodations, with an accessible bedroom and small crew lounge on the lower level. Bathrooms and showers are located on both levels. At one end of the car is a top level end-door; at the other end is a staircase and end door on the lower level. On some trains, Amtrak makes the roomettes closest to the upper level end door available for sale to passengers. The transition sleepers weigh .

Between them Pullman-Standard and Bombardier manufactured 479 cars:

The Superliners established a standard basic design for bilevel railcars, including the upper-floor height of above the top of rail. Built primarily for long-distance services, the Superliners were not ideal for use on corridor routes. They were not equipped for the volumes of passenger loading and unloading found on corridor routes, nor did they have amenities designed for these shorter trips. The 1990 passage of California <a href="List%20of%20California%20ballot%20propositions%201990%E2%80%9399">propositions 108, 111 and 116</a> authorized the sale of nearly $3 billion in bonds for the creation of rail services across the state. Proposition 116 required the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans) to create specifications for standardized railcars and locomotives that would be suitable for <a href="Amtrak%20California">rail operations across the state</a>. 

The resulting <a href="California%20Car">California Car</a> design, of which 66 were built by <a href="Morrison%20Knudsen">Morrison Knudsen</a> from 1994 to 1997, offered a number of improvements on the Superliner design. The single vestibule and bent staircase of the Superliner design were replaced with two vestibules and two straight staircases to facilitate faster loading and unloading. The trainline-controlled power doors do not require a crew member at every door, thus reducing crew size requirements. The California Cars comply with the <a href="Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act%20of%201990">Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990</a>, with wheelchair lifts and accessible seating on the lower levels. Fourteen of the cars were built as <a href="cab%20car">cab car</a>s, allowing <a href="push%E2%80%93pull%20train">push-pull</a> operations rather than turning the whole train at terminals. 

The success of the California Cars resulted in the procurement of the <a href="Surfliner%20%28railcar%29">Surfliner</a> cars by Amtrak and Caltrans in 1998. <a href="Alstom">Alstom</a> built 62 Surfliners from 2000 to 2002. The Surfliner is a modification of the California Car, with design changes including an accessible bathroom and passenger amenities such as outlets. Both the Surfliners and California Cars are mechanically and electrically compatible with the Superliners, and they often are combined in trainsets on <a href="Amtrak%20California">Amtrak California</a> services. 

Caltrans and Amtrak began drafting the specification for a third generation of the design in 2006. This specification, dubbed "Corridor Car for the 21st Century" or C21, became the basis for the design work undertaken by the Next Generation Corridor Equipment Pool Committee (NGCE) under the provisions of the <a href="Passenger%20Rail%20Investment%20and%20Improvement%20Act%20of%202008">Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008</a> beginning in 2009. Caltrans and the <a href="Illinois%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Illinois Department of Transportation</a> ordered 130 of these <a href="Next%20Generation%20Bi-Level%20Passenger%20Rail%20Car">Next Generation Bi-Level Passenger Rail Car</a>s from <a href="Sumitomo">Sumitomo</a> (with <a href="Nippon%20Sharyo">Nippon Sharyo</a> as the builder) in 2012. In August 2015, a new car shell failed a <a href="buff%20strength">buff strength</a> compression test, which forced a complete redesign of the car. That delay would have placed delivery beyond the expiration of a $220 million <a href="American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a> (ARRA) grant that funded the order. In November 2017, Sumitomo instead contracted with <a href="Siemens%20Mobility">Siemens Mobility</a> to build 137 single-level <a href="CALIDOT">CALIDOT</a> cars instead of the bilevel cars.

Common toad

The common toad, European toad, or in Anglophone parts of Europe, simply the toad ("Bufo bufo", from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "bufo" "toad"), is an <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a> found throughout most of Europe (with the exception of <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, and some <a href="List%20of%20islands%20in%20the%20Mediterranean">Mediterranean islands</a>), in the western part of <a href="North%20Asia">North Asia</a>, and in a small portion of <a href="Northwest%20Africa">Northwest Africa</a>. It is one of a group of closely related animals that are descended from a common ancestral line of <a href="toad">toad</a>s and which form a <a href="species%20complex">species complex</a>. The toad is an inconspicuous animal as it usually lies hidden during the day. It becomes active at dusk and spends the night hunting for the <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s on which it feeds. It moves with a slow, ungainly walk or short jumps, and has greyish-brown skin covered with wart-like lumps.

Although toads are usually solitary animals, in the breeding season, large numbers of toads converge on certain breeding ponds, where the males compete to mate with the females. Eggs are laid in gelatinous strings in the water and later hatch out into <a href="tadpole">tadpole</a>s. After several months of growth and development, these sprout limbs and undergo <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> into tiny toads. The juveniles emerge from the water and remain largely terrestrial for the rest of their lives.

The common toad seems to be in decline in part of its range, but overall is listed as being of "<a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>" in the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List%20of%20Threatened%20Species">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a>. It is threatened by habitat loss, especially by drainage of its breeding sites, and some toads get killed on the roads as they make their annual migrations. It has long been associated in popular culture and literature with <a href="witchcraft">witchcraft</a>.

The common toad was first given the name "<a href="Rana%20%28genus%29">Rana</a> bufo" by the Swedish biologist <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> in the "<a href="10th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">10th edition of Systema Naturae</a>" in 1758. In this work, he placed all the frogs and toads in the single genus "Rana". It later became apparent that this genus should be divided, and in 1768, the Austrian naturalist <a href="Josephus%20Nicolaus%20Laurenti">Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti</a> placed the common toad in the genus "Bufo", naming it "Bufo bufo". The toads in this genus are included in the family <a href="Bufonidae">Bufonidae</a>, the true toads.

Various <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of "B. bufo" have been recognized over the years. The Caucasian toad is found in the mountainous regions of the Caucasus and was at one time classified as "B. b. verrucosissima". It has a larger <a href="genome">genome</a> and differs from "B. bufo" <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> and is now accepted as "<a href="Bufo%20verrucosissimus">Bufo verrucosissimus</a>". The spiny toad was classified as "B. b. spinosus". It is found in France, the Iberean Peninsula and the Maghreb and grows to a larger size and has a spinier skin than its more northern counterparts with which it <a href="Intergradation">intergrades</a>. It is now accepted as "Bufo spinosus". The Gredos toad, "B. b. gredosicola", is restricted to the <a href="Sierra%20de%20Gredos">Sierra de Gredos</a>, a mountain range in central Spain. It has exceptionally large <a href="paratoid%20gland">paratoid gland</a>s and its colour tends to be blotched rather than uniform. It is now considered to be a synonym of "BufoÂ spinosus".

"B. bufo" is part of a <a href="species%20complex">species complex</a>, a group of closely related species which cannot be clearly demarcated. Several modern species are believed to form an ancient group of related <a href="Taxon">taxa</a> from preglacial times. These are the spiny toad ("B. spinosus"), the <a href="Caucasian%20toad">Caucasian toad</a> ("B. verrucosissimus") and the <a href="Japanese%20common%20toad">Japanese common toad</a> ("B. japonicus"). The European common toad ("BufoÂ bufo") seems to have arisen more recently. It is believed that the range of the ancestral form extended into Asia but that isolation between the eastern and western species complexes occurred as a result of the development of the Central Asian Deserts during the <a href="Middle%20Miocene">Middle Miocene</a>. The exact taxonomic relationships between these species remains unclear. A serological investigation into toad populations in Turkey undertaken in 2001 examined the blood serum proteins of "BufoÂ verrucosissimus" and "BufoÂ spinosus". It found that the differences between the two were not significant and that therefore the former should be synonymized with the latter.

A study published in 2012 examined the phylogenetic relationships between the Eurasian and North African species in the "BufoÂ bufo" group and indicated a long evolutionary history for the group. Nine to thirteen million years ago, "<a href="Bufo%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Beichwaldi">BufoÂ eichwaldi</a>", a recently <a href="Species%20description">described species</a> from south Azerbaijan and Iran, split from the main lineage. Further divisions occurred with "BufoÂ spinosus" splitting off about five million years ago when the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> were being uplifted, an event which isolated the populations in the Iberian Peninsula from those in the rest of Europe. The remaining European lineage split into "BufoÂ bufo" and "BufoÂ verrucosissimus" less than three million years ago during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. Very occasionally the common toad hybridizes with the <a href="natterjack%20toad">natterjack toad</a> ("Bufo calamita") or the <a href="European%20green%20toad">European green toad</a> ("Bufo viridis").

The common toad can reach about in length. Females are normally stouter than males and southern specimens tend to be larger than northern ones. The head is broad with a wide mouth below the terminal snout which has two small nostrils. There are no teeth. The bulbous, protruding eyes have yellow or copper coloured irises and horizontal slit-shaped pupils. Just behind the eyes are two bulging regions, the paratoid glands, which are positioned obliquely. They contain a noxious substance, <a href="bufotoxin">bufotoxin</a>, which is used to deter potential <a href="Predation">predators</a>. The head joins the body without a noticeable neck and there is no external vocal sac. The body is broad and squat and positioned close to the ground. The fore limbs are short with the toes of the fore feet turning inwards. At breeding time, the male develops <a href="nuptial%20pad">nuptial pad</a>s on the first three fingers. He uses these to grasp the female when mating. The hind legs are short relative to other frogs' legs and the hind feet have long, unwebbed toes. There is no tail. The skin is dry and covered with small wart-like lumps. The colour is a fairly uniform shade of brown, olive-brown or greyish-brown, sometimes partly blotched or banded with a darker shade. The common toad tends to be <a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a> with the females being browner and the males greyer. The underside is a dirty white speckled with grey and black patches.

Other species with which the common toad could be confused include the <a href="natterjack%20toad">natterjack toad</a> ("Bufo calamita") and the <a href="European%20green%20toad">European green toad</a> ("Bufo viridis"). The former is usually smaller and has a yellow band running down its back while the latter has a distinctive mottled pattern. The paratoid glands of both are parallel rather than slanting as in the common toad. The <a href="common%20frog">common frog</a> ("Rana temporaria") is also similar in appearance but it has a less rounded snout, damp smooth skin, and usually moves by leaping.

Common toads can live for many years and have survived for fifty years in captivity. In the wild, common toads are thought to live for about ten to twelve years. Their age can be determined by counting the number of annual growth rings in the bones of their <a href="Phalanx%20bone">phalanges</a>.

After the <a href="Common%20Frog">common frog</a> ("Rana temporaria"), the <a href="Edible%20Frog">edible frog</a> ("Pelophylax esculentus") and the <a href="Smooth%20Newt">smooth newt</a> ("Lissotriton vulgaris"), the common toad is the fourth most common amphibian in Europe. It is found throughout the continent with the exception of Iceland, the cold northern parts of <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>, Ireland and a number of Mediterranean islands. These include <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, <a href="Crete">Crete</a>, <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, <a href="Sardinia">Sardinia</a> and the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>. Its easterly range extends to <a href="Irkutsk">Irkutsk</a> in Siberia and its southerly range includes parts of northwestern <a href="Africa">Africa</a> in the northern mountain ranges of <a href="Morocco">Morocco</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a> and <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>. A closely related variant lives in eastern Asia including <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. The common toad is found at altitudes of up to in the southern part of its range. It is largely found in forested areas with coniferous, deciduous and mixed woodland, especially in wet locations. It also inhabits open countryside, fields, copses, parks and gardens, and often occurs in dry areas well away from standing water.

The common toad usually moves by walking rather slowly or in short shuffling jumps involving all four legs. It spends the day concealed in a lair that it has hollowed out under foliage or beneath a root or a stone where its colouring makes it inconspicuous. It emerges at dusk and may travel some distance in the dark while hunting. It is most active in wet weather. By morning it has returned to its base and may occupy the same place for several months. It is voracious and eats <a href="Woodlouse">woodlice</a>, <a href="slug">slug</a>s, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, <a href="caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s, <a href="Fly">flies</a>, <a href="earthworm">earthworm</a>s and even small <a href="Mouse">mice</a>. Small, fast moving prey may be caught by a flick of the tongue while larger items are grabbed with the jaws. Having no teeth, it swallows food whole in a series of gulps. It does not recognise its prey as such but will try to consume any small, dark coloured, moving object it encounters at night. A research study showed that it would snap at a moving piece of black paper as if it were prey but would disregard a larger moving piece. Toads seem to use visual cues for feeding and can see their prey at very low light intensities where humans are unable to discern anything. Periodically, the common toad sheds its skin. This comes away in tattered pieces and is then consumed.

When attacked, the common toad adopts a characteristic stance, inflating its body and standing with its hindquarters raised and its head lowered. Its chief means of defence lies in the foul tasting secretion that is produced by its paratoid glands and other glands on its skin. This contains a toxin called <a href="bufagin">bufagin</a> and is enough to deter many predators although <a href="grass%20snake">grass snake</a>s seem to be unaffected by it. Other predators of adult toads include hedgehogs, rats and mink, and even domestic cats. Birds that feed on toads include <a href="heron">heron</a>s, <a href="crow">crow</a>s and <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>. Crows have been observed to puncture the skin with their beak and then peck out the animal's liver, thus avoiding the toxin. The tadpoles also exude noxious substances which deter fishes from eating them but not the <a href="great%20crested%20newt">great crested newt</a>. Aquatic invertebrates that feed on toad tadpoles include <a href="dragonfly">dragonfly</a> larvae, <a href="Dytiscidae">diving beetles</a> and <a href="Corixidae">water boatmen</a>. These usually avoid the noxious secretion by puncturing the tadpole's skin and sucking out its juices.
A parasitic fly, "<a href="Lucilia%20bufonivora">Lucilia bufonivora</a>", attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's skin and when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam ("<a href="Sphaerium%20corneum">Sphaerium corneum</a>") is unusual in that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to the toe of a common toad and this is believed to be one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.

In 2007, researchers using a <a href="remotely%20operated%20underwater%20vehicle">remotely operated underwater vehicle</a> to survey <a href="Loch%20Ness">Loch Ness</a>, Scotland, observed a common toad moving along the bottom of the lake at a depth of . They were surprised to find that an air-breathing animal could survive in such a location.

The annual life cycle of the common toad is divided into 3 periods: the <a href="Hibernation">winter sleep</a>, the time of mating and feeding period.

The common toad emerges from <a href="hibernation">hibernation</a> in spring and there is a mass migration towards the breeding sites. The toads converge on certain ponds that they favour while avoiding other stretches of water that seem eminently suitable. Adults use the same location year after year and over 80% of males marked as juveniles have been found to return to the pond at which they were <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawned</a>. They find their way to these by using a suite of orientation cues, including olfactory and magnetic cues, but also visual cues help guide their journeys. Toads experimentally moved elsewhere and fitted with tracking devices have been found to be able to locate their chosen breeding pond when the displacement exceeded three kilometres (two miles).
The males arrive first and remain in the location for several weeks while the females only stay long enough to mate and spawn. Rather than fighting for the right to mate with a female, male toads may settle disputes by means of the pitch of their voice. Croaking provides a reliable sign of body size and hence of prowess. Nevertheless, fights occur in some instances. In a study at one pond where males outnumbered females by four or five to one, it was found that 38% of the males won the right to mate by defeating rivals in combat or by displacing other males already mounted on females. Male toads generally outnumber female toads at breeding ponds. A Swedish study found that female mortality was higher than that of males and that 41% of females did not come to the breeding pond in the spring and missed a year before reproducing again.

The males mount the females' backs, grasping them with their fore limbs under the armpits in a grip that is known as <a href="amplexus">amplexus</a>. The males are very enthusiastic, will try to grasp fish or inanimate objects and often mount the backs of other males. Sometimes several toads form a heap, each male trying to grasp the female at the base. It is a stressful period and mortality is high among breeding toads. A successful male stays in amplexus for several days and, as the female lays a long, double string of small black <a href="Egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>, he fertilises them with his sperm. As the pair wander piggyback around the shallow edges of the pond, the gelatinous egg strings, which may contain 3000 to 6000 eggs and be in length, get tangled in plant stalks.

The strings of eggs absorb water and swell in size, and small <a href="tadpole">tadpole</a>s hatch out after two to three weeks. At first they cling to the remains of the strings and feed on the jelly. They later attach themselves to the underside of the leaves of water weed before becoming free swimming. The tadpoles at first look similar to those of the common frog ("Rana temporaria") but they are a darker colour, being blackish above and dark grey below. They can be distinguished from the tadpoles of other species by the fact that the mouth is the same width as the space between the eyes, and this is twice as large as the distance between the nostrils. Over the course of a few weeks their legs develop and their tail gradually gets reabsorbed. By twelve weeks of age they are miniature toads measuring about long and ready to leave the pond.

The common toad reaches <a href="Sexual%20maturity">maturity</a> at three to seven years old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode "<a href="Rhabdias%20bufonis">Rhabdias bufonis</a>". This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller ones that have been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as <a href="Scientific%20control">control juveniles</a>. Their parasite-induced <a href="anorexia%20nervosa">anorexia</a> caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of <a href="ammonium%20nitrate">ammonium nitrate</a> of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, there was no significant difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.

A comparison was made between the growth rate of newly <a href="Metamorphosis">metamorphosed</a> juveniles from different altitudes and latitudes, the specimens studied being from Norway, Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. At first the growth rates for males and females was identical. By the time they became mature their growth rate had slowed down to about 21% of the initial rate and they had reached 95% of their expected adult size. Some females that were on a biennial breeding cycle carried on growing rapidly for a longer time. Adjusting for differences in temperature and the length of the growing season, the toads grew and matured at much the same rate from the four colder localities. These juveniles reached maturity after 1.09 years for males and 1.55 years for females. However, the young toads from lowland France grew faster and longer to a much greater size taking an average 1.77 years for males and 2.49 years for females before reaching maturity.

Common toads <a href="Hibernation">winter</a> in various holes in the ground, sometimes in basements, often in droves with other amphibians. Rarely they spend the winter in flowing waters with the <a href="common%20frog">common frog</a>s and <a href="Edible%20frog">green frogs</a>.

The <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List%20of%20Threatened%20Species">IUCN Red List of Threatened Species</a> considers the common toad as being of "<a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>". This is because it has a wide distribution and is, over most of its range, a common species. It is not particularly threatened by habitat loss because it is adaptable and is found in deciduous and coniferous forests, scrubland, meadows, parks and gardens. It prefers damp areas with dense foliage. The major threats it faces include loss of habitat locally, the drainage of wetlands where it breeds, agricultural activities, pollution and mortality on roads. <a href="Chytridiomycosis">Chytridiomycosis</a>, an infectious disease of amphibians, has been reported in common toads in <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> and may affect some populations.

There are parts of its range where the common toad seems to be in decline. In Spain, increased aridity and habitat loss have led to a diminution in numbers and it is regarded as "<a href="near%20threatened">near threatened</a>". A population in the <a href="Sierra%20de%20Gredos">Sierra de Gredos</a> mountain range is facing predation by otters and increased competition from the frog "<a href="Pelophylax%20perezi">Pelophylax perezi</a>". Both otter and frog seem to be extending their ranges to higher altitudes. The common toad cannot be legally sold or traded in the United Kingdom but there is a slow decline in toad numbers and it has therefore been declared a <a href="Biodiversity%20Action%20Plan">Biodiversity Action Plan</a> priority species. In <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, it is considered to be a "Rare Species" in the <a href="Bashkortostan">Bashkortostan Republic</a>, the <a href="Tatarstan">Tatarstan Republic</a>, the <a href="Yamalo-Nenets%20Autonomous%20Okrug">Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug</a>, and the <a href="Irkutsk%20Oblast">Irkutsk Oblast</a>, but during the 1990s, it became more abundant in <a href="Moscow%20Oblast">Moscow Oblast</a>.

It has been found that urban populations of common toad occupying small areas and isolated by development show a lower level of <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a> and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.

Many toads are killed by traffic while migrating to their breeding grounds. In Europe they have the highest rate of mortality from roadkill among amphibians. Many of the deaths take place on stretches of road where streams flow underneath showing that migration routes often follow water courses. In some places in <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, <a href="Northern%20Italy">Northern Italy</a> and <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, special tunnels have been constructed so that toads can cross under roads in safety. In other places, local wildlife groups run "toad patrols", carrying the amphibians across roads at busy crossing points in buckets. The toads start moving at dusk and for them to travel far, the temperature needs to remain above . On a warm wet night they may continue moving all night but if it cools down, they may stop earlier. An estimate was made of the significance of <a href="roadkill">roadkill</a> in toad populations in the Netherlands. The number of females killed in the spring migration on a quiet country road (ten vehicles per hour) was compared with the number of strings of eggs laid in nearby fens. A 30% mortality rate was found, with the rate for deaths among males likely to be of a similar order.

The main toxic substance found in the parotoid gland and skin of the common toad is called bufotoxin. It was first isolated by <a href="Heinrich%20Otto%20Wieland">Heinrich Wieland</a> and his colleagues in 1922 and they succeeded in identifying its structure about 20 years later. Meanwhile, other workers succeeded in isolating the same compound and its parent <a href="steroid">steroid</a> bufotalin from the <a href="Japanese%20common%20toad">Japanese toad</a> ("Bufo japonicus"). By 1986, researchers at the <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a> had succeeded in synthesizing the toad venom constituents <a href="bufotalin">bufotalin</a>, bufalitoxin and bufotoxin. The chemical formula of bufotoxin is CHNO. Its physical effects resemble those of <a href="digitalis">digitalis</a> which in small doses increases the strength with which the heart muscle contracts and which is used in the treatment of <a href="congestive%20heart%20failure">congestive heart failure</a>. The skin of one toad contains enough toxin to cause serious symptoms or even death in animals and man. Clinical effects include severe irritation and pain to eyes, mouth, nose and throat, cardiovascular and respiratory symptoms, <a href="paralysis">paralysis</a> and seizures, increased salivation, vomiting, <a href="hyperkalemia">hyperkalemia</a>, <a href="cyanosis">cyanosis</a> and <a href="hallucination">hallucination</a>s. There is no known anti-venom. Treatment consists of supporting respiratory and cardiovascular functions, prevention of absorption and <a href="electrocardiography">electrocardiography</a> to monitor the condition. <a href="Atropine">Atropine</a>, <a href="phenytoin">phenytoin</a>, <a href="cholestyramine">cholestyramine</a> and <a href="lidocaine">lidocaine</a> may prove useful in its management.

The toad has long been considered to be an animal of ill omen or a connection to a spirit world. This may have its origins in the fact that it is at home both on land and in the water. It may cause repugnance because of its blackish, wart-like skin, its slow movements and the way it emerges from some dark hole. In Europe in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, the toad was associated with the <a href="Christian%20teaching%20about%20the%20Devil">Devil</a>, for whom a coat-of-arms was invented emblazoned with three toads. It was known that the toad could poison people and, as the <a href="Familiar%20animal">witch's familiar</a>, it was thought to possess magical powers. Even ordinary people made use of dried toads, their bile, faeces and blood. In some areas, the finding of a toad in a house was considered evidence that a witch was present. In the <a href="Basque%20Country%20%28greater%20region%29">Basque Country</a>, the familiars were believed to be toads wearing elegant robes. These were herded by children who were being trained as witches. Between 1610 and 1612, the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish inquisitor</a> <a href="Alonso%20de%20Salazar%20Fr%C3%ADas">Alonso de Salazar FrÃ­as</a> investigated witchcraft in the region and searched the houses of suspected witches for dressed toads. He found none. These witches were reputed to use undomesticated toads as ingredients in their liniments and brews.

An English <a href="Folklore">folk tale</a> tells how an old woman, a supposed witch, cursed her landlord and all his possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her to collapse. The toad was thrown into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and it was found that the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.

The <a href="saliva">saliva</a> of the toad was considered poisonous and was known as "sweltered venom" and it was believed that it could spit or vomit poisonous fire. Toads were associated with devils and demons and in "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>", <a href="John%20Milton">John Milton</a> depicted <a href="Satan">Satan</a> as a toad when he poured poison into <a href="Eve">Eve</a>'s ear. The First Witch in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare's</a> <a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a> gave instructions on using a toad in the concoction of spells:

It was also believed that there was a jewel inside a toad's head, a "<a href="toadstone">toadstone</a>", that when worn as a necklace or ring would warn the wearer of attempts to poison them. Shakespeare mentioned this in "<a href="As%20You%20Like%20It">As You Like It</a>":

<a href="Mr.%20Toad">Mr. Toad</a> Esq. is one of the main characters in the children's novel "<a href="The%20Wind%20in%20the%20Willows">The Wind in the Willows</a>", by <a href="Kenneth%20Grahame">Kenneth Grahame</a>. This has been dramatized by several authors including <a href="A.%20A.%20Milne">A. A. Milne</a> who called his play "<a href="Toad%20of%20Toad%20Hall">Toad of Toad Hall</a>". Mr. Toad is a very conceited, <a href="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> toad and in the book he composes a ditty in his own praise which starts like this:

<a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a> in his essay "<a href="Some%20Thoughts%20on%20the%20Common%20Toad">Some Thoughts on the Common Toad</a>" described the emergence of the common toad from hibernation as one of the most moving signs of spring.
