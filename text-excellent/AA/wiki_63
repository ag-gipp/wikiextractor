History of Poland (1945–1989)

The history of Poland from 1945 to 1989 spans the period of <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> dominance and <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">communist rule</a> imposed after the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> over <a href="Poland">Poland</a>, as reestablished within new borders. These years, while featuring general <a href="Industrialisation">industrialization</a> and <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a> and many improvements in the <a href="standard%20of%20living">standard of living</a>, were marred by social unrest, political strife and severe economic difficulties.

Near the end of World War II, the advancing Soviet <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a>, along with the , pushed out the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi German</a> forces from <a href="Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29">occupied Poland</a>. In February 1945, the <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Yalta Conference</a> sanctioned the formation of a provisional government of Poland from a compromise coalition, until postwar elections. <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>, the leader of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, manipulated the implementation of that ruling. A practically communist-controlled <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20National%20Unity">Provisional Government of National Unity</a> was formed in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> by ignoring the <a href="Polish%20government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a> based in <a href="London">London</a> since 1940.

During the subsequent <a href="Potsdam%20Conference">Potsdam Conference</a> in July–August 1945, the three major <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the <a href="Oder%E2%80%93Neisse%20line">Oder–Neisse line</a> and <a href="Curzon%20Line">Curzon Line</a>. Following the destruction of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Poland">Polish-Jewish</a> population in <a href="The%20Holocaust%20in%20Poland">the Holocaust</a>, the <a href="Flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans%20%281944%E2%80%9350%29">flight and expulsion of Germans</a> in the west, <a href="Operation%20Vistula">resettlement of Ukrainians</a> in the east, and the <a href="Polish%20population%20transfers%20%281944%E2%80%931946%29">repatriation of Poles</a> from <a href="Kresy">Kresy</a>, <a href="Poland">Poland</a> became for the first time in its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government <a href="Polish%20legislative%20election%2C%201947">solidified its political power</a> over the next two years, while the <a href="Polish%20United%20Workers%27%20Party">Polish United Workers' Party</a> (PZPR) under <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20Bierut">Bolesław Bierut</a> gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar <a href="Soviet%20Empire">Soviet sphere of influence</a> in <a href="Central%20Europe">Central</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">Constitution of the Polish People's Republic</a> was promulgated in July 1952 and the state officially became the <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">Polish People's Republic</a> (PRL).

Following Stalin's death in 1953, a political <a href="Khrushchev%20Thaw">"thaw" in the Soviet sphere</a> allowed a more liberal faction of the <a href="Communism%20in%20Poland">Polish communists</a>, led by <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Gomu%C5%82ka">Władysław Gomułka</a>, to <a href="Polish%20October">gain power</a>. By the mid-1960s, Poland began experiencing increasing economic as well as political difficulties. They culminated in the <a href="1968%20Polish%20political%20crisis">1968 Polish political crisis</a> and the <a href="1970%20Polish%20protests">1970 Polish protests</a>, when a consumer price hike led to a wave of strikes. The government introduced a new economic program based on large-scale borrowing from the West, which resulted in a rise in living standards and expectations, but the program meant growing integration of Poland's economy with the <a href="world%20economy">world economy</a> and it faltered after the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>. In 1976, the government of <a href="Edward%20Gierek">Edward Gierek</a> was forced to raise prices again and this led to the <a href="June%201976%20protests">June 1976 protests</a>.

This cycle of repression and reform and the economic-political struggle acquired new characteristics with the 1978 election of Karol Wojtyła as <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>. Wojtyła's unexpected elevation strengthened the opposition to the <a href="Authoritarianism">authoritarian</a> and ineffective system of "<a href="nomenklatura">nomenklatura</a>"-run <a href="state%20socialism">state socialism</a>, especially with the pope's first visit to Poland in 1979. In early August 1980, a new wave of strikes resulted in the founding of the independent <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> "<a href="Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29">Solidarity</a>" (<a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a> "Solidarność") led by electrician <a href="Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa">Lech Wałęsa</a>. The growing strength and activity of the opposition caused the government of <a href="Wojciech%20Jaruzelski">Wojciech Jaruzelski</a> to declare <a href="martial%20law%20in%20Poland">martial law</a> in December 1981. However, with the reforms of <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a> in the Soviet Union, increasing pressure from the West, and dysfunctional economy, the regime was forced to negotiate with its opponents. The 1989 <a href="Polish%20Round%20Table%20Agreement">Round Table Talks</a> led to Solidarity's participation in the <a href="Polish%20legislative%20election%2C%201989">1989 election</a>. Its candidates' striking victory gave rise to the first of the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201989">succession of transitions</a> from communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1990, Jaruzelski resigned from the presidency of the Republic of Poland; following the <a href="Polish%20presidential%20election%2C%201990">presidential election</a>, he was succeeded by Wałęsa.

Before <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, a third of Poland's population was composed of <a href="Ethnic%20minorities%20in%20Poland">ethnic minorities</a>. Poland had about 35 million inhabitants in 1939, but fewer than 24 million in 1946, within the respective borders. Of the remaining population over three million were ethnic minorities, such as Germans, Ukrainians and Jews, most of whom would soon leave Poland. Poland suffered the heaviest <a href="World%20War%20II%20casualties%23endnote%20Poland">proportionate human losses</a> during World War II, amounting to 16–17 percent of its population. It is estimated that up to 6 million Polish citizens died from war-related causes between 1939 and 1945. The approximate figure includes 3 million <a href="Polish%20Jews">Jewish-Polish</a> victims as part of the above total. The number of ethnically Polish victims was perhaps 2 million.

The historical minorities in Poland were <a href="Demographic%20history%20of%20Poland%23Second%20Polish%20Republic%20and%20World%20War%20II%20%281918%E2%80%931945%29">most significantly affected</a>, whereas Poland's multiethnic <a href="Multinational%20state">diversity</a> reflected in prior national censuses was <a href="Polish%20population%20transfers%20%281944%E2%80%931946%29">all but gone</a> within several years after the war. The Polish educated class suffered greatly. A large proportion of the country's pre-war social and political elite perished and a large proportion were dispersed.

The implementation of the immense task of reconstructing the country was accompanied by the struggle of the new government to acquire centralized authority, further complicated by the mistrust a considerable part of society held for the new regime and by disputes over Poland's postwar borders, which were not firmly established until mid-1945. The Soviet forces present at that time engaged in plunder of the <a href="former%20eastern%20territories%20of%20Germany">former eastern territories of Germany</a> which were being transferred to Poland, stripping it of valuable industrial equipment, infrastructure and factories and sending them to the Soviet Union.

After the Soviet annexation of the <a href="Kresy">Kresy</a> territories east of the <a href="Curzon%20Line">Curzon Line</a>, about 2 million Poles were <a href="Polish%20population%20transfers%20%281944%E2%80%931946%29">"repatriated"</a> (they moved, were transferred or expelled) from these areas into the new western and northern territories east of the <a href="Oder%E2%80%93Neisse%20line">Oder–Neisse line</a>, which were transferred from Germany to Poland under the <a href="Potsdam%20Agreement">Potsdam Agreement</a>. Others stayed in what had become the Soviet Union and more went to Poland after 1956. Additional settlement with people from central parts of Poland brought the number of Poles in what the government called the <a href="Recovered%20Territories">Recovered Territories</a> up to 5 million by 1950. Most of the <a href="Demographic%20estimates%20of%20the%20flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans">former German population of 10 million</a> had <a href="Flight%20and%20expulsion%20of%20Germans%20from%20Poland%20during%20and%20after%20World%20War%20II">fled or was expelled</a> to <a href="History%20of%20Germany%20%281945%E2%80%9390%29">post-war Germany</a> by 1950: about 4.4 million fled in the final stages of the war and 3.5 million were removed by the Polish authorities in 1945–1949. The expulsion of the Germans was the result of the Allied decisions finalized in Potsdam.

With the <a href="Population%20exchange%20between%20Poland%20and%20Soviet%20Ukraine">repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union</a> and the 1947 <a href="Operation%20Vistula">Operation Vistula</a> dispersing the remaining <a href="Ukrainians%20in%20Poland">Ukrainians in Poland</a>, and with most of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Poland">Polish Jews</a> exterminated by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> during <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a> and many of the survivors emigrating to the West and to newly created <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, Poland for the first time <a href="Demographic%20history%20of%20Poland">became an ethnically homogeneous nation state</a>. The government-imposed and spontaneous movements of people amounted to one of the greatest demographic upheavals in European history.

Poland suffered catastrophic damage to its <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a> during the war, which caused it to lag even further behind <a href="Western%20world%23Cold%20War%20context%20%281947-1991%29">the West</a> in its industrial output. The losses in national resources and infrastructure amounted to over 30% of the pre-war potential. Poland's capital of <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a> was among the most devastated cities – over 80 percent destroyed in the aftermath of the <a href="Warsaw%20Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a> of 1944. The Polish state acquired more highly developed western territories and lost the more economically backward eastern regions. Already in 1948 the prewar level of industrial production was exceeded in global and per capita terms during the <a href="Three-Year%20Plan">Three-Year Plan</a> ("Plan Trzyletni"), implemented first and fueled by the collective desire to rebuild shattered lives.. The Three-Year Plan was the work of the Central Planning Office led by <a href="Czes%C5%82aw%20Bobrowski">Czesław Bobrowski</a> and PPR economist <a href="Hilary%20Minc">Hilary Minc</a>, who declared the need to preserve elements of <a href="market%20%28economics%29">market</a> <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a>. Standard of living of the population of Poland markedly improved. Soviet pressure caused the Polish government to reject the American-sponsored <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a> in 1947 and to join the Soviet Union-dominated <a href="Comecon">Comecon</a> in 1949.

Warsaw and other ruined cities were cleared of rubble — mainly by hand — and rebuilt with great speed (one of the successes of the Three-Year Plan) at the expense of former German cities like <a href="Wroc%C5%82aw">Wrocław</a>, which often provided the needed construction material. Wrocław, <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a>, <a href="Szczecin">Szczecin</a> and other formerly German cities were also completely rebuilt.

Historian <a href="Norman%20Davies">Norman Davies</a> found the new Polish frontiers, from the Polish interests point of view, entirely advantageous, but realized at the cost of enormous suffering and specious justifications. The radically new Eastern European borders constituted a "colossal feat of political engineering", but could not be derived from immemorial historical determinations, as claimed by the communist propaganda.

Already before the Red Army entered Poland, the Soviet Union was pursuing a strategy of eliminating pro-Western resistance as an organized force to ensure that Poland would fall under its sphere of influence. In 1943, following the revelation of the <a href="Katyn%20massacre">Katyn massacre</a>, Stalin severed relations with the <a href="Polish%20government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a> in London. However, at the February 1945 <a href="Yalta%20Conference">Yalta Conference</a>, the Soviet Union agreed to allow the formation of a coalition government composed of the communists, including the <a href="Polish%20Workers%27%20Party">Polish Workers' Party</a> ("Polska Partia Robotnicza", PPR), as well as Polish pro-Western elements in exile and in Poland, and subsequently to arrange for free <a href="election">election</a>s to be held.

After the prewar <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Poland">Communist Party of Poland</a> was eliminated in <a href="Great%20Purge">Stalin's purges</a> in 1938 (some five thousand Polish communists were brought to <a href="Russia">Russia</a> and killed), a group of survivors led by <a href="Marceli%20Nowotko">Marceli Nowotko</a>, <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20Mo%C5%82ojec">Bolesław Mołojec</a> and <a href="Pawe%C5%82%20Finder">Paweł Finder</a> convinced in 1941 the Soviets in Moscow of the need to reestablish a Polish party. The conspiratorial core of the new Polish Workers' Party was assembled in Warsaw in January 1942, and after the deaths or arrests of the above leaders there, <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Gomu%C5%82ka">Władysław Gomułka</a> emerged as the PPR's first secretary by the end of 1943. Gomułka was a dedicated communist in the national tradition of the Polish <a href="left-wing%20politics">leftist</a> movement. He loathed the Soviet practices he experienced while being trained in Russia and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> in the 1930s, but was convinced of the historic necessity of alliance with the Soviet Union. He may have survived the purges because of being imprisoned in Poland for illegal labor-organizing activities in 1938–39. Throughout the <a href="German-occupied%20Europe">German occupation</a>, Gomułka remained in Poland and was not a part of the circle organized in the Soviet Union around the <a href="Union%20of%20Polish%20Patriots">Union of Polish Patriots</a> by Stalin and <a href="Wanda%20Wasilewska">Wanda Wasilewska</a>. In Polish society of 1945, Gomułka's party was marginally small in comparison to other political groups.

With the liberation of Polish territories and the failure of the <a href="Home%20Army">Home Army</a>'s <a href="Operation%20Tempest">Operation Tempest</a> in 1944, control over what was to become post-war Poland passed from the occupying forces of Nazi Germany to the Red Army, and from the Red Army to <a href="Communism%20in%20Poland">Polish communists</a>, who formed the <a href="Polish%20Committee%20of%20National%20Liberation">Polish Committee of National Liberation</a> ("Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego", PKWN), an early government, in existence from late July 1944 in <a href="Lublin">Lublin</a>. The Polish communists became the most influential Polish factor in the politics of emerging Poland, despite having initially minuscule popular support. The PKWN recognized the legal continuity of the <a href="March%20Constitution%20%28Poland%29">March Constitution of Poland</a>, as opposed to the <a href="April%20Constitution%20of%20Poland">April Constitution</a>. On 6 September 1944, the PKWN issued its momentous <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a> decree, the consequences of which would fundamentally alter the antiquated social and economic structure of the country. Over one million peasant families benefited from parcellation of the <a href="folwark">larger estates</a>.

The communists, favored by the Yalta decisions, enjoyed the advantages of Soviet support within the Soviet plan of bringing Eastern Europe firmly under the influence of the Soviet Union; they exercised control over crucial government departments, such as the security services (security was in the hands of the Soviet <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> until its Polish counterparts were developed). Beginning in the later part of 1944, following the defeat of the Warsaw Uprising and the promotion of the <a href="populism">populist</a> program of the PKWN, the London exiled government's <a href="Government%20Delegation%20for%20Poland">delegation</a> was increasingly seen by the majority of Poles as a failed enterprise, its <a href="Polish%20Underground%20State">political-military organizations</a> became isolated, and the resistance against the new communist political and administrative forces decisively weakened. The population was tired of the years of oppression and conflict and the ideas expressed in the <a href="PKWN%20Manifesto">PKWN Manifesto</a> and their progressive implementation attracted widening social support. Beyond the land reform, the PKWN Manifesto foresaw no further radical ownership changes and <a href="nationalization">nationalization</a> of industry was not mentioned. On the contrary, business property was supposed to return to its owners as the economic relations become properly regulated. From 1944 in liberated areas, responding to promulgated slogans, workers spontaneously took over existing factory installations, established <a href="workers%27%20council">workers' council</a>s, undertook reconstruction, activation and production. A considerable labor struggle and compulsion were necessary for the PPR to claim the factories and enforce its own rules.

The PKWN was reshaped into the <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland">Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland</a> ("Rząd Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej", RTRP), which functioned from January 1945. This government was headed by <a href="Edward%20Os%C3%B3bka-Morawski">Edward Osóbka-Morawski</a>, a socialist, but the communists, mostly non-PPR Soviet employees such as <a href="Micha%C5%82%20Rola-%C5%BBymierski">Michał Rola-Żymierski</a>, held a majority of key posts. In April 1945, a Polish-Soviet treaty of friendship and cooperation was signed; it severely limited the possibilities of future Western or <a href="%C3%A9migr%C3%A9">émigré</a> impact or internal cooperation with non-communist political forces in Poland. The consecutive early Soviet-influenced governments were subordinate to the unelected, communist-controlled parliament, the <a href="State%20National%20Council">State National Council</a> ("Krajowa Rada Narodowa", KRN), formed by Gomułka and his PPR in occupied Warsaw in January 1944. The communist governmental structures were not recognized by the increasingly isolated Polish government-in-exile, which had formed its own quasi-parliament, the <a href="Council%20of%20National%20Unity">Council of National Unity</a> ("Rada Jedności Narodowej", RJN).

The Yalta agreement stipulated a governmental union in Poland of "all democratic and anti-Nazi elements". Prime Minister <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Miko%C5%82ajczyk">Stanisław Mikołajczyk</a> of the Polish government-in-exile resigned his post in November 1944 and having accepted the Yalta terms went to Moscow, where he negotiated with <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20Bierut">Bolesław Bierut</a> the shape of a "national unity" government". Mikołajczyk, along with several other exiled Polish leaders, returned to Poland in July 1945.

The new Polish <a href="Provisional%20Government%20of%20National%20Unity">Provisional Government of National Unity</a> ("Tymczasowy Rząd Jedności Narodowej", TRJN) — as the Polish government was called until the <a href="Polish%20legislative%20election%2C%201947">elections of 1947</a> — was established on 28 June 1945. Osóbka-Morawski was kept as prime minister, Gomułka became first deputy prime minister and Mikołajczyk second deputy and minister of agriculture. The government was "provisional" and the <a href="Potsdam%20Conference">Potsdam Conference</a> soon declared that before a regular government is created, free elections must be held and a permanent constitutional system established.

The communists' principal rivals were <a href="Freedom%20and%20Independence">veteran activists</a> of the <a href="Polish%20Underground%20State">Polish Underground State</a>, Mikołajczyk's <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Party%20%281945%E2%80%931949%29">Polish People's Party</a> ("Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe", PSL), and veterans of the <a href="Polish%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20the%20West">Polish Armed Forces in the West</a>. Of particular practical importance was Mikołajczyk's People's Party (originally a peasant formation), because it was legally recognized by the communists and thus able to function within the political arena. The People's Party wanted to prevent the communists from monopolizing power and eventually establish a parliamentary polity with a market economy by winning the promised elections. Mikołajczyk hoped that an independent Polish state, friendly with the Soviet Union, would be allowed to act as a bridge between the East and the West.

Soviet-oriented parties, backed by the Soviet Red Army and in control of the security forces, held most of the power, concentrated especially in the Polish Workers' Party under Gomułka and Bierut. Bierut represented the influx of appointees to the Polish party coming (during and after the war) from the Soviet Union and imposed by the Soviets, a process accelerated at the time of the PPR Congress of December 1945. The party's membership dramatically increased from perhaps a few thousand in early 1945 to over one million in 1948.

As a show of Soviet domination, sixteen prominent leaders of the <a href="Polish%20Underground%20State">Polish anti-Nazi underground</a> were brought to <a href="Trial%20of%20the%20Sixteen">trial in Moscow</a> in June 1945. Their removal from the political scene precluded the possibility of a democratic transition called for by the Yalta agreements. The trial of the defendants, falsely and absurdly accused of collaboration with the Nazis, was watched by British and American diplomats without protest. The absence of the expected death sentences was their relief. The exiled government in London, after Mikołajczyk's resignation led by <a href="Tomasz%20Arciszewski">Tomasz Arciszewski</a>, ceased to be officially recognized by Great Britain and the United States on 5 July 1945.

In the years 1945–47, about 500,000 Soviet soldiers were stationed in Poland. Between 1945 and 1948, some 150,000 Poles were imprisoned by the Soviet authorities. Many former Home Army members were apprehended and executed. During the PPR <a href="Central%20Committee">Central Committee</a> Plenum of May 1945, Gomułka complained that the Polish masses regard the Polish communists as the "NKVD's worst agency" and <a href="Edward%20Ochab">Edward Ochab</a> declared the withdrawal of the Soviet Army from Poland a high priority. But in the meantime tens of thousands of Poles died in the postwar struggle and persecution and tens of thousands were sentenced by courts on fabricated and arbitrary charges or deported to the Soviet Union. The status of Soviet troops in Poland was not legalized until late 1956, when the Polish-Soviet declaration "On the legal status of Soviet forces temporarily stationed in Poland" was signed. The Soviet <a href="Northern%20Group%20of%20Forces">Northern Group of Forces</a> would be permanently stationed in Poland.

Stalin had promised at the Yalta Conference that free elections would be held in Poland. However, the Polish communists, led by Gomułka and Bierut, while having no intention of giving up power, were also aware of the limited support they enjoyed among the general population. To circumvent this difficulty, in 1946 a national plebiscite, known as the <a href="Polish%20people%27s%20referendum%2C%201946">"Three Times Yes" referendum</a> ("Trzy razy tak"), was held first, before the parliamentary elections. The referendum comprised three fairly general, but politically charged questions about the Senate, national industries and western borders. It was meant to check and promote the popularity of communist initiatives in Poland. Since most of the important parties at the time were leftist or centrist – and could have easily approved all three options – Mikołajczyk's Polish People's Party (PSL) decided, not to be seen as merging into the government bloc, to ask its supporters to oppose the first one: the abolition of the Senate. The communists voted "Three Times Yes". The partial results, reconstructed by the PSL, showed that the communist side was met with little support on the first question. However, after a campaign marked by electoral fraud and intimidation the communists claimed large majorities on all three questions, which led to the <a href="nationalization">nationalization</a> of industry and state control of economic activity in general, and a unicameral national parliament ("<a href="Sejm">Sejm</a>").

The communists consolidated power by gradually whittling away the rights of their non-communist foes, particularly by suppressing the leading opposition party – Mikołajczyk's PSL. In some widely publicized cases, the perceived enemies were sentenced to death on trumped up charges — among them <a href="Witold%20Pilecki">Witold Pilecki</a>, the organizer of the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a> resistance. Leaders of the Home Army and of the Council of National Unity were persecuted. Many resistance fighters were murdered extrajudicially or forced to exile. The opposition members were also harassed by administrative means. Although the ongoing persecution of the former anti-Nazi and <a href="National%20Armed%20Forces">right-wing organizations</a> by state security kept <a href="cursed%20soldiers">some partisans</a> in the forests, the actions of the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Poland%29">Ministry of Public Security</a> (known as the UB, Department of Security), NKVD and the Red Army steadily diminished their numbers. The <a href="National%20Military%20Union">right-wing insurgency</a> radically decreased after the amnesty of July 1945 and faded after the <a href="Amnesty%20of%201947">amnesty of February 1947</a>.

By 1946, all rightist parties had been outlawed, and a new pro-government <a href="Front%20of%20National%20Unity">Democratic Bloc</a> was formed in 1947 which included only the Polish Workers' Party and its leftist allies. On 19 January 1947, the <a href="Polish%20legislative%20election%2C%201947">first parliamentary elections</a> took place featuring primarily the PPR and allied candidates and a potentially politically potent opposition from the Polish People's Party. However, the PSL's strength and role had already been seriously compromised due to government control and persecution. Election results were adjusted by Stalin to suit the communists, whose bloc claimed 80% of the votes. The British and American governments protested the poll for its blatant violations of the Yalta and Potsdam accords. The rigged elections effectively ended the multiparty system in Poland's politics. After the referendum dress rehearsal, this time the vote fraud was much better concealed and spread into various forms and stages and its actual scale is not known. With all the pressure and manipulations, an NKVD colonel charged with election supervision reported to Stalin that about 50% of the vote was cast for the regime's Democratic Bloc nationwide. In the new "Sejm", out of 444 seats, 27 were given to the <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Party%20%281945%E2%80%931949%29">Polish People's Party</a> of <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Miko%C5%82ajczyk">Stanisław Mikołajczyk</a>. He, having declared the results to be falsified, was threatened with arrest or worse and fled the country in October 1947, helped by the <a href="United%20States">US</a> Embassy; other opposition leaders also left. In February, the new "Sejm" created the <a href="Small%20Constitution%20of%201947">Small Constitution of 1947</a>. Over the next two years, the communists monopolized political power in Poland.

Additional force in Polish politics, the long-established <a href="Polish%20Socialist%20Party">Polish Socialist Party</a> ("Polska Partia Socjalistyczna", PPS), suffered a fatal split at this time, as the ruling Stalinists applied the <a href="salami%20tactics">salami tactics</a> to dismember the opposition. Communist politicians cooperated with the left-wing PPS faction led by <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Cyrankiewicz">Józef Cyrankiewicz</a>, prime minister under new president Bierut from February 1947. The socialists' originally tactical decision to collaborate with the communists resulted in their institutional demise. Cyrankiewicz visited Stalin in Moscow in March 1948 to discuss the idea of a party merger. The <a href="Government%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Kremlin</a>, increasingly uncomfortable with Gomułka's communist party leadership, concurred, and Cyrankiewicz secured his own political place for the future (until 1972). In December 1948, after the removal of Gomułka and imposition of Bierut as the communist Polish Workers' Party chief, the PPR and Cyrankiewicz's rump PPS joined ranks to form the <a href="Polish%20United%20Workers%27%20Party">Polish United Workers' Party</a> ("Polska Zjednoczona Partia Robotnicza", PZPR), in power for the next four decades. Poland became a "de facto" <a href="one-party%20state">one-party state</a> and a <a href="satellite%20state">satellite state</a> of the Soviet Union. Only two other parties were allowed to exist legally: the <a href="United%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Poland%29">United People's Party</a> (ZSL) that had split from Mikołajczyk's <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Party%20%281945%E2%80%931949%29">PSL</a> and was meant to represent rural communities, and the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Democrats%20%28Poland%29">Alliance of Democrats</a> (SD), a token <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a> party (see also: <a href="List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20Poland">List of political parties in Poland</a>).

As the period of <a href="Sovietization">Sovietization</a> and <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> began, the PZPR was anything but united. The most important split among the communists occurred before the union with the PPS, when the Stalinists forced Gomułka out of the PPR's top office and suppressed his native communist faction. The PZPR became divided into several factions, which espoused different views and methods and sought different degrees of the Polish state's distinction and independence from the Soviet Union. While <a href="Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism">Marxism–Leninism</a>, the official ideology, was new to Poland, the communist regime continued, in many psychologically and practically important ways, the precepts, methods and manners of past Polish ruling circles, including those of the <a href="Sanation">Sanation</a>, the <a href="National%20Democracy">National Democracy</a>, and 19th century traditions of cooperation with the <a href="Partitions%20of%20Poland">partitioning powers</a>.

With Poland being a member of the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Soviet Bloc</a>, the party's pursuits of power and reform were permanently hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers of the Soviet Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by the understanding of the party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements of the Soviet alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction). Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the Soviets and the Polish communists.

The "<a href="nomenklatura">nomenklatura</a>" political elite developed. It comprised leaders, administrators and managers within the ruling party structure, in all branches of central and local government and in institutions of all kinds. "Nomenklatura" members were appointed by the party and exercised political control in all spheres of public life, for example economic development, industry management, or education. For the party, the privileged "nomenklatura" layer was maintained to assure the proper placement of people who were ideologically reliable and otherwise qualified, but the <a href="Revisionism%20%28Marxism%29">revisionist</a> dissidents <a href="Jacek%20Kuro%C5%84">Jacek Kuroń</a> and <a href="Karol%20Modzelewski">Karol Modzelewski</a> later described this system as a class dictatorship of central political <a href="bureaucracy">bureaucracy</a> for its own sake. The Polish public widely approved the many social undertakings of the communist government, including family apartment construction, child care, worker vacation and resorts, health care and full employment policies, but the special privileges granted "nomenklatura" and the security services were resented.

As in other <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> countries, there was a Soviet-style political purge of communist officials in Poland after 1948, accused of "nationalist" or other "<a href="Deviationism">deviationist</a>" tendencies. The half-hearted in Poland campaign included the arrests and imprisonments of <a href="Marian%20Spychalski">Marian Spychalski</a> from May 1950, and <a href="Micha%C5%82%20Rola-%C5%BBymierski">Michał Rola-Żymierski</a> five months after Stalin's death. In September 1948 Władysław Gomułka, who opposed Stalin's direct control of the Polish PPR party, was charged, together with a group of communist leaders who like Gomułka spent the war in Poland, with ideological departure from <a href="Leninism">Leninism</a>, and dismissed from the post of the party's first secretary. Gomułka, accused of "right-wing nationalist deviations", had indeed emphasized the <a href="Polish%20Socialist%20Party">Polish socialist</a> traditions and severely criticized <a href="Rosa%20Luxemburg">Rosa Luxemburg</a>'s <a href="Social%20Democracy%20of%20the%20Kingdom%20of%20Poland%20and%20Lithuania">Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania</a> (SDKPiL) party for belittling Polish national aspirations. More insidiously, the Soviets claimed Gomułka's participation in an anti-Soviet international conspiracy. Following Bolesław Bierut's order, he was arrested by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Poland%29">Ministry of Public Security</a> (MBP) in early August 1951 and interrogated by <a href="Roman%20Romkowski">Roman Romkowski</a> and <a href="Anatol%20Fejgin">Anatol Fejgin</a>, as demanded by the Soviets. Gomułka was not subjected to physical torture unlike other communists persecuted under the regime of Bierut, <a href="Jakub%20Berman">Jakub Berman</a> and other Stalin's associates. Under interrogation he defiantly conducted his defense, threatened to reveal "the whole truth" if put on a trial and remained unbroken. Gomułka was thus placed in prison without a typical <a href="show%20trial">show trial</a> (he was released in December 1954). Bierut replaced Gomułka as the PPR (and then the PZPR) leader. Gomułka remained protected by his Polish comrades to the best of their ability and the record of his sometime defiance came in handy when in 1956 there was an opportunity for the Polish party to reassert itself.

The Stalinist government was controlled by Polish communists originating from wartime factions and organizations operating in the Soviet Union under Stalin, such as the <a href="Union%20of%20Polish%20Patriots">Union of Polish Patriots</a>. Their leaders at that time included <a href="Wanda%20Wasilewska">Wanda Wasilewska</a> and <a href="Zygmunt%20Berling">Zygmunt Berling</a>. Now in Poland, those who remained politically active and in favor ruled the country, aided by the MBP and Soviet "advisers", who were placed in every arm of the government and state security as a guarantee of pro-Soviet policy of the state. The most important of them was <a href="Konstantin%20Rokossovsky">Konstantin Rokossovsky</a> ("Konstanty Rokossowski" in Polish), defense minister of Poland from 1949 to 1956, <a href="Marshal%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Marshal of the Soviet Union</a> and war hero. Military conscription was introduced following a postwar hiatus and the army soon reached its permanent size of 400,000 men.

The Soviet-style secret police including the Department of Security (UB) grew to around 32,000 agents as of 1953. At its Stalinist peak, there was one UB agent for every 800 Polish citizens. The MBP was also in charge of the Internal Security Corps, the Civil Militia (<a href="Milicja%20Obywatelska">MO</a>), border guard, prison staff and paramilitary police <a href="ORMO">ORMO</a> used for special actions (with over 100,000 members). The ORMO originated from popular self-defense efforts, which were a spontaneous reaction to the explosion of crime in the power vacuum of 1944–45. In February 1946, the PPR channeled and formalized this citizen militia movement, creating its ostensibly crime control voluntary ORMO structure.

Primarily in Stalin's lifetime, public prosecutors and judges as well as functionaries of the Ministry of Public Security and the <a href="Main%20Directorate%20of%20Information%20of%20the%20Polish%20Army">Main Directorate of Information of the Polish Army</a> engaged in acts recognized by international law as crimes against humanity and crimes against peace. One example was the <a href="1951%20Mokot%C3%B3w%20Prison%20execution">1951 Mokotów Prison execution</a> in Warsaw of members of the <a href="Freedom%20and%20Independence">Freedom and Independence</a> (WiN) organization, former participants in anti-Nazi resistance, after the official amnesty and their voluntary disclosure. The postwar Polish Army, intelligence and police were staffed with Soviet NKVD officers who stationed in Poland with the <a href="Northern%20Group%20of%20Forces">Northern Group of Forces</a> until 1956.

Mass arrests continued during the early 1950s. In October 1950, 5,000 people were arrested in one night in the so-called "Operation K". In 1952, over 21,000 people were arrested. By the second half of 1952, according to official data, 49,500 political prisoners were being held. Former Home Army commander <a href="Emil%20August%20Fieldorf">Emil August Fieldorf</a> was subjected to several years of brutal persecution in the Soviet Union and Poland before being executed in February 1953, just before Stalin's death.

Resistance to the Soviet and native Stalinists was widespread among not only the general population but also the PZPR ranks, which limited the oppressive system's damage in Poland to well below that of other European communist-ruled countries. According to <a href="Norman%20Davies">Norman Davies</a>, political violence after 1947 was not widespread. The Church, subjected to partial property confiscations, remained largely intact, the marginalized to a considerable degree intelligentsia retained its potential to affect future reforms, the peasantry avoided wholesale collectivization and remnants of private enterprise survived. Gradual liberalizing changes took place between Stalin's death in 1953 and the <a href="Polish%20October">Polish October</a> of 1956.

In February 1948, Minister of Industry <a href="Hilary%20Minc">Hilary Minc</a>, a Marxist economist, attacked the Central Planning Office of Poland as a "<a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeois</a>" remnant, the office was abolished and the Polish Stalinist economy was born. The government, headed by President Bierut, Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz and Minc, embarked on a sweeping program of economic reform and national reconstruction. Poland was brought into line with the Soviet model of a "<a href="People%27s%20Republic">people's republic</a>" and <a href="Planned%20economy">centrally planned</a> <a href="command%20economy">command economy</a>, in place of the façade of democracy and partial <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a> which the regime had maintained until 1948.

The relationships of ownership of the industry, the banking sector and rural property after the nationalization and the land reform were fundamentally altered. The changes, implemented in the name of <a href="egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a>, enjoyed broad societal approval and support.

The structure of Polish economy was established in the late 1940s and the early 1950s. <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet-style planning</a> begun in 1950 with the <a href="Six-Year%20Plan">Six-Year Plan</a>. The plan focused on rapid development of <a href="heavy%20industry">heavy industry</a> ("accelerated industrialization", after the outbreak of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> driven by Soviet military demands at the expense of many cancelled consumer-oriented investments) and the (eventually futile) <a href="Collective%20farming">collectivization of agriculture</a>. Among the main projects was the <a href="Tadeusz%20Sendzimir%20Steelworks">Lenin Steelworks</a> and its supporting "socialist city" of <a href="Nowa%20Huta">Nowa Huta</a> (New Steel Mill), both built from the scratch in the early 1950s near <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>, of which Nowa Huta soon became a part. The <a href="folwark">land seized from prewar large landowners</a> was redistributed to the poorer peasants, but subsequent attempts at taking the land from farmers for collectivization met wide resentment. In what became known as the <a href="battle%20for%20trade">battle for trade</a>, the private trade and industry were <a href="nationalization">nationalized</a>. Within few years most private shops disappeared. The regime embarked on the <a href="Collectivization%20in%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">campaign of collectivization</a> (<a href="State%20Agricultural%20Farm">State Agricultural Farm</a>s were created), although the pace of this change was slower than in other Soviet satellites. Poland remained the only Eastern Bloc country where individual peasants would continue to dominate agriculture. A Soviet-Polish trade treaty, initiated in January 1948, dictated the dominant direction of Poland's future foreign trade and economic cooperation.

In 1948, the United States announced the <a href="Marshall%20Plan">Marshall Plan</a> initiative to help rebuild postwar Europe and thus gain more political power there. After initially welcoming the idea of Poland's participation in the plan, the Polish government declined the American offer under pressure from Moscow. Also, following the <a href="Uprising%20of%201953%20in%20East%20Germany">Uprising of 1953 in East Germany</a>, Poland was forced by the Soviet Union to give up its claims to compensation from Germany, which as a result paid no significant compensation for war damages, either to the Polish state or to Polish citizens. Poland received compensation in the form of land and property left behind by the German population of the <a href="Recovered%20Territories">annexed western territories</a>.

Despite the lack of American aid, the East European "command economies", including Poland, made some progress in bridging the historically existing wealth gap with the market economy driven Western Europe. Because of the <a href="capital%20accumulation">capital accumulation</a>, the Polish <a href="Measures%20of%20national%20income%20and%20output">national income</a> grew in real terms by over 76% and the agricultural and industrial production more than doubled between 1947 and 1950. The economic transition and industrialization were accompanied and made possible by massive social transformations, as peasants migrated and were converted into city dwelling <a href="working%20class">working class</a> (1.8 million between 1946 and 1955) and the country went through a period of rapid <a href="urbanization">urbanization</a> (total population of the cities increased by 3.1 million). The influx of cheap labor and the availability of the Soviet market facilitated an accumulation of resources, despite low productivity and insufficient investment in new technologies. The centrally planned socialist economies of Eastern Europe in terms of growth during the postwar years did relatively better than the West, only to sustain economic damage later, especially after the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>. However, the rise in living standards caused by the earlier industrial dynamics was not comparable to that in the West.

The last <a href="1951%20Polish%E2%80%93Soviet%20territorial%20exchange">Polish–Soviet territorial exchange</a> took place in 1951. Some of land along the border were swapped between Poland and the Soviet Union.

The <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">Constitution of the Polish People's Republic</a> was promulgated in July 1952 and the state officially became the <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">Polish People's Republic</a> (PRL). Among the rights it guaranteed was universal free health care. The large <a href="state-owned%20enterprise">state-owned enterprise</a>s provided to employees an extensive range of welfare and leisure activities, including housing, sports facilities and hospitals, which started to diminish in the 1970s. In the early 1950s, the Stalinist regime also carried out <a href="Education%20in%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">major changes to the education system</a>. The program of free and compulsory school education for all and the establishment of free institutions of higher learning received much support. The communists screened out what facts and interpretations were to be taught; history and other sciences had to follow Marxist views approved by <a href="Censorship%20in%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">ideological censorship</a>. During 1951–53, a large number of prewar professors who were perceived by the regime as reactionary was dismissed from universities. Government control over art and artists deepened. The Soviet-style <a href="socialist%20realism">socialist realism</a> became the only formula accepted by the authorities after 1949. Most works of art and literature represented <a href="Propaganda%20in%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">propaganda of the party</a> or had to be in line with its views. (See also: <a href="Socialist%20realism%20in%20Poland">Socialist realism in Poland</a>)

The reforms often brought relief for a significant part of the population. After World War II many people were willing to accept communist rule in exchange for the restoration of relatively normal life; hundreds of thousands joined the communist party and actively supported the regime. Nonetheless, latent popular discontent remained present and many Poles adopted the attitude of "resigned cooperation". Others, like the <a href="Freedom%20and%20Independence">Freedom and Independence</a> organization that originated from elements of the Home Army and especially the <a href="National%20Armed%20Forces">National Armed Forces</a> actively opposed the communists, hoping for a <a href="World%20War%20III">World War III</a> that would liberate Poland. Most <a href="cursed%20soldiers">people who took up arms against the communist regime</a> had surrendered during the amnesties of 1945 and <a href="amnesty%20of%201947">1947</a>, but brutal repressions by the secret police continued and some fought well into the 1950s.

The communists further alienated many Poles by persecuting the <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Poland">Catholic Church</a>. The <a href="PAX%20Association">PAX Association</a> created in 1947 and led by the former prewar <a href="National%20Radical%20Camp">far-right</a> activist <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20Piasecki">Bolesław Piasecki</a>, attempted to divide the Catholic movement and promote a communist rule-friendly, <a href="collaborationism">collaborationist</a> church. The PAX did not get very far in molding the Catholic public opinion, but published numerous books and officially approved daily Catholic press. In 1953 <a href="Cardinal%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">Cardinal</a> <a href="Stefan%20Wyszy%C5%84ski">Stefan Wyszyński</a>, the <a href="List%20of%20archbishops%20of%20Gniezno%20and%20primates%20of%20Poland">Primate of Poland</a>, was placed under house arrest, even though he had been willing to make compromises with the government. In the early 1950s, the war against religion by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Poland%29">secret police</a> led to arrests and persecution of hundreds of religious personalities, culminating in the <a href="Stalinist%20show%20trial%20of%20the%20Krak%C3%B3w%20Curia">Stalinist show trial of the Kraków Curia</a>. (See also: <a href="Polish%20anti-religious%20campaign">Polish anti-religious campaign</a>)

The constitution of 1952 guaranteed on paper all sorts of democratic rights and freedoms. In reality, the country was controlled extra-constitutionally by the Polish United Workers' Party, which used its own rules and practices to supervise all governmental institutions specified in the constitution. The post of <a href="President%20of%20Poland">President of Poland</a> was replaced with the collective <a href="Polish%20Council%20of%20State">Council of State</a>, but Bierut, the party's first secretary, remained the effective leader of Poland. In the future, the existence of a constitution with democratic provisions would give the opposition a legal tool and a way to pressure the regime.

Stalin died in 1953, which was followed by a partial thaw in Poland. <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> became <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">first secretary</a> of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>. The PZPR's Second Congress deliberated in March 1954. Cyrankiewicz, previously replaced as prime minister by Bierut, was returned to that post (to remain prime minister until December 1970). The Six-Year Plan was adjusted to increase production of items for popular consumption. Khrushchev, present at the Congress, asked Bierut for the reasons of the continuing detention of Gomułka, "a good communist"; Bierut denied having specific knowledge of Gomułka's imprisonment.

Following the defection to the West and revelations of its official <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20%C5%9Awiat%C5%82o">Józef Światło</a>, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Public%20Security%20%28Poland%29">Ministry of Public Security</a> was abolished in December 1954. Gomułka and his associates were freed from confinement and censorship was slightly relaxed. The two notable periodicals braving the prohibitions were "Po prostu" ('Simply') and "Nowa Kultura" ('The New Culture') ("Po prostu" was closed down and its defenders brutally pacified in October 1957, just one year after Gomułka's rise to power). From early 1955, the Polish press engaged in criticizing the Stalinist recent past and praising the older <a href="Polish%20Socialist%20Party">Polish socialist traditions</a> (<a href="social%20democracy">social democratic</a> <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> and national independence). Political discussion clubs were on the rise throughout the country. The party itself appeared to be moving in the social democratic direction. Leftist intellectuals, who had joined the party because of their commitment to <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a>, were heading in the social democratic direction more decisively and they soon gave rise to the Polish <a href="Revisionism%20%28Marxism%29">revisionism</a> movement.

In February 1956, Khrushchev denounced <a href="Stalin%27s%20cult%20of%20personality">Stalin's cult of personality</a> at the <a href="20th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a> and embarked on a <a href="Khrushchev%20Thaw">reform course</a>. The <a href="de-Stalinization">de-Stalinization</a> of official Soviet ideology left Poland's Stalinist hardliners in a difficult position. While unrest and desire for reform and change among both intellectuals and workers were beginning to surface throughout the Eastern Bloc, the death of Stalin's ally Bierut in March 1956 in Moscow (he was attending the Soviet party's congress) exacerbated an existing split in the Polish party. In March Bierut was succeeded by <a href="Edward%20Ochab">Edward Ochab</a> as first secretary. As the 20th Congress inspired also partial democratisation of Polish political and economic life, Ochab engaged in reforms intended to promote industrial decentralization and improve living standards.

The number of security agents was cut by 22%. By a widespread amnesty, 35,000 detainees across the entire country were released. 9,000 imprisoned for political reasons were freed in all. Hardline Stalinists, such as <a href="Jakub%20Berman">Jakub Berman</a>, <a href="Roman%20Romkowski">Roman Romkowski</a> and <a href="Anatol%20Fejgin">Anatol Fejgin</a> were removed from power, some arrested. Berman, dismissed in May, by Gomułka's decision was never prosecuted. A few perpetrators of Stalinist crimes were prosecuted and sentenced to prison terms. A much broader plan to charge the responsible and verify all of the security apparatus was formally presented by the prosecutors, but the action was not approved by Gomułka, who counted among the Stalinist persecution victims, as did his wife. Gomułka conducted some purges and reforms but did not want to destabilize the security system, now under his control, by wide-ranging formal prosecutions.

Beginning on 28 June 1956, workers in the industrial city of <a href="Pozna%C5%84">Poznań</a>, who had repeatedly but in vain petitioned the authorities to intervene and improve their deteriorating situation, <a href="Pozna%C5%84%201956%20protests">went on strike and rioted</a> in response to a cut in wages and changed working conditions. Demonstrations by <a href="H.%20Cegielski%20%E2%80%93%20Pozna%C5%84">factory workers</a> turned into a huge citywide protest. 16 tanks, 2 armoured personnel carriers and 30 vehicles were brought to bear by a local military commander. Some of them were seized by the protesters, who also broke into the local government buildings. 57 people were killed and several hundred injured in two days of fighting. Several major military formations entered the scene, but the army's role was mainly that of support of the <a href="Milicja%20Obywatelska">police</a> and <a href="Internal%20Security%20Corps">security forces</a> action. At the Poznań radio station, Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz warned and threatened the rioters in his widely publicized speech: he "…who will dare raise his hand against the people's rule may be sure that… the authorities will chop off his hand". Of the 746 people officially detained during and in the aftermath of the disturbances, almost 80% were workers. The authorities launched an investigation, attempting to uncover a claimed premeditated instigation and involvement by Western or anticommunist underground centers. Such efforts were unsuccessful and the events were found to have been spontaneous and locally supported. The Poznań revolt's lasting impact was that it caused a deeper and more <a href="classical%20liberalism">liberal</a> realignment within the Polish communist party and in its relationship to Moscow.

Deeply shaken by the protests and violence, the 7th Plenum of the Central Committee, held in July 1956, split into two groups, the "ethno-nationalist" "Natolin" and the "reformist" "Puławy" factions, named after the locations where they held their meetings. The "Natolin" faction consisted largely of communist officials from the army and state security, including <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Moczar">Mieczysław Moczar</a>, <a href="Zenon%20Kliszko">Zenon Kliszko</a> and <a href="Zenon%20Nowak">Zenon Nowak</a>, who advocated the removal of "Stalin's Jewish protégés", but were themselves of Stalinist sympathies. Many in the "Puławy" faction were former Stalinist fanatics, past Gomułka's enemies, now turned liberal reformers, supporters of Gomułka's return to power. In response to the recent disturbances, the regime turned to conciliation: wage rises and other reforms for the Poznań workers were announced. In the party and among the intellectuals, demands for wider reforms of the Stalinist system were becoming more widespread and intense.

Realizing the need for new leadership, in what became known as the <a href="Polish%20October">Polish October</a>, the <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a> chose Gomułka, who had been released from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was reinforced by pressure from communist <a href="China">China</a>, which demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous <a href="social%20democracy">social democratic</a>-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing <a href="revisionism%20%28Marxism%29">revisionists</a> and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists aspired to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. Their main goals were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises. However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of <a href="NATO">NATO</a>.

Many Soviet officers serving in the <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Army">Polish Armed Forces</a> were dismissed, but very few Stalinist officials were put on trial for the repressions of the Bierut period. The "Puławy" faction argued that mass trials of Stalinist officials, many of them Jewish, would incite animosity toward the Jews. <a href="Konstantin%20Rokossovsky">Konstantin Rokossovsky</a> and other Soviet advisers were sent home, and the Polish communist establishment and system took on a more independent orientation. Gomułka, conscious of geopolitical realities, agreed that <a href="Northern%20Group%20of%20Forces">Soviet troops would remain in Poland</a> and no overt anti-Soviet outbursts would be allowed. However, he formalized the Polish-Soviet relations and the unprecedented for a Soviet-allied state military cooperation treaty, signed in December 1956, stated that the stationing of the Soviet forces in Poland "can in no way violate the sovereignty of the Polish state and cannot lead to their interference in internal matters of the Polish People's Republic". Poland thus avoided the risk of Soviet armed intervention of the kind that crushed the <a href="Hungarian%20Revolution%20of%201956">Hungarian Revolution of 1956</a>. On his part, Gomułka rewarded the Soviets for his internal leeway with loyal support for the duration of his career. In one act of defiance, the Polish delegation at the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> abstained in November 1956 from the vote condemning the Soviet intervention in Hungary.

There were repeated attempts by some <a href="History%20of%20philosophy%20in%20Poland">Polish academics and philosophers</a>, many related to the prewar <a href="Lw%C3%B3w%E2%80%93Warsaw%20school">Lwów–Warsaw school</a> – such as <a href="Leszek%20Ko%C5%82akowski">Leszek Kołakowski</a>, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Ossowski">Stanisław Ossowski</a> and <a href="Adam%20Schaff">Adam Schaff</a> – to create a bridge between Poland's history and <a href="Marxism">Marxist</a> ideology and develop a specific form of <a href="Communism%20in%20Poland">Polish Marxism</a>. Such efforts were stifled due to the regime's unwillingness to risk the wrath of the Soviet Union for deviating too far from the Soviet <a href="Party%20line%20%28politics%29">party line</a>. Kołakowski, a leading revisionist, was verbally attacked by Gomułka in 1957, expelled from the party in 1966 and had to emigrate in 1968.

Poland welcomed Gomułka's rise to power with relief. Gomułka promised an end to police terror, greater intellectual and religious freedom, higher wages, and the reversal of collectivization; and to some degree he fulfilled these promises. Production of consumer goods was somewhat increased. The party elite as well as academic and literary <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a> experienced greater freedom and significant gains, felt as "a certain diversity and revitalization of elite public life". The dissident discussion group survived until 1962. Other forms of collective community expression and a legally guaranteed academic autonomy lasted until the <a href="1968%20Polish%20political%20crisis">1968 Polish political crisis</a>. The permitted academic discourse was in marked contrast to the treatment afforded workers, whose self-management councils that had spontaneously formed in 1956 were neutralized and brought under control of the party by 1958. In the communist era, because of their <a href="social%20class">class</a> role in the official ideology and leadership's sensibilities, workers enjoyed some clout and a degree of protection of their economic interests, on the condition that they refrained from engaging in independent politics or publicly exerting pressure.

Economic reform was attempted when the "Sejm" created the Economic Council in 1957. The council included the prominent economists <a href="Oskar%20R.%20Lange">Oskar R. Lange</a>, <a href="Czes%C5%82aw%20Bobrowski">Czesław Bobrowski</a>, <a href="Micha%C5%82%20Kalecki">Michał Kalecki</a>, and <a href="Edward%20Lipi%C5%84ski">Edward Lipiński</a>. They proposed a <a href="Market%20economy">market</a> reform, beginning with the granting of greater self-rule and more independent decision-making capability to enterprises, to facilitate their "realization of plan goals". But the recommended economic improvements, despite the self-restraint of the authors, were not compatible with the obligatory at that time heavy-handed centralized economic command system, and the reform effort fizzled out.

In October 1957, Poland's Foreign Minister <a href="Adam%20Rapacki">Adam Rapacki</a> proposed a European <a href="Rapacki%20Plan">nuclear-free zone</a> that would include the territories of Poland, <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>, <a href="East%20Germany">East Germany</a> and <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>. In August 1961, the new <a href="Berlin%20Wall">Berlin Wall</a> cemented the division of Europe.

After the first wave of reform, Gomułka's regime started to move back on their promises. Control over mass media and universities was gradually tightened, and many of the younger and more reformist members of the party were forced out. The reform-promising Gomułka of 1956 turned into the authoritarian Gomułka of the 1960s. Although Poland enjoyed a period of relative stability in that decade, the idealism of the "Polish October" faded away. The decisions made at the XIII Plenum of the Central Committee, held in 1963, meant a definite end of the post-October liberalization period. The demise of Gomułka's tactical allies, the "Puławy" faction, gradually replaced by Gomułka's own people, was apparent when <a href="Roman%20Zambrowski">Roman Zambrowski</a>, the leading Jewish politician, was removed from the Politburo.

Poland under Gomułka's rule was generally considered one of the more liberal <a href="communist%20state">communist state</a>s. However, Poles could still go to prison for writing <a href="political%20satire">political satire</a> about the party leader, as <a href="Janusz%20Szpota%C5%84ski">Janusz Szpotański</a> did, or for publishing a book abroad. A March 1964 "Letter of the 34", signed by leading intellectuals and delivered to the office of Prime Minister Cyrankiewicz, criticized the worsening censorship and demanded a more open cultural policy, as guaranteed by the constitution. <a href="Jacek%20Kuro%C5%84">Jacek Kuroń</a> and <a href="Karol%20Modzelewski">Karol Modzelewski</a> were expelled from the party and from 1965 imprisoned for written criticism (an "Open Letter to the Party") of the party rule and pointing out the contradictory nature of the supposedly workers' state. Kuroń and Modzelewski accused the regime of betraying the revolutionary cause; like many younger Polish reformers, they spoke from <a href="New%20Left">leftist positions</a> and were ideologically closely aligned with Western radicals of the 1960s.

As the regime was getting less liberal and more repressive, Gomułka's popularity declined as his initial vision lost its impetus. Many Poles found Gomułka's self-righteous attitude irritating and his demeanor provincial. He reacted to increasing criticism by refusing to budge and insulating himself with the help of cronies, of whom <a href="Zenon%20Kliszko">Zenon Kliszko</a> was the most influential. Within the party, Minister of the Interior <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Moczar">Mieczysław Moczar</a> and his nationalist-communist faction known as "the Partisans" (together with "Moczarowcy", the much broader system of Moczar's political clientele) were looking for an opportunity to assert their dominance.

By the mid-1960s, Poland was starting to experience economic difficulties and the appreciable thus far standard of living improvements were showing signs of stagnation (during 1960–70 real wages for workers grew only by an average of 1.8% per year). The postwar <a href="Business%20cycle">economic boom</a> was ending and the increasingly <a href="globalization">globalized</a> and integrated <a href="world%20economy">world economy</a> was becoming inhospitable to national developments operating behind trade barriers. Like the other communist states, Poland was spending too much on heavy industry, armaments and prestige projects and too little on consumer production. The failure of Soviet-style collectivization returned the collectivized land to the peasants, but most of their farms were too small to be prosperous and productivity in agriculture remained low. Economic relations with West Germany were frozen due to East German interference and resistance to economic integration. Gomułka attributed the signs of economic decline to faulty implementation of the fundamentally correct directions issued by central organs of the party. He failed to appreciate the corrective role of the <a href="Market%20%28economics%29">market</a>, whose <a href="feedback">feedback</a> could not be replaced by theoretical computations, planning and administrative decisions. On the other hand, pursuing conservative investment rather than consumption oriented economic policies, his government generated no foreign debt.

From 1960, the regime increasingly implemented anti-Catholic policies, including harassment, atheistic propaganda, and measures that made carrying out religious practices more difficult. Gomułka, according to Andrzej Leder, was the last Polish politician who seriously tried to realize an <a href="Anti-clericalism">anti-clerical</a> program, a staple leftist undertaking. In 1965, the <a href="Episcopal%20Conference%20of%20Poland">Conference of Polish Bishops</a> issued the <a href="Letter%20of%20Reconciliation%20of%20the%20Polish%20Bishops%20to%20the%20German%20Bishops">Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops</a>. In 1966, the celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of the <a href="Christianization%20of%20Poland">Christianization of Poland</a> led by the <a href="Primate%20%28bishop%29">primate</a>, Cardinal <a href="Stefan%20Wyszy%C5%84ski">Stefan Wyszyński</a> and other bishops who toured the country, turned into a huge demonstration of the power and popularity of the <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20Poland">Catholic Church in Poland</a>. In fierce competition, the state authorities conducted their own national celebrations, stressing the origin of Polish statehood, but the display of the Church hierarchy's command of enormous crowds in a land ruled by the communists must have impressed the Catholic <a href="prelate">prelate</a>s in the <a href="Vatican%20City">Vatican</a> and elsewhere. The state-church dialogue, symbolized by the presence of the few "<a href="Znak%20%28association%29">Znak</a>" independent Catholic deputies in parliament, was rapidly deteriorating.

By the 1960s, rival regime officials and their followers, generally from the younger generation of party activists, had begun to plot against the rule of Gomułka and his associates. Poland's security chief Mieczysław Moczar, a wartime communist partisan commander, based his appeal on nationalistic rhetoric combined with anti-intelligentsia and anti-Jewish sentiments and became the chief challenger. The party leader in <a href="Upper%20Silesia">Upper Silesia</a>, <a href="Edward%20Gierek">Edward Gierek</a>, who had become involved with the communist movement as a teenage mining industry laborer in France, also emerged as a possible alternative leader. Gierek was favored by the more pragmatic and technocratic members of the "<a href="nomenklatura">nomenklatura</a>". From January 1968, Polish revisionist opposition and other circles were strongly influenced by the developing movement of the <a href="Prague%20Spring">Prague Spring</a>.

In March 1968, student demonstrations at the <a href="University%20of%20Warsaw">University of Warsaw</a> broke out in the wake of the government's ban on further performance of the play "<a href="Dziady%20%28poem%29">Dziady</a>" by <a href="Adam%20Mickiewicz">Adam Mickiewicz</a> (written in 1824) at the <a href="National%20Theatre%2C%20Warsaw">National Theatre in Warsaw</a>, because of its alleged "anti-Soviet references". Subsequently, the <a href="ORMO">ORMO</a> and other security formations attacked protesting university students in several major cities.

In what became known as the <a href="1968%20Polish%20political%20crisis">March 1968 events</a>, Moczar used the prior spontaneous and informal celebrations of the outcome of the Arab–Israeli <a href="Six-Day%20War">Six-Day War</a> of 1967 and now the Warsaw theatre affair as pretexts to launch an anti-intellectual and anti-Semitic (officially designated as "<a href="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionist</a>") press campaign, whose real goal was to weaken the pro-reform liberal party faction and attack other circles. Thousands of generally secular and integrated people of Jewish origin lost their employment and some 15,000 Jews emigrated between 1967 and 1971. Of what used to be the prewar Europe's largest Jewish community, only several thousand people remained in Poland.

Other victims were college students, many of whom were expelled from their institutions and had their careers destroyed, academic teachers who tried to defend the students and the academic institutions themselves: Warsaw University had several departments administratively dissolved. Liberal intelligentsia members, Jewish or not, were removed from the government and other places of employment. Leftist intellectuals and student leaders lost what was left of their faith in the ostensibly socialist government. Finally the party itself was purged of many thousand suspect members, people who somehow did not fit the new environment of intolerance and hatred. The 1968 purges meant also the beginning of a large scale generational replacement of the party executive membership, a process that continued into the early 1970s, after Gomułka's departure. The prewar communist cadres were removed and people whose careers were formed in People's Poland took their place, which gave Gomułka's successor Edward Gierek one of the youngest in Europe elites of power early in his term.

The revisionist dissident prominence in the 1968 events overshadowed the equally significant awakening taking place among the working class of Poland. <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a>, where thousands of students and workers fought the police on March 15, had the highest in the country rate of administrative detentions and court cases. The greatest proportion of people arrested and imprisoned in March and April 1968 in Poland were classified by the authorities as "workers".

An internal attempt was made to discredit Gomułka's leadership, but there were aspects of the ongoing witch hunt which he found to be to his advantage and tolerated. In the meantime, irreversible damage to society had been wrecked by the Moczar movement. Gomułka's regime reasserted itself and was saved by a combination of international and domestic factors, including the Moczar faction's inability to take over the party and state apparatus. The Soviet Union, now led by <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a>, was preoccupied with the <a href="Prague%20Spring">crisis in Czechoslovakia</a> and not inclined to support personnel changes in the Polish leadership.

In August 1968, the <a href="Polish%20People%27s%20Army">Polish People's Army</a> took part in the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia">Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia</a>. Some Polish intellectuals protested, and <a href="Ryszard%20Siwiec">Ryszard Siwiec</a> burned himself alive during celebrations of an official holiday. The Polish participation in the crushing of the <a href="Prague%20Spring">Czech liberalization movement</a> (the crowning achievement of <a href="revisionism%20%28Marxism%29">Marxist revisionism</a>, according to David Ost) further alienated Gomułka from his former liberal supporters. But within the party, the opposition to Gomułka faded and the 5th Congress of the PZPR reconfirmed his rule in November. Brezhnev, who attended the gathering, used the occasion to expound his <a href="Brezhnev%20Doctrine">Brezhnev Doctrine</a>, a self-granted Soviet right to forcefully intervene if an allied state strays too far from the "fraternal course".

In December 1970, Gomułka's government scored a major political success when Poland obtained recognition by <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a> of <a href="Oder%E2%80%93Neisse%20line">post-World War II borders</a>. In the negotiations leading to the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Warsaw%20%281970%29">Treaty of Warsaw</a>, the German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for residents of Poland of German identity and the ability to help financially those who stayed in Poland by granting pensions. Hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany%20%281949%E2%80%93present%29">German Chancellor</a> <a href="Willy%20Brandt">Willy Brandt</a>, who signed the agreement, used the occasion to ask on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis ("<a href="Kniefall%20von%20Warschau">Kniefall von Warschau</a>"). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was made at the site of the <a href="Warsaw%20Ghetto">Warsaw Ghetto</a> and thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church leaders issued the <a href="Letter%20of%20Reconciliation%20of%20the%20Polish%20Bishops%20to%20the%20German%20Bishops">Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops</a>, criticized then by the Polish government.

Gomułka felt proud and secure after the treaty with West Germany, his milestone political achievement. It signified a lasting trend in Poland's international policy: extricating the country from the disproportional dependence on Russia and compensating the security vulnerability by building good relations with Germany.

But the event could not mask the economic crisis into which Poland was drifting. Although the system of fixed, artificially low food prices kept urban discontent under control, it caused economic strain. In the long run the situation was unsustainable, and on 12 December 1970 the regime unexpectedly announced substantial increases in the prices of basic foodstuffs. The new measures were incomprehensible to many workers, and their unfortunate timing (before Christmas, the most intense food purchase period for most Polish families) led to strong social reaction and ultimately Gomułka's fall from power.

On 14–19 December 1970, <a href="1970%20Polish%20protests">mass demonstrations</a> against the price rises broke out in the northern (<a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic</a> coast) cities of <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a>, <a href="Gdynia">Gdynia</a>, <a href="Elbl%C4%85g">Elbląg</a> and <a href="Szczecin">Szczecin</a>. In violent confrontations at those and other locations 19 public buildings were destroyed or damaged, including headquarters of the party in Gdańsk and Szczecin. The PZPR Central Committee was deliberating in Warsaw, but a smaller conference, led by Gomułka, issued an authorization for a limited use of lethal force to defend lives and property. Gomułka, however, was determined to impose a forceful resolution of the conflict. Among the party leaders who arrived on the coast and directed the local enforcement actions, initially in Gdańsk, were <a href="Zenon%20Kliszko">Zenon Kliszko</a> and <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Kocio%C5%82ek">Stanisław Kociołek</a>. In Gdynia, soldiers were instructed to prevent protesters from returning to factory buildings; they fired into a crowd of workers emerging from commuter trains. Fatal confrontations took place also in Szczecin. Possibly about fifty people were killed in the coastal region in December.

The protest movement spread to other cities, leading to more strikes and causing angry workers to occupy many factories. The general strike across Poland was scheduled for 21 December 1970.

The party leadership meeting in Warsaw on 20 December recognized the danger that the working class revolt presented to their system. In consultations with the disturbed Soviet leaders, they proceeded with arranging the resignation of Gomułka, who was by then stressed out and ill. Several of his collaborators were also removed. <a href="Edward%20Gierek">Edward Gierek</a> was drafted as the new first secretary. <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Moczar">Mieczysław Moczar</a>, another strong contender, was not trusted and even blamed for the current debacle by the Soviets.

Another strike in Szczecin broke out on 22 January 1971. Gierek gambled that his personal appearances would resolve the crisis. He went to Szczecin on 24 January and to Gdańsk the next day, met the workers, apologized for the past mistakes and assured them that as a former worker himself he understood their plight and would now govern Poland for the people. Participants of the Szczecin strike demanded freely elected worker councils and union representatives. Gierek consented, but in reality the authorities soon marginalized and eliminated the worker leaders from the legally existing labor structures and their places of employment. The February <a href="1971%20%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA%20strikes">1971 Łódź strikes</a> followed and concentrated on economic demands. Afterwards prices were lowered, wage increases announced, and sweeping economic and political changes promised.

The Polish opposition movement, traditionally led by the intelligentsia, after the two heavy blows of 1968 and 1970 was in disarray and silent. The revisionists' tenuous connection with the communist party was permanently broken, but a new strategy had not yet emerged. However, already in 1971 <a href="Leszek%20Ko%C5%82akowski">Leszek Kołakowski</a> published in the émigré "<a href="Kultura">Kultura</a>" journal a seminal article entitled "Theses on Hope and Hopelessness". It put forward a concept of civil democratizing resistance movement that would be valid even in the repressed and seemingly deadlocked <a href="state%20socialism">state socialist</a> society.

Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came to power on a raft of promises that everything would be different from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and those responsible for the violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He proceeded to create a new economic program, based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West, to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek years, was intended to be used for equipment and modernization of Polish industry, and for import of <a href="consumer%20goods">consumer goods</a> to give the workers more incentive to work.

For the next few years, the regime optimistically engaged in reform and experimentation and for the first time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and other luxury items. Attention was paid to the wages workers received. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. Censorship was eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were improved. The relative cultural and political relaxation resulted in a better <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly "<a href="Polityka">Polityka</a>". The massive investments and purchases of Western technology were expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.

This "New Development Strategy", based on import-led growth, depended on the global economic conditions and the program faltered suddenly because of worldwide recession and increased oil prices. The effects of the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973–74 oil crisis</a> produced an inflationary surge followed by a recession in the West, which resulted in a sharp increase in the price of imported consumer goods in Poland, coupled with a decline in demand for Polish exports, particularly <a href="coal">coal</a>. Poland's <a href="external%20debt">foreign debt</a>, absent at the time of Gomułka's departure, rose rapidly under Gierek to reach a multibillion-dollar figure. Continuing borrowing from the West had become increasingly difficult. Consumer goods began to disappear from Polish shops. The new factories built by Gierek's regime proved to be largely ineffective and mismanaged, as the basics of market <a href="demand">demand</a> and <a href="Cost-effectiveness%20analysis">cost effectiveness</a> were often ignored. The significant internal economic reform, promised by the Gierek team, had not materialized.

The Western credits thus helped spur industrial growth and helped Gierek's policy of <a href="consumerism">consumerism</a>, but just for a few years. The industrial production grew by an average of 10% per year between 1971 and 1975 (the years remembered later by many older Poles as most prosperous, considering not only the communist period in Poland), only to dwindle to less than 2% in 1979. <a href="Government%20debt">Debt servicing</a> that took 12% of export earnings in 1971, rose to 75% in 1979.

In 1975, like other European countries, Poland became a signatory of the <a href="Helsinki%20Accords">Helsinki Accords</a> and member of the <a href="Organization%20for%20Security%20and%20Co-operation%20in%20Europe">Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE); such developments were possible because of the period of "<a href="d%C3%A9tente">détente</a>" between the Soviet Union and the United States. Despite the regime's promises that the freedoms listed in the agreement would be implemented in Poland, there was little change. However, the Poles were becoming more aware of the rights they were being denied and emboldened by the knowledge of their government's treaty obligations.

Gierek government's growing difficulties led also to increased dependence on the Soviet Union, including tight economic cooperation and displays of submissiveness not seen under Gomułka's rule. The <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">constitution</a>, amended in February 1976, formalized the alliance with the Soviet Union and the leading role of the communist party. The language of the proposed changes was softened after <a href="Letter%20of%2059">protests by intellectuals</a> and the Church, but the regime felt it needed additional authority given the indebtedness to the West and the deepening economic crisis. The divisive issues raised helped to coalesce the emerging circles of active political opposition.

Nevertheless, the regime of Gierek deemphasized the Marxist ideology and from his time the "communist" governments of Poland concentrated on pragmatic issues and current concerns. In Polish economic politics new lasting trends were initiated, such as the emphasis on individual initiative, personal aspirations and competition, which some interpreted as an attack on <a href="egalitarianism">egalitarianism</a> (social inequalities were indeed increasing). Sections of the <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>, "<a href="nomenklatura">nomenklatura</a>" and <a href="small%20business">small business</a> gave rise to the emerging <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>. The new "socialist" ways were less totalitarian, stressed innovation, modern management methods and engaged workers, all seen as necessary to push the outdated economy past the constant crisis stage. Poland of the 1970s became more open to the world and entered the <a href="World%20economy">global economy</a>, which permanently changed society, creating at the same time a new type of crisis vulnerability. The opposition thinking, its promotion of society formed by active individuals, developed along complementary concepts.

As a result of the 1970 worker rebellion food prices remained frozen and were artificially low. The demand for food products exceeded the supply also because of the higher real wages, which already in the first two years of Gierek's government increased more than during the entire decade of the 1960s. In June 1976, in an attempt to reduce consumption, the government introduced a long-announced and several times delayed, but radical price increase: basic foodstuffs had their prices raised by an average of 60%, three times the rate of Gomułka'a increases from six years before. The compensatory wage rises were skewed toward the better-off part of the population. The result was an immediate <a href="June%201976%20protests">nationwide wave of strikes</a>, with violent demonstrations, looting and other labor unrest at the <a href="Ursus%20Factory">Ursus Factory</a> near Warsaw, in <a href="Radom">Radom</a>, <a href="P%C5%82ock">Płock</a> and other places. The government quickly backed down and repealed the price rises, but the strike leaders were arrested and put on trial. A series of "spontaneous" large scale public gatherings, intended to convey the "anger of the people" at the "trouble-makers" was staged by the party leadership in a number of cities, but the Soviet pressure prevented further attempts at raising prices. Gierek's cordial in the past relations with <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> were now seriously damaged. Food <a href="Ration%20stamp">ration cards</a>, introduced because of the destabilized market in August 1976, were to remain a feature of life in Poland for the duration of the People's Republic. The regime's retreat, having occurred for the second time in several years, amounted to an unprecedented defeat. Within the rigid political system, the government was neither able to reform (it would lose control and power) nor to satisfy society's staple needs, because it had to sell abroad all it could to make foreign debt and interests payments. The government was in a quandary, the population suffered from the lack of necessities, and organized opposition found room to expand and consolidate.

Because of the 1976 disturbances and the subsequent arrests, mistreatment and dismissals of worker militants, a group of intellectuals led by <a href="Jacek%20Kuro%C5%84">Jacek Kuroń</a>, <a href="Antoni%20Macierewicz">Antoni Macierewicz</a>, <a href="Jan%20J%C3%B3zef%20Lipski">Jan Józef Lipski</a> and <a href="Adam%20Michnik">Adam Michnik</a> founded and operated the <a href="Workers%27%20Defence%20Committee">Workers' Defence Committee</a> ("Komitet Obrony Robotników"; KOR). The aim of the KOR was to assist the worker victims of the 1976 repression. Working to support the spontaneous workers' movements, the dissidents recognized the necessarily predominant role of the working class in resisting the abuses of the regime. Accordingly, the newly formed opposition was increasingly characterized by an alliance of intelligentsia with workers. The KOR, according to Modzelewski, constituted the core of organized opposition and a seed of political alternative; clearing the way for other opposition formations, it engendered <a href="Pluralism%20%28political%20philosophy%29">political pluralism</a>. More opposition groups indeed soon followed, including the <a href="Movement%20for%20Defense%20of%20Human%20and%20Civic%20Rights">Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights</a> (ROPCiO), <a href="Free%20Trade%20Unions%20of%20the%20Coast">Free Trade Unions of the Coast</a> (WZZW) and the <a href="Confederation%20of%20Independent%20Poland">Confederation of Independent Poland</a> (KPN). The periodical "Robotnik" ('The Worker') was distributed in factories from September 1977. The idea of independent trade unions was first raised by the Gdańsk and Szczecin workers striking in 1970–71. Now it was developed and promoted by the KOR and its leftist collaborators, which led to the establishment in 1978 of Free Trade Unions, the precursor of <a href="Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29">Solidarity</a>. The KPN represented the minority <a href="right-wing%20politics">right-wing</a> of the Polish opposition scene at that time. The opposition members tried to resist the regime by denouncing it for violating the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">Constitution of the Polish People's Republic</a>, Polish laws and Poland's international obligations. They fit within the post-<a href="Helsinki%20Accords">Helsinki</a> Soviet Bloc human rights movements and for the most part had not yet developed more radical, anti-system orientations.

For the rest of the 1970s, resistance to the regime grew, assuming also the forms of student groups, <a href="Polish%20underground%20press%23Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">clandestine newspapers and publishers</a>, importing books and newspapers, and even a "<a href="Flying%20University">Flying University</a>". The regime practiced various forms of repression against the budding reform movements.

On 16 October 1978, Poland experienced what many Poles literally believed to be a miracle. Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, the <a href="archbishop%20of%20Krak%C3%B3w">archbishop of Kraków</a>, was elected <a href="pope">pope</a> at the Vatican, taking the name <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">John Paul II</a>. The election of a Polish pope had an electrifying effect on what was at that time one of the last idiosyncratically Catholic countries in Europe. When John Paul toured Poland in June 1979, half a million people came to welcome him in Warsaw; in the next eight days, about ten million Poles attended the many outdoor <a href="mass%20%28liturgy%29">masses</a> he celebrated. John Paul clearly became the most important person in Poland, leaving the regime not so much opposed as ignored. Rather than calling for rebellion, John Paul encouraged the creation of an "alternative Poland" of social institutions independent of the government, so that when the next crisis came, the nation would present a united front.

The <a href="Polish%20government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, unrecognized since the end of World War II, ridiculed by the communists, to many Poles was of great symbolic importance. Under President <a href="Edward%20Bernard%20Raczy%C5%84ski">Edward Bernard Raczyński</a> it overcame years of internal squabbles, and after the election of the Polish pope, at the time of the increasingly assertive Polish opposition, improved its image and standing.

The large Polish emigrant communities in North America, Western Europe and elsewhere were politically active and lent significant support to those struggling in the country. The staunchly anti-communist American "<a href="Polish%20diaspora">Polonia</a>" and other Poles felt grateful for the leadership of President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. Of the Polish institutions in the West the most important were the <a href="Radio%20Free%20Europe/Radio%20Liberty">Radio Free Europe</a>, whose Polish section was run by <a href="Jan%20Nowak-Jeziora%C5%84ski">Jan Nowak-Jeziorański</a>, and the monthly literary "<a href="Kultura">Kultura</a>" magazine in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, led by <a href="Jerzy%20Giedroyc">Jerzy Giedroyc</a> and <a href="Juliusz%20Mieroszewski">Juliusz Mieroszewski</a>.

By 1980, the authorities had no choice but to make another attempt to raise consumer prices to realistic levels, but they knew that doing so would likely spark another worker rebellion. Western bankers providing loans to the Polish government at a meeting at the <a href="Bank%20Handlowy">Bank Handlowy</a> in Warsaw on 1 July 1980 made it clear that the state could no longer subsidize artificially low prices of consumer goods. The government gave in and on 1 July announced a system of gradual but continuous price rises, particularly for meat. A wave of strikes and <a href="occupation%20of%20factories">factory occupations</a> began at once, with the biggest ones <a href="Lublin%201980%20strikes">taking place in Lublin</a> in July.

The strikes reached the politically sensitive <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a> coast, with a sit-down strike at the <a href="Gda%C5%84sk%20Shipyard">Lenin Shipyard</a> in <a href="Gda%C5%84sk">Gdańsk</a> beginning on 14 August. Among the leaders of the strike were <a href="Anna%20Walentynowicz">Anna Walentynowicz</a> and <a href="Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa">Lech Wałęsa</a>, a long-fired shipyard electrician who headed the strike committee. A list of <a href="21%20demands%20of%20MKS">21 demands</a> was formulated by the <a href="Inter-Enterprise%20Strike%20Committee">Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee</a> on 17 August. The strike wave spread along the coast, closing the ports and bringing the economy to a halt. With the assistance of activists from the <a href="Workers%27%20Defence%20Committee">KOR</a> and support of many other intellectuals (an Expert Commission was established to aid with the negotiations), the workers occupying the various factories, mines and shipyards across Poland organized as a united front. They were not limiting their efforts to seeking economic improvements, but made and stuck to the crucial demand, an establishment of <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>s independent of government control. Among other issues raised were rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners and an improved health service.

The party leadership was faced with a choice between repressions on a massive scale and an amicable agreement that would give the workers what they wanted and thus quieten the aroused population. They chose the latter. On 31 August Wałęsa signed the <a href="Gda%C5%84sk%20Agreement">Gdańsk Agreement</a> with <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Jagielski">Mieczysław Jagielski</a>, a member of the party <a href="Politburo">Politburo</a>. The agreement acknowledged the right of employees to associate in free trade unions, obliged the government to take steps to eliminate censorship, abolished weekend work, increased the <a href="minimum%20wage">minimum wage</a>, improved and extended welfare and pensions and increased autonomy of industrial enterprises, where a meaningful role was to be played by <a href="workers%27%20self-management">workers' self-management</a> councils. The rule of the party was significantly weakened (to a "leading role in the state", not society) but nonetheless explicitly recognized, together with Poland's international alliances. It was seen by the more moderate forces, including leading intelligentsia advisers and the Catholic hierarchy, as necessary to prevent a Soviet intervention. The opposition negotiators did not concern themselves with the issue of affordability of the economic concessions they obtained and a wave of national euphoria swept the country. In addition to the Gdańsk Agreement, similar documents were signed at other centers of strike activity: in Szczecin (the <a href="Szczecin%20Agreement">Szczecin Agreement</a>), <a href="Jastrz%C4%99bie-Zdr%C3%B3j%20strikes">Jastrzębie-Zdrój</a>, and at <a href="Katowice%20Steelworks">Katowice Steelworks</a>.

The Gdańsk Agreement, an aftermath of the August 1980 strike, was an important milestone. It led to a national gathering of independent union representatives (Interfactory Organizing Committees, MKZ) on 17 September in Gdańsk and the formation of the trade union "<a href="Solidarity%20%28Polish%20trade%20union%29">Solidarity</a>" (Polish "Solidarność"), founded on that day and led by Lech Wałęsa. The ideas of the independent union movement spread rapidly throughout Poland; Solidarity structures were formed in most places of employment and in all regions. Having been able to overcome the regime's efforts to thwart or derail its activities and status, Solidarity was finally registered in court as a national labor union in November. Early in 1981, a network of union organizations at the enterprise-level was established; it included the country's main industrial complexes, such as the <a href="Tadeusz%20Sendzimir%20Steelworks">Lenin Steelworks</a> in Kraków and the <a href="Upper%20Silesia">Silesian</a> mines.

Initially, in the KOR's tradition, Solidarity was an ostensibly non-political movement aiming at reconstruction of <a href="civil%20society">civil society</a>. Suddenly thrust into legal existence and prominence in 1980, Solidarity and the Polish opposition in general lacked a constructive program or consensus regarding further developments. In 1981, Solidarity accepted the necessity of assuming a political role and helped form a broad anti-<a href="real%20socialism">ruling system</a> social movement, dominated by the working class and with members ranging from <a href="Klub%20Inteligencji%20Katolickiej">people associated with the Catholic Church</a> to non-communist leftists. The union was backed by intellectual dissidents, including the KOR, and adhered to a policy of <a href="nonviolent%20resistance">nonviolent resistance</a>. According to Karol Modzelewski, the Solidarity of 1980–81 was permeated by the idea of brotherhood between intelligentsia and workers. In the areas of ideology and politics, Solidarity followed the lead of its associated opposition intellectuals.

The activity of Solidarity, although concerned with trade union matters (such as replacing the <a href="nomenklatura">nomenklatura</a>-run system with worker self-management in enterprise-level decision making), was widely regarded as the first step towards dismantling the regime's dominance over social institutions, professional organizations and community associations. Because of conditions specific to <a href="state%20socialism">state socialist</a> society, Solidarity soon lost its labor focus and became a <a href="universalism">universalist</a> movement that emphasized <a href="Civil%20and%20political%20rights">civic rights</a> and <a href="open%20society">open society</a>. Removing the ruling formation or breaking the dependence on the Soviet Union was not on the agenda. Using strikes and other tactics, the union sought to block government policies. The aims of the original, so-called First Solidarity (1980–81), were to reform socialism, not to introduce industrial private ownership or promote <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a> in general. Solidarity was an egalitarian and collectivist movement. It did not postulate any re-privatization of property taken over by the state after World War II or of rural possessions generated by the <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a>, as such concepts were beyond the <a href="Axiology">axiological</a> horizon of Polish society. Solidarity was socialist and <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a> was its goal. The First Solidarity upheaval could be viewed also as working people revolting against the emerging capitalist features of the economic order that diminished their role in Gierek-led society, combined with the "anti-politics" approach (building civil society "without reference to both state and market") embraced at that time by their allied intellectual leaders. People of decidedly anticommunist or anti-PZPR orientations constituted a relatively small minority within the First Solidarity organization, which accommodated one million communist party members among its ranks. Apart from workers, both individual farmers and students created their own independent organizations: <a href="Rural%20Solidarity">Rural Solidarity</a> and <a href="Independent%20Students%27%20Union">Independent Students' Union</a>. They were formally recognized by the authorities only after strike actions conducted by activists of both movements in January 1981.

In September 1980, in the aftermath of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Kania">Stanisław Kania</a>. Like his predecessors, Kania made promises that the regime could not fulfill because the authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. The <a href="gross%20national%20income">gross national income</a> fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8%, and in 1981 by 15–20%.

At the communist summit in December 1980 in <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a>, Kania argued with <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> and other <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> leaders, who pressed for an immediate military intervention in Poland. Kania and Minister of Defense <a href="Wojciech%20Jaruzelski">Wojciech Jaruzelski</a> declared their determination to fight the "counterrevolution" in Poland on their own. In regard to Solidarity, as they saw it, there was still a chance for its healthy, working class current to prevail, not the KOR-instigated anti-socialist, troublemaking elements. President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> and President-elect <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> made urgent phone calls to Brezhnev and the intervention was postponed. In the meantime Solidarity, not quite aware of the looming danger, did its <a href="revolution">revolution</a>ary work, practicing democracy in the union movement and pushing for sovereign society in a number of ways. The autonomous labor unions, united under the Solidarity banner, strove to "recapture public life from the monopoly control of the party". On 16 December 1980, the <a href="Monument%20to%20the%20Fallen%20Shipyard%20Workers%20of%201970">Monument to the Fallen Shipyard Workers of 1970</a> was officially unveiled in Gdańsk in a ceremony that marked the high point in the ascent of Solidarity.

Among the mass protests that occurred at that time were the winter <a href="1981%20general%20strike%20in%20Bielsko-Bia%C5%82a">1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała</a>, the <a href="1981%20warning%20strike%20in%20Poland">nationwide warning strike</a> in the spring of that year and <a href="Summer%201981%20hunger%20demonstrations%20in%20Poland">hunger demonstrations</a> in summer. The warning strike took place in the aftermath of the <a href="Bydgoszcz%20events">Bydgoszcz events</a> (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but the negotiators worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, but at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.

Minister Jaruzelski became also prime minister in February 1981. In June, the Soviet Central Committee pressured the Polish party for a leadership change, but Jaruzelski received strong support from the military members of the Polish Central Committee. The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR took place in July. Kania was reelected the party's first secretary, while the organization's internal reformers suffered a defeat.

As the economic situation kept deteriorating and the regime avoided implementation of the agreed reforms, the government and Solidarity representatives met in early August to discuss the outstanding issues. The talks ended in disagreement. During a conference of Solidarity's National Commission (a central representative policy making body) that followed, Modzelewski, Kuroń and others proposed a democratic transformation and practical arrangements by which the Union would take upon itself a major political role, participating in governing the country, accepting responsibility for the outcome and keeping social peace, thus relieving the ruling party of some of its burdens. Such a deal was seen as the only constructive way forward, but it would require government partners interested in a negotiated solution.

The existence of Solidarity and the political liberties that the movement brought paralyzed the authoritarian state and the state-controlled economy. Everyday life was becoming increasingly unbearable and the public displayed sentiments of extreme volatility. The hostility of the "nomenklatura" toward Solidarity was rapidly increasing.

At the State Defense Committee meeting on 13 September (the time of the Soviet <a href="Exercise%20Zapad-81">Exercise Zapad-81</a> maneuvers and of renewed pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must be terminated by an imposition of <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>. The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.

In September and October, the <a href="History%20of%20Solidarity">First Congress of Solidarity</a> deliberated in Gdańsk. Wałęsa faced activist opposition and was barely elected chairman of the organization. The delegates passed a radical reform program in which the world "social" or "socialized" was repeated 150 times. The congress issued a provocative call for workers in other East European countries, urging them to follow in Solidarity's footsteps. Locally authorized, increasingly "political" strikes continued. They were characterized as "<a href="Wildcat%20strike%20action">wildcats</a>" by Wałęsa, who desperately tried to impose discipline from the center. He attempted to reach an accord with the state, meeting General Jaruzelski and Catholic Primate <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Glemp">Józef Glemp</a> on 4 November. At the time of the regime's re-energized efforts to reduce Solidarity's role, the union had nearly ten million members — almost four times as many as the ruling party. Militant mood was displayed and unrealistic demands made at the meeting of the partially represented National Commission on 3 December, but the proceedings were wiretapped by the authorities, who then broadcast the (previously manipulated to their advantage) recordings.

The government, not consulting Solidarity, adopted a plan of economic measures that could be implemented only by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition of martial law that followed.

On 13 December 1981, claiming that the country was on the verge of economic and civil breakdown and <a href="Soviet%20reaction%20to%20the%20Polish%20crisis%20of%201980%E2%80%931981">alleging a danger of Soviet intervention</a>, General <a href="Wojciech%20Jaruzelski">Wojciech Jaruzelski</a> began a crack-down on Solidarity. <a href="martial%20law%20in%20Poland">Martial law was declared</a>, the free labor union was suspended and most of its leaders detained. Several thousand citizens were interned or imprisoned and much larger numbers were subjected to various forms of harassment. Polish state militia ("<a href="Milicja%20Obywatelska">Milicja Obywatelska</a>", the police) and paramilitary riot police <a href="ZOMO">ZOMO</a> suppressed the strike action and demonstrations. Military forces entered industrial enterprises to clamp down on the independent union movement. A series of violent attacks included the <a href="pacification%20of%20Wujek">pacification of Wujek Coal Mine</a> during which 9 people were killed. The martial law offensive was directed primarily against workers and their union; the workers, rather than intelligentsia activists, were the object of the most brutal treatment. The authorities ultimately succeeded in imposing on members of Solidarity an individual and collective trauma, from which the broken mass movement would not be able to recover. The Catholic Church strove to exert a moderating influence on Solidarity before and after the martial law.

Initially, the regime leadership intended to remold Solidarity into a compliant union, stripped of its intelligentsia advisers and compatible with the state socialist system. The failure to incite most ranking Solidarity leaders to collaborate, especially Wałęsa's refusal to extend any such cooperation, resulted in the government adopting the goal of total liquidation of the union movement.

Strikes and protests followed, but were not nearly as widespread as those of August 1980. The <a href="1982%20demonstrations%20in%20Poland">last mass street demonstrations</a> that Solidarity was able to muster occurred on 31 August 1982, the second anniversary of the Gdańsk agreements. The "<a href="Military%20Council%20of%20National%20Salvation">Military Council of National Salvation</a>" banned Solidarity officially on 8 October. Martial law was formally lifted in July 1983, though many heightened controls on civil liberties and political life, as well as food rationing, remained in place throughout the mid-to-late 1980s. With all the restrictions, however, "the official cultural realm remained far more open than it was prior to 1980" and "cultural policy continued to be the most open in all of Eastern Europe". Among the concessions in the <a href="civil%20and%20political%20rights">civil and political rights</a> area granted by the troubled regime were the establishment of the <a href="Constitutional%20Tribunal%20%28Poland%29">Constitutional Tribunal</a> in 1982 and of the <a href="Polish%20Ombudsman">Polish Ombudsman</a> office in 1987.

In the mid-1980s and even as late as 1987, Solidarity was seen by many, including most of its activists, as likely a thing of the past. It persisted solely as a rather small underground organization, supported by various international institutions, from the Catholic Church to the <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a>. When most senior Solidarity figures were interned or otherwise neutralized by the authorities, <a href="Zbigniew%20Bujak">Zbigniew Bujak</a>, head of the union's Warsaw branch, remained in hiding and was the leader of the clandestine organization until his arrest in 1986. But the post-martial law general public showed signs of tiredness and disappointment, as it had become apparent that Solidarity was not a united front.

During the chaotic years of Solidarity and martial law, Poland entered a decade of economic crisis more pronounced than in Gierek's years. Work on the major unfinished projects that had begun in the 1970s drained the available investment outlays, little money was left for replacing obsolete production equipment and the manufactured goods were not competitive on the world market. Managerial ineffectiveness, bad organization of production and shortages of inputs and raw materials were among the factors that contributed to further deterioration of workers' morale. 640,000 people of productive age left the country between 1981 and 1988.

Throughout their existence, the governments functioning under General Jaruzelski's leadership (1981–1989) engaged in <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a> reforms aimed at improving economic performance by eliminating central planning, reducing central bureaucracy, introducing self-management and self-financing of state enterprises and allowing self-government by employee councils. The reform's effects were positive but limited (the process vastly increased general economic literacy and some of its accomplishments were later claimed by Solidarity governments as their own), because enterprises' self-rule had to compete with the traditional party interference, the authorities shied from subjecting the population to hardships, and Western governments and institutions showed no interest in supporting what was perceived as reform of a communist regime. The government allowed more small-scale private enterprises to function, departing further from the 'socialist' model of economy. Ideological considerations were abandoned and priority was given to pragmatic issues and moves. Searching for ways to improve the economy and conscious of its alienation from the industrial working class, the regime turned toward <a href="free%20market">market</a> reforms with an increasingly significant from the mid-1980s elite-oriented <a href="Economic%20liberalism">liberal</a> component. <a href="Marketization">Marketization</a>, formalized by a 1988 statute on economic activity, was a process that would continue past the mid-1990s. <a href="Neoliberalism">Neoliberal</a> processes may have been initiated by Deputy Prime Minister Zdzisław Sadowski and the government of <a href="Zbigniew%20Messner">Zbigniew Messner</a>, then developed further under Minister <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Wilczek">Mieczysław Wilczek</a> (author of the statute) and the government of <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Rakowski">Mieczysław Rakowski</a>. "<a href="Market%20socialism">Market socialism</a>" was introduced as the regime leaders lost their faith in the socialist system and even "nomenklatura" managers were threatened by the declining economy. The enterprises were to be made independent, self-financing and self-managed, which included workers' councils that were resistant to restructuring. Owners of private businesses did well in the final years of the People's Republic and the number of such entities increased. Foreign investment was also encouraged, but limited marketization failed to deliver an economic turnaround. The practice of centralized economic decision making had not been overcome, while the newly autonomous enterprises moved toward a rather spontaneous and chaotic partial <a href="privatization">privatization</a> of dubious legality; it included elements of <a href="kleptocracy">kleptocracy</a> and had a significant middle-level "nomenklatura" component. On a more basic level, countless ordinary Poles took advantage of the changing attitudes and became involved in a great variety of income-producing activities.

The deepening economic crisis caused a marked deterioration in quality of life of ordinary citizens and resulted in increasing political instability. Rationing and queuing became a way of life, with <a href="Ration%20stamp">ration card</a>s ("kartki") necessary to buy consumer staples. The ration cards were utilized by the government in order to avoid allowing market regulation of income and prices and thus risking social unrest. As Western institutions were no longer willing to extend credit to the "de facto" bankrupt Polish government, access to goods that the Poles needed became even more restricted. Most of the scarce resources of Western currency available had to be used to pay the crushing rates on Poland's foreign debt, which reached US$27 billion by 1980 and US$45 billion in 1989. The government, which controlled all official foreign trade, responded by maintaining a highly artificial exchange rate with Western currencies. The exchange rate worsened distortions in the economy at all levels, resulting in a growing <a href="black%20market">black market</a> and the development of <a href="shortage%20economy">shortage economy</a>. The omnipresent and destructive underground economy was characterized by such phenomena as bribery, waiting lists, speculation, direct exchanges between enterprises and large percentages of personal incomes deriving from secondary activities. Societal degradation was accompanied by unprecedented deterioration of biological environment and physical and mental health; mortality rates kept increasing. In the late 1980s, the PZPR feared another social explosion because of high inflation, depressed living standards and deepening public anger and frustration. The authorities themselves, facing an increasingly disorderly and unmanageable system, felt perplexed and powerless.

In September 1986, the government declared a general amnesty and began work on a number of meaningful reforms. Given the liberalized political environment, Wałęsa was urged to reconvene the National Commission from the time of the First Solidarity, but he refused, preferring to deal with the circle of Solidarity's Expert Commission advisers. A National Executive Commission, led by Wałęsa, was openly established in October 1987. Other opposition structures such as the <a href="Fighting%20Solidarity">Fighting Solidarity</a>, the <a href="Federation%20of%20Fighting%20Youth">Federation of Fighting Youth</a>, the Freedom and Peace Movement ("Ruch Wolność i Pokój") and the <a href="Orange%20Alternative">Orange Alternative</a> "dwarf" movement founded by <a href="Major%20Waldemar%20Fydrych">Major Waldemar Fydrych</a> began organizing street protests in form of colorful happenings that assembled thousands of participants. The liberal periodical "Res Publica" negotiated with the authorities its officially published release.

In the <a href="1987%20Polish%20political%20and%20economic%20reforms%20referendum">1987 Polish political and economic reforms referendum</a>, 67% of the eligible voters participated and most of them approved the government-proposed reforms, but a popular mandate was formally missed because of the unrealistically stringent passage requirements self-imposed by the regime. The referendum debacle dealt a blow to the process of market-oriented economic reforms, which had been sought by Polish governments since the early 1980s.

The ruling communist/military establishment slowly and gradually came to realize that a deal of some sort with the opposition would eventually be necessary and would have to include the leading Solidarity figures. Solidarity as such, a labor union representing workers' interests, was unable to reassert itself after the martial law and later in the 1980s was practically destroyed, but preserved in the national consciousness as a myth that facilitated social acceptance of systemic changes previously deemed unthinkable. The Solidarity organization as a mass movement, and with it its dominant <a href="social%20democracy">social democratic</a> element (supporters of <a href="democratic%20socialism">democratic socialism</a>), had been defeated. Solidarity's name had continuously been used, but the opposition movement split to form rival groups of different political orientations. According to a new intellectual consensus, "democracy was grounded not in an active citizenry, as had been argued from the mid-1970s through 1981, but in private property and a free market". The current view no longer entailed broad political participation, emphasizing instead elite leadership and a capitalist economy. Solidarity became a symbolic entity, its activists openly assumed ideological "anti-communist" positions and its leadership moved to the <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right</a>. The historic mass movement was now represented by a small number of individuals, of whom <a href="Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa">Lech Wałęsa</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20Mazowiecki">Tadeusz Mazowiecki</a> and <a href="Leszek%20Balcerowicz">Leszek Balcerowicz</a> were about to assume particularly decisive roles. They were proponents of unfettered <a href="free%20market">free market</a>, strongly influenced by the American and West European financial and other interests.

Jaruzelski's Poland depended on low-cost deliveries of industrial staple commodities from the Soviet Union and meaningful Polish reforms, economic or political, were not feasible during the rule of the last three conservative Soviet <a href="General%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">general secretaries</a>. The <a href="perestroika">perestroika</a> and <a href="glasnost">glasnost</a> policies of the Soviet Union's new leader, <a href="Mikhail%20Gorbachev">Mikhail Gorbachev</a>, were therefore a crucial factor in stimulating reform in Poland. Gorbachev essentially repudiated the <a href="Brezhnev%20Doctrine">Brezhnev Doctrine</a>, which had stipulated that attempts by its Eastern European <a href="satellite%20state">satellite state</a>s to abandon the communist bloc would be countered by the Soviet Union with force. The developments in the Soviet Union altered the international situation and provided a historic opportunity for independent reforms in Poland. The hardline stance of US President <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> was also helpful. David Ost stressed the constructive influence of Gorbachev. With his support for Polish and Hungarian membership in the <a href="World%20Bank">World Bank</a> and the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a> and for the Eastern European pluralistic evolution in general, the Soviet leader effectively pushed the region toward the West.

<a href="1988%20Polish%20strikes">Nationwide strikes</a> broke out in the spring and summer of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were discontinued after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the economic restructuring that was in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.

Both sides having been prompted by the new international situation and the recent strike wave in Poland, in September 1988 preliminary talks between government representatives and Solidarity leaders ensued in <a href="Magdalenka%2C%20Masovian%20Voivodeship">Magdalenka</a>. Numerous meetings took place involving Wałęsa and the minister of internal affairs, General <a href="Czes%C5%82aw%20Kiszczak">Czesław Kiszczak</a> among others, at that time and in the following year, behind the scenes of the official negotiations conducted then. In November, Wałęsa debated on national TV <a href="Alfred%20Miodowicz">Alfred Miodowicz</a>, chief of the <a href="All-Poland%20Alliance%20of%20Trade%20Unions">official trade unions</a>. The encounter enhanced Wałęsa's image.

During the PZPR's plenary session of 16–18 January 1989, General Jaruzelski and his ruling formation overcame the Central Committee's resistance by threatening to resign and the party decided to allow re-legalization of Solidarity and to approach its leaders for formal talks. From 6 February to 4 April, 94 sessions of negotiations between 13 working groups, which became known as the "<a href="Polish%20Round%20Table%20Agreement">Round Table Talks</a>" (Polish: "Rozmowy Okrągłego Stołu"), resulted in political and economic compromise reforms. Jaruzelski, Prime Minister <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Rakowski">Mieczysław Rakowski</a> and Wałęsa did not directly participate in the negotiations. The government side was represented by Czesław Kiszczak, <a href="Aleksander%20Kwa%C5%9Bniewski">Aleksander Kwaśniewski</a>, Janusz Reykowski and Stanisław Ciosek, the Solidarity opposition by <a href="Adam%20Michnik">Adam Michnik</a>, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Geremek">Bronisław Geremek</a>, <a href="Jacek%20Kuro%C5%84">Jacek Kuroń</a>, <a href="Zbigniew%20Bujak">Zbigniew Bujak</a>, <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Frasyniuk">Władysław Frasyniuk</a> and <a href="Jaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski">Jarosław Kaczyński</a>, among others. The talks resulted in the <a href="Polish%20Round%20Table%20Agreement">Round Table Agreement</a>, by which political power was to be vested in a newly created <a href="bicameralism">bicameral legislature</a> and in a <a href="President%20of%20Poland">president</a>, who would be the chief executive.

By 4 April 1989, numerous reforms and freedoms for the opposition were agreed. Solidarity, now in existence as the <a href="Solidarity%20Citizens%27%20Committee">Solidarity Citizens' Committee</a>, was to be legalized again as a trade union and allowed to participate in <a href="1989%20Polish%20legislative%20election">semi-free elections</a>. This election had restrictions imposed, designed to keep the PZPR in power, since only 35% of the seats in the "<a href="Sejm">Sejm</a>", the key lower chamber of parliament, would be open to Solidarity candidates. The remaining 65% were to be reserved for candidates from the PZPR and its allies (the <a href="United%20People%27s%20Party%20%28Poland%29">United People's Party</a>, the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Democrats%20%28Poland%29">Alliance of Democrats</a> and the <a href="PAX%20Association">PAX Association</a>). Since the Round Table Agreement mandated only reform (not replacement) of "<a href="real%20socialism">real socialism</a>" in Poland, the party thought of the election as a way of neutralizing political conflict and staying in power, while gaining some legitimacy to carry out economic reforms. However, the negotiated social policies, arrived at by economists and trade unionists during the Round Table talks, were quickly tossed out by both the party and the opposition.

A systemic transformation happening sooner rather than later was made possible by the <a href="1989%20Polish%20legislative%20election">Polish legislative elections</a> of 4 June 1989, which coincided with the bloody crackdown on the <a href="1989%20Tiananmen%20Square%20protests">Tiananmen Square protests</a> in <a href="China">China</a>. When the results of the voting were released, a political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity (caused in part by the <a href="electoral%20system">electoral system</a> that favored the opposition as far as the contested seats were concerned, but was permitted by the government nevertheless) surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the "Sejm", while in the newly established <a href="Senate%20of%20Poland">Senate</a> they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats. At the same time, many prominent PZPR candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them. The PZPR-led coalition suffered a catastrophic blow to its legitimacy.

The next few months were spent on political maneuvering. The increasingly insecure communists, who still had military and administrative control over the country, were appeased by a compromise in which Solidarity allowed General Jaruzelski to remain head of state. On 19 July 1989 Jaruzelski barely won the vote in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Poland%23National%20Assembly">National Assembly</a> <a href="1989%20Polish%20presidential%20election">presidential election</a>, even though his name was the only one on the ballot. He won through an informally arranged abstention by a sufficient number of Solidarity MPs and his position was not strong. Jaruzelski resigned as first secretary of the PZPR on 29 July.

The Round Table deal basically allowed the PZPR to remain in power regardless of the election results, and the party's reshuffled leadership continued to rule. On 1 August, prices were freed because of the ongoing market reforms and <a href="hyperinflation">hyperinflation</a> resulted. The instantly increased economic hardship caused a new wave of strikes. The strikes were spontaneous, but the Solidarity leaders, no longer in agreement with the strikers' economic demands, were able to emphasize the secondary political aspect of the strikes (anger at the party's obstinacy) and use them to pressure the regime for an expedited transfer of power. The new prime minister, General Kiszczak, who was appointed on 2 August 1989, failed to gain enough support in the "Sejm" to form a government and resigned on 19 August. He was the last communist head of government in Poland. Although Jaruzelski tried to persuade Solidarity to join the PZPR in a "grand coalition", Wałęsa refused. The two formerly subservient parties allied with the PZPR, prompted by the current strike pressure, were moving toward adopting independent courses and their added votes would give the opposition control of parliament. Under the circumstances, Jaruzelski had to come to terms with the prospect of new government being formed by political opposition. Solidarity elected representative Tadeusz Mazowiecki was appointed prime minister and confirmed by the assembly on 24 August 1989. The new government led by a non-communist, the first of its kind in the Soviet Bloc, was sworn into office on 13 September. The PZPR did not immediately relinquish all power, remaining in the coalition and retaining control of the ministries of foreign trade, defense, interior and transport.

Mazowiecki's government, forced to deal quickly with galloping hyperinflation, soon adopted <a href="Balcerowicz%20Plan">radical economic policies</a>, proposed by Leszek Balcerowicz, which transformed Poland into a functioning <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a> under an accelerated schedule. Many Polish <a href="state-owned%20enterprise">state-owned enterprise</a>s, undergoing <a href="privatization">privatization</a>, turned out to be woefully unprepared for capitalist competition and the pace of their accommodation (or attrition) was rapid. The economic reform, a <a href="Shock%20therapy%20%28economics%29">shock therapy</a> accompanied by comprehensive <a href="neoliberalism">neoliberal</a> restructuring, was in reality an extension of the previous incremental "communist" policies of the 1970s and 1980s, which were now followed by a leap to greatly expanded integration with the <a href="world%20economy">global economy</a> with little protection. Among the reform's negative immediate effects were the economic <a href="recession">recession</a> and near-paralysis of foreign trade. On longer-term bases, the country experienced quickly rising unemployment and social inequities, as enterprises were liquidated and income was redistributed away from workers and farmers, in favor of the establishment and the entrepreneurial class. A <a href="Deindustrialisation%20by%20country%23Poland">collapse of Polish industry</a> was among the detrimental consequences of fundamental and lasting importance. Labor unions underwent further marginalization; Solidarity activity as a labor union, prioritized in the past, was now suppressed. On the positive side, the market price-income reform balanced the economy and brought inflation under control, the currency stabilized, shortages were eliminated and significant foreign investment began. The shock therapy solutions were often dictated by Western consultants, of whom <a href="Jeffrey%20Sachs">Jeffrey Sachs</a> was best known but also most criticized.

The striking electoral victory of Solidarity candidates in the limited elections, and the subsequent formation of the first non-communist government in the region in decades, encouraged many similar peaceful transitions from communist party rule in <a href="Central%20Europe">Central</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> in the second half of 1989.

In December 1989, changes to the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20Polish%20People%27s%20Republic">Polish constitution</a> were made, officially eliminating the "socialist" order: Marxist references were removed and the name of the country was changed back to the Polish Republic.

Wałęsa, president of the Solidarity trade union, demanded early presidential elections. He was acting against the advice of his traditional Solidarity allies, intellectuals who were now running the government. Under pressure from the continuing worker unrest, Wałęsa declared himself a supporter of workers' interests, allegedly threatened by those whom he identified as communists (such as President Jaruzelski), or elitist political liberals (such as Prime Minister Mazowiecki). Wałęsa presented himself as a person of good conservative, Christian and nationalist credentials.

In 1990, Jaruzelski resigned as Poland's president and was succeeded by Wałęsa, who won the <a href="1990%20Polish%20presidential%20election">1990 presidential election</a>. Lech Wałęsa's inauguration as president took place on 22 December 1990. He distanced himself from Wojciech Jaruzelski by accepted the <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">prewar</a> presidential insignia from President-in-Exile <a href="Ryszard%20Kaczorowski">Ryszard Kaczorowski</a>, who was stepping down. Wałęsa defeated Mazowiecki and in the second round <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Tymi%C5%84ski">Stanisław Tymiński</a>, but under his presidency economic policy remained unchanged.

The historically communist <a href="Polish%20United%20Workers%27%20Party">Polish United Workers' Party</a> dissolved itself in 1990 and transformed into the <a href="Social%20Democracy%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Poland">Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland</a>. The <a href="German%E2%80%93Polish%20Border%20Treaty">German–Polish Border Treaty</a>, signed in November 1990, resolved the sensitive for Prime Minister Mazowiecki and his government issue of recognition of Poland's western border by <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, after the country's <a href="unification%20of%20Germany">unification</a>. The <a href="Warsaw%20Pact">Warsaw Pact</a> was formally dissolved on 1 July 1991; the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991 and the last <a href="Northern%20Group%20of%20Forces">post-Soviet troops</a> left Poland in September 1993. On 27 October 1991, the first (since the 1920s) entirely free <a href="1991%20Polish%20parliamentary%20election">Polish parliamentary election</a> took place. This completed Poland's transition from a communist party rule to a Western-style <a href="Parliamentary%20system">liberal democratic political system</a>.


"a."The troops were brought in by Minister of Defense <a href="Konstantin%20Rokossovsky">Konstantin Rokossovsky</a>. Rokossovsky obtained permission from First Secretary <a href="Edward%20Ochab">Edward Ochab</a>, who shared his assessment of the situation: a widespread counterrevolutionary activity that the <a href="Milicja%20Obywatelska">militia</a> and the security forces might be unable to contain.

"b."As characterized by Jane Hardy, (1956 events were) "...the first cycle of a pattern that would re-emerge with increasing severity over the following decades. A slowdown in the ability of the economy to deliver rising standards of living, followed by revolts triggered by price increases, led to reforms based on decentralisation and worker self-management. Recentralisation, repression and reform followed in its wake." To "...a decline in the rate of economic growth and...a fall in real average wages...the ruling class would react by introducing more control in enterprises, a higher turnover of managerial and political cadres, intensified propaganda against ideological revisionism, the suspension of certain investment projects and the reallocation of investment favouring the consumption goods sector and services." But from the late 1960s, "a policy of extensive growth could no longer deliver positive rates of growth and increasing standards of living."

"c."Mazowiecki and Balcerowicz had a vastly greater freedom of economic action than their predecessors, because neither Gierek nor Jaruzelski could consider triggering high unemployment (it would violate the symbolic legitimation of workers as the ruling class). The Western economies responded to crisis situations from the 1970s onward by utilizing the existing free market flexibilities (deregulation, downsizing, anti-trade union legislation, moving cheap manufacturing to the <a href="Third%20World">Third World</a> countries etc.) ever more easily under the newly dominant <a href="neoliberalism">neoliberal</a> policies. Such remedies were not available before 1989 for the ruling establishments in Central and Eastern Europe.

"d."<a href="Karol%20Modzelewski">Karol Modzelewski</a> wrote the following on the controversial issue of popular support for communist reforms in Stalinist Poland:

"...the extent of social support for the communist power and its undertakings was considerable. Especially as it regards the rebuilding and industrialization of the country, which before the war belonged to the European underdeveloped zone, widespread dissemination of education and the availability of higher education for the youth from peasant and worker families. The mass social advancement related to such transformations naturally affected the attitudes of millions of people, especially the young, for whom People's Poland opened the previously unavailable opportunities."

Modzelewski qualified this view by stressing the greatly limited access to impartial information. Society was intensely indoctrinated at the official level, while families at home, to protect their youth, refrained from criticizing the regime or discussing issues that were deemed not safe.

"e." Maciej Gdula summarized Solidarity's demise and its subsequent mythologizing as follows:

"Solidarity was put in a golden sarcophagus and turned into a myth, which was supposed to legitimize the change of 1989. But the movement at that time was dead: it was falling apart already in 1981 and it was finished off by the martial law. However, it was precisely this external termination that opened the possibility of its rebirth as a myth."

"...the new order was legitimized to a great extent by the myth of Solidarity. The time between the martial law and the <a href="Polish%20Round%20Table%20Agreement">Round Table</a> had to be compressed to make an impression of continuity. There was a moment of lapse, the story went, but then society woke up again and reclaimed power."

"f." The Balcerowicz Plan enjoyed a consensus of opinion of Polish legislators, who supported it across the political spectrum, together with President Jaruzelski. However, <a href="Michael%20Bruno">Michael Bruno</a>, chief of advisers of the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">International Monetary Fund</a>, was surprised when Mazowiecki's government chose the harshest of the transformation plans presented by the fund. Jane Hardy argued that "a particularly pernicious ideologically reactionary variant of neoliberalism" had been produced in Poland. <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> and <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> did not opt for a radical liberal changeover and their systemic conversions resulted in lower than in Poland levels of social inequalities.

According to the economist Zdzisław Sadowski, the Poles were generally euphoric about the end of the era of communist rule and Soviet domination. Because of the belief that the Balcerowicz Plan would quickly result in universal Western-like prosperity, the plan enjoyed broad social support, which would cause any conceivable competing pursuits of more moderate economic policies to be politically unrealistic.
According to Rafał Woś, "...Poland was a <a href="periphery%20countries">peripheral country</a>, it moved from one relationship of dependence to another, was in a very weak position. The international financial institutions treated our elites like children, not partners. ... But even then, there was some room for maneuver."

"g." Among the critics of the prevailing <a href="Right-wing%20politics">right wing</a> ideology and practice of the Polish transformation were <a href="Karol%20Modzelewski">Karol Modzelewski</a> and <a href="Tadeusz%20Kowalik">Tadeusz Kowalik</a>. Other "prescient voices" listed by David Ost were <a href="Ryszard%20Bugaj">Ryszard Bugaj</a>, Barbara Labuda, Włodzimierz Pankow and <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Pinior">Józef Pinior</a>. The Solidarity Working Group, led by <a href="Andrzej%20Gwiazda">Andrzej Gwiazda</a>, <a href="Marian%20Jurczyk">Marian Jurczyk</a> and <a href="Jan%20Rulewski">Jan Rulewski</a>, was opposed in 1989 to the course adopted by the PZPR-Solidarity negotiators.

"h." Employee councils that Solidarity managed to push through survived the martial law and the 1980s, only to be eliminated by <a href="Leszek%20Balcerowicz">Leszek Balcerowicz</a>.

"i." The historian Andrzej Leon Sowa characterized the outcome of the Polish transition as follows: "Part of the <a href="nomenklatura">nomenklatura</a>, combined with the elites originating from the opposition (intelligentsia and middle bureaucracy, forming the new but engendered by the previous system urban class), became the beneficiaries of the system that developed over the ruins of People's Poland. As a whole, however, both the PZPR and the worker in its bulk Solidarity lost. The only organization ... strengthened in every respect is the institutional Roman Catholic Church." According to the journalist Kaja Puto, the <a href="2015%20Polish%20parliamentary%20election">2015 Polish parliamentary election</a> marked Poland's rejection of the myth of successful transformation and the end of the Polish post-communist period. Karol Modzelewski sees the 2015 elections and their outcome as a path to collapse of Polish democracy and direct consequence of the faulty systemic transformation, beginning with the destruction of <a href="state%20socialism">socialist</a> industry. The transformation's victims and their descendants have experienced lasting social degradation and became disheartened adversaries of the post-1989 liberal democracy, which failed them and which (in 2015) may have ended.

"j." The name "Solidarność" (Solidarity) was proposed by Karol Modzelewski, who also insisted on and pushed through the formation of a single countrywide union. The Expert Commission of the <a href="Inter-Enterprise%20Strike%20Committee">Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee</a> thought the idea was unrealistic and planned only to register a number of regional unions. The movement remained significantly decentralized though, with local branches enjoying considerable autonomy.

"k." Uniquely in the Soviet camp, from 1956 Polish institutions of higher learning enjoyed considerable autonomy. Statutory elimination of academic self-rule and existing protections in the area of intellectual freedom was carried out by the authorities following the 1968 unrest.

"l." The processes of the Polish transformation resulted in a considerable loss of economic potential and people who depended on such potential were deprived of means to support their existence. <a href="Gross%20national%20income">Gross national income</a> dropped by over 18% within two years, which in Poland amounted to a deepest <a href="recession">recession</a> since the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> crisis of 1929–33. The ideologically motivated, frenetic <a href="privatization">privatization</a>, a sell out of best state enterprises for a fraction of their worth, was called by Aleksander Małachowski a "reform by ruin". According to Karol Modzelewski (2013), the psychological, cultural and political consequences of the social degradation experienced still burden everyday life of the Poles and threaten the regained freedom. The trauma of the great transformation has been exploited by right-wing <a href="populism">populists</a>. David Ost wrote the following (2016), referring to the "post-communist" <a href="Democratic%20Left%20Alliance">Democratic Left Alliance</a>, its ascent to power and its decline in 1993–1997 and 2001–2005: "Twice before <a href="Law%20and%20Justice">PiS</a> first came to power, parties aligned with the liberal left secured strong labor support. But by insisting on marketization, privatization and participation (as a <a href="periphery%20countries">peripheral</a> player) in the global capitalist economy, and disparaging demands for more security, they soon squandered that support, and ended up driving regular workers into the arms of PiS." Then in 2007–2015, "market liberals of <a href="Civic%20Platform">Civic Platform</a> ... pursued a pragmatic politics of adapting to the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> ... while suicidally pursuing a hard agenda against workers." Economic insecurity having fueled the rise of the Right as elsewhere in Europe, "<a href="Jaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski">Kaczyński</a> won in 2015 by focusing on economic issues" and because of PiS' "promise of economic security".

"m." Drastic cuts were implemented in <a href="Progressive%20tax">progressive taxation</a> and public spending, including on <a href="welfare">welfare</a>. Income and wealth were massively redistributed toward a small number of people at the top at the price of impoverishment of a large number at the bottom. The unemployment had reached an all-time high of 20% by the end of 2003, just before the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> membership came to the rescue. As a result of high unemployment, it took at least a decade for the average real pay to reach the level from before 1989 and joining the Union triggered the greatest peacetime wave of permanent economic migration out of the country. The reforms undertaken by the Polish elites were of an overwhelmingly economic character. Their socially detrimental consequences included the lasting political polarization over the practically limited range of choices: economic liberalism lacking any communal concerns on the one hand, and the conservative, patriarchal and parochial backwaters of Polish nationalism on the other.

"n."Polish intellectuals and leaders of the 1980s were affected by the shifted economic and political thinking in the West, now dominated by the <a href="neoliberalism">neoliberal</a> and <a href="neoconservatism">neoconservative</a> policies of <a href="Friedrich%20Hayek">Friedrich Hayek</a>, <a href="Milton%20Friedman">Milton Friedman</a>, <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>.

"o."Sixty percent of the Polish workforce were manual laborers (skilled and unskilled) or farm workers. They had become passive objects in the systemic transition processes, but provided the votes needed by the Solidarity intelligentsia elite in order to achieve its domination and implement the changes that the leaders intended.

"p."In 1980, according to David Ost, "intellectuals first proclaimed an inseparable "connection" of labor and democracy, thus establishing the claim they would spend most of the rest of the decade trying to dismantle". Later in the 1980s and in the 1990s workers will be defined by intellectuals as irrational, misguided and even dangerous, because of their "illegitimate" opposition to the "necessary", "correct" and "rational" economic policies, pursued especially by the new post-1989 liberal establishment and couched by it in the absolute language of science, not in relative terms of a political debate. Ost concludes that the liberals "got it wrong" and made "their fatal error": they drove the critics of their reform toward an ideological and intolerant <a href="right-wing%20politics">Right</a>. The abandonment, rejection and exclusion would thus push many workers, labor activists and others into right-wing <a href="populism">populism</a> and religious nationalism (the marginalized in 1989 but later resurgent illiberal camp), while the liberal elite would pay with a steady erosion of its authority. The liberals' approach revealed "a fundamental misunderstanding of what democracy is and how best to consolidate it". In the end the liberals, misguided in their belief that "liberal democracy could be grounded solely in private property", ignored in the post-1989 discourse not only the material but also the symbolic and emotional levels. They adopted a hostile attitude toward their labor base and had thus "squandered their moral and political authority", making it possible for the politically illiberal populist Right to fill the resulting societal vacuum. The illiberal Right had been able to flourish by proffering only fictitious enemies and symbolic appeasement.

"q."David Ost described the situation as follows:
"As democratic reform became a real possibility, intellectuals sought to legitimate their emerging class interests. Political liberalism they shared with labor, but not economic liberalism, which is what they emphasized now. In doing so, they spoke the language that the party was now speaking, which eventually made them attractive partners for the party elite."

"r."The <a href="All-Poland%20Alliance%20of%20Trade%20Unions">All-Poland Alliance of Trade Unions</a> (OPZZ) was established by the government in 1984, following the martial law ban on all trade union activity. It was shunned by underground Solidarity activists, who pressured past Solidarity members and its present sympathizers not to get involved with this initiative.

"s."<a href="Neoliberalism">Neoliberalism</a> and <a href="shock%20therapy%20%28economics%29">shock therapy</a> were presented to the Polish public as a rational (scientific, based on <a href="mathematical%20economics">mathematical economics</a>) and merit-based, nonpolitical and objective system. The supposedly natural (biological) character of the systemic changes was stressed. The Central European myth of the West was used as a justification for the radical economic transformations, but at the same time the Poles were fed the already discredited in Western social sciences argumentation evoking <a href="evolutionism">evolutionism</a> and <a href="social%20Darwinism">social Darwinism</a>.

"t."Wałęsa'a election campaign and its approach, worked out together with <a href="Jaros%C5%82aw%20Kaczy%C5%84ski">Jarosław Kaczyński</a>, according to David Ost amounted to the beginning of Poland's era of "<a href="neoliberalism">neoliberal</a> populism": a practice of transforming social anger provoked by deprivation and economic difficulties through redirecting it to issues and targets that were non-economic, political and unrelated to the causes of that anger. While Wałęsa declared a "war at the top" in order to unseat the liberal leaders (his former protégés), his current allies the <a href="Lech%20Kaczy%C5%84ski">Kaczyński</a> brothers in a related move established a new party, the <a href="Centre%20Agreement">Center Alliance</a> (May 1990). The Alliance combined extreme anti-communism with a pursuit of accelerated neoliberal economic reforms.

"u."Following the current enforcement activity and in the wake of <a href="1970%20Polish%20protests">citizen discontent</a> in the following years, a massive expansion of the ORMO force was undertaken; at its peak in 1979 it reached over 450,000 members.

"v."David Ost identified <a href="Tadeusz%20Mazowiecki">Tadeusz Mazowiecki</a>, <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Geremek">Bronisław Geremek</a>, <a href="Jacek%20Kuro%C5%84">Jacek Kuroń</a> and <a href="Adam%20Michnik">Adam Michnik</a> as the most influential members of the (formerly opposition) intellectual elite during the early post-communist period. He characterized them as <a href="liberalism">liberals</a> in the political, but especially in the economic sense. They "sponsored <a href="Leszek%20Balcerowicz">Leszek Balcerowicz</a> and persuaded Wałęsa to approve. ... Their aim was to ... allow painful economic changes and unpopular capitalist class formation to occur". "The very language that in 1980 both underpinned and promoted an engaged civil society, providing the theoretical foundation for the struggle against communism, was used after 1989 to legitimate policies aimed at creating and empowering a new dominant class."

"w."The party leaders, conscious of the 1970 Gomułka's precedent and fearful of its repeat, tried to forestall the price rises, but eventually accepted the harsh package forced by Prime Minister <a href="Piotr%20Jaroszewicz">Piotr Jaroszewicz</a>. <a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Leonid Brezhnev</a> and other Soviet leaders applied strong pressure in an attempt to prevent the fateful move by the Polish regime.

"x."The leftist in the 1960s democratic opposition regrouped in the 1970s in a different form, giving up in process much of its leftist moral affiliation. <a href="1968%20Polish%20political%20crisis">Defeated in 1968</a> by the regime which took advantage of the opposition's social isolation, the opposition activists opted for an alliance with the Polish Catholic Church. The alliance ended the opposition's isolation and legitimated the movement in popular perception. However, the cost for the Left was a surrender of its fundamental value system (the mainstream opposition could thus no longer be considered leftist), and in the long run granting the Right the upper hand in the ability to mobilize mass political support. The opposition's alliance with the Church (before 1989 and after, when it became the ruling establishment) is also responsible, according to the cultural philosopher Andrzej Leder, for the marginalization of the Left and its social concept in the political spectrum of democratic Poland. In 1977 <a href="Adam%20Michnik">Adam Michnik</a> published his pivotal book "Kościół, lewica, dialog" ('The Church, the Left, the dialogue'). It marks the ideological transformation (capitulation in the political and cultural sense) of the opposition movement that soon resulted in the formation and domination in Poland of the <a href="liberalism">liberal</a>-<a href="conservatism">conservative</a> consensus.

"y."The old industry left behind well-qualified <a href="workforce">workforce</a>. Its existence turned out to be valuable for a <a href="periphery%20countries">peripheral economy</a> resource, because Poland became a major (for <a href="globalization">international capital</a>) source of <a href="labour%20economics">inexpensive labor</a>, both inside and outside the country. In Poland however, the availability of low-cost labor was used by entrepreneurs as a tool for competitiveness and discouraged investing in technical improvements, creativity and innovation.

"z."Unlike labor union members in the West, the Polish post-transformation unionist could not conceive of an adversarial or competitive relationship between themselves and the new capitalist owners of their places of employment. In a survey conducted in 1994, most Polish unionists, in both the Solidarity and <a href="All-Poland%20Alliance%20of%20Trade%20Unions">OPZZ</a> main unions, saw their proper role as promoters and facilitators of the market reform and <a href="privatization">privatization</a> processes, not in protecting themselves from the <a href="shock%20therapy%20%28economics%29">shock therapy</a> effects. Such attitude, conditioned by their historical experience and current government propaganda, rendered the workers unable to defend their <a href="Social%20class">class interests</a> under the new system.

"a1."The philosopher Andrzej Leder wrote of the post-war "departure from the mentality defined by the <a href="village">village</a> and "<a href="folwark">folwark</a>" toward one determined by the city and urban life style", which facilitated the later expansion of the <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> in Poland. Between 1956 and 1968 the modern urban culture was established, and the entire 1944–1989 period meant an irreversible destruction of the previously existing social and <a href="social%20class">class</a> barriers, including the realms of culture and customs.

"b1."Andrzej Leder gives the following figures, quoting <a href="Andrzej%20Paczkowski">Andrzej Paczkowski</a> and Henryk Słabek. Of the 4.7 million people who populated the <a href="Recovered%20Territories">Recovered Territories</a> in 1945–1950, 2.9 million came from central and south-eastern provinces of the new Polish territory and over 1.5 million from what had become the Soviet Union; smaller numbers of settlers arrived from France, Germany and other countries. From February 1946 to the end of 1948, 2.2 million Germans had to leave Poland (Paczkowski). 2.8 million Poles returned to Poland after the war from Germany and other parts of Western Europe (out of the total of 3.0–3.5 million war displaced who were present there) and many of them settled in the Recovered Territories.(Słabek).

"c1."Andrzej Leder wrote (2014) of the mass migration from rural areas to urban centers: "The consequence ... of the extermination during the German occupation of Jewish urban people and the destruction by Stalinist communism of the dominant position of state functionary, military and intellectual elites originating from "<a href="szlachta">szlachta</a>", was the creation of an enormous and multi-dimensional sphere for advancement. Cities became widely open and were rapidly overtaken by all those who bothered to make the move. Such people, actually their children and grandchildren, today make-up the basic skeleton of social structure.

"d1."According to Andrzej Leder, Jaruzelski's martial law (supported at the time of its imposition by about 50% of Poles) and its aftermath have had strongly deleterious long-term effects on social and political developments in Poland. The trauma caused by the deprivation of the collective sense of self-determination (acquired during the Solidarity period) atomized society and prevented future politically moderate and socially responsible undertakings and movements, creating a social vacuum, which was eventually filled by individualistic <a href="neoliberalism">neoliberalism</a> and right-wing <a href="nationalism">nationalism</a>.

Great Stink

The Great Stink was an event in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather exacerbated the smell of untreated <a href="human%20waste">human waste</a> and industrial <a href="effluent">effluent</a> that was present on the banks of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that emptied directly into the Thames. The <a href="miasma%20theory">miasma</a> from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of <a href="cholera">cholera</a> before the Great Stink were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.

The smell, and fears of its possible effects, prompted action from the local and national administrators who had been considering possible solutions for the problem. The authorities accepted a proposal from the <a href="civil%20engineer">civil engineer</a> <a href="Joseph%20Bazalgette">Joseph Bazalgette</a> to move the effluent eastwards along a series of interconnecting sewers that sloped towards <a href="outfall">outfall</a>s beyond the metropolitan area. Work on high-, mid- and low-level systems for the new <a href="Northern%20Outfall%20Sewer">Northern</a> and <a href="Southern%20Outfall%20Sewer">Southern Outfall Sewer</a>s started at the beginning of 1859 and lasted until 1875. To aid the drainage, <a href="Pumping%20station%23Sewage%20systems">pumping stations</a> were placed to lift the sewage from lower levels into higher pipes. Two of the more ornate stations, <a href="Abbey%20Mills%20Pumping%20Stations">Abbey Mills</a> in <a href="Stratford%2C%20London">Stratford</a> and <a href="Crossness%20Pumping%20Station">Crossness</a> on the <a href="Erith%20Marshes">Erith Marshes</a>, are <a href="listed%20building">listed</a> for protection by <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a>. Bazalgette's plan introduced the three embankments to London in which the sewers ran—the <a href="Victoria%20Embankment">Victoria</a>, <a href="Chelsea%20Embankment">Chelsea</a> and <a href="Albert%20Embankment">Albert Embankment</a>s.

Bazalgette's work ensured that sewage was no longer dumped onto the shores of the Thames and brought an end to the cholera outbreaks; his actions are thought to have saved more lives than the efforts of any other Victorian official. His sewer system operates into the 21st century, servicing a city that has grown to a population of over eight million. The historian <a href="Peter%20Ackroyd">Peter Ackroyd</a> argues that Bazalgette should be considered a hero of London.

Brick sewers had been built in London from the 17th century when sections of the <a href="River%20Fleet">Fleet</a> and <a href="Walbrook">Walbrook</a> rivers were covered for that purpose. In the century preceding 1856, over a hundred sewers were constructed in London, and at that date the city had around 200,000 <a href="cesspit">cesspit</a>s and 360 sewers. Some cesspits leaked <a href="methane">methane</a> and other gases, which often caught fire and exploded, leading to loss of life, while many of the sewers were in a poor state of repair. During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners, and by 1858 many of the city's medieval wooden water pipes were being replaced with iron ones. This, combined with the introduction of <a href="Flush%20toilet">flushing toilets</a> and the rising of the city's population from just under one million to three million, led to more water being flushed into the sewers, along with the associated <a href="effluent">effluent</a>. The <a href="outfall">outfall</a>s from factories, slaughterhouses and other industrial activities put further strain on the already failing system. Much of this outflow either overflowed, or discharged directly, into the <a href="Thames">Thames</a>.

The scientist <a href="Michael%20Faraday">Michael Faraday</a> described the situation in a letter to "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in July 1855: shocked at the state of the Thames, he dropped pieces of white paper into the river to "test the degree of opacity". His conclusion was that "Near the bridges the feculence rolled up in clouds so dense that they were visible at the surface, even in water of this kind. ... The smell was very bad, and common to the whole of the water; it was the same as that which now comes up from the gully-holes in the streets; the whole river was for the time a real sewer." The smell from the river was so bad that in 1857 the government poured chalk lime, <a href="chloride%20of%20lime">chloride of lime</a> and <a href="carbolic%20acid">carbolic acid</a> into the waterway to ease the stench.

The prevailing thought in Victorian healthcare concerning the transmission of contagious diseases was the <a href="miasma%20theory">miasma theory</a>, which held that most communicable diseases were caused by the inhalation of contaminated air. This contamination could take the form of the odour of rotting corpses or sewage, but also rotting vegetation, or the exhaled breath of someone already diseased. Miasma was believed by most to be the vector of transmission of <a href="cholera">cholera</a>, which was on the rise in 19th-century Europe. The disease was deeply feared by all, because of the speed with which it could spread, and its high fatality rates.

London's first major cholera epidemic struck in 1831 when the disease claimed 6,536 victims. In 1848–49 there was a second outbreak in which 14,137 London residents died, and this was followed by a further outbreak in 1853–54 in which 10,738 died. During the second outbreak, <a href="John%20Snow%20%28physician%29">John Snow</a>, a London-based physician, noticed that the rates of death were higher in those areas supplied by the Lambeth and the Southwark and Vauxhall water companies. In 1849 he published a paper, "On the Mode of Communication of Cholera", which posited the theory of the water-borne transmission of disease, rather than the miasma theory; little attention was paid to the paper. Following the <a href="1854%20Broad%20Street%20cholera%20outbreak">third cholera outbreak in 1854</a>, Snow published an update to his treatise, after he focused on the effects in Broad Street, Soho. Snow had removed the handle from the local water pump, thus preventing access to the contaminated water, with a resulting fall in deaths. It was later established that a leaking sewer ran near the well from which the water was drawn.

The civic infrastructure overseeing the management of London's sewers had gone through several changes in the 19th century. In 1848 the <a href="Metropolitan%20Commission%20of%20Sewers">Metropolitan Commission of Sewers</a> (MCS) was established at the urging of the social reformer <a href="Edwin%20Chadwick">Edwin Chadwick</a> and a Royal Commission. The Commission superseded seven of the eight authorities that had managed London's sewers since the time of <a href="Henry%20VIII">Henry VIII</a>; it was the first time that a unitary power had full control over the capital's sanitation facilities. The Building Act 1844 had ensured that all new buildings had to be connected to a sewer, not a cesspool, and the commission set about connecting cesspools to sewers, or removing them altogether. Because of the fear that the miasma from the sewers would cause the spread of disease, Chadwick and his successor, the <a href="Pathology">pathologist</a> <a href="John%20Simon%20%28pathologist%29">John Simon</a>, ensured that the sewers were regularly flushed through, a policy that resulted in more sewage being discharged into the Thames.
In August 1849 the MCS appointed <a href="Joseph%20Bazalgette">Joseph Bazalgette</a> to the position of assistant surveyor. He had been working as a consultant engineer in the railway industry until overwork had brought about a serious breakdown in his health; his appointment to the commission was his first position on his return to employment. Working under the chief engineer, Frank Foster, he began to develop a more systematic plan for the city's sewers. The stress of his position was too much for Foster and he died in 1852; Bazalgette was promoted into his position, and continued refining and developing the plans for the development of the sewerage system. The <a href="Metropolis%20Management%20Act%201855">Metropolis Management Act 1855</a> replaced the commission with the <a href="Metropolitan%20Board%20of%20Works">Metropolitan Board of Works</a> (MBW), which took control of the sewers.

By June 1856 Bazalgette completed his definitive plans, which provided for small, local sewers about in diameter to feed into a series of larger sewers until they drained into main outflow pipes high. A <a href="Northern%20Outfall%20Sewer">Northern</a> and <a href="Southern%20Outfall%20Sewer">Southern Outfall Sewer</a> were planned to manage the waste for each side of the river. London was mapped into high-, middle- and low-level areas, with a main sewer servicing each; a series of <a href="Pumping%20station%23Sewage%20systems">pumping stations</a> was planned to remove the waste towards the east of the city. Bazalgette's plan was based on that of Foster, but was larger in scale, and allowed for more of a rise in population than Foster's – from 3 to 4.5 million. Bazalgette submitted his plans to Sir <a href="Benjamin%20Hall%2C%201st%20Baron%20Llanover">Benjamin Hall</a>, the <a href="First%20Commissioner%20of%20Works">First Commissioner of Works</a>. Hall had reservations about the outfalls—the discharge points of waste outlets into other bodies of water—from the sewers, which he said were still within the bounds of the capital, and were therefore unacceptable. During the ongoing discussions, Bazalgette refined and modified his plans, in line with Hall's demands. In December 1856 Hall submitted the plans to a group of three consultant engineers, Captain <a href="Douglas%20Strutt%20Galton">Douglas Strutt Galton</a> of the Royal Engineers, <a href="James%20Simpson%20%28engineer%29">James Simpson</a>, an engineer with two water companies, and Thomas Blackwood, the chief engineer on the <a href="Kennet%20and%20Avon%20Canal">Kennet and Avon Canal</a>. The trio reported back to Hall in July 1857 with proposed changes to the positions of the outfall, which he passed on to the MBW in October. The new proposed discharge points were to be open sewers, running beyond the positions proposed by the board; the cost of their plans was to be over £5.4 million, considerably more than the maximum estimate of Bazalgette's plan, which was £2.4 million. In February 1858 a <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20elections%20overview">general election</a> saw the fall of <a href="Henry%20John%20Temple%2C%203rd%20Viscount%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>'s <a href="Whig%20government%2C%201855%E2%80%931858">Whig government</a>, which was replaced by <a href="Edward%20Smith-Stanley%2C%2014th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a>'s <a href="Second%20Derby%E2%80%93Disraeli%20ministry">second Conservative ministry</a>; <a href="John%20Manners%2C%207th%20Duke%20of%20Rutland">Lord John Manners</a> replaced Hall, and <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a> was appointed <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons">Leader of the House of Commons</a> and <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>.

By mid-1858 the problems with the Thames had been building for several years. In his novel "<a href="Little%20Dorrit">Little Dorrit</a>"—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—<a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> wrote that the Thames was "a deadly sewer ... in the place of a fine, fresh river". In a letter to a friend, Dickens said: "I can certify that the offensive smells, even in that short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature", while the social scientist and journalist <a href="George%20Godwin">George Godwin</a> wrote that "in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep" on the Thames foreshore, and that "the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged —rising to in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained on the banks of the river. Queen Victoria and <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event "The Great Stink"; the leading article in the "<a href="City%20Press%20%28London%29">City Press</a>" observed that "Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it". A writer for "The Standard" concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a "pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination", while a second wrote that "the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream". The leading article in "<a href="The%20Illustrated%20London%20News">The Illustrated London News</a>" commented that:

By June the stench from the river had become so bad that business in <a href="Palace%20of%20Westminster">Parliament</a> was affected, and the curtains on the river side of the building were soaked in <a href="Calcium%20hypochlorite">lime chloride</a> to overcome the smell. The measure was not successful, and discussions were held about possibly moving the business of government to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a> or <a href="St%20Albans">St Albans</a>. "<a href="The%20Examiner%20%281808%E2%80%9386%29">The Examiner</a>" reported that Disraeli, on attending one of the committee rooms, left shortly afterwards with the other members of the committee, "with a mass of papers in one hand, and with his pocket handkerchief applied to his nose" because the smell was so bad. The disruption to its legislative work led to questions being raised in the House of Commons. According to "<a href="Hansard">Hansard</a>", the Member of Parliament (MP) John Brady informed Manners that members were unable to use either the Committee Rooms or the Library because of the stench, and asked the minister "if the noble Lord has taken any measures for mitigating the effluvium and discontinuing the nuisance". Manners replied that the Thames was not under his jurisdiction. Four days later a second MP said to Manners that "By a perverse ingenuity, one of the noblest of rivers has been changed into a cesspool, and I wish to ask whether Her Majesty's Government intend to take any steps to remedy the evil?" Manners pointed out "that Her Majesty's Government have nothing whatever to do with the state of the Thames". The satirical magazine "<a href="Punch%20%28magazine%29">Punch</a>" commented that "The one absorbing topic in both Houses of Parliament ... was the Conspiracy to Poison question. Of the guilt of that old offender, Father Thames, there was the most ample evidence".

At the height of the stink, between of lime were being used near the mouths of the sewers that discharged into the Thames, and men were employed spreading lime onto the Thames foreshore at low tide; the cost was £1,500 per week. On 15 June Disraeli tabled the Metropolis Local Management Amendment Bill, a proposed amendment to the 1855 Act; in the opening debate he called the Thames "a Stygian pool, reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors". The Bill put the responsibility to clear up the Thames on the MBW, and stated that "as far as may be possible" the sewerage outlets should not be within the boundaries of London; it also allowed the Board to borrow £3 million, which was to be repaid from a three-penny levy on all London households for the next forty years. The terms favoured Bazalgette's original 1856 plan, and overcame Hall's objection to it. The leading article in "The Times" observed that "Parliament was all but compelled to legislate upon the great London nuisance by the force of sheer stench". The bill was debated in late July and was passed into law on 2 August.

Bazalgette's plans for the of additional street sewers (collecting both effluent and rainwater), which would feed into of main interconnecting sewers, were put out to tender between 1859 and 1865. Four hundred draftsmen worked on the detailed plans and sectional views for the first phase of the building process. There were several engineering challenges to be overcome, particularly the fact that parts of London—including the area around <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a> and <a href="Pimlico">Pimlico</a>—lie below the high-water mark. Bazalgette's plan for the low-level areas was to lift the sewage from low-lying sewers at key points into the mid- and high-level sewers, which would then drain with the aid of gravity, out towards the eastern outfalls at a gradient of .

Bazalgette was a proponent of the use of <a href="Portland%20cement">Portland cement</a>, a material stronger than standard cement, but with a weakness when over-heated. To overcome the problem he instituted a quality control system to test batches of cement, that is described by the historian Stephen Halliday as both "elaborate" and "draconian". The results were fed back to the manufacturers, who altered their production processes to further improve the product. One of the cement manufacturers commented that the MBW were the first public body to use such testing processes. The progress of Bazalgette's works was reported favourably in the press. Paul Dobraszczyk, the architectural historian, describes the coverage as presenting many of the workers "in a positive, even heroic, light", and in 1861 "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" described the progress on the sewers as "the most expensive and wonderful work of modern times". Construction costs were so high that in July 1863 an additional £1.2 million was lent to the MBW to cover the cost of the work.

The southern system, across the less populated suburbs of London, was the smaller and easier part of the system to build. Three main sewers ran from <a href="Putney">Putney</a>, <a href="Wandsworth">Wandsworth</a> and <a href="South%20Norwood">Norwood</a> until they linked together in <a href="Deptford">Deptford</a>. At that point a pumping station lifted the effluent into the main outflow sewer, which ran to the <a href="Crossness%20Pumping%20Station">Crossness Pumping Station</a> on the <a href="Erith%20Marshes">Erith Marshes</a>, where it was discharged into the Thames at high tide. The newly built station at Crossness was designed by Bazalgette and a consultant engineer, <a href="Charles%20Henry%20Driver">Charles Henry Driver</a>, a proponent of the use of <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> as a building material. The building was in a <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque style</a> and the interior contains architectural cast ironwork which <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> describe as important. The power for pumping the large amount of sewage was provided by four massive beam engines, named Victoria, Prince Consort, Albert Edward and Alexandra, which were manufactured by <a href="James%20Watt">James Watt</a> and Co.

The station was opened in April 1865 by the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a>—the future King <a href="Edward%20VII">Edward VII</a>—who officially started the engines. The ceremony, which was attended by other members of royalty, MPs, the <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a> and the Archbishops of <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Canterbury</a> and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">York</a>, was followed by a dinner for 500 within the building. The ceremony marked the completion of construction of the Southern Outfall Sewers, and the beginning of their operation.
With the successful completion of the southern outflow, one of the board members of the MBW, an MP named Miller, proposed a bonus for Bazalgette. The board agreed and were prepared to pay the engineer £6,000—three times his annual salary—with an additional £4,000 to be shared among his three assistants. Although the idea was subsequently dropped following criticism, Halliday observes that the large amounts discussed "at a time when parsimony was the dominant characteristic of public expenditure is a firm indication of the depth of public interest and approval that appears to have characterised the work."

The northern side of the Thames was the more populous, housing two-thirds of London's population, and the works had to proceed through congested streets and overcome such urban hurdles as canals, bridges and railway lines. Work began on the system on 31 January 1859, but the builders encountered numerous problems in construction, including a labourers' strike in 1859–60, hard frosts in winter, and heavier than normal rainfall. The rain was so heavy in June 1862 that an accident occurred at the works re-building the Fleet sewer. The deep excavations were running parallel to the excavation of a cutting at <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a> for the <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (now the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a>), and the wall dividing the two trenches collapsed, spilling the waters of the Fleet onto Victoria Street, damaging the gas and water mains.

The high-level sewer—the most northern of the works—ran from <a href="Hampstead%20Heath">Hampstead Heath</a> to <a href="Stoke%20Newington">Stoke Newington</a> and across <a href="Victoria%20Park%2C%20London">Victoria Park</a>, where it joined with the eastern end of the mid-level sewer. The mid-level sewer began in the west at <a href="Bayswater">Bayswater</a> and ran along <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a>, through <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a> and <a href="Bethnal%20Green">Bethnal Green</a>, before the connection. This combined main sewer ran to the <a href="Abbey%20Mills%20Pumping%20Station">Abbey Mills Pumping Station</a> in <a href="Stratford%2C%20London">Stratford</a>, where it was joined by the eastern end of the low-level sewer. The pumps at Abbey Mills lifted the effluent from the low-level sewer into the main sewer. This main sewer ran —along what is now known as the <a href="Greenway%2C%20London">Greenway</a>—to the outfall at <a href="Beckton">Beckton</a>.

Like the Crossness Pumping Station, Abbey Mills was a joint design by Bazalgette and Driver. Above the centre of the engine-house was an ornate dome that, Dobraszczyk considers, gives the building a "superficial resemblance ... to a Byzantine church". The architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a>, in his "<a href="Pevsner%20Architectural%20Guides%23Buildings%20of%20England">Buildings of England</a>", thought the building showed "exciting architecture applied to the most foul purposes"; he went on to describe it as "an unorthodox mix, vaguely <a href="Italian%20Gothic%20architecture">Italian Gothic</a> in style but with tiers of Byzantine windows and a central octagonal lantern that adds a gracious Russian flavour".

To provide the drainage for the low-level sewers, in February 1864 Bazalgette began building three embankments along the shores of the Thames. On the northern side he built the <a href="Victoria%20Embankment">Victoria Embankment</a>, which runs from <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a> to <a href="Blackfriars%20Bridge">Blackfriars Bridge</a>, and the <a href="Chelsea%20Embankment">Chelsea Embankment</a>, running from <a href="Millbank">Millbank</a> to the <a href="Cadogan%20Pier">Cadogan Pier</a> at Chelsea. The southern side contains the <a href="Albert%20Embankment">Albert Embankment</a>, from the Lambeth end of <a href="Westminster%20Bridge">Westminster Bridge</a> to <a href="Vauxhall">Vauxhall</a>. He ran the sewers along the banks of the Thames, building up walls on the foreshore, running the sewer pipes inside and infilling around them. The works claimed over of land from the Thames; the Victoria Embankment had the added benefit of relieving the congestion on the pre-existing roads between Westminster and the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. The cost of building the embankments was estimated at £1.71 million, of which £450,000 was used for purchasing the necessary river-front properties, which tended to be for light industrial use. The Embankment project was seen as being nationally important and, with the Queen unable to attend because of illness, the Victoria Embankment was opened by the Prince of Wales in July 1870. The Albert Embankment had been completed in November 1869, while the Chelsea Embankment was opened in July 1874.

Bazalgette considered the Embankment project "one of the most difficult and intricate things the ... [MBW] have had to do", and shortly after the Chelsea Embankment was opened, he was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a>. In 1875 the work on the western drainage was completed, and the system became operational. The building work had required 318 million bricks and of concrete and mortar; the final cost was approximately £6.5 million.

In 1866 there was a further cholera outbreak in London that claimed 5,596 lives, although it was confined to an area of the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End</a> between <a href="Aldgate">Aldgate</a> and <a href="Bow%2C%20London">Bow</a>. At the time that was a part of London which had not been connected to Bazalgette's system, and 93 per cent of the fatalities occurred within the area. The fault lay with the East London Water Company, who discharged their sewage half a mile () downstream from their reservoir: the sewage was being carried upstream into the reservoir on the incoming tide, contaminating the area's drinking water. The outbreak and the diagnosis of its causes led to the acceptance that cholera was water-borne, not transmitted by miasma. "<a href="The%20Lancet">The Lancet</a>", relating details of the investigation into the incident by <a href="William%20Farr">Dr William Farr</a>, stated that his report "will render irresistible the conclusions at which he has arrived in regard to the influence of the water-supply in causation of the epidemic." It was the last outbreak of the disease in the capital.

In 1878 a Thames pleasure-steamer, the , collided with the <a href="Collier%20%28ship%29">collier</a> "Bywell Castle" and sank, causing over 650 deaths. The accident took place close to the outfalls and questions were raised in the British press over whether the sewage was responsible for some of the deaths. In the 1880s further fears over possible health concerns because of the outfalls led to the MBW purifying sewage at Crossness and Beckton, rather than dumping the untreated waste into the river, and a series of six sludge boats were ordered to ship effluent into the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> for dumping. The first boat commissioned in 1887 was named the SS "Bazalgette"; the procedure remained in service until December 1998, when the dumping stopped and an incinerator was used to dispose of the waste. The sewers were expanded in the late 19th century and again in the early 20th century. The drainage network is, , managed by <a href="Thames%20Water">Thames Water</a>, and is used by up to eight million people a day. The company said in 2014 that "the system is struggling to cope with the demands of 21st-century London".

Crossness Pumping Station remained in use until the mid-1950s when it was replaced. The engines were too large to remove and were left "in situ", although they fell into a state of disrepair. The station itself became a grade I <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> with the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Works%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Public Building and Works</a> in June 1970 (since replaced by English Heritage). The building and its engines are, , under restoration by the Crossness Engines Trust. The president of the trust is the British television producer <a href="Peter%20Bazalgette">Peter Bazalgette</a>, the great-great-grandson of Joseph. part of the Abbey Mill facility continues to operate as a sewage pumping station. The building's large double chimneys were removed during the Second World War following fears that they could be used by the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> as landmarks for navigation, and the building became a grade II* listed building with the Ministry of Works in November 1974.

The provision of an integrated and fully functioning sewer system for the capital, together with the associated drop in cholera cases, led the historian John Doxat to state that Bazalgette "probably did more good, and saved more lives, than any single Victorian official". Bazalgette continued to work at the MBW until 1889, during which time he replaced three of London's bridges: <a href="Putney%20Bridge">Putney</a> in 1886, <a href="Hammersmith%20Bridge">Hammersmith</a> in 1887 and <a href="Battersea%20Bridge">Battersea</a> in 1890. He was appointed president of the <a href="Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">Institution of Civil Engineers</a> (ICE) in 1884, and in 1901 a monument commemorating his life was opened on the Victoria Embankment. When he died in March 1891, his obituarist in "The Illustrated London News" wrote that Bazalgette's "two great titles to fame are that he beautified London and drained it", while <a href="John%20Coode%20%28engineer%29">Sir John Coode</a>, the president of ICE at the time, said that Bazalgette's work "will ever remain as monuments to his skill and professional ability". The obituarist for "The Times" opined that "when the New Zealander comes to London a thousand years hence ... the magnificent solidity and the faultless symmetry of the great granite blocks which form the wall of the Thames-embankment will still remain." He continued, "the great sewer that runs beneath Londoners ... has added some 20 years to their chance of life". The historian <a href="Peter%20Ackroyd">Peter Ackroyd</a>, in his history of <a href="subterranean%20London">subterranean London</a>, considers that "with <a href="John%20Nash%20%28architect%29">[John] Nash</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Wren">[Christopher] Wren</a>, Bazalgette enters the pantheon of London heroes" because of his work, particularly the building of the Victoria and Albert Embankments.

Panavision

Panavision is an American <a href="motion%20picture">motion picture</a> equipment <a href="company%20%28law%29">company</a> specializing in <a href="camera">camera</a>s and <a href="photographic%20lens">lenses</a>, based in <a href="Woodland%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Woodland Hills, California</a>. Formed by <a href="Robert%20Gottschalk">Robert Gottschalk</a> as a small partnership to create <a href="anamorphic%20format">anamorphic</a> projection lenses during the <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> boom in the 1950s, Panavision expanded its product lines to meet the demands of modern filmmakers. The company introduced its first products in 1954. Originally a provider of <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a> accessories, the company's line of anamorphic widescreen lenses soon became the industry leader. In 1972, Panavision helped revolutionize filmmaking with the lightweight <a href="Panaflex">Panaflex</a> <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm</a> <a href="movie%20camera">movie camera</a>. The company has introduced other groundbreaking cameras such as the Millennium XL (1999) and the digital video <a href="Genesis%20%28camera%29">Genesis</a> (2004).

Panavision operates exclusively as a rental facility—the company owns its entire inventory, unlike most of its competitors.

<a href="Robert%20Gottschalk">Robert Gottschalk</a> founded Panavision in late 1953, in partnership with <a href="Richard%20Moore%20%28cinematographer%29">Richard Moore</a>, <a href="Meredith%20Merle%20Nicholson">Meredith Nicholson</a>, Harry Eller, Walter Wallin, and William Mann; the company was formally incorporated in 1954. Panavision was established principally for the manufacture of <a href="anamorphic%20format">anamorphic</a> <a href="Movie%20projector">projection</a> lenses to meet the growing demands of theaters showing <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a> films. At the time of Panavision's formation, Gottschalk owned a camera shop in Westwood Village, California, where many of his customers were <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a>s. A few years earlier, he and Moore—who worked with him in the camera shop—were experimenting with <a href="underwater%20photography">underwater photography</a>; Gottschalk became interested in the technology of anamorphic lenses, which allowed him to get a wider field of view from his underwater camera housing. The technology was created during World War I to increase the field of view on tank <a href="periscopes">periscopes</a>; the periscope image was horizontally "squeezed" by the anamorphic lens. After it was unsqueezed by a complementary anamorphic <a href="Optics">optical</a> element, the tank operator could see double the horizontal field of view without significant distortion. Gottschalk and Moore bought some of these lenses from <a href="C.%20P.%20Goerz">C. P. Goerz</a>, a New York optics company, for use in their underwater photography. As <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> filmmaking became popular, Gottschalk saw an opportunity to provide anamorphic lenses to the film industry—first for <a href="Movie%20projector">projectors</a>, and then for cameras. Nicholson, a friend of Moore, started working as a <a href="cameraman">cameraman</a> on early tests of anamorphic photography.

In the 1950s, the motion picture industry was threatened by the advent of <a href="television">television</a>—TV kept moviegoers at home, reducing box office revenues. Film studios sought to lure audiences to theaters with attractions that television could not provide. These included a revival of <a href="Color%20photography">color films</a>, <a href="3-D%20film">three-dimensional films</a>, <a href="stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic sound</a>, and widescreen movies. <a href="Cinerama">Cinerama</a> was one of the first widescreen movie processes of the era. In its initial conception, the cumbersome system required three cameras for shooting and three synchronized projectors to display a picture on one wide, curved screen. Along with the logistical and financial challenges of tripling equipment usage and cost, the process led to distracting vertical lines between the three projected images. Looking for a high-impact method of widescreen filmmaking that was cheaper, simpler, and less visually distracting, <a href="20th%20Century%20Fox">20th Century Fox</a> acquired the rights to a process it branded <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a>: in this system, the film was shot with anamorphic lenses. The film was then exhibited with a complementary anamorphic lens on the projector that expanded the image, creating a projected <a href="aspect%20ratio%20%28image%29">aspect ratio</a> (the ratio of the image's width to its height) twice that of the image area on the physical frame of film. By the time the first CinemaScope movie—"<a href="The%20Robe%20%28film%29">The Robe</a>" (1953)—was announced for production, Gottschalk, Moore and Nicholson had a demo reel of work with their anamorphic underwater system.

Gottschalk learned from one of his vendors that <a href="Bausch%20%26amp%3B%20Lomb">Bausch & Lomb</a>, whom Fox had contracted to manufacture CinemaScope lenses, was having difficulty filling the lens orders for theatrical anamorphic projection equipment. He teamed up with William Mann, who provided optical manufacturing capability, and Walter Wallin, an optical physicist who was an acquaintance of Mann's. The anamorphic lens design they selected was <a href="Prism%20%28optics%29">prismatic</a> rather than the <a href="Cylinder%20%28geometry%29">cylindrical</a> design of the Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lens. This design meant the anamorphic lens extension factor—how much the image is horizontally unsqueezed—could be manually shifted, useful for projectionists switching between nonanamorphic ("flat" or "spherical") <a href="Trailer%20%28film%29">trailers</a> and an anamorphic <a href="feature%20film">feature</a>. The result was the anamorphosing system, designed by Wallin, used in the Panatar lens; the patent for the system was filed on August 11, 1954, and awarded five years later.

Panavision's first product—the Super Panatar projection lens—debuted in March 1954. Priced at $1,100, it captured the market. The Super Panatar was a rectangular box that attached to the existing projection lens with a special bracket. Its variable prismatic system allowed a range of film formats to be shown from the same projector with a simple adjustment of the lens. Panavision improved on the Super Panatar with the Ultra Panatar, a lighter design that could be screwed directly to the front of the projection lens. Panavision lenses gradually replaced CinemaScope as the leading anamorphic system for theatrical projection.

In December 1954, the company created a specialized lens for film laboratories—the Micro Panatar. When fitted to an <a href="optical%20printer">optical printer</a>, the Micro Panatar could create "flat" (nonanamorphic) prints from anamorphic negatives. This allowed films to be distributed to theaters that did not have an anamorphic system installed. To accomplish this dual platform release strategy before the Micro Panatar, studios would sometimes shoot films with one anamorphic and one spherical camera, allowing nonwidescreen theaters to exhibit the film. The cost savings of eliminating the second camera and making flat prints in <a href="post-production">post-production</a> with the Micro Panatar were enormous.

Another innovation of the era secured Panavision's leading position: the Auto Panatar camera lens for 35 mm anamorphic productions. Early CinemaScope camera lenses were notoriously problematic in <a href="close-up">close-up</a>s with an optical aberration that was commonly known as "the mumps": a widening of the face due to a loss of anamorphic power as a subject approaches the lens. Because of the novelty of the new anamorphic process, early CinemaScope productions compensated for this aberration by avoiding tightly framed shots. As the anamorphic process became more popular, it became more problematic. Panavision invented a solution: adding a rotating lens element that moved in mechanical sync with the <a href="Focus%20%28optics%29">focus</a> ring. This eliminated the distortion and allowed for natural close-up anamorphic photography. The Auto Panatar, released in 1958, was rapidly adopted, eventually making CinemaScope lenses obsolete. This innovation earned Panavision the first of its 15 <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a> for technical achievement. Soon the screen credit "Filmed in Panavision" (as if Panavision itself were a widescreen format) began appearing on motion picture screen credits.

Since 1954, Panavision had been working on a new widescreen process commissioned by <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a>. The MGM camera system used 1930 Mitchell FC "Fox Grandeur" 70mm motion picture cameras, retooled for 65mm film and modern lenses. The resulting system used the retooled Grandeur <a href="65%20mm%20film">65 mm film</a> camera in conjunction with the APO Panatar lens, which was an integrated anamorphic lens (as opposed to a standard <a href="prime%20lens">prime lens</a> with an anamorphoser mounted on it). This created a 1.25x anamorphic squeeze factor. Movies using the process had an astounding potential aspect ratio of 2.76:1 when exhibited with <a href="70%20mm">70 mm</a> anamorphic projection prints. Introduced as <a href="Ultra%20Panavision%2070">MGM Camera 65</a>, the system was used on just a few films, the first of which was "<a href="Raintree%20County%20%28film%29">Raintree County</a>" (1956). However, the film was released only in 35 mm anamorphic prints because the circuit of 70 mm theaters was booked with "<a href="Around%20the%20World%20in%20Eighty%20Days%20%281956%20film%29">Around the World in Eighty Days</a>" (1956), shot with the competing, nonanamorphic <a href="Todd-AO">Todd-AO</a> system. In January 1959, the posters for the 70 mm release of Disney's "<a href="Sleeping%20Beauty%20%281959%20film%29">Sleeping Beauty</a>" carried the notation "Process lenses by Panavision" next to the <a href="Super%20Technirama%2070">Super Technirama 70</a> logo. The first film to be presented in 70 mm anamorphic—"<a href="Ben-Hur%20%281959%20film%29">Ben-Hur</a>"—was released by MGM in 1959 under the trade name <a href="MGM%20Camera%2065">MGM Camera 65</a>. Panavision also developed a nonanamorphic widescreen process called <a href="Super%20Panavision%2070">Super Panavision 70</a>, which was essentially identical to Todd-AO. Super Panavision made its screen debut in 1959 with "<a href="The%20Big%20Fisherman">The Big Fisherman</a>", released by <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a>'s <a href="Buena%20Vista%20Distribution">Buena Vista</a> division.

By 1962, four of Panavision's founders had left the company to pursue private careers. That year, MGM's Camera 65 production of "<a href="Mutiny%20on%20the%20Bounty%20%281962%20film%29">Mutiny on the Bounty</a>" went so far over budget that the studio liquidated assets to cover its costs. As a result of this liquidation, Panavision acquired MGM's camera equipment division, as well as the rights to the Camera 65 system it had developed for MGM; the technology was renamed <a href="Ultra%20Panavision%2070">Ultra Panavision</a>. Only six more features were made with the system: "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Mad%2C%20Mad%2C%20Mad%2C%20Mad%20World">It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</a>" (1963), "<a href="The%20Fall%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire%20%28movie%29">The Fall of the Roman Empire</a>" (1964), "<a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>" (1965), "<a href="The%20Greatest%20Story%20Ever%20Told">The Greatest Story Ever Told</a>" (1965), "<a href="The%20Hallelujah%20Trail">The Hallelujah Trail</a>" (1965), and "<a href="Khartoum%20%28film%29">Khartoum</a>" (1966). The system was revived in 2015 for Quentin Tarantino's "<a href="The%20Hateful%20Eight">The Hateful Eight</a>". As 1.25× anamorphosers for 70 mm projectors have become rare, most of the 70 mm prints of these films still in circulation are designed for projection with non-anamorphic, spherical lenses. The result is a 2.20:1 aspect ratio, rather than the broader ratio originally intended.

Although Fox insisted on maintaining CinemaScope for a time, some actors disliked the system. For Fox's 1965 production "<a href="Von%20Ryan%27s%20Express">Von Ryan's Express</a>", <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> reputedly demanded that Auto Panatar lenses be used. Such pressures led Fox to completely abandon CinemaScope for Auto Panatars that year; "Von Ryan's Express" was the studio's first picture with Panavision lenses. To meet the extraordinary demand for Panavision projection lenses, Gottschalk had Bausch & Lomb CinemaScope lenses retrofitted into Panavision housings with a new astigmatic attachment, improving them greatly. This was revealed many years after Gottschalk's death; a lead designer from Bausch & Lomb, who had been involved with the original CinemaScope project, came to work as a designer for Panavision and—after opening some of the older lenses—figured out the secret.

In the mid-1960s, Gottschalk altered Panavision's business model. The company now maintained its full inventory, making its lenses and the cameras it had acquired from MGM available only by rental. This meant that equipment could be maintained, modified, and regularly updated by the company. When Panavision eventually brought its own camera designs to market, it was relatively unconstrained by retrofitting and manufacturing costs, as it was not directly competing on sales price. This allowed Panavision to build cameras to new standards of durability.

The new business model required additional capital. To this end, the company was sold to Banner Productions in 1965, with Gottschalk remaining as president. Panavision would soon expand into markets beyond <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a>, eventually including New York, Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, and Southeast Asia. <a href="Kinney%20National%20Company">Kinney National Company</a> bought out Banner in 1968 and took over <a href="Warner%20Bros.-Seven%20Arts">Warner Bros.-Seven Arts</a> the following year, eventually renaming itself <a href="Warner%20Communications">Warner Communications</a> due to a financial scandal. Kinney/Warner's financial resources made possible a massive expansion in Panavision's inventory, as well as substantial leaps in research and development.

During this period, the company's R&D department focused on retrofitting the industry standard 35 mm camera, the Mitchell BNC. The first cameras produced by Panavision were Mitchell cameras, and all standard 35mm cameras made by Panavision to this day are based on the Mitchell movement.

The effort to develop a lighter, quieter camera with a <a href="Reflex%20finder">reflex viewfinder</a> led to the introduction of the Panavision Silent Reflex (PSR) in 1967. The camera could provide a <a href="rotary%20disc%20shutter">shutter angle</a> of up to 200 degrees. Many refinements were made to the PSR during the first few years after its introduction, and it soon became one of the most popular studio cameras in the world. Panavision also began manufacturing spherical lenses for 1.85:1 photography, garnering a significant share of the market.

In 1968, Panavision released a handheld 65 mm camera. By that time, however, the much cheaper process of blowing up 35 mm anamorphic films to 70 mm—introduced with "<a href="The%20Cardinal">The Cardinal</a>" (1964)—had made 65 mm production virtually obsolete. In 1970, the last two feature films shot entirely with Super Panavision were released: "<a href="Song%20of%20Norway">Song of Norway</a>" and "<a href="Ryan%27s%20Daughter">Ryan's Daughter</a>". In the decades since, only a handful of films have been shot in 65 mm.

Albert Mayer led the next major project: the creation of a lightweight reflex camera adaptable to either handheld or studio conditions. After four years of development, the Panaflex debuted in 1972. A revolutionary camera that operated quietly, the Panaflex eliminated the need for a cumbersome <a href="sound%20blimp">sound blimp</a>, and could synchronize handheld work. The Panaflex also included a digital electronic <a href="tachometer">tachometer</a> and <a href="camera%20magazine">magazine</a> motors for the take-up reel. <a href="Ted%20Post">Ted Post</a>'s "<a href="Magnum%20Force">Magnum Force</a>" (1973) and <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sugarland%20Express">The Sugarland Express</a>" (1974) were the first motion pictures filmed with the Panaflex.

During the 1970s, the Panaflex line was updated and marketed in new incarnations: the Panaflex X, Panaflex Lightweight (for <a href="steadicam">steadicam</a>), the high-speed Panastar, Panaflex Gold, and Panaflex G2. Panavision came out with a direct competitor to <a href="Tiffen">Tiffen</a>'s Steadicam stabilizer, the <a href="Panaglide">Panaglide</a> harness. The Panacam, a <a href="video%20camera">video camera</a>, was also brought out, though the company largely left the video field to others.

Robert Gottschalk died in 1982 at the age of 64. After Gottschalk's death, Warner Communications sold the company to a consortium headed by <a href="Ted%20Field">Ted Field</a>, <a href="John%20Farrand">John Farrand</a>, and Alan Hirschfield. With new ownership came sweeping changes to the company, which had stagnated. Optics testing was computerized and, in 1986, the new Platinum model camera was introduced. The next year—responding to a perceived demand for the resurrection of the 65 mm camera—development began on a new model. The company was sold to <a href="Lee%20International">Lee International</a> PLC for $100 million in 1987, but financing was overextended and ownership reverted to the investment firm <a href="Warburg%20Pincus">Warburg Pincus</a> two years later.

In 1989, the company brought out Primo, a new line of lenses. Designed with a consistent color match between all the different <a href="focal%20length">focal-length</a> instruments in the line, these were also the sharpest lenses yet manufactured by Panavision. Six years later, Oscars were awarded to the company and to three of its employees for their work on the Primo 3:1 <a href="zoom%20lens">zoom lens</a>: Iain Neil for the optical design, Rick Gelbard for the mechanical design, and Eric Dubberke for the lens's engineering. According to the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">AMPAS</a> citation, "The high contrast and absence of flare, along with its ability to provide close focusing and to maintain constant image size while changing focus, make the Primo 3:1 Zoom Lens truly unique." In 1991, the company released its new 65 mm technology, System 65, though <a href="Arri">Arri</a> had beaten it to market by two years with the Arriflex 765. The gauge was not widely readopted, and only two major Hollywood films were shot with the new 65 mm Panavision process: "<a href="Far%20and%20Away">Far and Away</a>" (1992) and <a href="Kenneth%20Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a>'s "<a href="Hamlet%20%281996%20film%29">Hamlet</a>" (1996).

In 1992, Panavision launched a project to develop a camera that involved rethinking every aspect of the company's existing 35 mm system. Nolan Murdock and Albert Mayer Sr. headed up the design team. The new Millennium camera, replacing the Platinum as the company's flagship, was introduced in 1997. The Millennium XL came to the market in 1999 and was led by Al Mayer, Jr. It soon established itself as Panavision’s new 35mm workhorse. The XL was the first product in Panavision history to win both an Academy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award within the first year of official release. The update to the XL, the XL2 was initially released in 2004.[26] . The first feature films to use these latter two systems were, respectively, "<a href="The%20Perfect%20Storm%20%28film%29">The Perfect Storm</a>" (2000) and "<a href="Just%20Like%20Heaven%20%28film%29">Just Like Heaven</a>" (2005). The XL series not only had a much smaller camera body—making it suitable for studio, handheld, and steadicam work—but also marked the first significant change to the film transport mechanism in the camera since the Panaflex: two smaller sprocket drums for feed and take-up (a design similar to the <a href="Moviecam">Moviecam</a> and subsequent <a href="Arricam">Arricam</a>) instead of one large drum to do both. As of 2006, Panavision has no further plans to develop additional film camera models.

In May 1997, Panavision announced it would be purchasing Visual Action Holdings PLC, a major film services group for $61m (£37.5m). The British-based company was formerly known as Samuelson Group PLC. The company operated three rental depots in the UK and was main agent for Panavision in France and Australia. It also had smaller rental operations in New Zealand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Crucially, it controlled three Panavision agencies in the US cities of Atlanta, Chicago, and Dallas (acquired from Victor Duncan, Inc.). Panavision CEO William C Scott said, "This transaction provides Panavision with a strong platform on which to grow the international side of our business and also completes our company-controlled distribution system in the US. Additionally, we will immediately expand our presence in key Southeast Asia markets, where television and film activity are expect to grow rapidly. Overall, the transaction enables us to control a true worldwide distribution network for Panavision’s camera systems and related products, one of our most important strategic objectives."

<a href="Ronald%20Perelman">Ronald Perelman</a>'s solely owned <a href="MacAndrews%20%26amp%3B%20Forbes%20Holdings">MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings</a> (Mafco) acquired a majority interest in Panavision in 1998, via a Mafco subsidiary. After aborted attempts to create a film-style video camera in the 1970s and 1980s, Panavision joined the digital revolution in July 2000, establishing DHD Ventures in partnership with <a href="Sony">Sony</a>. The new company's objective was to raise the quality of <a href="High-definition%20video">high definition</a> digital video to the standards of top-level Hollywood motion-picture production.

This cooperative venture was established, largely at the instigation of <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a>, to serve his designs for the "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" prequels. The collaboration resulted in the Sony HDW-F900 <a href="CineAlta">CineAlta</a> <a href="HDCAM">HDCAM</a> high definition video camera. Sony produced the electronics and a stand-alone version of the camera; Panavision supplied custom-designed high definition lenses, trademarked Primo Digital, and retrofitted the camera body to incorporate standard film camera accessories, facilitating the equipment's integration into existing crew equipment as a "digital cinema camera". This <a href="Panavision%20HD-900F">Panavision HD-900F</a>, was used in the making of <a href="Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a>'s "" (2002), described as "the first digital major feature film". Panavision's next step in the evolution of digital cinema cameras also involved collaboration between Sony and Panavision; this time, Panavision participated in all the stages of development. The aim was to create a system that could use the entire range of the company's 35 mm spherical lenses.

This led to the 2004 introduction of the Genesis HD—a <a href="chroma%20subsampling">full bandwidth (4:4:4)</a> <a href="Serial%20Digital%20Interface">HD SDI</a> camera with improved <a href="colorimetry">colorimetry</a>- and <a href="sensitometry">sensitometry</a>-related specs. Its <a href="Super%2035%20mm%20film">Super 35 mm film</a>–sized recording area made it focally compatible with regular 35 mm lenses, giving it a true 35 mm <a href="depth%20of%20field">depth of field</a>. The camera's electronics—including its CCD (<a href="charge-coupled%20device">charge-coupled device</a>) <a href="image%20sensor">image sensor</a>—and <a href="HDCAM-SR">HDCAM SR</a> <a href="video%20tape%20recorder">record deck</a> were manufactured by Sony. The <a href="chassis">chassis</a> and mechanics were designed by a Panavision team led by Albert Mayer Jr., son of the Panaflex designer. The Genesis was first used on "<a href="Superman%20Returns">Superman Returns</a>" (2006) followed soon after by "<a href="Flyboys%20%28film%29">Flyboys</a>" (2006); But the comedy "<a href="Scary%20Movie%204">Scary Movie 4</a>" (2006), shot afterward on a mixture of 35mm film and the Genesis, actually went into general release first because of the extensive visual effects work needed to complete both "Flyboys" and "Superman Returns." Subsequent to the completion of major design work on the Genesis, Panavision bought out Sony's 49 percent share of DHD Ventures and fully consolidated it in September 2004.

During the same period, Panavision began acquiring related motion picture companies, including <a href="EFILM">EFILM</a> (acquired 2001; sold to Deluxe in full by 2004), Technovision France (2004), the motion picture camera-rental arm of the Canadian rental house William F. White International (2005), the digital camera rental company Plus8Digital (2006), the international lighting and equipment company AFM and the camera company One8Six (2006), and the camera inventory of Joe Dunton & Company (2007). On July 28, 2006, Mafco announced it was acquiring the remaining Panavision stock and returning the company to private status. A $345 million credit line from <a href="Bear%20Stearns">Bear Stearns</a> and <a href="Credit%20Suisse">Credit Suisse</a> was secured to finance the company's debt as well as to facilitate "global acquisitions." That same year, Mafco acquired Deluxe Entertainment Services Group.

In March 2010, citing a drop in production and difficulty servicing significant debt as a result of the 1998 Mafco transaction, shareholder <a href="MacAndrews%20%26amp%3B%20Forbes%20Holdings">MacAndrews & Forbes</a> agreed to a <a href="debt%20restructuring">debt restructuring</a> arrangement with Panavision's creditors. <a href="Private%20equity">Private equity</a> firm <a href="Cerberus%20Capital%20Management">Cerberus Capital</a> was the lead investor in the deal, which involved a US$140 million reduction in debt and a US$40 million cash infusion. In return the majority shareholder Ronald Perelman was required to relinquish control of Panavision, and he no longer has any equity in the company. In June 2013, its creditors sued over an unpaid debt of $1.7 million, threatening to dissolve the company if they win.

In September 13, 2018, <a href="Saban%20Capital%20Group">Saban Capital Acquisition Corp.</a> announced the purchase of "Panavision" and "Sim Video International" in a $622 million cash and stock deal. The transaction is aimed at creating a comprehensive production and post-production entity. Saban Capital Acquisition Corp. intends to change its name to Panavision Holdings Inc. and is expected to continue to trade on the Nasdaq stock exchange. 

Panavision 3D was a system for presenting <a href="3-D%20film">3-D film</a> in a <a href="digital%20cinema">digital cinema</a>. It was a passive stereoscopic 3D system that utilized spectral <a href="comb%20filter">comb filter</a>s produced using <a href="thin-film%20optics">thin-film optics</a> technology. In such systems, the <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a> is broken into alternate bands of light that evenly span the entire visible spectrum.

In June 2012 the Panavision 3D system was discontinued by DVPO Theatrical, who marketed it on behalf of Panavision, citing "challenging global economic and 3D market conditions".

Carrow Road

Carrow Road is an <a href="association%20football">association football</a> <a href="stadium">stadium</a> located in <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>, <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, England, and is the home of <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City Football Club</a>. The stadium is located toward the east of the city, not far from <a href="Norwich%20railway%20station">Norwich railway station</a> and the <a href="River%20Wensum">River Wensum</a>.

The club originally played at <a href="Newmarket%20Road%20%28football%20ground%29">Newmarket Road</a> before moving to <a href="The%20Nest%20%28football%20ground%29">The Nest</a>. When The Nest was deemed inadequate for the size of crowds it was attracting, the Carrow Road ground, named after the road on which it is located, was purpose-built by Norwich City in just 82 days and opened on 31 August 1935.

The stadium has been altered and upgraded several times during its history, notably following a fire that destroyed the old City Stand in 1984. Having once accommodated standing supporters, the ground has been <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater</a> since 1992. The ground's current capacity is 27,244, the most recent works being the addition of approximately 1,000 seats in the summer of 2010. The stadium's record attendance since becoming an all-seater ground is 27,137, set during a <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> match versus <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> on 2 April 2016. In the days when fans could stand on <a href="Terrace%20%28stadium%29">terraces</a>, Carrow Road saw a crowd of 43,984 when hosting <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a> for an <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> match in 1963.

Carrow Road has also hosted <a href="National%20under-21%20football%20team">under-21 international football</a> and a number of concerts, including performances by <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> and <a href="George%20Michael">George Michael</a>. The Carrow Road site includes catering facilities and a <a href="Holiday%20Inn">Holiday Inn</a> hotel offering rooms with views of the pitch.

<a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City F.C.</a> played at <a href="Newmarket%20Road%20%28football%20ground%29">Newmarket Road</a> from 1902 to 1908, with a record attendance of 10,366 in 1908. Following a dispute over the conditions of renting Newmarket Road, the club moved to a new home in 1908, a converted disused chalk pit in Rosary Road, <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>. The new ground became known as <a href="The%20Nest%20%28football%20ground%29">The Nest</a>, named for Norwich City's nickname, "The Canaries".

By the 1930s, the ground capacity was proving insufficient for the growing crowds: The Nest's largest crowd was 25,037 in the <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20FA%20Cup">1934–35 FA Cup</a>. The physical limitations of the site of The Nest meant that expansion was not possible, and there were safety problems with the existing structures. The club began looking for alternative accommodation in 1926, their hand forced finally when one corner of the pitch subsided up to 30 feet after old chalk workings collapsed. An attempt to patch up the problem with railway sleepers and soil failed to impress <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> (FA), who wrote to the club on 15 May 1935, saying The Nest "was no longer suitable for large crowds and measures must be taken".

The club's dilemma was acute: the FA no longer approved of large crowds at The Nest, but the new season was just weeks away. About half a mile south of The Nest, they found a new site, the <a href="Boulton%20Paul%20Aircraft">Boulton Paul</a> Sports Ground in Carrow Road, which belonged to <a href="Colman%27s">J. & J. Colman</a>.

The new stadium took its name from the street which encloses the ground on three sides, the fourth boundary being the <a href="River%20Wensum">River Wensum</a>. The name "Carrow" originally refers to the former <a href="Carrow%20Abbey">Carrow Abbey</a> that once stood on the riverside, its name in turn having possible <a href="Vikings">Norse</a> origins. In 1800, John Ridges, owner of the Carrow Abbey Estate and the land opposite on the banks of the Wensum in <a href="Thorpe%20Hamlet">Thorpe Hamlet</a>, "granted permission for a proposed road access across his grounds to Carrow". By 1811, <a href="Martineau%20family">Philip M. Martineau</a>, a surgeon, owned the building, lands and manor of Carrow, including the adjacent Thorpe land. Carrow Hill Road was created on his Carrow Abbey Estate, to provide work for the poor in the community. The road linked Martineau's Bracondale Estate to Carrow Toll Bridge, installed in 1810. Norwich Railway Co. had acquired the land in Thorpe around Carrow Road by the 1840s, and by 1860 the Thorpe site of the future stadium belonged to the firm of J. & J. Colman. The stadium's Thorpe Corner acknowledges this historical link. In 1935, Colman's offered the 20-year leasehold to Norwich City and construction of the new stadium began swiftly on the site: tenders were issued on the day the site was purchased and ten days later, on 11 June, work began.

Initial materials were sourced by demolishing the former "Chicken Run" section of The Nest, with the rubble dumped as a bank at the river end of the new ground. Thereafter, work proceeded quickly, with most of the stands and terraces built by 17 August. A practice match was held on 26 August with work "still in progress", and, after just 82 days, on 31 August, the ground was opened for a <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> fixture featuring <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>. The stadium had an initial capacity of 35,000, including 5,000 seats under cover. Norwich won the game 4–3; the attendance was 29,779, which set a new club record crowd for a home game. The first competitive goal at the ground was scored by Norwich's <a href="Duggie%20Lochhead">Duggie Lochhead</a>.

The new stadium was described by club officials as "the largest construction job in the city since the building of Norwich Castle", "miraculously built in just 82 days" and "the eighth <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">wonder of the world</a>". An <a href="Aerial%20photography">aerial photograph</a> from August 1935 shows three sides of open terracing, and a covered stand with a <a href="Colman%27s">Colman's Mustard</a> advertisement painted on its roof, visible only from the air. The club's association with Colman's has continued into the modern era; in 1997 the club signed a shirt sponsorship deal with the company. The mustard manufacturer's original factory was located adjacent to the stadium in Carrow Road, and the ground was opened by Russell Colman, the President of the club. The author <a href="Simon%20Inglis">Simon Inglis</a> describes the early Carrow Road as comprising "a Main Stand, a covered end terrace and two large open banks". The covered terrace was paid for by Captain Evelyn Barclay, the vice-president of Norwich City; it was constructed in time for the opening of the <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20in%20English%20football">1937–38 season</a>, and while the original construction is long gone, the end retains the name of its benefactor.

At this time, the ground's capacity was 38,000, with space for 10,000 of "the more vociferous of the home and away supporters", in the new Barclay end. The new ground received a royal seal of approval: on 29 October 1938, <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a> watched twenty minutes of the home game versus <a href="Millwall%20F.C.">Millwall</a>, the first time a ruling monarch had watched a Second Division match.

Floodlights were erected at the ground in 1956 and the £9,000 cost nearly sent the club into bankruptcy. However, Norwich's success in the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20FA%20Cup">1958–59 FA Cup</a> (where as a <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> club they reached the semi-final, losing to <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a> after a replay) secured the financial status of the club and provided sufficient funds for a cover to be built over the South Stand. In 1963, the record was set for attendance at Carrow Road: a crowd of 43,984 watched a <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20FA%20Cup%23Sixth%20Round">sixth round FA Cup match</a> against <a href="Leicester%20City%20F.C.">Leicester City</a>, and the South Stand was covered shortly afterwards.

In the wake of the <a href="1971%20Ibrox%20disaster">Ibrox stadium disaster in 1971</a>, a government enquiry brought more stringent safety requirements, which, when applied to Carrow Road, resulted in the capacity being drastically reduced to around 20,000. With focus on the dangers of standing, seats began to replace terracing: by 1979, the stadium had a capacity of 28,392, with seats for 12,675. A fire in 1984 partially destroyed one of the stands which eventually led to its complete demolition and replacement by 1987 with a new City Stand. When it opened, then chairman <a href="Robert%20Chase%20%28businessman%29">Robert Chase</a> compared the experience of visiting the new stand to "going to the theatre – the only difference being that our stage is covered with grass".

After the <a href="Hillsborough%20disaster">Hillsborough disaster</a> in 1989 and the subsequent outcome of the <a href="Taylor%20Report">Taylor Report</a> in 1990, the stadium was converted to <a href="all-seater%20stadium">all-seater</a>. In 2003 the South Stand was replaced by the new, 8,000-seat Jarrold Stand. In the summer of 2010, work was undertaken to increase the ground's capacity from 26,018 to 27,000. This was achieved by finding additional capacity for seats within the existing stands.

In 2004, £700,000 was invested in improving the pitch. The former all-grass surface was replaced with a sand-based <a href="Desso%20GrassMaster">Desso GrassMaster</a> one, the mix of artificial and real grass which, according to the then groundsman Gary Kemp "guarantee[d] that the pitch would be looking good enough for every match to be broadcast on TV". The <a href="under-soil%20heating">under-soil heating</a> system "can clear snow and ice within eight hours of being turned on".

In anticipation of the ground's 80th anniversary on 31 August 2015, a rematch of the original fixture versus West Ham was played on 28 July. As part of the celebrations, the club offered season ticket holders the opportunity to mark their seats with their name or a message. Fans were also offered the chance to buy tickets for a celebratory dinner with the first-team squad, the menu provided by the club's joint majority shareholder, the celebrity chef <a href="Delia%20Smith">Delia Smith</a>.

The current stadium consists of four stands; the Regency Security Stand, the Barclay, the Geoffrey Watling City Stand and the most recent addition, the rebuilt South Stand.

This end of the ground, closest to the River Wensum, was originally known as the "River End", a name that still persists among fans. An old stand was demolished in April 1979 and a two-tiered replacement was completed in December 1979. The stand was officially named the Norwich & Peterborough Stand in the 1990s, after a sponsorship deal with the <a href="Norwich%20%26amp%3B%20Peterborough%20Building%20Society">Norwich & Peterborough Building Society</a>. An extra 160 seats were installed in the summer of 2010. The stand was renamed the Regency Security Stand after a deal with Regency Security, the current security firm of the club. 

The Barclay is named after Captain Evelyn Barclay, a former vice-president of the club, who donated the cost of roofing the original stand. This was built in 1937, but demolished in 1992, when a new two-tier structure, modelled on the River End was built in accordance with the recommendations of the Taylor Report.

Local brewers Woodforde's Brewery were announced as the stand's sponsors in June 2018. 

The single-tiered Geoffrey Watling City Stand was built following a severe fire in its ageing predecessor on 25 October 1984. The fire was apparently caused by an employee of the club leaving a three-bar electric fire switched on overnight.

The City Stand (as it was named at the time) cost £1.7 million to build and was used for the first time on 30 August 1986 when City hosted <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>. It was formally opened by the <a href="Katharine%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Kent">Duchess of Kent</a> on 14 February 1987. The stand was renamed in honour of Norwich City president <a href="Geoffrey%20Watling">Geoffrey Watling</a>, who died in 2004, aged 91. The stand has the lowest capacity of the four; it also houses the directors' box, the press area and hospitality suites. Where The Barclay extends around to meet the Geoffrey Watling City Stand is the Thorpe corner infill, known to supporters as 'The Snakepit'.

The South Stand is on the site of the former South Stand, which was named in honour of <a href="Arthur%20South">Sir Arthur South</a>. The new stand was partially opened for the game against <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> on 31 January 2004, and fully opened for the next home match, a game versus <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham</a>. It was opened by <a href="Ken%20Brown%20%28footballer%29">Ken Brown</a>, a former manager of both clubs.

From 2004 until May 2016 the stand was sponsored by <a href="Jarrolds">Jarrolds</a>, a local department store. It is a single-tiered stand of <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a> construction with a capacity of 8,212. From 2016, the infill where the hotel is situated a large rotating screen which allows fans in the South Stand and the Barclay Stand to see various video broadcasts relating to the club. The corner infill between the Jarrold and Norwich & Peterborough stands is called the Aviva Community Stand. It was built in 2005 and named after sponsors <a href="Aviva">Aviva</a>. It seats up to 1,700 fans, and also provides extensive facilities for disabled supporters.

On 15 June 2016, it was announced that following the termination of Jarrold as the stand's sponsor, the stand would revert to its historical name of the South Stand. Irish coffee company The Galway Roast were announced as the stand's new sponsors, which would be officially called The South Stand sponsored by The Galway Roast. On 2 November 2016, the club announced that the sponsorship deal with The Galway Roast had been terminated and the stand would once again simply be known as The South Stand.

On 25 November 2016, the club announced a new sponsorship of The South Stand with NVCS with their Green Farm Coffee brand. Although the stand name remained the same with the new sponsor.

Accommodation for visiting supporters is provided in the end of the South Stand closest to The Barclay. The "Essential Football Fan" describes the away end as follows:

"As you would expect from a new stand, the facilities and view of the playing action are good. The normal allocation in this area is 2,500 fans although this can be increased further for cup games. If you are located at the very back of the stand then you can enjoy some fine views of the city."

The corner between The Barclay and the Jarrold Stand contains a <a href="Holiday%20Inn">Holiday Inn</a> hotel, which opened in 2007. The hotel, with six floors and 150 rooms, is held by Holiday Inn on a 150-year lease from the club, which received in return a 30% stake in the hotel and £1.1 million.

Catering at Carrow Road is provided by <a href="Delia%27s%20Canary%20Catering">Delia's Canary Catering</a>, which is part of Norwich City Football Club PLC. Smith took control of the catering at the club in 1999.

Coffee is supplied to Carrow Road by Green Farm Coffee. Coffee is available in the kiosks to fans as instant coffee and fresh filter coffee is provided in the boxes and throughout restaurants including Delia's Restaurant and Bar and Yellows American Bar & Grill.

Catering facilities include: "Yellows American Bar & Grill", an American-style <a href="diner">diner</a> located in the Norwich & Peterborough Stand; and "Delia's Restaurant and Bar", located in the Norwich & Peterborough Stand. "The Gunn Club" is a catering facility behind The Barclay, named after former player and <a href="Manager%20%28association%20football%29">manager</a> <a href="Bryan%20Gunn">Bryan Gunn</a>. There are a number of other conference facilities around the ground, many named after former players and club officials such as <a href="Darren%20Huckerby">Darren Huckerby</a> and Sir Arthur South, as well as former club sponsors <a href="Lotus%20Cars">Lotus Cars</a>.

Carrow Road is approximately ten minutes walking distance from <a href="Norwich%20railway%20station">Norwich railway station</a>, which is on the <a href="Great%20Eastern%20Main%20Line">Great Eastern Main Line</a> to <a href="Liverpool%20Street%20station">Liverpool Street station</a>. Although resident parking scheme is in force in the roads surrounding the stadium, a <a href="park-and-ride">park-and-ride</a> facility operates around the city centre enabling visitors to the ground to arrive by bus.

Norwich City have a capped season ticket allocation of 22,000, with a waiting list. The club regularly sells out its home allocation of tickets and, in <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Premier%20League">2013–14</a>, the ground had an occupancy rate of 99.95%, one of the highest in the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>.

In this context, the club has often stated that it plans to increase the capacity of the stadium in the future, The Geoffrey Watling City Stand has foundations designed to support a second tier, and the roof could be removed and replaced after a second tier is added. In January 2011, chairman <a href="Alan%20Bowkett">Alan Bowkett</a> announced an interest in expanding the ground by about 8,000 seats, because Carrow Road was routinely close to capacity. Bowkett said:
The trade off is between capacity and price. I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's getting a bit expensive Alan' and I know it is. I think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible thing to do is bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be the people who have been the supporters for many generations.

In 2012, the club commissioned the <a href="University%20of%20East%20Anglia">University of East Anglia</a> to undertake a study of the costs of significantly increasing the ground's capacity. The study's report cited a cost of £20 million to expand the ground by 7,000 seats. In response, chief executive <a href="David%20McNally%20%28football%29">David McNally</a> announced that the club would therefore only expand the stadium at such a time that Norwich City has become a fixture in the Premier League. At the club's 2015 AGM, it was reiterated that expansion of the ground was not a priority, although developing the training facilities at <a href="Colney">Colney</a>, was.

Carrow Road has never hosted a match involving the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national team</a>, but the <a href="England%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">England under-21 team</a> has played at the stadium on five occasions. The first was in 1983 in a <a href="UEFA%20European%20Under-21%20Championship">European Under-21 Championship</a> qualifying match against <a href="Denmark%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Denmark</a>, which England won 4–1. The team played another qualifying match in the same tournament at the stadium in 1997, beating <a href="Greece%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Greece</a> 4–2. The <a href="Slovakia%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Slovakia</a> team featured in a <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly match</a> at the ground in June 2007, England winning 5–0 in front of a crowd of 20,193 people. In 2010, the ground played host to a <a href="2011%20UEFA%20European%20Under-21%20Championship%20qualification%20play-offs">play-off</a> against <a href="Romania%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Romania</a>, a game the home side won 2–1 in front of a then record all-seated attendance for the stadium of 25,749. Most recently, in October 2012, the England U21s defeated their <a href="Serbia%20national%20under-21%20football%20team">Serbian counterparts</a> 1–0 at Carrow Road.

Games involving the <a href="England%20national%20under-19%20football%20team">England under-19 team</a> and the full <a href="England%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">England women's team</a> have also been played at the stadium. The women's team have played there on two occasions; the first a 1–0 defeat to <a href="Nigeria%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Nigeria</a> in July 2002, in front of over 8,000 fans, and the second a 1–0 victory over <a href="Iceland%20women%27s%20national%20football%20team">Iceland</a> in March 2006, before a 9,616 crowd.

The stadium has occasionally hosted music concerts. <a href="Status%20Quo%20%28band%29">Status Quo</a> played a concert there in 1997. <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, supported by <a href="Lulu%20%28singer%29">Lulu</a>, appeared at the venue in 2005. <a href="George%20Michael">George Michael</a> gave a performance there on 12 June 2007, supported by <a href="Sophie%20Ellis-Bextor">Sophie Ellis-Bextor</a>, and <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a> performed a concert at the stadium in June 2011.

The Elton John and George Michael concerts both attracted crowds of over 20,000 people. Andrew Cullen, the director of sales and marketing for the Carrow Road ground, told <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Norfolk">BBC Radio Norfolk</a> prior to the George Michael performance that he hoped such concerts would become an annual summer event for the venue, if big enough star names could be attracted.

Sidney George Barnes (5 June 1916 – 16 December 1973) was an Australian <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er and cricket writer, who played 13 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> between 1938 and 1948. Able to <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">open the innings</a> or <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Top%20order">bat down the order</a>, Barnes was regarded as one of Australia's finest batsmen in the period immediately following the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. He helped create an enduring record when scoring 234 in the second Test against England at Sydney in December 1946; exactly the same score as his captain, <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>, in the process setting a world-record 405 run <a href="wicket%23Partnership">fifth wicket</a> <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a>. Barnes averaged 63.05 over 19 innings in a career that, like those of most of his contemporaries, was interrupted by the Second World War.

He made his <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> début at the end of the 1936–37 season when selected for <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> and was later included in the team for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">1938 Australian tour of England</a>, making his Test début in the final international of the series. On the resumption of Test cricket after the war, he was picked as the opening partner to <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a>. Barnes was a member of <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">"The Invincibles"</a>, the 1948 Australian team that toured England without losing a single match. Retiring from cricket at the end of that tour, Barnes attempted a comeback to Test cricket in the 1951–52 season that was ultimately and controversially unsuccessful.

Barnes had a reputation as an eccentric and was frequently the subject of controversy. This included a celebrated <a href="Defamation">libel</a> case, following his exclusion from the national team in 1951–52 for "reasons other than cricket ability". He was later involved in an incident where, acting as <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a>, he performed his duties on the ground in a suit and tie (rather than <a href="Flannels">'whites'</a>), carrying a bizarre range of superfluous items. Despite this reputation, Barnes was a shrewd businessman who used the opportunities afforded by cricket to supplement his income through trading, journalism and <a href="Real-estate%20developer">property development</a>. Increasing <a href="paranoia">paranoia</a> brought about by <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a> saw Barnes lose many of the friends he had made through the game, as he sought treatment for his depression. On 16 December 1973, he was found dead at his home in the Sydney suburb of <a href="Collaroy%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Collaroy</a>; he had ingested <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a>s and <a href="bromide">bromide</a> in a probable suicide.

Barnes was born in 1916 in <a href="Annandale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Annandale</a>, an inner suburb of Sydney. However, in his autobiography, he claims to have been born in 1918 or 1919 in <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, and his military service record has his date of birth as 5 June 1917. He was the third child of Alfred Percival Barnes and Hilda May Barnes (née Jeffery), both from farming families near <a href="Tamworth%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tamworth</a> in northern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. After marrying, the couple left Tamworth to take up a lease on a remote <a href="sheep%20station">sheep station</a> near <a href="Hughenden%2C%20Queensland">Hughenden</a> in North Queensland. Before Sid was born, Alfred died from <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>, caused by drinking contaminated water on the family property. After his death, Hilda, widowed and pregnant with her latest child, moved to Sydney with her children and stayed with her sister, where Sid was born. From her husband's estate, Hilda Barnes mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in <a href="Stanmore%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Stanmore</a> and <a href="Leichhardt%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Leichhardt</a>, New South Wales, to let or sell. Later in life, Barnes would recount how, as a child, he used to collect the rents for his mother.

Barnes attended <a href="Stanmore%2C%20New%20South%20Wales%23Schools">Stanmore Public School</a> and, although not a scholar, was a keen participant in sporting activities. His introduction to cricket came via his older brother, Horrie; Horrie was a useful batsman who played in the local Western Suburbs Churches league and paid Sid <a href="Sixpence%20%28Australian%29">sixpence</a> to bowl to him after he finished work. Taking an interest in the game, Sid had trials for the school team and was eventually selected in the first XI. An early controversy saw Barnes suspended for three weeks for disputing an <a href="umpire%20%28cricket%29">umpire</a>'s decision. Successes for both his school team and his local club team, St. Augustine, saw him acquire the nickname "The Governor-General"—the nickname of Australian Test player, <a href="Charlie%20Macartney">Charlie Macartney</a>, and he was selected for New South Wales Schoolboys to play teams from <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a> and <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>.

In 1932–33, Barnes joined the <a href="Petersham%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Petersham</a> club, and began playing in the third XI. Former Test batsman <a href="Tommy%20Andrews%20%28cricketer%29">Tommy Andrews</a> became his mentor at the club and in 1933–34, Barnes made his <a href="Sydney%20Grade%20Cricket">first-grade cricket</a> début as a <a href="batsman">batsman</a>/<a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> against Paddington, facing the bowling of <a href="Hunter%20Hendry">Hunter Hendry</a> and <a href="Alan%20McGilvray">Alan McGilvray</a>. He was soon successful, scoring a century against Manly in February. Even as a young and inexperienced cricketer, he showed a "brash confidence in his own ability."
When praised for his batting by the great Test bowler <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a>, Barnes responded "Thanks very much, you didn't bowl too badly yourself", leaving O'Reilly speechless.

This success led Barnes to consider cricket as a potential career. However, his mother and stepfather were concerned about the likelihood of cricket providing him with a living. In response, Barnes took a job with a <a href="Automobile%20repair%20shop">garage</a> in <a href="Mosman%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Mosman</a> but after finding that the necessary travel interfered too much with playing cricket, he found alternative employment, demonstrating motorbikes in the city.

Barnes had come to the attention of the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> selectors by the 1936–37 season and was included as <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a> in the side to play the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201936-37">visiting English side</a>, taking a catch on the boundary to dismiss <a href="Stan%20Worthington">Stan Worthington</a>. He made his <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> début in the final <a href="Pura%20Cup">Sheffield Shield</a> match of the season, against <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a> at the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a>. Batting at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Middle%20order">number five</a>, Barnes scored 31 and 44, twice being dismissed <a href="leg%20before%20wicket">LBW</a> by the <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>ner <a href="Frank%20Ward%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201906%29">Frank Ward</a>. Whilst fielding, Barnes managed to find himself in controversy again, <a href="run%20out">running out</a> <a href="Vic%20Richardson">Vic Richardson</a>, the opposition captain, after the end of the <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">over</a> was called. The square leg umpire had not heard the call of "Over" and upheld the <a href="appeal%20%28cricket%29">appeal</a>, much to the disgust of Richardson. The New South Wales captain <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a>, whom Barnes idolised, withdrew the appeal.

Barnes was selected for New South Wales for the opening match of the 1937–38 season against <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a> making 68 in a rain-affected match. Against the touring <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20cricket%20team">New Zealanders</a>, Barnes fell just short of his maiden first-class century, scoring 97. He appeared to have reached the landmark when scoring 127 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> against <a href="Western%20Warriors">Western Australia</a>, but the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Cricket%20Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a> retrospectively deemed the match to be not of first-class status, angering Barnes. He finally scored his maiden first-class century (110) against Victoria in the final game of the season, completing his hundred while bleeding profusely after being struck on the jaw by a ball delivered by <a href="Ernie%20McCormick">Ernie McCormick</a>. As a result of his performances over the season (scoring over 800 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a>, averaging 50.56), Barnes was selected as the youngest member of the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">Australian cricket team to tour England in 1938</a>.

Unfortunately for Barnes, he broke his wrist while exercising on the sea voyage to England for the 1938 tour, keeping the injury secret until the tourists had departed <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, for fear of being sent home. On arrival in England, he therefore did not play an innings until the last day of June, missing exactly half of the 30 first-class matches scheduled for the tour, including the first two Tests, both of which were drawn. His first innings was 42 against <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> and he shared in a fourth wicket stand of 176 with <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown</a>, who made an unbeaten 265. The third Test was a wash-out and he was not picked for the fourth, which the Australians won, although in his autobiography he claimed that he was considered as a candidate to be wicketkeeper, having deputised for <a href="Ben%20Barnett">Ben Barnett</a> in that role in tour matches against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a> and <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>. In the event, his Test début came in the final Test, played at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. Barnes had to field for 16 hours as England amassed a total of 903 for seven declared, then the highest Test score. Barnes bowled 38 overs in the innings and took the seventh wicket, that of <a href="Arthur%20Wood%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201898%29">Arthur Wood</a>, for 84 runs. With both <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a> and <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> injured and unable to bat, Australia struggled – England won by an innings and 579 runs – still the largest winning margin in Test cricket history; but Barnes played innings of 41 and 33 and, according to <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden</a>, "well justified his choice". In all first-class matches on the tour, Barnes scored 720 runs, and reached 90 three times, though without going on to a first-class century. He scored 140 in a two-day match against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a>, which was not considered first-class.

His international career was then put on hold, as all foreign tours were suspended during the Second World War. He continued to play first-class cricket in Australia, before enlisting in the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> in May 1942. Barnes's time in the military was short. A man who was proud of his appearance, he had a uniform made to measure when the one issued did not fit. He met champion golfer <a href="Norman%20Von%20Nida">Norman Von Nida</a> early into his enlistment and the two were assigned to the <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Armoured Division</a> in <a href="Greta%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Greta</a>. A shortage of tanks and the military regimen led to boredom and Barnes used his hitherto ignored trade background to his advantage, seeking a release to join a tank-making company, which was granted. Von Nida and Barnes remained friends and business partners for many years afterwards.

After scoring 1,050 runs (including six centuries) at an average of 75.00 in the 1940–41 season, Barnes played little cricket until 1945–46, when he scored centuries in five successive matches for New South Wales. He was picked for the <a href="History%20of%20cricket%20in%20New%20Zealand%20from%201945-46%20to%201970%23Australia%201945-46">1945–46 Australian tour of New Zealand</a> and played in the representative match that was later designated as the first Test match between the two countries: he made 54 as Australia won easily. The post-war period also saw a new approach to batting on the part of Barnes. He discarded his aggressive and flamboyant shot-making and re-invented himself as a watchful, more defensive player, which made his scoring more prolific, although less crowd pleasing.

Barnes was made captain of New South Wales for the 1946–47 Australian season, though he only managed to play three matches for the state team. One of those was the match against <a href="MCC%20tour%20of%20Australia%20in%201946%E2%80%9347">the touring MCC team</a>, and Barnes was approached during the match about becoming an <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">opening batsman</a> for the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series">forthcoming Test series</a>. He wrote in his autobiography: "I had never opened before and was a little dubious. I had, however, struck new balls at different periods of innings and was not afraid of that." He also liked the idea of batting ahead of Bradman in the batting order: "Much better, I thought, to get in before him than to come later, like flat beer after champagne."

Barnes was first-choice as an opener with <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> throughout the Test series, although it was not until the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Third%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Melbourne">Third Test</a> that they had a first-wicket partnership of any substance. Morris had broken into the team as an opener after an injury sidelined Bill Brown for the entire season.

The <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23First%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Brisbane">First Test at Brisbane</a> was dominated by Australia, a pattern that was to be a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the tub in which our drinks were kept, staggered to the side of the dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass. Those English eyes certainly did stand out.

Bradman had words with Barnes after this match about his new role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think what you want to watch as an opener is not getting out ... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is patience and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.

Years later, Barnes wrote about the effect this had on his batting style. There was one angle about this change of batting position that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [sic] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence ... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting ... If I were to become an Australian Test opening batsman I would have to conform to standard. I would have to put up the shutters ... And so I came to the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Second%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Sydney">Second Test in Sydney</a> ready to drape myself in the gloomy colors of a Test opening batsman.

It was during the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Second%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Sydney">Second Test at Sydney</a> in December 1946, that Barnes made a lasting impression on the world game. Having <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">opened the innings</a>, he made his top Test score of 234 and helped to set a world-record 405 run <a href="wicket%23Partnership">fifth wicket</a> <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> with <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>, a record that still stands today.
On a rain-affected pitch <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> was out at 1/24 and <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> came out as a <a href="Nightwatchman%20%28cricket%29">nightwatchman</a> He and Barnes angered the crowd by launching into a <a href="Umpiring%20in%20the%201946%E2%80%9347%20Ashes%20series%23Bad%20Light">series of bad light appeals</a> – up to 12 were counted – before the umpires gave way and play was ended with an hour to spare. This ensured that Australia would not have to play on a sticky wicket and allowed Bradman to rest his leg until play resumed on the Monday. After the series Barnes said on radio;

We could have played on, but it was a Test match and we just had to win. I realised something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, in an effort to get the appeal upheld. <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Hammond</a> and <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Yardley</a> were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.

Barnes played carefully on the still suspect pitch the following day and late in the afternoon Bradman, lower in the order than usual due to a leg injury, joined Barnes with the score at 4/159. Over six and a half hours later, Bradman was out for 234. Barnes was dismissed just four balls later, also for 234, having batted for over ten hours. In his autobiography, Barnes stated that the coincidence of scores was intended. "Lots of people have asked me whether I deliberately threw my wicket away at 234. The answer is yes." He confirmed to an interviewer many years later that "it wouldn't be right for someone to make more runs than Sir Donald Bradman".
<a href="E.W.%20Swanton">E.W. Swanton</a> wrote that this "could well have been so for he was a man of <a href="Quixotism">quixotic</a> mood and temperament". However the England bowler, <a href="Alec%20Bedser">Alec Bedser</a> wrote "It was when I was bowling to Sid at Sydney that I first discovered that I could move the ball to leg by use of my wrist and fingers...I held the ball in the same manner as a <a href="wrist%20spin">leg-break bowler</a> with the fingers across the seam...and on pitching I was surprised to see the ball go away like a leg-break. It also surprised Sid Barnes". This would make Barnes the first batsman to be dismissed by Bedser's "Special Ball" which would claim Bradman for a duck in the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Fourth%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Adelaide">Fourth Test at Adelaide</a>.

Barnes injured his hand during fielding practice before the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Third%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Melbourne">Third Test</a>, and although he went on to play in that game (scoring 45 and 32), he opted out of batting in a state game – according to his autobiography, this cost him the New South Wales captaincy – and he missed the fourth Test. He returned for the final Test and top-scored with 71 in Australia's first innings, adding 30 in the second.

Barnes went to England in 1947. In his autobiography, he claimed that he went as a representative for a wine and spirits company, although after the initial mention of that there is no further word and he appears also to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply because of rationing in England. Once in England, he was approached by <a href="Burnley%20Cricket%20Club">Burnley</a> to play as a professional in <a href="Lancashire%20League%20%28cricket%29">Lancashire League</a> cricket, which he did for a while before finding it "too much of a drag" and resigning.

Barnes returned to Australia for the 1947–48 season, keen to win a place on the 1948 tour to England. He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, but at the same time suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams to fall back on should he not be picked. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers. In fact, lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201947-48">the Indian tourists</a>, Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.

The match between Victoria and New South Wales was Barnes's chance to redeem himself. "Wisden" reported it thus: 
Barnes needed a score to rehabilitate himself in the eyes of the Test Selectors and he spent all Saturday over 131 runs while 20,000 impatient spectators barracked loudly. His dismissal on the third day evoked cheers all round the ground.

He followed that century (158 in total) with a similarly plodding 80 not out in the second innings, and was picked for the third Test, with Brown dropped after a series of low scores in the first two Tests. Barnes made only 12 and 15, jeopardising his place, but what "Wisden" termed "another of his dour, determined but faultless innings for top score" in the New South Wales game against South Australia ensured a second chance. In the fourth Test at <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide</a> he made 112 and put on 236 with Bradman for the second wicket. With 33 in the final match of the series, his place on the 1948 tour was secure, though he had to give assurances about the amount of contact he would have with his wife, still living in Scotland, before he was confirmed.

The 1948 Australia team that toured England has become known as "The Invincibles", because they did not lose a single game. Following their performances during the Australian <a href="Cricket%20season">season</a>, Barnes and Morris were favoured as Australia's first-choice opening pair, while Brown batted out of position in the middle order in the first two Tests.

Before the second Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>, Barnes wagered £8 at 15/1 on himself to score a century. He made a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> in the first innings but ensured success in the second, making 141.

Barnes and Morris shared century opening partnerships at Lord's and <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, where their 117 run stand dwarfed the 52 <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23A">all out</a> made by the entire England team. In addition to his century at Lord's, Barnes made three other scores over 60 in the series.

When fielding, Barnes stationed himself as close to the bat as possible at either <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">forward short-leg or point</a>. The report of the tour in the 1949 edition of <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>, stated that Barnes's fielding was as important a factor as his batting in "The Invincibles"' success: Probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on the bowler running up, but equally important was the fact that the knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction. The Barnes demeanour in the field illustrated the general purposefulness of the Australians.

However, he received criticism for this approach and it resulted in him missing the fourth Test at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a> through injury. In England's first innings of the third Test, he was hit in the ribs by a full-blooded pull shot from <a href="Dick%20Pollard">Dick Pollard</a> from the bowling of <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a>, and had to be carried from the pitch by four policemen. The following day, he collapsed while practising in the nets, and when he went in to bat at number six, he collapsed again and had to <a href="Substitute%20%28cricket%29%23Retired%20hurt">retire hurt</a>. After this, he was taken to hospital where he spent 10 days before rejoining the tour for the <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> match that followed the fourth Test.

Barnes thus played in four of the five Tests, missing the fourth Test through injury. He scored 329 runs, averaging 82.25. During the first-class tour matches, Barnes's performance was less spectacular. In all first-class matches on the tour, he amassed 1354 runs, averaging 56.41. Barnes made 176 in 255 minutes against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> early in the tour, but, apart from his Test hundred, his only other century came in the final tour match, when the final 50 runs of his 151 against the <a href="H.%20D.%20G.%20Leveson-Gower">H. D. G. Leveson-Gower</a> XI at the <a href="Scarborough%20Festival">Scarborough cricket festival</a> came in just 25 minutes.

An important concern for Barnes, when returning from the United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs <a href="Duty%20%28economics%29">duties</a> on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.

Barnes played in Bradman's testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948, but otherwise made himself unavailable for first-class cricket, preferring to pursue business interests. He wrote a regular column for Sydney's "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Sydney%29">The Daily Telegraph</a>", prosaically titled "Like It or Lump It", in which he often criticised the administration of the game and the amounts paid to Australia's leading cricketers. Barnes was one of a number of cricket writers of the immediate post-war era who adopted a confrontational <a href="tabloid%20%28newspaper%20format%29">tabloid</a> style of journalism, in contrast to the more sedate reporting of the 1930s.

At the beginning of the 1951–52 season, Barnes had a change of heart and returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to play Test cricket again. He approached <a href="Aubrey%20Oxlade">Aubrey Oxlade</a>, the chairman of Australian cricket's <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Board of Control</a>, to ask if there was any impediment to his return to the Australian team. Oxlade told Barnes that he would be judged solely on his batting performances.

During his absence from the Test team, the Australian selectors had been unsuccessful in their attempts to find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The selectors duly picked him for the match, then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement. When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a "<a href="cause%20c%C3%A9l%C3%A8bre">cause célèbre</a>" for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.

The Board of Control had granted themselves the power to exclude a player from the national team "on grounds other than cricket ability" following the poor behaviour of some members of the 1912 team that toured England. They had a secret dossier, compiled during the season, documenting Barnes's behaviour and they doctored the minutes of the meeting at which they discussed his selection. Publicly, the Board remained silent on their policy and how it related to Barnes. On the field, Barnes responded with an innings of 128 in three hours against Queensland; off the field, he sought answers from the administrators, but was frustrated by their evasiveness. His form tapered off during the closing stages of the season and he finished with 433 first-class runs at an average of 39.36.

Just as the furore appeared to have died down, in April 1952 Sydney's "<a href="The%20Daily%20Mirror%20%28Australia%29">Daily Mirror</a>" published a letter from a reader, Jacob Raith. Responding to a letter in support of Barnes, Raith sided with the Board and suggested that his character was to blame for the omission. Acting on legal advice, Barnes sued Raith for <a href="Defamation">libel</a> and engaged Sydney's leading <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, Jack Shand KC, as counsel.

The case began in Sydney's District Court on 21 August 1952. Shand's examination of the various Board members appearing for the defendant revealed the Board's maladministration, pettiness and its acceptance of rumour as fact. No firm reason was put forward for the omission of Barnes and a division within the Board was evident when several of its members spoke highly of him. As Barnes began his testimony on the second day of proceedings, Raith's counsel announced settlement of the case and commented to the court, "seldom in the history of libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly". Barnes was vindicated with a full public apology.

Although the court case portrayed "an awful image of the chaos and bigotry under which Australian cricket was administered", it did little to alter the Board's culture. The next major court case involving Australian cricket, the <a href="World%20Series%20Cricket">World Series Cricket</a> challenges of 1977–78 demonstrated that the Board was still run as a "closed shop", over 25 years later. In an analysis of the Barnes libel case, <a href="Gideon%20Haigh">Gideon Haigh</a> wrote, "far from becoming a watershed in player-administrator relations, it may even have discouraged players contemplating defiance of the Board but lacking the wherewithal to retain a hotshot criminal barrister."

Resuming for New South Wales in 1952–53, Barnes scored 152 against Victoria in the last match before the beginning of the <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201952-53">Test series against South Africa</a>. Nevertheless, the selectors overlooked him for the first Test and in the following state match, against South Australia at the <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a>, Barnes offered to act as <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a> to provide an opportunity for a younger player, <a href="Ray%20Flockton">Ray Flockton</a>. During a drinks break on the second day of the match, he appeared on the ground in a suit and tie, (rather than <a href="Flannels">'whites'</a>) carrying superfluous items such as cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a clothes brush. The crowd initially responded well to the joke, but their mood soured when the interval extended beyond its scheduled time and Barnes received criticism for delaying the game. The South Australian team, captained by Australian selector <a href="Phil%20Ridings">Phil Ridings</a>, officially complained to the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Cricket%20Association">New South Wales Cricket Association</a> (NSWCA), which asked Barnes to express regret over the incident. Despite the association's support for Barnes during his problems of the previous season, he prevaricated. Eventually, the NSWCA forwarded a written apology on his behalf.

Barnes appeared just once more for New South Wales, against South Africa at New Year 1953, then made himself unavailable for selection, conceding that "his card had been marked". The <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201953">Australian team</a> toured England in 1953 and lost the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23A">Ashes</a> after holding them for 19 years. Barnes wrote "Eyes on the Ashes", a book about the tour that included trenchant criticism of the behaviour of the Australian team, which did not go down well with some of his former team-mates.

Barnes gripped the bat very low on the handle and bent over so far in his stance that the knuckles of his right hand were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.

Journalist <a href="Ray%20Robinson%20%28cricket%20writer%29">Ray Robinson</a> called Barnes the <a href="Artful%20Dodger">Artful Dodger</a> of cricket, alluding to both his batting style and his off-field business dealings, and wrote that he "would rather steal a run like a pickpocket than hit an honest four with a straightforward stroke." Robinson summarised his safety-first approach in going so far back as the bowler delivered:
Though this routine made his play air-tight in one way, it simplified opposing captains' field-placing to curb his scoring, it left him with a back-foot addict's liability to go leg-before-wicket or be caught behind on either side, and it allowed his attackers to bowl their most awkward length ... he could have made more runs since the war as a stroke-player, and won popular backing as a candidate for the title of world's best batsman, instead of the austere distinction of looking the hardest Australian to get out.

<a href="David%20Frith">David Frith</a> wrote of <a href="Bill%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Brown's</a> memories of Barnes as a person, and his controversial fielding:

'Bagga' Barnes was also Bill's room-mate, and his affection for his late lamented pal, a lovable rogue, was obvious. He recalled the furore over Barnes's provocative field positioning, extremely close at silly mid-on, and how criticism of his foot being too close to the mown pitch prompted him to plonk his boot a couple of feet into the forbidden territory – and a couple of feet more when the English crowd roared at him.

He was a part-time <a href="leg%20spin">leg break</a> bowler, taking 57 wickets in first-class cricket at a useful average of 32.21. Barnes's leg break spun very little, but he had a <a href="topspinner">topspinner</a> which hurried onto the batsman and yielded him many wickets. Barnes was also a substitute wicket-keeper and a versatile fieldsman. During his career, he was noted for his disaffection for cricket administrators and umpires. On the 1948 tour of England, after an Australian <a href="appeal%20%28cricket%29">appeal</a> was turned down by umpire <a href="Alec%20Skelding">Alec Skelding</a>, he grabbed a stray dog and presented it to Skelding, stating: "Now all you want is a white stick". A complex character, Barnes, "rarely forgave a slight or forgot a good turn. Stocky, with blue eyes and powerful wrists, he had a passion for physical fitness, and was an enthusiastic big-game fisherman and golfer".

Barnes married a schoolteacher, Alison Margaret Edward on 11 June 1942. Alison was the daughter of Kenneth Edward, a <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> <a href="Professor">Professor</a> of <a href="Theology">Theology</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>. The couple met at a country dance, when Barnes, on his way back from an <a href="exhibition%20match">exhibition match</a> in <a href="Katoomba%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Katoomba</a>, was bet the price of the meal that he could not get the young girl to dance with him. Within twelve months the pair were married.

Outside of cricket, Barnes followed his mother into <a href="real-estate%20developer">property development</a> (see <a href="Sid%20Barnes%23Early%20years">above</a>) and at various times entered into partnerships with <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> and <a href="Norman%20Von%20Nida">Norman Von Nida</a>. His suspicious nature, which grew as time passed, saw these partnerships and developments end in arguments and recriminations. While Barnes was not a millionaire, he was a successful and organised businessman.

As a writer, Barnes had no claims to literary talent; his copy was <a href="ghostwriter">ghost-written</a>, in all likelihood by his friend Jack Tier and later by former professional <a href="rugby%20league">rugby league</a> footballer <a href="Peter%20Peters">Peter Peters</a>. His writing was of a provocative tone; his column in the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>" during the 1953 tour was called "The Aussie They Couldn't Gag". His forthright opinions certainly cost him friends and hardened the opinions of others about him. At the end of the 1953 tour, he published "Eyes on the Ashes", and his autobiography, "It Isn't Cricket". He also wrote "The Ashes Ablaze" in 1955, and turned to full-time writing, mostly for Sydney's "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Sydney%29">The Daily Telegraph</a>". His columns were perceived as being deliberately controversial, and, as time went by, increasingly regarded as carping.

In later life, Barnes suffered from depressive illness. He was diagnosed with <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a> and treated with a combination of medication, mainly <a href="diazepam">diazepam</a>, and <a href="electroconvulsive%20therapy">electroconvulsive therapy</a>. He spent much of his last years in and out of clinics seeking treatment for his condition. In 1973, Barnes died at his home in <a href="Collaroy%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Collaroy</a>, one of Sydney's northern beach suburbs, from <a href="barbiturate">barbiturate</a> and <a href="bromide">bromide</a> poisoning. Although the medications were certainly self-administered, the <a href="coroner">coroner</a> could not "determine intent". 

Only six players with ten or more completed innings have achieved an end of career average in excess of 60. Barnes's 63.05 in 19 innings ranks him as number three in the history of Test cricket, behind Sir <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a> (99.94, 80 innings) and <a href="Stewie%20Dempster">Stewie Dempster</a> (65.72, 15 innings).

Barnes's short career was dominated by his monumental double hundred, but he was a consistent performer, as the chart (left) reveals. Age did not seem to diminish his abilities; in his last eight Test innings, aged 31–32, he passed 50 five times and scored two of his three Test hundreds. 

Comparing players from Test cricket is an exercise usually flawed by the different conditions, rules of the day and oppositions faced. However, a useful comparison can be made between Barnes and Bradman because they were contemporaries in the same team. Bradman is generally acknowledged as the greatest <a href="batsman">batsman</a> of all time, fully a third better (statistically) than the next best man in history (see completed career averages chart, right). Barnes and Bradman
played together in three series. In those series, Barnes's averages bear comparison to Bradman's, particularly in the more combatitive <a href="The%20Ashes">Ashes</a> series:

Another way of viewing a player's performance without distortion is by using the <a href="ICC%20Player%20Rankings">world rankings</a>, which have been applied retrospectively to assess the careers of past players. However, the ratings employ a measure to "damp down the oscillation of points of new players". Because Barnes played only 19 Test innings, his performances are weighted to just under 85% of their full value. Consequently, even in his own day, he is rated as no better than seventh in the world, at his peak.

These Are the Voyages...

"These Are the Voyages..." is the <a href="series%20finale">series finale</a> of the American <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction television</a> series "". The 22nd episode of the and the 98th of the series overall, it first aired on the <a href="UPN">UPN</a> network in the United States on May 13, 2005. "These Are the Voyages..." is a <a href="frame%20story">frame story</a>, where the 22nd-century events of "Star Trek: Enterprise" are shown through a 24th-century <a href="holodeck">holodeck</a> re-creation during the "" episode "". The episode features guest stars <a href="Jonathan%20Frakes">Jonathan Frakes</a>, <a href="Marina%20Sirtis">Marina Sirtis</a>, and <a href="Jeffrey%20Combs">Jeffrey Combs</a>, as well as a voice cameo from <a href="Brent%20Spiner">Brent Spiner</a>. Series creators <a href="Rick%20Berman">Rick Berman</a> and <a href="Brannon%20Braga">Brannon Braga</a>, who co-wrote the episode, conceived "These Are the Voyages..." as a valentine to <a href="Trekkie">"Star Trek" fans</a>.

Set in the 22nd century, the series follows the adventures of the first <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> starship "<a href="Enterprise%20%28NX-01%29">Enterprise</a>", registration NX-01. In this episode, the story moves to the year 2370, when Commander <a href="William%20Riker">William Riker</a> grapples with making a difficult admission to his commanding officer about a cover-up. Riker, after consulting Counselor <a href="Deanna%20Troi">Troi</a>, turns to the simulated events of the year 2161 for guidance, when the crew of "Enterprise" travels home to Earth for both decommissioning and the formation of the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">United Federation of Planets</a>.

Reaction to "These Are the Voyages..." was negative. Critics and cast alike believed the "Next Generation" frame robbed the characters and their fans of closure, and that the death of Commander <a href="Charles%20Tucker%20III">Tucker</a> felt forced and unnecessary. The final episode attracted 3.8 million viewers, the highest number since the previous season. After a strong premiere, "Enterprise" had grappled with declining ratings throughout its run. By the fourth season, fewer than three million viewers tuned in each week despite what some fans and critics considered an increase in episode quality. After selling the syndication rights, UPN and <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount</a> announced in February 2005 that the fourth season would be the show's last. With no new "Star Trek" episodes in the fall of 2005, the 2005–2006 season was the first year without a first-run "Star Trek" in 18 years. Despite the cancellation, Paramount hoped to revive the series, and Berman began work on a possible new "Star Trek" film, which was ultimately rejected in favor of the <a href="J.%20J.%20Abrams">J. J. Abrams</a>-directed "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>".

In 2370, Commander <a href="William%20Riker">William Riker</a>, aboard <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-D%29">"Enterprise"-D</a>, is troubled by the events of "" and seeks guidance. At Lieutenant Commander <a href="Deanna%20Troi">Deanna Troi</a>'s suggestion, Riker sets a <a href="holodeck">holo-program</a> to the date 2161, some six years after the events of "<a href="Terra%20Prime">Terra Prime</a>", to a time when the original <a href="Enterprise%20%28NX-01%29">"Enterprise" (NX-01)</a> is due to be decommissioned after ten years of active service. The starship and its crew are also returning to Earth for the signing of the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets%23Depiction">Federation Charter</a>, and Captain <a href="Jonathan%20Archer">Archer</a> frets over the speech he will give to the assembled delegates.

En route, Riker and Troi observe as "Enterprise" is contacted by <a href="Thy%27lek%20Shran">Shran</a>, a former <a href="Andorian%23History">Andorian Imperial Guard</a> who Archer believed was dead. Apparently his young daughter has been kidnapped, and he asks for Archer's help in rescuing her from <a href="Rigel%20in%20fiction%23Star%20Trek">Rigel X</a>. Archer decides to assist, despite Commander <a href="T%27Pol">T'Pol</a>'s warning that they may be late returning for the ceremony. Riker joins the "Enterprise" crew as it assaults Shran's enemies and brings his daughter safely back. Troi also advises that Riker assume the role of ship's chef, hoping to earn the confidence of the simulated crew. As he prepares food with the crew, he learns more about their memories and impressions of <a href="Trip%20Tucker">Tucker</a>.

He also watches as the kidnappers board "Enterprise", and how, in order to save Archer's life, Commander Tucker overloads two conduits and dies after being mortally wounded. Riker notices that Archer is troubled that he must write a speech about how worthwhile their explorations have been, despite his friend's death, but T'Pol assures him that Tucker would have considered it worthwhile. On Earth, Troi watches as Archer enters a crowded grand hall to give his speech and Riker joins her, now sure of what course he should take. The final shot of the episode is a montage of the ships named "Enterprise" as Captains <a href="Jean-Luc%20Picard">Picard</a>, <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">Kirk</a>, and Archer recite the "<a href="Where%20no%20man%20has%20gone%20before">Where no man has gone before</a>" Prologue.

"These Are the Voyages..." was written by Braga and Berman, the pair's only script of the fourth season. "Enterprise" writer <a href="Mike%20Sussman%20%28TV%20series%20writer/producer%29">Mike Sussman</a> told <a href="TrekNation">TrekNation</a> in May 2005 that Braga had considered the idea of an episode crossover featuring characters from other "Star Trek" series prior to the finale. Sussman's original idea for the episode was to have of "" treating an ill patient who may or may not have been Archer trapped in the future. Due to the subject matter, Sussman said his version would not have been suitable for the final episode. In interviews, Berman said that the episode had always been intended as the season finale regardless of cancellation, and gave conflicting answers regarding whether Trip would still have been killed if the show was to continue.

<a href="Allan%20Kroeker">Allan Kroeker</a> directed the episode, his third series finale following ""s "<a href="What%20You%20Leave%20Behind">What You Leave Behind</a>" and ""s "". "These Are the Voyages..." featured guest appearances by <a href="Jonathan%20Frakes">Jonathan Frakes</a> and <a href="Marina%20Sirtis">Marina Sirtis</a> as their "Next Generation" characters <a href="William%20Riker">William Riker</a> and <a href="Deanna%20Troi">Deanna Troi</a>. <a href="Brent%20Spiner">Brent Spiner</a>, another "Next Generation" veteran who had guest-starred earlier in the fourth season of "Enterprise", had an off-screen speaking role as the android <a href="Data%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Data</a>. <a href="Jeffrey%20Combs">Jeffrey Combs</a> appeared as the <a href="Andorian">Andorian</a> <a href="Thy%27lek%20Shran">Shran</a>, whom Coto had wanted to be a permanent addition to the cast in the event of another season.

Filming of the final episode began on Friday, February 25, after the first half of the day was spent completing "Terra Prime". Principal photography took eight days to complete, one day longer than usual. The snowy complex set of <a href="Rigel%20in%20fiction%23Star%20Trek">Rigel X</a>, first seen in the pilot episode, was used, as was the rarely seen "Enterprise"s galley. "Enterprise"-D locations such as hallways and the observation lounge were re-created. Frakes and Sirtis arrived at the lot at the same time that a "Save Enterprise" rally was being held outside the gates. Similar to "What You Leave Behind", many of the production staff cameoed for a large crowd scene at the end of the episode, as Archer prepares to give his speech. Fifteen "VIPs" including writers <a href="Judith%20and%20Garfield%20Reeves-Stevens">Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Bormanis">André Bormanis</a>, and Manny Coto joined two dozen extras in forming part of the audience. The rest of the digital set was filled by a computer-generated crowd. After their parts were finished, the final dismissal of each cast member was met with applause. <a href="Jolene%20Blalock">Jolene Blalock</a> and <a href="Scott%20Bakula">Scott Bakula</a> were the last actors to be released, and Bakula gave a speech thanking the production crew for making the cast feel welcome. Filming ended on Tuesday, March 8, and the sets were struck. Frakes and Sirtis returned on March 9 to complete green screen shots, which would be used when their characters entered or exited the holodeck. Before the episode's release, Berman would not elaborate on the final episode's content, saying "It's going to have some surprising twists and turns. It's somewhat of a valentine."

"These Are the Voyages..." was negatively received by both critics and the show's cast. Before the episode aired, Blalock called the episode "appalling." She followed up her remarks by saying she was upset over the finale being a "The Next Generation" episode rather than an end for "Enterprise".
<a href="Connor%20Trinneer">Connor Trinneer</a> (who played Commander <a href="Trip%20Tucker">Trip Tucker</a>), felt that the finale should have had a memorable farewell that he described as a ""<a href="Goodbye%2C%20Farewell%20and%20Amen">M*A*S*H</a>" moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. <a href="Anthony%20Montgomery">Anthony Montgomery</a> (who played Ensign <a href="Travis%20Mayweather">Travis Mayweather</a>) was similarly displeased with the finale and said, "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. It just seemed to take a little bit away from what the "Enterprise" cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that "the reality is it was a bit of a stretch to have us shut down [the "Enterprise" cast's] show," and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just "Enterprise" but "Star Trek" as a whole.

Reviewers were also critical of the "Next Generation" tie-in. "<a href="Syfy%23Science%20Fiction%20Weekly">Sci Fi Weekly</a>"'s Patrick Lee said the framing story "reduces [the "Enterprise" cast] to the status of lab rats." Lee further noted that even without the guest appearances, the episode did not live up to the best offerings of the season, including "<a href="In%20a%20Mirror%2C%20Darkly">In a Mirror, Darkly</a>". "<a href="National%20Post">National Post</a>"s Alex Strachan called the "Next Generation" cameos reminders of better "Star Trek", compared to the "bad make-up effects, bad acting, bad music" of the latest show. Rob Salem of the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" said the cameos served no narrative purpose, and that the episode "robs [the] characters (and their fans) of any significant long-term development or satisfying sense of closure." Reviewers also criticized the episode's ending, where viewers never got to see Archer's rousing speech. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> said that the episode was "Berman and Braga's parting shot, making sure that everyone knew who was in charge," and that the sharp contrast between "These Are the Voyages..." and "Terra Prime" brought into relief the reason why both should not be allowed to produce "Star Trek" ever again.

The death of Tucker was another object of controversy. Salem described the development as "a major character is pointlessly killed off in service of a pointless plot device," a complaint echoed by IGN. Actor <a href="Connor%20Trinneer">Connor Trinneer</a>, who played Trip, said during a convention appearance that the character had "gotten out of much worse scrapes than that," and the death seemed forced. The writers, Trinneer contended, wanted to kill off a character to "get the fans talking," and so Trip was killed off simply to manipulate viewers. Several critics ended their reviews by saying that whether fans would be disappointed or pleased by the episode, the majority of casual viewers would not care one way or another.

In response to some of these criticisms, Coto stated that he personally considered the two-part story "" and "<a href="Terra%20Prime">Terra Prime</a>" that preceded "These Are the Voyages..." the actual finale of the "Enterprise" storyline. Berman said "I've read a lot of the criticisms and I understand how some people feel, but [Braga] and I spent a lot of time coming up with the idea and a somewhat, I would say, unique ending to a series, especially when you’re ending it prematurely. [...] You never like to disappoint people, but I think it's nonsense to say that it was more a "Next Generation" episode than an "Enterprise" episode. The only elements of ["The Next Generation"] that were present were there as a sounding board to allow us to look at a mission that took place six years after "<a href="Terra%20Prime">Terra Prime</a>"."

In 2009, Den of Geek, while acknowledging cast critiques of the finale, stated that "These Are the Voyages...'" was the tenth best episode of the series, praising the inclusion of Riker and Troi and remarking the "undeniable joy in seeing the familiar and beloved characters back on screen."

The episode was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> home media as part of the season four box set on November 1, 2005 in the United States. The <a href="Blu%20ray">Blu ray</a> release of the final season of "Enterprise" was made available on April 29, 2014.

"", "Enterprise"s 2001 premiere episode, attracted 12.5 million viewers in its first broadcast, but ratings quickly dropped to a low of 5.9 million viewers. "Enterprise" was threatened with cancellation by the third season. The show survived by slashing its budget amid broadcaster <a href="UPN">UPN</a>'s schedule revamp. The show was moved to Fridays in 2004, while the rest of UPN's programming became more female-friendly, in part due to the success of "<a href="America%27s%20Next%20Top%20Model">America's Next Top Model</a>". The third season introduced a season-long story arc, to some of the best reviews of the entire series. In the fourth season, <a href="Manny%20Coto">Manny Coto</a> became executive producer after writing and co-producing the show since 2003. While Coto's episodes were hailed by critics and fans as equaling the quality of previous "Star Trek" television series, the average viewership dropped to 2.9 million, with a series-low showing of 2.5 million in January 2005. According to TrekNation, "Enterprise"s final episode attracted 3.8 million viewers, an increase of 69% over the previous season's finale.

On February 3, 2005, UPN and Paramount announced that the fourth season of the show would be its last. The network waited until the series had been sold to syndication before making the announcement. The cancellation marked the first time new "Star Trek" episodes would not appear on television in 18 years, since "" premiered. The fourth season continued production so that Paramount could sell an attractive 98 episodes to syndicates.

A series-ending wrap party was held for the cast and crew at the <a href="Roosevelt%20Hotel%20%28Hollywood%29">Roosevelt Hotel</a> in April. Cast members spoke about their feelings about the end of the series. <a href="John%20Billingsley">John Billingsley</a> said the show "was a great ride, and it changed my life. It's something that will last forever for me." He was happy to say goodbye to the two-hour makeup sessions to create his character, <a href="Phlox%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Phlox</a>. Many of the cast were taking a break and going on vacation before seeking new acting jobs. Among the notable guests were "" screenwriter <a href="John%20Logan%20%28writer%29">John Logan</a>, who was not affiliated with "Enterprise", and <a href="Peter%20Weller">Peter Weller</a>, who appeared as a villain in "Terra Prime".

Actress <a href="Jolene%20Blalock">Jolene Blalock</a> (T'Pol) criticized the early stories as boring and lacking intriguing content. She felt that early "Enterprise" scripts ignored basic tenets of "Star Trek" chronology, and offered "revealing costumes instead of character development". UPN executives stated that the male-oriented episodes of "Enterprise" did not mesh with the viewership of its other top shows, such as "Top Model" and "<a href="Veronica%20Mars">Veronica Mars</a>". <a href="Brannon%20Braga">Brannon Braga</a> suggested that the reason for the cancellation was viewer fatigue, noting that "after 18 years and 624 hours of "Star Trek", the audience began to have a little bit of overkill." Fans, meanwhile, criticized Berman and Braga for ignoring "Star Trek" canon and refusing to fix their shows. Michael Hinman, news coordinator for <a href="Airlock%20Alpha">SyFy Portal</a>, stated that in addition to the oversaturation of "Star Trek", there "also is an oversaturation of Braga and Berman. [...] They couldn't sit back and say, 'You know, we just can't keep this fresh.' No, it was more about their stupid egos, and their nonsensical 'Even if it's broke, don't fix it' attitude." Braga defended the series, noting that "The Next Generation" faced little competition from other science fiction shows, while "Enterprise" had to contend with a plethora of shows such as "<a href="Battlestar%20Galactica%20%282004%20TV%20series%29">Battlestar Galactica</a>".

Newspapers covering "Enterprise"s cancellation and its final episode often said that the failure of "Enterprise" was evidence that the franchise had moved too far from its roots and grown too dark. Andy Dehnhart of <a href="MSNBC">MSNBC</a> said that "while the writers and production designers deserve credit for offering worlds that were perhaps slightly more believable, they lost the fantastic, wondrous approach to space travel that "The Next Generation" borrowed from the original "Star Trek" and then perfected." "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"s Michael Peck said that without the "dreams" of earlier series, ""Star Trek" becomes just another television drama." Melanie McFarland of the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>", meanwhile, said the show "never found the sense of uniqueness within the "Trek" universe that every version that came before it possessed." Despite the cancellation, Paramount remained optimistic. Studio head David Stapf looked "forward to a new chapter of this enduring franchise in the future." Berman and screenwriter Erik Jendrensen developed a concept for a new film taking place after "Enterprise" but before the 1960s television show. Meanwhile, Paramount asked <a href="Roberto%20Orci">Roberto Orci</a> for ideas to revive the franchise, resulting in the production of a reboot film set in an alternate timeline from the 1966–2005 franchise simply titled "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>", released in May 2009 and directed by <a href="J.%20J.%20Abrams">J. J. Abrams</a>.

GRB 970228

GRB 970228 was the first <a href="gamma-ray%20burst">gamma-ray burst</a> (GRB) for which an <a href="Afterglow%20%28gamma-ray%20burst%29">afterglow</a> was observed. It was detected on 28 February 1997 at 02:58 <a href="UTC">UTC</a>. Since 1993, physicists had predicted GRBs to be followed by a lower-energy afterglow (in wavelengths such as <a href="radio%20waves">radio waves</a>, <a href="x-rays">x-rays</a>, and even <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a>), but until this event, GRBs had only been observed in highly <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> bursts of high-energy <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s (the most energetic form of <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>); this resulted in large positional uncertainties which left their nature very unclear. 

The burst had multiple peaks in its <a href="light%20curve">light curve</a> and lasted approximately 80 seconds. Peculiarities in the light curve of GRB 970228 suggested that a <a href="supernova">supernova</a> may have occurred as well. The position of the burst coincided with a galaxy about 8.1 billion <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s away (a <a href="redshift">redshift</a> of z = 0.695), providing early evidence that GRBs occur well beyond the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>; this was proven decisively two months later with a subsequent burst <a href="GRB%20970508">GRB 970508</a>. 

A gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a highly <a href="luminosity">luminous</a> flash of <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a>s, the most energetic form of <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a>. GRBs were first detected in 1967 by the <a href="Vela%20satellites">Vela satellites</a>, a series of spacecraft designed to detect nuclear explosions.

GRB 970228 was detected on 28 February 1997 at 02:58 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> by the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GRBM) and one of the Wide Field Cameras (WFCs) on board <a href="BeppoSAX">BeppoSAX</a>, an Italian–Dutch satellite originally designed to study X-rays. The burst lasted around 80 seconds and had multiple peaks in its light curve. Gamma-ray bursts have very diverse time profiles, and it is not fully understood why some bursts have multiple peaks and some have only one. One possible explanation is that multiple peaks are formed when the source of the gamma-ray burst undergoes <a href="precession">precession</a>.
Within a few hours, the BeppoSAX team used the X-ray detection to determine the burst's position with an error box—a small area around the specific position to account for the <a href="Measurement%20uncertainty">error</a> in the position—of 3 <a href="arcminute">arcminute</a>s. The burst was also detected by the <a href="Ulysses%20%28spacecraft%29">Ulysses</a> space probe.

About one and nine days later, optical images of the error box were taken with the <a href="William%20Herschel%20Telescope">William Herschel Telescope</a> on La Palma; comparison of the images revealed a fading point source located at a <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> of and a <a href="declination">declination</a> of , providing the first arcsecond-accuracy localization of any Gamma-ray burst. 

Later images after the point source faded revealed a faint galaxy at almost the same position, the presumed host galaxy of the burst; a chance position coincidence was unlikely but possible, so the cosmological origin of GRBs was not conclusive until observations of <a href="GRB%20970508">GRB 970508</a> about two months later.

In 1993, <a href="Bohdan%20Paczy%C5%84ski">Bohdan Paczyński</a> and James E. Rhoads published an article arguing that, regardless of the type of explosion that causes GRBs, the extreme energetics of GRBs meant that matter from the host body must be ejected at <a href="relativistic%20speed">relativistic speed</a>s during the explosion. They predicted that the interaction between the ejecta and <a href="interstellar%20matter">interstellar matter</a> would create a <a href="shock%20front">shock front</a>. Should this shock front occur in a magnetic field, accelerated electrons in it would emit long-lasting <a href="synchrotron%20radiation">synchrotron radiation</a> in the <a href="radio%20frequencies">radio frequencies</a>, a phenomenon that would later be referred to as a radio afterglow. Jonathan Katz later concluded that this lower-energy emission would not be limited to radio waves, but should range in frequency from radio waves to <a href="x-ray">x-ray</a>s, including <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a>.

The Narrow Field Instruments on board BeppoSAX began making observations of the GRB 970228's position within eight hours of its detection. A transient x-ray source was detected which faded with a <a href="power-law">power-law</a> slope in the days following the burst. This x-ray <a href="Afterglow%20%28gamma-ray%20burst%29">afterglow</a> was the first GRB afterglow ever detected. Power-law decays have since been recognized as a common feature in GRB afterglows, although most afterglows decay at differing rates during different phases of their lifetimes.

Optical images were taken of GRB 970228's position on 1 and 8 March using the <a href="William%20Herschel%20Telescope">William Herschel Telescope</a> and the <a href="Isaac%20Newton%20Telescope">Isaac Newton Telescope</a>. Comparison of the images revealed an object which had decreased in luminosity in both <a href="visible%20light">visible light</a> and <a href="infrared%20light">infrared light</a>. This was the burst's optical afterglow. Deeper follow-up observations using the <a href="New%20Technology%20Telescope">New Technology Telescope</a> showed that the afterglow coincided with a distant, small galaxy: the first evidence of the extragalactic, cosmological nature of Gamma-ray bursts. After the gamma-ray bursts itself had faded away, very deep observations taken with the <a href="Keck%20telescopes">Keck telescopes</a> showed the underlying galaxy to have a redshift of 0.695. The predicted radio afterglow was never detected for this burst. At the time of this burst's discovery, GRBs were believed to emit radiation <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a>ally. The afterglows from this burst and several others—such as <a href="GRB%20970508">GRB 970508</a> and <a href="GRB%20971214">GRB 971214</a>—provided early evidence that GRBs emit radiation in <a href="collimated">collimated</a> jets, a characteristic which lowers the total energy output of a burst by several <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a>.

<a href="Daniel%20Reichart">Daniel Reichart</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> and <a href="Titus%20Galama">Titus Galama</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Amsterdam">University of Amsterdam</a> independently analyzed GRB 970228's optical light curve, both concluding that the host object may have undergone a <a href="supernova">supernova</a> explosion several weeks before the gamma-ray burst occurred.

Galama analyzed the light curve of the burst and found that its luminosity decayed at different rates at different times. The luminosity decayed more slowly between March 6 and April 7 than it did before and after these dates. Galama concluded that the earlier light curve had been dominated by the burst itself, whereas the later light curve was produced by the underlying <a href="Type%20Ic%20supernova">Type Ic supernova</a>. Reichart noted that the late afterglow was <a href="visual%20spectrum">redder</a> than the early afterglow, an observation which conflicted with the then-preferred relativistic fireball model for the gamma-ray burst emission mechanism. He also observed that the only GRB with a similar temporal profile was <a href="GRB%20980326">GRB 980326</a>, for which a supernova relation had already been proposed by <a href="Joshua%20Bloom">Joshua Bloom</a>.

An alternative explanation for the light curves of GRB 970228 and GRB 980326 involved <a href="light%20echo">dust echoes</a>. Although GRB 980326 did not provide enough information to definitively rule out this explanation, Reichart showed that the light curve of GRB 970228 could only have been caused by a supernova. Definitive evidence linking gamma-ray bursts and supernovae was eventually found in the <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of <a href="GRB%20020813">GRB 020813</a> and the afterglow of <a href="GRB%20030329">GRB 030329</a>. However, supernova-like features only become apparent in the weeks following a burst, leaving the possibility that very early luminosity variations could be explained by dust echoes.

During the night between 12 and 13 March, <a href="Jorge%20Melnick">Jorge Melnick</a> made observations of the region with the <a href="New%20Technology%20Telescope">New Technology Telescope</a>. He discovered a faint <a href="nebula">nebula</a>r patch at the burst's position, almost certainly a distant galaxy. Although there was a remote chance that the burst and this galaxy were unrelated, their positional coincidence provided strong evidence that GRBs occur in distant galaxies rather than within the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. This conclusion was later supported by observations of <a href="GRB%20970508">GRB 970508</a>, the first burst to have its <a href="redshift">redshift</a> determined.

The position of the burst's afterglow was measurably offset from the <a href="centroid">centroid</a> of the host galaxy, effectively ruling out the possibility that the burst originated in an <a href="active%20galactic%20nucleus">active galactic nucleus</a>. The redshift of the galaxy was later determined to be z = 0.695, which corresponds to a distance of approximately . At this distance, the burst would have released a total of assuming <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a> emission.

Gloucestershire Regiment

The Gloucestershire Regiment, commonly referred to as the Glosters, was a <a href="line%20infantry">line infantry</a> <a href="regiment">regiment</a> of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> from 1881 until 1994. It traced its origins to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot raised in 1694, which later became the <a href="28th%20%28North%20Gloucestershire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot</a>. The regiment was formed by the merger of the 28th Regiment with the <a href="61st%20%28South%20Gloucestershire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot</a>. It inherited the unique privilege in the British Army of wearing a badge on the back of its headdress as well as the front, an honour won by the 28th Regiment when it fought in two ranks back to back at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alexandria">Battle of Alexandria</a> in 1801. At its formation the regiment comprised two <a href="Regular%20army">regular</a>, two <a href="Militia%20%28Great%20Britain%29">militia</a> and two <a href="Volunteer%20Force%20%28Great%20Britain%29">volunteer</a> battalions, and saw its first action during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>.

Before the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the regiment's four auxiliary battalions were converted to three <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> battalions and a <a href="Militia%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%23The%20Special%20Reserve">reserve</a> battalion, and a further 18 battalions were added to the regiment's establishment during the war. Sixteen battalions of the regiment saw active service in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and Salonika, losing a total of 8,100 men killed and winning 72 different <a href="battle%20honour">battle honour</a>s. Four awards of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (VC) were made to soldiers serving with the regiment. The wartime battalions were disbanded as the war ended, and just before the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, two of the territorial battalions were re-purposed and ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment. On the eve of the war, the remaining territorial battalion was duplicated, and another five battalions were raised on the outbreak of war, though most of these were disbanded or re-purposed as the war progressed. Four battalions saw active service under the regiment's colours during the war. The 2nd and 5th Battalions both fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a> and, after being lost almost in its entirety during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dunkirk">Battle of Dunkirk</a>, the re-formed 2nd Battalion landed at <a href="Gold%20Beach">Gold Beach</a> on <a href="Normandy%20landings">D-Day</a> and fought in the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> campaign in North-West Europe. The 1st Battalion was involved in the retreat from Rangoon during the <a href="Japanese%20conquest%20of%20Burma">Japanese conquest of Burma</a>, and the 10th Battalion saw active service in the defeat of Japanese forces during the <a href="Burma%20Campaign%201944%E2%80%9345">Burma Campaign 1944–45</a>.

After the Second World War, the hostilities-only battalions were disbanded and the 1st and 2nd Battalions were <a href="wikt%3Aamalgamated">amalgamated</a>, leaving the regiment with one regular and one <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> battalion. It achieved fame during the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> when the 1st Battalion held out for three nights against overwhelming odds during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Imjin%20River">Battle of the Imjin River</a>. The stand, described by the commander of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> forces in Korea at the time as "the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war", prevented the encirclement of other United Nations forces, for which the regiment was awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28United%20States%29">Presidential Unit Citation</a> and earned the nickname "The Glorious Glosters". Two men serving with the regiment were awarded the VC for their actions in the battle. In the latter half of the 20th century, the regiment was reduced to a single regular battalion and completed tours of duty around the world, including Germany, Africa, the Caribbean, Central America and the Middle East, as well as in Northern Ireland during <a href="The%20Troubles">The Troubles</a>. Shortly after celebrating its tercentenary in 1994, the regiment, which carried more battle honours on its <a href="Military%20colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">colours</a> than any other regiment of the line, was merged with the <a href="Duke%20of%20Edinburgh%27s%20Royal%20Regiment">Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment</a> to form the <a href="Royal%20Gloucestershire%2C%20Berkshire%20and%20Wiltshire%20Regiment">Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment</a>. The new regiment inherited the back badge, and when it too was merged in 2007, it passed the tradition on to its successor, <a href="The%20Rifles">The Rifles</a>.

The Gloucestershire Regiment traced its roots to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of Foot, raised in 1694 in Portsmouth, which first saw action in 1705 during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Spanish%20Succession">War of the Spanish Succession</a>. Having been commanded by, and therefore named after, a succession of colonels, the regiment was renamed in 1742 as the 28th Regiment of Foot and fought under this name during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Austrian%20Succession">War of the Austrian Succession</a>. Another predecessor, the 61st Regiment of Foot, was formed in 1758 when the British Army was expanded during the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>. The 61st Regiment gained its first battle honour a year later during the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Guadeloupe%20%281759%29">invasion of Guadeloupe</a>, the same year that <a href="James%20Wolfe">General Wolfe</a> placed himself at the head of the 28th Regiment on the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Plains%20of%20Abraham">Plains of Abraham</a> in the capture of Quebec.

In 1782, the British Army began linking foot regiments with counties for the purposes of recruitment. For the first time the county of <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a> was associated with both the 28th and 61st Regiments, which were renamed as the <a href="28th%20%28North%20Gloucestershire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot</a> and the <a href="61st%20%28South%20Gloucestershire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot</a>. Both regiments began to recruit from the county, and it was in Gloucester in December 1782 that the 61st Regiment was presented with new colours to replace those lost during the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Minorca%20%281781%29">Franco-Spanish invasion of Minorca</a> earlier that year.

In March 1801, the 28th Regiment formed part of the British expeditionary force that landed at Aboukir Bay in Egypt to oppose <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon's</a> Army of the East. On 21 March, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alexandria">Battle of Alexandria</a>, French cavalry broke through the British lines, formed up behind the regiment, and began to charge. With the men still heavily engaged to their front, the order was given for the rear rank to turn about, and standing thus in two ranks back to back, the regiment successfully held the line. For this action the 28th Regiment was accorded the unique privilege of wearing the regimental number both on the front and the back of its headdress. The 61st Regiment also deployed to Egypt and, although arriving too late to play an active part, was, like the 28th Regiment, awarded the battle honour "Egypt" and the right to display the Sphinx on its colours.
During the 19th century, relatively uneventful postings at home and abroad were punctuated with periods of active service. The 28th and 61st Regiments both fought in Spain and Portugal during the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>. The 28th Regiment also participated in the final defeat of Napoleon; it was commended by the <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a> for gallantry in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Quatre%20Bras">Battle of Quatre Bras</a> and saw action again in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a>. In the mid-19th century, both regiments were deployed to India, and the 61st Regiment saw active service during the <a href="Second%20Anglo-Sikh%20War">Second Anglo-Sikh War</a> and the <a href="Indian%20Rebellion%20of%201857">Indian Mutiny</a>, adding "Chillianwallah", "Goojerat", "Punjaub" and "Delhi 1857" to the list of battle honours that the Gloucestershire Regiment would soon inherit. The 28th Regiment, whose time in India was shorter and less eventful, was meanwhile deployed to the <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimea</a> and added "Alma", "Inkerman" and "Sevastopol" to its legacy.

Another thread that would be woven into the story of the Gloucestershire Regiment is that of the civilian administered auxiliary forces which supported the army in times of need. In the mid-18th century, county <a href="Militia%20%28Great%20Britain%29">militias</a> were raised for home defence and as a pool of reserves for the regular army. By 1760, Gloucestershire had raised two battalions of militia, and these were organised in 1763 as the South Gloucestershire Militia based at Gloucester and the North Gloucestershire Militia at <a href="Cecily%20Hill%20Barracks">Cirencester</a>. In 1859, county-based <a href="Volunteer%20Force%20%28Great%20Britain%29">volunteer rifle corps</a> were raised, leading to the formation of the 1st (City of Bristol) Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers and the 2nd Gloucestershire Rifle Volunteers.

In 1872, the <a href="Cardwell%20Reforms">Cardwell Reforms</a> began the process of organising the British Army along county lines based on two-battalion line infantry regiments, a process that was completed by the <a href="Childers%20Reforms">Childers Reforms</a> nine years later. As a result, the 28th and 61st Regiments were amalgamated in 1881 to form the Gloucestershire Regiment, headquartered at <a href="Horfield%20Barracks">Horfield Barracks</a> in Bristol. The reforms also added the county's auxiliary forces to the regiment's establishment, and at its formation it thus comprised two <a href="Regular%20army">regular</a>, two militia and two volunteer battalions:

The Gloucestershire Regiment inherited from the 28th Regiment the privilege of wearing the back badge. It was a privilege that the 2nd Battalion did not want, but it was made palatable to the former 61st Regiment by replacing the number 28 with the Sphinx, a battle honour awarded to both predecessor regiments. Although both battalions were forced to give up their individual <a href="facing%20colour">facing colour</a>s on their uniforms – yellow for the 28th Regiment and buff for the 61st Regiment – when the government imposed a standard white across all English and Welsh regiments, the Gloucestershire Regiment never accepted this change for their <a href="Military%20colours%2C%20standards%20and%20guidons">regimental colours</a>. Both battalions retained their former colours until 1929, when a compromise primrose yellow was finally chosen and a new regimental colour subsequently presented.

The two battalions continued to refer to themselves by their former regimental numbers until they were merged in 1948, when the Gloucestershire Regiment became a single-battalion regiment. The 1st Battalion celebrated the bicentenary of the regiment at Malta in 1894 and the anniversary of the Battle of Alexandria annually. The 2nd Battalion, on the other hand, held games followed by a dinner and a ball on the anniversary of the 61st Regiment's victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Chillianwala">Chillianwallah</a> on 13 January 1849 when overseas, or on the anniversary of that regiment's victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Salamanca">Salamanca</a> on 22 July 1812 when at home.

The new regiment acquired its march, "The Kinnegad Slashers", and its official nickname, "Slashers", from the 28th Regiment. The name arose from an incident in 1764, when members of the regiment allegedly slashed off part of the ear of a Montreal magistrate who had been harassing soldiers stationed in the city after the Seven Years' War. The regiment was also sometimes referred to as "The Old Braggs", from Colonel <a href="Philip%20Bragg">Philip Bragg</a>, who commanded the 28th Regiment when it was still named after its colonels. Two other nicknames associated with the new regiment were inherited from the 61st Regiment; "The Flowers of Toulouse", from the scarlet uniforms of that regiment's many dead in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Toulouse%20%281814%29">Battle of Toulouse</a>, and "The Silver-Tailed Dandies", from the silver decorations on the longer-than-normal coat tails of the 61st Regiment's uniform.

The Gloucestershire Regiment began life quietly. The two battalions alternated between postings at home and overseas, mostly in India, but their first action came in 1899 during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>. Deployed to Ladysmith, the 1st Battalion was part of a column sent out on 24 October to cover the withdrawal of a brigade after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Talana%20Hill">Battle of Talana Hill</a>. When the column came under fire near Rietfontein, the battalion was detached and ordered forward, but the order was ambiguous and the battalion advanced too far. The troops were caught in the open for several hours before they were able to extricate themselves at the cost of five men killed, including the battalion commander, and 58 wounded.

Five days later, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion were part of a small force tasked with seizing Nicholson's Nek, a pass some north of Ladysmith, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ladysmith">Battle of Ladysmith</a>. The troops moved out on the night of 29 October with the intention to be in position before the main battle started, but they left too late to reach their objective before daybreak. As they took up an alternative position on the nearby Tchrengula Hill the pack-mules bolted, taking most of the heavy weaponry and ammunition with them. The Boers discovered the incursion at dawn and surrounded the position, and although the British held out for several hours they were forced to surrender at 12:30. The battalion lost 38 killed and 115 wounded, and the survivors were held as prisoners of war (POWs) in Pretoria.

While the remainder of the 1st Battalion helped in the defence of Ladysmith (the city was eventually <a href="relief%20of%20Ladysmith">relieved</a> on 1 March), the 2nd Battalion deployed to South Africa, arriving in January 1900. The battalion fought in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Paardeberg">Battle of Paardeberg</a>, a nine-day battle which ended on 27 February with the capture of the Boer general <a href="Piet%20Cronj%C3%A9">Piet Cronjé</a> and his force of some 4,000 men. On 15 March, the battalion entered the Boer city of Bloemfontein, where it remained on garrison duties until 1904. The 1st Battalion, re-united when its POWs were liberated after the capture of Pretoria on 5 July, was posted in August 1900 to Ceylon, where it remained until 1903 guarding Boer prisoners of war.

Some of the regiment's auxiliary battalions, which in 1900 were increased in number by the formation of the 3rd Volunteer Battalion, also played a role in the war. On 16 March 1900, a company of 124 officers and men from the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Battalions landed at Cape Town. They served for a year alongside the 2nd Battalion and were replaced by a second volunteer company in April 1901. The 4th (Militia) Battalion, meanwhile, guarded Boer prisoners held on St. Helena. By the war's end the regiment had lost 2 officers and 94 other ranks killed, 13 officers and 201 men wounded, and suffered 250 deaths from sickness. The regiment added 4 new battle honours to its colours: "Defence of Ladysmith"; "Relief of Kimberley"; "Paardeberg"; and "South Africa, 1899–1902"; the last of which was also awarded to the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Battalions.

Following the end of the war in South Africa, the 1st battalion transferred in late 1902 from Ceylon to <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a>, where it was posted to <a href="Lucknow">Lucknow</a>.

Following the <a href="Territorial%20and%20Reserve%20Forces%20Act%201907">Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907</a> – part of the <a href="Haldane%20Reforms">Haldane Reforms</a> which restructured the British Army and converted the militia and volunteer battalions into the <a href="Militia%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%23The%20Special%20Reserve">Special Reserve</a> and the <a href="Territorial%20Force">Territorial Force</a> – the 4th (Militia) Battalion was disbanded, and at the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1914 the Gloucestershire Regiment comprised:

During the war the regiment raised an additional 18 battalions, and in total 16 battalions of the Gloucestershire Regiment saw active service in France and Flanders, Italy, Gallipoli, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and Salonika.

The 1st Battalion was deployed to France in August 1914 and saw action on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. It suffered its first casualties at Landrecies on 26 August 1914 during the <a href="Great%20Retreat">retreat from Mons</a>, and sustained further losses in September during the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20the%20Aisne">First Battle of the Aisne</a>. The battalion entered the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">First Battle of Ypres</a> on 19 October 1914 with 26 officers and 970 other ranks, played a pivotal role in the defence of Langemarck, was called upon several times to counter-attack against enemy breakthroughs and, by the time of its relief four weeks later, had been reduced to 2 officers and 100 other ranks. In December 1914, it fought in the Defence of Festubert, and the next month in the Defence of Givenchy. Later in 1915, the battalion saw action in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aubers%20Ridge">Battle of Aubers Ridge</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Loos">Battle of Loos</a>, and it was active during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Somme offensive</a> in 1916 during the Battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Bazentin%20Ridge">Bazentin</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Pozi%C3%A8res">Pozières</a>, and in an <a href="Attacks%20on%20High%20Wood">attack on High Wood</a>.
Early in 1917, the 1st Division moved south of the Somme, and the 1st Battalion participated in the advance to the <a href="Hindenburg%20Line">Hindenburg Line</a>. In July, the division was allocated to <a href="Operation%20Hush">Operation Hush</a>, a planned seaborne invasion that was later cancelled, and the only significant action the 1st Battalion saw in 1917 was in November, on the last day of the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Second Battle of Passchendaele</a>. On 18 April 1918, during the Battle of Béthune, an engagement in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Lys%20%281918%29">Battle of the Lys</a>, the battalion earned high praise and 33 awards for gallantry when it repulsed an attack by four enemy regiments that had turned the Glosters' flank and, in echoes of the Battle of Alexandria, forced them to fight back to back. The battalion saw action again in September and October on the Hindenburg Line in the Battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20%C3%89pehy">Épehy</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20St%20Quentin%20Canal">St Quentin Canal</a>. The 1st Battalion saw its last action of the war on 4 November 1918 in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Sambre%20%281918%29">Battle of the Sambre</a>, where it helped capture Catillon and the crossing over the Sambre canal, some from the scene of its first casualties over four years previously.

The 2nd Battalion returned from Tianjin in November 1914 and landed in France the next month as part of the <a href="81st%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">81st Brigade</a> in the <a href="27th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">27th Division</a>. Its first significant action came in May 1915 during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Ypres">Second Battle of Ypres</a> – the only German offensive on the Western Front that year – in which the battalion held its ground, though at the cost of 505 casualties. At the end of 1915, the 27th Division was transferred to <a href="XVI%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XVI Corps</a> of the <a href="British%20Salonika%20Army">British Salonika Army</a> on the <a href="Macedonian%20Front">Macedonian Front</a>, and the 2nd Battalion occupied positions west of Lake Beshik (modern day Lake Volvi, Greece). In July 1916, XVI Corps took over the line of the <a href="Struma%20%28river%29">River Struma</a>, and for the next two years the battalion was involved in operations along the Struma valley, from November 1916 as part of the <a href="82nd%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">82nd Brigade</a>. It was a relatively quiet sector, and although the battalion was involved in attacks across the Struma in September, October and December 1916 – the last costing the battalion 114 casualties – and conducted a number of raids in 1917, sickness was more of a threat than enemy action. In July 1918, the 27th Division was transferred to <a href="XII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XII Corps</a> south-west of <a href="Dojran">Dojran</a>, and the capture of the Roche Noire salient on 1 September, at a cost of 89 casualties, was the last action of the 2nd Battalion in the war.

Each of the Territorial Force battalions volunteered for service overseas and raised a second battalion, the six battalions being numbered 1/4th, 2/4th, 1/5th, 2/5th, 1/6th, and 2/6th. The original territorial battalions also raised a third battalion each in 1915 as home-based reserves, though in 1916 these were merged to form the 4th Reserve Battalion. Another home-based territorial battalion, the 17th, was raised in 1917.

The first-line territorials proceeded to France in March 1915 as part of the <a href="48th%20%28South%20Midland%29%20Division">48th (South Midland) Division</a>; the 1/4th and 1/6th Battalions in the <a href="144th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">144th Brigade</a>, and the 1/5th Battalion in the <a href="145%20%28South%29%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">145th Brigade</a>. Their first significant experience of battle came during the Somme offensive; on 16 July, during the Battle of Bazentin, the 1/4th Battalion fought north of Ovillers, and the 1/5th and 1/6th Battalions went into action in the same area on 20 and 21 July respectively. They returned to the area during the Battle of Pozières and fought a number of actions between 13 and 27 August. In February 1917, the 48th Division moved to positions opposite Péronne, and the territorials saw action in March and April during the general advance that followed the <a href="Operation%20Alberich">German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line</a>. The division moved again in July, to Ypres, where the territorials fought in engagements of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a>; the 1/5th Battalion in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Langemarck%20%281917%29">Battle of Langemarck</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Broodseinde">Battle of Broodseinde</a>, and the 1/4th and 1/6th Battalions in the <a href="Action%20of%2022%20August%201917">Action of 22 August 1917</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Poelcappelle">Battle of Poelcappelle</a>. Total losses to the three battalions at Passchendaele numbered 1,186 men.

In December 1917, the 48th Division transferred to Italy, where the battalions were weakened by an outbreak of influenza. In June 1918, the 1/5th and 1/6th Battalions were in action during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20the%20Piave%20River">Second Battle of the Piave River</a>, and the 1/4th and 1/6th Battalions fought their last actions of the war in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vittorio%20Veneto">Battle of Vittorio Veneto</a> at the beginning of November. Meanwhile, the 1/5th Battalion was transferred in September 1918 to the <a href="75th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">75th Brigade</a> of the <a href="25th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">25th Division</a> and returned to France. In October, it fought in the capture of the Beaurevoir Line during the Battle of St Quentin Canal, and in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Selle">Battle of the Selle</a>. During the latter, the battalion was held up for nearly four hours until Private <a href="Francis%20George%20Miles">Francis George Miles</a> went forward alone and knocked out two enemy machine-gun positions, for which action he was awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a> (VC). The final action of the 1/5th Battalion came in November, during the Battle of the Sambre.

The second-line territorials were raised in September 1914 and remained in the UK until they moved to France in May 1916 as part of <a href="61st%20%282nd%20South%20Midland%29%20Division">61st (2nd South Midland) Division</a>; the 2/4th and 2/6th Battalions in <a href="183rd%20%282nd%20Gloucester%20and%20Worcester%29%20Brigade">183rd Brigade</a>, and the 2/5th Battalion in the <a href="184th%20%282nd%20South%20Midland%29%20Brigade">184th Brigade</a>. The three battalions completed tours in the front line around Neuve Chapelle, but for the 2/4th and 2/6th Battalions the first significant action was on 19 July 1916 in a costly and unsuccessful attack in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fromelles">Battle of Fromelles</a> which cost the two battalions a total of 332 casualties. In March and April 1917, the three battalions saw action in the advance to the Hindenburg Line south of the Somme. The 61st Division moved to Ypres in July, and all three battalions fought near Gheluvelt in the Battle of Passchendaele the following month, when the 2/4th Battalion suffered particularly badly with over 200 casualties. In early December, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cambrai%20%281917%29">Battle of Cambrai</a>, a heavy German counter-attack forced both the 2/4th and 2/6th Battalions out of their positions in the front line at La Vacquerie, south-west of Cambrai, reducing the 2/4th Battalion to two companies and inflicting casualties of 16 officers and 308 other ranks on the 2/6th Battalion.

In February 1918, the 2/4th and 2/6th Battalions were disbanded and their men distributed to the 2/5th Battalion and the 24th <a href="Entrenching%20battalions">Entrenching Battalion</a>. At the end of March, 10 days of fighting, retreating and digging-in near St. Quentin reduced the 2/5th Battalion to 150 men during <a href="Operation%20Michael">Operation Michael</a>, the opening phase of the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>. The 61st Division was transferred north to help reinforce First Army in April, and the 2/5th Battalion fought a number of actions south-west of Merville during the Battle of the Lys. In August, the battalion attempted to force a bridgehead across a stream in Nieppe Forest, west of Merville, and fought on 1 September during the advance to the River Lys. The battalion was in battle again on 30 September at Fleurbaix, south-west of Armentières, and saw its last action of the war on 1 and 2 November during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Valenciennes%20%281918%29">Battle of Valenciennes</a>.

As volunteers answered <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener's</a> call to arms, ten <a href="Kitchener%27s%20Army">New Army</a> battalions, the 7th to the 16th, were added to the regiment's establishment between 1914 and 1916. Three of them, the 11th, 15th and 16th, were home-based reserve battalions which later transferred to the <a href="British%20Army%20World%20War%20I%20reserve%20brigades">Training Reserve</a>.

The 7th Battalion was formed in Bristol in August 1914. It sailed to the island of Lemnos in June 1915 as part of the <a href="39th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">39th Brigade</a> in the <a href="13th%20%28Western%29%20Division">13th (Western) Division</a> and went into the line at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> the next month. The battalion fought its first action on 8 August in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chunuk%20Bair">Battle of Chunuk Bair</a>, during which it suffered over 820 casualties, including all of its officers, <a href="warrant%20officer">warrant officer</a>s and senior <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s. It was brought back up to strength and moved to Egypt in January 1916. In March, the 13th Division was transferred to Mesopotamia, but on landing at Basra the battalion was put out of action by an outbreak of <a href="Relapsing%20fever%20borreliosis">relapsing fever</a>. It rejoined the division in the middle of April and fought in the unsuccessful attempt to lift the <a href="siege%20of%20Kut">siege of Kut</a>. The battalion saw action in December 1916 and February 1917 during the subsequent advance on and <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Kut">capture of Kut</a>, and fought its last battle on 29 March 1917 during the <a href="Samarrah%20Offensive">Samarrah offensive</a>. It spent the next 15 months mostly on defensive and garrison duties and was disbanded in September 1919.

The 8th Battalion was raised in Bristol in September 1914. It arrived in France in July 1915 as part of the <a href="57th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">57th Brigade</a> in the <a href="19th%20%28Western%29%20Division">19th (Western) Division</a> and saw its first action the next year during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Albert%20%281916%29">Battle of Albert</a>, in which it helped <a href="Capture%20of%20La%20Boisselle">capture La Boisselle</a>. The division's 58th Brigade had captured the western half of the village on 2 July, and the 8th Battalion <a href="North%20Staffordshire%20Regiment">North Staffordshire Regiment</a> and 10th Battalion <a href="Worcestershire%20Regiment">Worcestershire Regiment</a>, both of the 57th Brigade, assisted in the capture of the rest of the village the next day. A German counter-attack regained the eastern half of the village, and the 8th Glosters suffered 302 casualties when it fought alongside the 10th Battalion <a href="Royal%20Warwickshire%20Regiment">Royal Warwickshire Regiment</a> to help retake it. During the battle, the Glosters' commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="Adrian%20Carton%20de%20Wiart">Adrian Carton de Wiart</a>, assumed command of all four 57th Brigade battalions when the other three commanding officers became casualties, and for his actions in averting a serious reverse he was awarded the VC. Later the same month, during the Battle of Pozières, the battalion made two unsuccessful attacks against the German line east of the village which together cost it 374 casualties, among whom were Carton de Wiart and his successor, Major <a href="Lord%20Alexander%20Thynne">Lord A.G. Thynne</a>, both wounded. On 18 November, the last day of the Somme offensive, the battalion suffered 295 casualties when it captured Grandcourt during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ancre">Battle of the Ancre</a>.

In 1917, the 8th Battalion saw action in June during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Messines%20%281917%29">Battle of Messines</a>, fought two minor actions in July near Oosttaverne, south of Ypres, and was involved in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Menin%20Road%20Ridge">Battle of the Menin Road Ridge</a> in August. The battalion was next in action on the evening of 21 March 1918, the first day of the German Spring Offensive, when the Germans captured Doignies. Unable to recapture the village, the battalion blocked any further enemy progress until the morning of 23 March, when German forces broke through on the left and threatened to outflank it. Company A fought to the last man covering the battalion's withdrawal, for which action the company commander, Captain <a href="Manley%20Angell%20James">Manley Angell James</a>, was awarded the VC. By the time the 19th Division withdrew to Doullens on 28 March the battalion had suffered 323 casualties. In April, the battalion fought in three engagements of the Battle of the Lys: the Battles of Messines, Bailleul and First Kemmel. The following month, the 19th Division's parent unit, <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">IX Corps</a>, was transferred to the French Sixth Army. The division was supposed to rest and re-organise in a quiet sector, but on 27 May the Germans launched a major attack, ensnaring the 8th Battalion in the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20the%20Aisne">Third Battle of the Aisne</a>. The battalion saw its last action in October, during the Battle of the Selle, and was disbanded in May 1919.

The 9th Battalion was formed in Bristol in September 1914 and reached France in September 1915 as part of the <a href="78th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">78th Brigade</a> in the <a href="26th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">26th Division</a>. The division was transferred to XII Corps of the British Salonika Army in November 1915, and the battalion held the line around Tumba, north of Salonika, until July 1916, when the division relieved the French south of Lake Dojran. The battalion participated in two attacks against the Bulgarian lines, on 25 April and 8 May 1917, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Doiran%20%281917%29">Battle of Dojran</a>. In July 1918, the battalion was transferred to the <a href="198th%20%28East%20Lancashire%29%20Brigade">198th Brigade</a> of the <a href="66th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">66th Division</a> in France, becoming the divisional pioneers, and was disbanded in November 1919.

The 10th Battalion was raised in September 1914 in Bristol, but was recruited mainly by volunteers from Cheltenham. It crossed to France in August 1915 and replaced one of the Guards battalions in the <a href="1st%20Armoured%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Brigade</a> of the <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">1st Division</a>. It saw its first action on 25 September during the Battle of Loos when, as one of the brigade's assault battalions, it succeeded in carrying the German front line at the cost of all but 60 of its men. On 23 July 1916, during the Battle of Pozières, the battalion attacked the German line east of the village, and was involved in two further attacks in the same area in August, all without success. The battalion's last action of the war came on 9 September, in a failed attack on High Wood which cost it 122 casualties. In 1917, the 1st Division was allocated to Operation Hush, and when that was cancelled the 10th battalion moved to the Ypres area. It was disbanded in February 1918 and its men distributed among the regiment's 1st and 8th Battalions and the 13th Entrenching Battalion.

The 12th Battalion was raised in Bristol in August 1914 by the Citizen's Recruiting Committee. It was taken over by the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> in June 1915 and left for France in November as part of the <a href="95th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">95th Brigade</a> in the <a href="5th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">5th Division</a>. The battalion went into action in 1916 during the Somme offensive: on 29 July at Longueval during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Delville%20Wood">Battle of Delville Wood</a>; between 3 and 5 September during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Guillemont">Battle of Guillemont</a>, in which it suffered some 300 casualties; and on 25 September during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Morval">Battle of Morval</a>. On 8 May 1917, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Battle of Arras</a>, the battalion was practically annihilated with the loss of 296 men at Fresnoy, and it did not see action again until 4 October in the Battle of Broodseinde. In December, the 5th Division was transferred to Italy, where it went into the line along the River Piave, but the battalion saw little action beyond patrolling. The division returned to France in April 1918, occupying positions in the line near Nieppe Forest, and the battalion saw action on 25 April and 28 June, both times successfully advancing the front line. Its last action came during the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bapaume">Second Battle of Bapaume</a>, where it suffered some 100 casualties on 21 August but succeeded in capturing <a href="Irles">Irles</a> on 23 August. On 6 October, the battalion was disbanded and its men distributed among the other units of the 5th Division.

The 13th Battalion was raised in December 1914 at Malvern by <a href="Sir%20Henry%20Webb%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir Henry Webb</a> and recruited from the miners of the Forest of Dean, South Wales and the Durham coalfields. In July 1915, it was taken over by the War Office and went to France in March 1916 as divisional pioneers to the <a href="39th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">39th Division</a>. The battalion saw its first significant action on 30 June 1916, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Boar%27s%20Head">Battle of the Boar's Head</a>, when it dug communication trenches behind the assaulting troops. On several occasions during the battle the pioneers had to stop digging to defend themselves, and the battalion suffered 71 casualties. It saw action again towards the end of 1916 during operations on the Ancre, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ancre%20Heights">Battle of the Ancre Heights</a> and the Battle of the Ancre. In March 1917, the battalion suffered particularly badly in the opening week of the German Spring Offensive, during which it was required to take positions in the line as infantry, and by the time the division was withdrawn on 31 March the battalion had sustained 326 casualties. In April, the survivors were allocated to composite infantry battalions and saw their last action on 26 April during the Second Battle of Kemmel, part of the Battle of the Lys, after which the battalion was reduced to a training cadre.

The 14th Battalion was a <a href="Bantam%20%28military%29">bantam</a> unit of volunteers from Bristol and Birmingham who had previously been rejected for service because of their short height. It was raised in April 1915 by the Citizen's Recruiting Committee, adopted by the War Office in June 1915, and departed for France in January 1916 as part of the <a href="105th%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">105th Brigade</a> in the <a href="35th%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">35th Division</a>. The battalion went into the line in March, where the men's first task was to raise the height of the <a href="wikt%3Afire%20step">firing step</a>, and its first significant action came on 8 June, when it conducted a large raid south-east of Neuve Chapelle. In July, following the <a href="capture%20of%20Tr%C3%B4nes%20Wood">capture of Trônes Wood</a> by the 18th Division during the Battle of Bazentin, the battalion moved into the line at the northern end of the wood where, on 19 July, it suffered 107 casualties to enemy artillery. On 21 August 1917, while in the line near Épehy, the Germans attacked one of the battalion's bombing posts. Although his bombing party were driven back, Second-Lieutenant <a href="Hardy%20Falconer%20Parsons">Hardy Falconer Parsons</a> remained and prevented the enemy from entering the trenches, for which act he was posthumously awarded the VC. The battalion fought in the Action of 22 October 1917 during the Battle of Passchendaele, and saw its last action on 4 February 1918, when it successfully attacked a fortified farm in the Ypres sector. Seven days later the battalion was disbanded and its men transferred to the 13th Battalion.

The 18th battalion was raised in 1918 from a cadre of the 5th Battalion <a href="Oxfordshire%20and%20Buckinghamshire%20Light%20Infantry">Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry</a>, and decamped to France in August 1918 as part of the <a href="49th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">49th Brigade</a> in the <a href="16th%20%28Irish%29%20Division">16th Division</a>. It went into action on 11 September, when it successfully assaulted the Railway Triangle west of Auchy, and saw its last action on 18 September, when a German attack drove A Company from its forward posts. The battalion was disbanded in June 1919.

The "Fifth Gloucester Gazette" was a trench journal published from the front lines by the men of the 1/5th Battalion. The first issue appeared on 12 April 1915 and foreshadowed more famous trench journals such as "<a href="The%20Wipers%20Times">The Wipers Times</a>". It ran for 25 issues, the last of which appeared in January 1919. After the war it was republished as a compilation titled "The Fifth Gloucester Gazette a chronicle, serious and humorous, of the Battalion while serving with the British Expeditionary Force". The gazette featured jokes, poetry, short stories, news and satirical adverts. In October 1916 "The Times Literary Supplement" hailed it as "the oldest and most literary of the British trench journals".

The gazette was regarded so highly due in part to the efforts of famous war poet and founding contributor <a href="F.%20W.%20Harvey">F. W. Harvey</a>, who published 77 poems in it while serving with the 1/5th. Five of Harvey's poems were included in the 1917 anthology of war poetry, "<a href="The%20Muse%20in%20Arms">The Muse in Arms</a>", alongside poems by <a href="Siegfried%20Sassoon">Siegfried Sassoon</a>, <a href="Robert%20Graves">Robert Graves</a> and <a href="Rupert%20Brooke">Rupert Brooke</a>. The anthology also featured the poetry of Lieutenant Cyril Winterbotham – who served in the 1/5th Battalion and edited the gazette until he was killed in action on 27 August 1916 – and Harvey's pre-war friend <a href="Ivor%20Gurney">Ivor Gurney</a>, who served in the 2/5th Battalion.

All second-line territorial and New Army battalions had been disbanded and the regiment returned to its pre-war establishment by the end of 1919. Close to 40,000 men are believed to have fought with the regiment in the war, of which 8,100 lost their lives, and the regiment was awarded 72 different battle honours. The regular battalions lost 1,400 men killed, 1,044 of them from the 1st Battalion, and were awarded 39 battle honours. The territorial battalions lost 2,542 men killed and received 60 battle honours, and the New Army battalions suffered 3,954 deaths and won 84 battle honours. Home-based reserve battalions and the regimental depot accounted for 204 deaths. Four awards of the VC were made to men serving with the regiment during the war, along with 47 <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>s (DSO), 188 <a href="Distinguished%20Conduct%20Medal">Distinguished Conduct Medal</a>s (DCM), 265 <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a>es (MC) and 747 <a href="Military%20Medal">Military Medal</a>s (MM). A fifth VC was awarded to an officer of the regiment attached to another unit.

After the end of the First World War, the regiment resumed alternate postings home and abroad. The 1st Battalion completed tours of duty in Ireland, where it captured the Irish republican <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20Moylan">Seán Moylan</a>, and Germany, which counted as a home posting, and returned to the UK in 1923. Meanwhile, the 2nd Battalion was posted to India, with a five-month interlude in Shanghai at short notice from February 1927 when warring Chinese factions threatened the <a href="Shanghai%20International%20Settlement">Shanghai International Settlement</a>. In 1928, the 2nd Battalion returned to the UK and the 1st Battalion was posted overseas, serving three years in Egypt, a year in Singapore and six years in India before ending up in Burma in 1938. Prompted by concerns of an Italian invasion following the <a href="Second%20Italo-Ethiopian%20War">Second Italo-Ethiopian War</a>, the 2nd Battalion was sent at short notice to Egypt in January 1936, returning to the UK in January 1937. The following year, the 5th Battalion became the regiment's sole territorial unit when the 4th Battalion was converted to the 66th Searchlight Regiment, <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> (RA), and the 6th Battalion converted to the <a href="44th%20Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">44th Battalion, Royal Tank Regiment</a>. On the eve of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> (TA), as the Territorial Force had been renamed, was doubled in size, and the 7th Battalion was created in August 1939 as the second-line duplicate of the 5th Battalion.

On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, the Gloucestershire Regiment comprised:

The 2nd Battalion deployed to France on 2 October 1939 and was transferred to the 145th Brigade in the 48th Division in March 1940. This brought it alongside the 5th Battalion in the division's 144th Brigade, which had arrived in France on 15 January 1940. In May 1940, during the <a href="Battle%20of%20France">Battle of France</a>, the German <a href="Battle%20of%20Sedan%20%281940%29">breakthrough at Sedan</a> precipitated a retreat to <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">Dunkirk</a>. The 5th Battalion marched in 83 hours with little food or sleep before eventually picking up transport at Tournai where, on 19 May, the 2nd Battalion lost 194 men killed or missing in a matter of minutes to an airstrike. The regiment gained some respite on 20 May, when the two battalions held positions along the River Escaut (<a href="Scheldt">Scheldt</a>) for two days before the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> resumed its retreat. On 25 May, the 2nd Battalion, having by now suffered 219 casualties, became part of Somer Force. This mixed group of units under the command of Brigadier Nigel Somerset, until recently the 2nd Battalion commanding officer, fortified Cassel on the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dunkirk">outer perimeter around Dunkirk</a>. The Germans probed the town the next day and began assaulting it on 27 May. Somer Force held out for two days, eventually attempting to withdraw under orders on the evening of 29 May, but few made it to Dunkirk. The 2nd Battalion suffered 678 casualties at Cassel, 484 of them POWs. Meanwhile, the 5th Battalion was given a similar task at the villages of Arneke and Ledringhem, some north-west of Cassel. The battalion took up positions on 26 May, and the first attacks came the next day. By 28 May, the battalion had concentrated at Ledringhem, where it was surrounded, and it withdrew under orders in the early hours of 29 May. The survivors reached Bray Dunes before dawn the next day and were subsequently taken off the beach by <a href="Little%20Ships%20of%20Dunkirk">little ships</a>. The stand at Ledringham had cost the battalion 87 killed, and when it reassembled in the UK it was 400 strong.

In March 1942, the 1st Battalion provided the rearguard for the British retreat from Rangoon during the <a href="Japanese%20conquest%20of%20Burma">Japanese conquest of Burma</a>. It saw its first significant action of the war on 7 and 8 March at the <a href="Taukkyan%20Roadblock">Taukkyan Roadblock</a>, and for the rest of the month operated independently to cover the retreat, fighting battles at Letpadan on 17 March and Paungde on 27 March. In a subsequent battle near Padigong, from Paungde, D Company became isolated for 17 hours and had to fight its way back to the battalion at Shwedaung. In the meantime, the battalion became part of the <a href="63rd%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade">63rd Indian Infantry Brigade</a> in the (<a href="17th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28India%29">17th Infantry Division</a>), which had to fight its way to and through Shwedaung when Japanese forces infiltrated between the rearguard and the main column. By the end of March, the 1st Battalion had been reduced to 140 all ranks, its commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Bagot, among the wounded.

In mid-April, the under-strength battalion became so dispersed while protecting demolition parties at oil installations around Yenangyaung and Chauk that when Bagot returned from hospital he was informed the battalion had ceased to exist. He was nevertheless able to gather the remnants, now numbering 7 officers and 170 other ranks, at Shwebo on 27 April, and the battalion was subsequently reinforced by a draft of 3 officers and 120 other ranks. When the Japanese threatened Monywa, Bagot took command of all the troops in the area, which included the 1st Battalion, to form Bagot Force. This mixed group of units fought a delaying action at Budalin, north of Monywa, on 4 May before withdrawing to Ye-u. The battalion continued to act as rearguard, crossing the River Chindwin at Kalewa on 9 May and into India at Tamu at the end of the month. At the same time, the Japanese halted operations in Burma. Since the start of the retreat from Rangoon on 7 March the battalion had lost 8 officers and 156 other ranks killed in action or died of sickness, and many more wounded. The battalion was rested and brought back up to strength in India, where it spent the remainder of the war, and saw no further action.

On its return to the UK, the 5th Battalion was brought back up to strength and manned coastal defences in Cornwall. It converted to a reconnaissance role in June 1941, eventually becoming the <a href="43rd%20%28Wessex%29%20Reconnaissance%20Regiment">43rd (Wessex) Reconnaissance Regiment</a>, and from October it ceased to have any affiliation with the Gloucestershire Regiment. Its duplicate, the 7th Battalion, was posted to Northern Ireland, but saw no action and became a training unit in 1944. With so many of its men languishing in POW camps, the 2nd Battalion was rebuilt and served in home defence at various locations around the UK, finally ending up in 1943 on the Isle of Wight before being assigned to a more active role.

As the UK braced itself for <a href="Operation%20Sea%20Lion">Operation Sea Lion</a>, the German plan to invade, a number of <a href="Home%20Service%20Battalions">home defence</a> battalions were raised under the regiment's colours. The 8th Battalion was formed from the <a href="National%20Defence%20Companies">National Defence Companies</a> and consisted of men too old, too young or unfit for active service, and the younger contingent from this battalion later formed the 70th Battalion. The 9th and 10th Battalions were also raised, the former serving in Northern Ireland, the latter in south Wales and then Lincolnshire. The 11th Battalion was created in October 1940 from a re-designation of the 50th (Holding) Battalion, and 32,000 men in 19 battalions of the <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a> wore the badges of the regiment. As the threat of invasion receded, most of these home defence battalions were disbanded, the 8th and 70th in 1942, the 9th in 1943, and the Home Guard in 1945. In February 1942, the 11th Battalion ceased to have any affiliation with the regiment when it was converted to the 118th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment of the Royal Artillery. The 10th Battalion was converted to armour in 1942 and became the <a href="159th%20Regiment%20Royal%20Armoured%20Corps">159th Regiment</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Armoured%20Corps">Royal Armoured Corps</a>, though it retained the Glosters' cap badges. It was sent to India in October where, in March 1943, it converted back to infantry and reverted to the regiment's 10th Battalion.

In 1944, the 2nd Battalion was transferred to the <a href="56th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">56th Independent Infantry Brigade</a>, and at 11:00 on 6 June, during the <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy landings</a>, the brigade landed without incident in the second wave at <a href="Gold%20Beach">Gold Beach</a>. The battalion saw action in the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">Battle of Normandy</a>: at Tilly-sur-Seulles on 11 June during <a href="Operation%20Perch">Operation Perch</a>; along the Saint-Germain d'Ectot ridge on 30 July during <a href="Operation%20Bluecoat">Operation Bluecoat</a>; and at Thury-Harcourt on 12 August in the prelude to <a href="Operation%20Tractable">Operation Tractable</a>. In mid-August, having variously served under the commands of the <a href="50th%20%28Northumbrian%29%20Infantry%20Division">50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division</a>, the <a href="7th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">7th Armoured Division</a> and the <a href="59th%20%28Staffordshire%29%20Infantry%20Division">59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division</a>, the 56th Brigade came under command of the <a href="49th%20%28West%20Riding%29%20Infantry%20Division">49th (West Riding) Infantry Division</a>, with which it remained for the rest of the war. During the advance to the River Seine, the 2nd Battalion suffered 53 casualties capturing Épaignes on 25 August, and crossed the river at Rouen on 2 September. It spearheaded the <a href="Operation%20Astonia">assault on Le Havre</a> eight days later, and it was the first British unit to enter the city's fort, on 12 September, capturing 1,500 prisoners and much beer for the loss during the battle of 40 men killed and wounded.

From Le Havre, the 2nd Battalion advanced into Belgium, seeing action in the bridgehead across the Turnhout-Antwerp Canal, and the Netherlands, where it fought at Stampersgat. The battalion reached Nijmegen in late November, where it spent over four relatively quiet months interrupted only by a four-day battle at Zetten in January 1945. The battalion's last significant action of the war came on 12 April, when it assaulted across the River Ijssel at Arnhem, after which the rest of the 56th Brigade passed through to <a href="Liberation%20of%20Arnhem">capture the town itself</a>. Following the <a href="German%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender">German surrender</a> on 8 May, the 2nd Battalion entered Germany near Osnabrück. It provided a detachment for the British guard at the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg trials</a>, and in August it was transferred to the <a href="5th%20Guards%20Armoured%20Brigade">5th Guards Brigade</a> stationed in Berlin. Between the Normandy landings on 6 June 1944 and <a href="Victory%20in%20Europe%20Day">VE Day</a> on 8 May 1945 the battalion suffered 718 casualties. Among them was the battalion commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Francis Butterworth, died of wounds received during the attack at Stampersgat and succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="Robert%20Bray%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Robert Bray</a>.

On reverting to the infantry role, the 10th Battalion was assigned to the <a href="72nd%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">72nd Brigade</a> in the <a href="36th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">36th Infantry Division</a>. The division was destined for <a href="Burma%20Campaign%201944%E2%80%9345">Burma</a>, and thus the battalion "having been trained as infantry, tank troops, and combined-operations troops, went straight into jungle warfare, for which we had had no training". The Glosters arrived on the Arakan Peninsula (modern day Rakhine) in February 1944, were part of the relief effort in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Admin%20Box">Battle of the Admin Box</a>, and fought in dispersed, company-scale actions in the capture of the Mayu tunnels and Hambone Hill. The division went into reserve in May and was airlifted to Myitkyina in July, transferring to the <a href="Northern%20Combat%20Area%20Command">Northern Combat Area Command</a> (NCAC) under the American General <a href="Joseph%20Stilwell">Joseph Stilwell</a>. It pushed south along the Mandalay railway and captured Taungni on 9 August, during which period the 10th Battalion lost more men to sickness than enemy action. Brought back up to strength in September, the battalion was engaged in four days of fierce fighting at Pinwe in November, losing all the officers in both A and C Companies, and all but one in B Company, before being relieved on 26 November.

The 36th Division continued its advance south in January 1945, and the 10th Battalion saw action in a series of short battles around Mabein that month. The battalion saw its last action of the war supporting the <a href="26th%20Indian%20Infantry%20Brigade">26th Indian Brigade</a> attack at Myitson on the River Shweli, during which D Company was cut off for five days before the rest of the battalion was able to link up with it on 16 February. Of the 250 or so men in the battalion before the battle, 119 were killed or wounded by the time the Japanese withdrew on 17 February. Although the men had fought well, there were bitter recriminations over the conduct of the battle between the commander of the 26th Brigade, Brigadier M. B. Jennings, and the 10th Battalion's commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Butler, which resulted in Butler being sacked. After reaching Mandalay, the battalion returned to India in May, and was disbanded at Poona in December 1945.

The regiment accrued 20 different battle honours and lost 870 men killed in the nine battalions that had served under its colours during the Second World War. Only the two regular battalions remained with the regiment at the war's end, though the territorial 5th Battalion was returned to the colours on 1 March 1947 and assigned to the <a href="129th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">129th Infantry Brigade</a> of the <a href="43rd%20%28Wessex%29%20Infantry%20Division">43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division</a>. That same year, the 1st Battalion was reduced to a cadre and returned from India to the UK, and the 2nd Battalion was posted to Jamaica and detached companies to Bermuda and British Honduras (modern day Belize). It was in Jamaica that, in accordance with the restructuring of the British Army, the regiment's two battalions swapped colours and amalgamated to form the single-battalion Gloucestershire Regiment (28th/61st) on 21 September 1948.

After its return to the UK in 1949, the 1st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel <a href="James%20Power%20Carne">James Power Carne</a>, was assigned to the <a href="29th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">29th Independent Infantry Brigade Group</a>, and on 3 November 1950, following the outbreak of the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, the battalion arrived with the brigade in Korea. At the beginning of December, the 29th Brigade provided the rearguard during the general retreat that followed the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a> (UN) defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ch%27ongch%27on%20River">Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River</a>. On 16 February, after UN forces launched a counter-offensive, the Glosters – with support from the <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2025-pounder">25-pounders</a> of the 45th Field Regiment RA, the <a href="Ordnance%20ML%204.2%20inch%20Mortar">mortars</a> of the 170th Heavy Mortar Battery and direct fire from 17 <a href="Centurion%20%28tank%29">Centurion tanks</a> of the <a href="8th%20King%27s%20Royal%20Irish%20Hussars">8th King's Royal Irish Hussars</a> – successfully assaulted Hill 327, south of the River Han, for the loss of 10 killed and 29 wounded.

Early in April, the 29th Brigade, supported by the 45th Field Regiment RA and under command of the United States (US) <a href="3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">3rd Infantry Division</a>, took up scattered positions on a front in Line Kansas along the Imjin river. The 657 men of the 1st Battalion's fighting component, supported by C Troop 170th Heavy Mortar Battery RA, were thinly spread on the brigade's left flank in positions set back some from the river, guarding a ford near the village of Choksong. Company A held Castle Hill (Hill 148) overlooking the ford, D Company was at Hill 182, to the south-east, and B Company was at Hill 144, to the east of D Company. Company C was in reserve near Hill 314, overlooking battalion headquarters (HQ) and Support Company at Solma-Ri. The battalion's second-in-command, Major Digby Grist, was with rear headquarters ("F echelon") some behind, on route Five Yankee (5Y) to Seoul. There was a gap between the Glosters and the 1st Battalion <a href="Royal%20Northumberland%20Fusiliers">Royal Northumberland Fusiliers</a> on their right, and on their left the 12th Regiment of the South Korean (ROK) <a href="1st%20Infantry%20Division%20%28South%20Korea%29">1st Infantry Division</a> was away.

After nightfall on 22 April, the Chinese launched the <a href="Chinese%20Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a>, the first phase of which was designed to eliminate the US 3rd Division, the 29th Brigade and the ROK 1st Division. Success would allow them to attack the US 24th and 25th Divisions in the flank and leave the way open to Seoul. Against the four battalions of the 29th Brigade the Chinese had amassed the <a href="63rd%20Army%20%28People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China%29">63rd Army</a>, comprising the 187th, 188th and 189th Divisions; some 27,000 men in 27 infantry battalions.

At 22:00, a 17-man patrol from C Company in position on the river bank, supported by the guns of the 45th Field Regiment, engaged the leading Chinese troops three times as they attempted to cross the ford. The patrol withdrew without loss when they began to run out of ammunition and the assaulting troops finally gained the opposite bank. During the night, the Glosters' forward companies were attacked, and by 07:30, A Company, outnumbered six to one, had been forced from Castle Hill. An attempt to retake it failed, and the company, now at less than half strength and with all officers killed or wounded, fell back to Hill 235. The withdrawal left D Company's position exposed and, with one of its platoons badly mauled in the overnight fighting, it too retired to the hill. Company B had not been pressed during the night, but the withdrawal of D Company on its left and the Fusiliers on its right left the company exposed, and it fell back to Hill 314, east of C Company. In the afternoon, Major Grist was with the battalion HQ during a lull in the fighting, having come up with supplies, when news came through of an attack on the F echelon position. He drove back along route 5Y, through an ambush and past a group of F echelon troops lining the road under Chinese guard, eventually reaching the brigade HQ. The loss of the F echelon position meant that the battalion was now cut off.

At 23:00 on 23 April, the Chinese resumed their attack, throwing the fresh 189th Division against the Glosters' B and C Companies around Hill 314. Through the night the men of B Company, led by Major Edgar Harding and outnumbered 18:1, endured six assaults, calling in artillery on their own position to break up the last of them. Low on ammunition and having taken many casualties, the seventh assault at 08:10 forced them from their position, and just 20 survivors made it to Hill 235, to which the battalion HQ, Support and C Companies had already withdrawn. With the Glosters' position still vital to the integrity of Line Kansas, Carne received orders at 07:00 on 24 April from the 3rd Division commander, General <a href="Robert%20H.%20Soule">Soule</a>, to stand his ground. He was advised that reinforcements, comprising tanks of the 8th Hussars and Philippine <a href="Philippine%20Expeditionary%20Forces%20to%20Korea">10th Battalion Combat Team</a> and the troops of the Glosters' own rear echelon, were being sent up route 5Y. The armour got to within of the Glosters' position before being halted in an ambush around 15:00, condemning the Glosters to another night alone on Hill 235.

By the afternoon of 24 April, the Glosters, with C Troop 170th Mortar Battery now fighting alongside as infantry, had been reduced to an effective fighting force of 400–450 men. They were low on ammunition, though in their favour the 45th Field Regiment provided excellent support. Estimates of the opposing force range from a regiment (three battalions) to a division (three regiments). The Glosters fought through the night of 24–25 April, during which the peak was briefly occupied by the Chinese, thus threatening the Glosters' whole position on the hill. It was recaptured in a counter-attack led by the <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a>, Captain <a href="Anthony%20Farrar-Hockley">Anthony Farrar-Hockley</a>, and the Chinese launched seven attacks in one hour in an attempt to take it again, all without success. Their assault on the hill was finally broken up after sunrise by airstrikes. That morning, with Chinese forces infiltrating miles behind the lines, UN forces began to withdraw to Line Delta. On Hill 235, the Glosters had very little ammunition, no hope of relief and, with the 45th Field Regiment on the move, no artillery support. Carne received permission to attempt a breakout at 06:05. He had no choice but to leave the wounded, estimated at some 100. The survivors split into small groups and attempted to evade the Chinese surrounding them to reach friendly lines. Just 63 men made it.

The Glosters' stand had plugged a large gap in the 29th Brigade's front on Line Kansas which would otherwise have left the flanks of the ROK 1st and US 3rd Divisions vulnerable. Their presence also threatened the rear of the Chinese forces as they advanced and denied them the use of routes south for their artillery and mule trains. General <a href="James%20Van%20Fleet">James Van Fleet</a>, commander of the US <a href="Eighth%20United%20States%20Army">Eighth Army</a>, described the stand as "the most outstanding example of unit bravery in modern war", and in a letter to General <a href="Matthew%20Ridgway">Ridgeway</a>, commander-in-chief of UN forces in Korea, he wrote that "the loss of 622 officers and men saved many times that number". The 29th Brigade commander, Brigadier <a href="Thomas%20Brodie">Thomas Brodie</a>, christened the regiment "The Glorious Glosters", a sobriquet that was repeated in the headlines of the day, and Hill 235 became known as "Gloster Hill", at the foot of which the <a href="Gloucester%20Valley%20Battle%20Monument">Gloucester Valley Battle Monument</a> was built in 1957.

The other battalions of the 29th Brigade had also been engaged in desperate fighting, though without the same scale of losses, and in total the brigade suffered 1,091 casualties. Of the Glosters' 622 casualties, 56 were killed and 522 were taken prisoner, some of whom had already endured the POW camps of Germany and Japan. Carne, himself taken POW and already a recipient of the DSO for his leadership during the earlier battle at Hill 327, was awarded the VC and the American <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Distinguished Service Cross</a>. Lieutenant <a href="Philip%20Curtis">Philip Curtis</a>, attached from the <a href="Duke%20of%20Cornwall%27s%20Light%20Infantry">Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry</a>, was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions during the attempt to retake Castle Hill. Two awards of the DSO were made, to Harding and Farrar-Hockley, and six MCs, two DCMs and ten MMs were also awarded. Lieutenant <a href="Terry%20Waters%20%28GC%29">Terence Waters</a>, attached from the <a href="West%20Yorkshire%20Regiment">West Yorkshire Regiment</a>, was posthumously awarded the <a href="George%20Cross">George Cross</a> for his conduct during captivity. The regiment itself, along with C Troop 170th Heavy Mortar Battery, was awarded the <a href="Presidential%20Unit%20Citation%20%28US%29">Presidential Unit Citation</a>.

The battalion's strength on 26 April was 119 men, mostly rear echelon troops who had been part of the relief effort but not otherwise involved in the battle. This figure rose to 217 later in the day as men returned from leave and those few who had managed to escape from Hill 235 rejoined. The 29th Brigade was brought back up to strength in May, and the regiment returned to the line along the Imjin in September. It was relieved in November and returned to a tumultuous welcome at Southampton on 20 December. The POWs were also welcomed back to great fanfare following their release in 1953. The Korean War accounted for 113 fatalities among the Glosters, 36 of them in captivity.

While the Korean War continued, the regiment was engaged in more ceremonial affairs at home. It lined the route of King <a href="George%20VI">George VI's</a> funeral procession on 15 February 1952, and it was presented with its first colours at a ceremony in Gloucester on 26 April, the two regular battalions having retained those of their predecessor regiments up to that point. On 2 June 1953, 400 men from both the 1st and 5th Battalions took part in the procession at the <a href="coronation%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">coronation of Queen Elizabeth II</a>. Between 1955 and 1994, the regiment returned to more martial duties, for the most part patrolling the shrinking <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> with tours of duty in <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Kenya</a>, <a href="Colony%20of%20Aden">Aden</a>, <a href="Bahrain">Bahrain</a>, <a href="Cyprus%20Emergency">Cyprus</a>, <a href="Belize">Belize</a>, <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> and the African colonies of <a href="Swaziland">Swaziland</a>, <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="Bechuanaland%20Protectorate">Bechuanaland</a> and <a href="Basutoland">Basutoland</a>. The regiment also participated in the British contribution to <a href="NATO">NATO</a> in Germany, serving three tours with the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a> and two with the <a href="Berlin%20Infantry%20Brigade">British garrison in Berlin</a>, and between 1968 and 1991 it completed seven tours in Northern Ireland during <a href="The%20Troubles">The Troubles</a>, in which it lost five men killed.

In March 1967, the 1st Battalion became the sole unit of the Gloucestershire Regiment when, as a result of a reorganisation of the TA, the 5th Battalion became A Company of the Wessex Volunteers in the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve. The regiment narrowly avoided amalgamation with the <a href="Royal%20Hampshire%20Regiment">Royal Hampshire Regiment</a> in 1970, and it celebrated its tercentenary in early March 1994; 300 years since the raising of Gibson's Regiment of Foot. But by that time, the <a href="dissolution%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">dissolution of the Soviet Union</a> had prompted the government to <a href="Options%20for%20Change">restructure the armed forces</a>. As a result, the Gloucestershire Regiment was amalgamated with the <a href="Duke%20of%20Edinburgh%27s%20Royal%20Regiment">Duke of Edinburgh's Royal Regiment</a> to form the <a href="Royal%20Gloucestershire%2C%20Berkshire%20and%20Wiltshire%20Regiment">Royal Gloucestershire, Berkshire and Wiltshire Regiment</a>. The new regiment maintained the back badge tradition, and when it was in turn amalgamated in 2007, it passed the tradition on to its successor regiment, <a href="The%20Rifles">The Rifles</a>, who wear the back badge with their ceremonial uniform. The Glosters paraded for the last time on 26 March 1994 in Gloucester. The colours, carrying more battle honours than any other regiment of the line, were then marched to the <a href="Soldiers%20of%20Gloucestershire%20Museum">Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum</a>, and the regiment followed the 28th and 61st Regiments of Foot into history.

The following were awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest award for bravery, while serving with the Gloucestershire Regiment:
<a href="Daniel%20Burges">Daniel Burges</a>, a temporary Lieutenant-Colonel in the Gloucestershire Regiment, was awarded the VC during the First World War while commanding the 7th Battalion <a href="South%20Wales%20Borderers">South Wales Borderers</a>.

The following served in the ceremonial position of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Colonel of the Regiment</a>:

St James' Church, Sydney

St James' Church, commonly known as St James', King Street, is a heritage-listed active <a href="Anglican%20Church%20of%20Australia">Anglican</a> <a href="Church%20%28building%29">parish church</a> located at 173 <a href="King%20Street%2C%20Sydney">King Street</a>, in the <a href="Sydney%20central%20business%20district">Sydney central business district</a> in the <a href="City%20of%20Sydney">City of Sydney</a> local government area of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, Australia. Consecrated in February 1824 and named in honour of <a href="St%20James%20the%20Great">St James the Great</a>, it became a parish church in 1835. Designed in the style of a <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> town church by the <a href="Convicts%20in%20Australia">transported convict</a> architect <a href="Francis%20Greenway">Francis Greenway</a> during the governorship of <a href="Lachlan%20Macquarie">Lachlan Macquarie</a>, St James' is part of the historical precinct of <a href="Macquarie%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Macquarie Street</a> which includes other early colonial era buildings such as the <a href="World%20Heritage%20List">World Heritage listed</a> <a href="Hyde%20Park%20Barracks%2C%20Sydney">Hyde Park Barracks</a>. 

The church remains historically, socially and architecturally significant. The building is the oldest one extant in Sydney's inner city region. It was added to the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20State%20Heritage%20Register">New South Wales State Heritage Register</a> on 3 September 2004; and was listed on the (now defunct) <a href="Register%20of%20the%20National%20Estate">Register of the National Estate</a>, and <a href="Around%20the%20World%20in%2080%20Treasures">has been described as one of the world's 80 greatest man-made treasures</a>.

The church has maintained its special role in the city's religious, civic and musical life as well as its close associations with the city's legal and medical professions through its proximity to the law courts and <a href="Sydney%20Hospital">Sydney Hospital</a>. Its original ministry was to the convict population of Sydney and it has continued to serve the city's poor and needy in succeeding centuries.

Worship at St James' is in a style commonly found in the <a href="High%20Church">High Church</a> and moderate <a href="Anglo-Catholicism">Anglo-Catholic</a> traditions of Anglicanism. It maintains the traditions of Anglican church music, with a robed <a href="choir">choir</a> singing psalms, anthems and responses in contrast to the great majority of churches in the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Sydney">Anglican Diocese of Sydney</a> where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with <a href="Low%20Church">Low Church</a> and <a href="Evangelical%20Anglicanism">Evangelical</a> Christian practices. The teaching at St James' has a more liberal perspective than most churches in the diocese on issues of gender and the <a href="Ordination%20of%20women%20in%20the%20Anglican%20Communion">ordination of women</a>.

St James' Church is located at 173 King Street, Sydney, in the legal and commercial district, near <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20Sydney">Hyde Park</a> and adjoining <a href="Queen%27s%20Square%2C%20Sydney">Queen's Square</a>, adjacent to the <a href="Greenway%20Wing%20%28Supreme%20Court%20of%20New%20South%20Wales%29">Greenway Wing</a> of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">NSW Supreme Court</a>. The church forms part of a group of notable colonial buildings along <a href="Macquarie%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Macquarie Street</a>, which runs from Queen's Square to <a href="Sydney%20Harbour">Sydney Harbour</a>. At the time of construction, the church and the buildings nearby were "Sydney's most distinguished structures ... on the highest ground, and, socially speaking, in the best part of the city".

The geographical <a href="St.%20James%20Parish%2C%20Cumberland">parish of St James'</a> is one of the 57 <a href="parish">parish</a>es of <a href="Cumberland%20County%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Cumberland County, New South Wales</a>, and it initially shared responsibility for an area that extended as far as <a href="Sydney%20Heads">Sydney Heads</a>. St James' acquired its own parish in 1835. Its boundaries have since remained essentially unchanged.

The <a href="City%20Circle">underground</a> <a href="St%20James%20railway%20station%2C%20Sydney">St James railway station</a> is named after the church. The precinct around the church is informally known as St James'.

The building of St James' Church was commissioned by Governor <a href="Lachlan%20Macquarie">Lachlan Macquarie</a> in 1819, designed by the convict architect <a href="Francis%20Greenway">Francis Greenway</a> and constructed between 1820 and 1824 using <a href="convict%20labour%23British%20Empire">convict labour</a>. Governor Macquarie and <a href="John%20Bigge">Commissioner John Bigge</a> laid the foundation stone on 7 October 1819. The building was originally intended to serve as a <a href="courthouse">courthouse</a> as Macquarie had plans for a large cathedral to be built on the present location of <a href="St%20Andrew%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Sydney">St Andrew's Cathedral</a> but they were put on hold by the intervention of Bigge who had been appointed to conduct a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> into the colonial government. Bigge initially approved of the courthouse project but by February 1820, less than four months after his arrival, he strongly recommended its conversion into a church.

"The reason for Bigge's change of mind may be found in the appointment, three years later, of his brother-in-law [and secretary], Mr <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes%20Scott">TH Scott</a>, a wine merchant, as <a href="Archdeacon">Archdeacon</a>". The design of the courthouse was modified before construction with the addition of a steeple at the western end, to serve as a church, while the adjacent school buildings were put into use as a courthouse. The first service was held in the unfinished church on the Day of <a href="Epiphany%20%28holiday%29">Epiphany</a>, 6 January 1822, the text being from <a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a>, Chapter 60: "Arise! Shine, for thy light has come. The glory of the Lord has risen upon thee". It was anticipated in the "<a href="Sydney%20Gazette">Sydney Gazette</a>'s" report of the event that the church, when fitted out with stalls and galleries, would hold 2,000 people. The church was consecrated by the senior chaplain, the Reverend <a href="Samuel%20Marsden">Samuel Marsden</a>, on 11 February 1824.

Before the building of St James', Sydney's growing population had been served by <a href="St%20Philip%27s%20Church%2C%20Sydney">St Philip's Church, York Street</a>. However, as St James' was able to hold more people than St Philip's and clergy meetings as well as ordinations were held there, it quickly became the centre of official church activity.

There was both official and general concern about the lack of morality within the predominantly male population, and the establishment of churches and of education was seen as a method of combatting this. The 19th-century church historian, Edward Symonds, credited a "better moral and spiritual tone" in the colony to "decent churches" and "the advent of additional clergy, headed by the Revd William Cowper, in 1808". The first rector of St James', the Reverend <a href="Richard%20Hill%20%28priest%29">Richard Hill</a>, was ordained specifically for colonial ministry and sent from London as assistant to <a href="William%20Cowper%20%28Archdeacon%20of%20Cumberland%29">William Cowper</a> at St Philip's. Hill was energetic and a good organiser, with progressive views on education. He instigated a number of projects to aid the community, including an infants' school in the <a href="crypt">crypt</a> of the church and a <a href="Sunday%20School">Sunday School</a>.

The focus of the church's <a href="Christian%20liturgy">liturgy</a> at the time was on preaching and the church's interior reflected this. The east end of the church had a triple-decker <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a> placed centrally, from which the service was led and the sermon preached. From this pulpit Bishops Broughton, Pattison, <a href="George%20Selwyn%20%28bishop%20of%20Lichfield%29">Selwyn</a>, <a href="Frederic%20Barker">Barker</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Barry">Barry</a> preached. The parish clerk led the congregation in the responses from its lower level. Between the three windows which at that time occupied the eastern wall, there were two large panels displaying the words of the <a href="Lord%27s%20Prayer">Lord's Prayer</a>, the <a href="Apostles%27%20Creed">Apostles' Creed</a> and the <a href="Ten%20Commandments">Ten Commandments</a>. The church was full of <a href="box%20pew">box pew</a>s which faced each other across a central aisle. The western end had a gallery, which is still in place, for the convicts. Pews were rented to provide a source of income for the church and the whole was arranged in "rigid social order" with the poor occupying the free seats. Sunday services consisted of <a href="Morning%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Morning</a> and <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Evening Prayer</a>, with <a href="Holy%20Communion">Holy Communion</a> taking place only occasionally as an addition to the regular service. For this reason, there was no visual emphasis on the <a href="communion%20table">communion table</a>, which was a small portable one, and no <a href="reredos">reredos</a>.
St James' suffered from a major scandal in the late 1820s ("a period of personal quarrels and violent newspaper controversies") when Commissioner Bigge's secretary and brother-in-law, <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes%20Scott">Thomas Hobbes Scott</a>, who had been made <a href="Archdeacon">Archdeacon</a> of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in 1825, came into conflict with a parishioner, <a href="Edward%20Smith%20Hall">Edward Smith Hall</a>. Archdeacon Scott ordered that Hall should vacate the pew he rented at St James' for himself and his six daughters. As Hall continued to occupy the pew, constables attended Sunday services to prevent his occupation of the pew by boarding it up and making it secure with iron bands. Hall, critical of both the archdeacon and Governor <a href="Ralph%20Darling">Ralph Darling</a>, was also a partner with Arthur Hill in the ownership of newspaper <a href="The%20Monitor%20%28Sydney%2C%20NSW%29">"The Monitor"</a>. He published an attack on the archdeacon, for which he was sued for libel. The courts fined him only <a href="Pound%20%28currency%29">£</a>1 and placed him on a bond. Hall appealed to <a href="Reginald%20Heber">Reginald Heber</a>, <a href="Diocese%20of%20Calcutta%20of%20the%20Church%20of%20North%20India">Bishop of Calcutta</a> (who was the relevant ecclesiastical authority at the time) and to the law where he was awarded £25 damages. The archdeacon, who was extremely unpopular, returned to London in 1828.

The first major alteration to the church was the enclosing of the south portico to form a vestry. In 1832 <a href="John%20Verge">John Verge</a> constructed another vestry at the eastern end of the church, in strict conformity with the architectural style of Greenway. Growth of the congregation necessitated further changes. Galleries were added along the northern and eastern walls. As the three eastern windows had been blocked by Verge's vestry, the interior became increasingly badly lit with every change. Verge's solution was to pierce <a href="Rose%20window">ocular windows</a> high in the walls to light the galleries.

In 1836, the Reverend Richard Hill had a fit of <a href="apoplexy">apoplexy</a> in the <a href="vestry">vestry</a> and died. Soon after this dramatic event, and while the church was still in mourning, the Right Reverend <a href="William%20Grant%20Broughton">William Grant Broughton</a> was installed as <a href="Anglican%20Archbishop%20of%20Sydney">Bishop of Australia</a> during a service in St James' lasting five hours. Since Macquarie's plans for a new cathedral on <a href="George%20Street%2C%20Sydney">George Street</a> had not come to fruition, Broughton acted as if St James' were a <a href="pro-cathedral">pro-cathedral</a>. Robert Cartwright and then Napoleon Woodd succeeded Richard Hill at St James'.

In 1839 the Reverend <a href="Robert%20Allwood">Robert Allwood</a>, educated at <a href="Eton%20College">Eton College</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, arrived in Sydney and was appointed to St James' by Bishop Broughton, in which parish he served for 44 years until his retirement in 1884. Allwood was an important patron of education in <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> Sydney. Under him, the parish school expanded and his teacher training college became a "model school". He was also the principal tutor at St James' College, which originally met in St James' parsonage (on the corner of King Street and Macquarie Street) until it was transferred to "Lyndhurst" at <a href="Glebe%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">The Glebe</a>.

In 1848, St James' was the venue for a full military funeral, "attended by 150 carriages" and in 1878 Allwood officiated at the <a href="wedding%20of%20Nora%20Robinson%20and%20Alexander%20Kirkman%20Finlay">wedding of Nora Robinson and Alexander Kirkman Finlay</a>. As the second <a href="vice-regal">vice-regal</a> wedding in the colony this ceremony was attended by many dignitaries and attracted a "crushing" crowd of 10,000 cheering onlookers. <a href="Edmund%20Barton">Edmund Barton</a>, the first <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>, was baptised at St James' on 4 July 1849.

Unlike Hill, Allwood advocated the principles of the <a href="Oxford%20Movement">Oxford Movement</a> (also known as "Tractarianism" after its publication of <a href="Tracts%20for%20the%20Times">Tracts for the Times</a>), which stressed the historical continuity of the Church of England, and placed a high importance upon the sacraments and the liturgy. "The culmination" of a trend towards Tractarianism in the colony was the founding in 1845, of St James' College – "the first seminary for training local ordinands". However, many colonial Anglicans were unhappy with Tractarian trends because Roman Catholics "were equated with Irish", and with "Romanism". "Serious differences opinion in matters of doctrine" began to "escalate into public debate as the influences of the Oxford Movement began to be felt in the Australian colonies" in the 1840s.

Allwood's sermons were brief and Holy Communion was celebrated every Sunday. The <a href="Pipe%20organ">organ</a>, which had been installed in 1827, was moved to the space of the southern vestry, and the pulpit and reading desk place in front of it where they could be seen from all parts of the church. The holy table continued to be located at the eastern end of the building. Bishop Broughton supported the Tractarian views of Allwood, but his successor, <a href="Frederic%20Barker">Frederic Barker</a>, who became bishop in 1855, was strongly Evangelical. The division in style between St James' and the "low church" ethos that predominated in the Sydney Diocese began at this time.

During the 1880s Sydney became a prosperous city, commerce and industry flourished, and the suburbs expanded. As more churches were built and fewer people lived in the heart of the city, the congregation of St James' Church shrank. The challenge that it faced was to minister effectively to city workers, rather than dwellers, to serve the poor of the city, and to attract those whose preference was for the style of worship and intellectual, topical preaching that distinguished St James' from many of the newly created parish churches. The young Henry Latimer Jackson, from Cambridge, was appointed in 1885. He introduced weekday services and a magazine called "The Kalendar", one of Australia's first parish papers. He also lectured at Sydney University, addressed conferences, spoke at synod and acted as secretary to the newly established <a href="Sydney%20Church%20of%20England%20Grammar%20School">Sydney Church of England Boys' Grammar School</a>. However, his sermons were described as "not so much opposed, as simply not understood". He resigned in 1895 after accepting a position in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20Ely">Diocese of Ely</a>.
Although Sydney was prospering, St James' had an acute shortage of money and "the government considered resuming the site for a city railway". The trustees at this time leased the <a href="Clergy%20house">parsonage</a> and, in 1894, used the money for urgent restoration to the exterior of the building. The architect <a href="Varney%20Parkes">Varney Parkes</a> replaced the old <a href="spire">spire</a>, using copper that was pre-weathered so that there was no radical change in its appearance. He removed infilling from the north portico and designed a new portico and entrance to the tower to match that of the eastern vestry. The result was to make the north face of the building its most significant aspect.

Jackson's successor was <a href="William%20Carr%20Smith">William Carr Smith</a>, a man with socialist ideals and a commitment to social reform and spiritual outreach. He preached long and engaging sermons inside the church and for a time in the open air in <a href="The%20Domain">The Domain</a> as well. Carr Smith had brought with him from England the "most recent developments" in the restoration of ancient liturgy, so he was able to help St James' play a "notable part" in Sydney's revival of Anglo-Catholicism, setting "new standards of ceremonial". To serve these purposes the architect <a href="John%20H.%20Buckeridge">John H. Buckeridge</a> was employed to transform the building's interior, completing the work in 1901.
The most significant change was the new emphasis given to the <a href="altar">altar</a>, which was made the focus of attention and "flanked by the pulpit, reading desks and lectern." The "principal features" under the Carr Smith plan were the construction of the <a href="apse">apse</a>, set into the eastern vestry to create a <a href="Sanctuary%23Sanctuary%20as%20an%20altar">sanctuary</a>; the raising of the <a href="chancel">chancel</a> floor which created a platform, five steps above the nave for the <a href="Choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a>, framed by the organ divided into two sections; the making of a new, unobtrusive entrance to the tower and western gallery; and the removal of the box pews and the eastern and northern galleries. The memorial plaques were also rearranged. The choir was ornamented with a <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> floor and ornate brasswork which complemented the large brass eagle lectern by the English ecclesiastical suppliers, J. Wippell and Company, that commemorated Canon Robert Allwood. The floor of the pulpit was made from parts of the old three-decker one. The organ, refurbished and enlarged by Davidson of Sydney, was installed in 1903. With the removal of the organ, the south vestry was made into a side chapel. Eight large <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> windows were installed between 1903 and 1913, along with a new pulpit, altar and <a href="retable">retable</a>, all of which were given as memorials. Another improvement was "the placing of double windows on the King-street side to shut out the sound of the traffic, which hitherto has been a serious annoyance to both the officiating clergymen and the congregation". In 1897, St James' Hall was offered to Father Dorotheos Bakalliarios, a <a href="Greek%20Orthodox%20Church">Greek Orthodox</a> priest from <a href="Samos">Samos</a> for Orthodox services in Sydney. In 1904 the diocesan architect, <a href="Burcham%20Clamp">John Burcham Clamp</a>, was employed to design a new <a href="Church%20hall">parish hall</a>.

In 1900, the Governor, <a href="William%20Lygon%2C%207th%20Earl%20Beauchamp">Earl Beauchamp</a>, presented to the church a number of embroidered <a href="Stole%20%28vestment%29">stoles</a> made by the <a href="Warham%20Guild">Warham Guild</a> of London, along with <a href="cope">cope</a>s and <a href="chasuble">chasuble</a>s. The centenary of the laying of the foundation stone was celebrated in October 1919 with a program of events that extended over nine days. Festivities included services at which the Bishops of <a href="Armidale%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Armidale</a> and <a href="Bathurst%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bathurst</a> were special preachers, music, processions, a <a href="Magic%20lantern">lantern</a> lecture on "Old Sydney" by the municipal librarian, and social events such as a ferry outing and a luncheon at which the chief guest was the Governor <a href="Walter%20Edward%20Davidson">Sir Walter Davidson</a> accompanied by his wife <a href="Margaret%20Davidson">Lady Davidson</a>. Also scheduled was a welcome to soldiers returned from the <a href="World%20War%20I">Great War</a>. An illustrated historical memoir was produced and sold for two <a href="Shilling%20%28Australian%29">shillings</a>.

The celebrations for the centenary of the Oxford Movement occurred during the tenure of the eighth rector of St James', <a href="Philip%20Arthur%20Micklem">Philip Micklem</a>. However, "they were not centred on the cathedral, but on St James'", Sydney being the only Australian diocese that "failed officially to observe the occasion". Micklem chaired a rally on 19 July 1933 in St James' Hall that was attended by governor <a href="Philip%20Game">Philip Game</a> and Lady Game, "and five bishops representing three states." The 180th anniversary of the Oxford Movement fell in the 21st century, and the rector of St James' preached at the commemoration.

Micklem was "a pioneer advocate of the preservation of early colonial architecture". As the century progressed, there were a number of threats to the church's historic environment, which includes Greenway's Law Courts and <a href="Hyde%20Park%20Barracks%2C%20Sydney">Hyde Park Barracks</a>. In spite of the threats to these colonial era buildings, they survived to form an important Sydney precinct. Both the building and the organisation continued to serve the city. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, for example, the crypt was used as a "Hostel for Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen" and the ninth rector, Edwin John Davidson, incumbent during that period, "gained fame" for the church with his "pungent sermons on current affairs". The eleventh rector, Frank Cuttriss, had an <a href="Ecumenism">ecumenical</a> outlook – he was a member of a meeting of the <a href="World%20Council%20of%20Churches">World Council of Churches</a> at <a href="Uppsala">Uppsala</a> and an observer to the <a href="Second%20Vatican%20Council">Second Vatican Council</a>.

St James' was the locus of many notable events throughout the 20th century, including weddings and funerals of famous, significant or notorious people, visits from theologians and senior clerics, and when needed, services for the <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> communities. At the wedding of singer <a href="Gladys%20Moncrieff">Gladys Moncrieff</a> and Tom Moore on 20 May 1924, the crowd in the streets nearby was so large that traffic was brought to a standstill, several women fell and two were so badly hurt they were taken to hospital. At the time Moncrieff was appearing in "<a href="The%20Merry%20Widow">The Merry Widow</a>" and returned to the stage on the night of her wedding. St James' was represented in the opening ceremonies of the <a href="Sydney%20Harbour%20Bridge">Sydney Harbour Bridge</a> by a <a href="Float%20%28parade%29">float</a> in the form of the church building. The church was "packed to the doors" when the seventh rector, <a href="Francis%20Wentworth-Sheilds">W.F. Wentworth-Sheilds</a>, officiated at the "impressive funeral" of <a href="Walter%20Liberty%20Vernon">Walter Liberty Vernon</a> in 1914. In 1950, four thousand people were reported to have lined the streets after the State funeral at St. James' of the first <a href="Australia%E2%80%93Sweden%20relations">Minister for Sweden in Australia</a>, Constans Lundquist, who died suddenly at the Swedish Legation in Sydney. Controversial former Governor-General, <a href="John%20Kerr%20%28governor-general%29">Sir John Kerr</a> had a private funeral and memorial service in St James' in 1991 rather than a State funeral because of his fall from favour as the result of his decision to sack the <a href="Whitlam%20government">Whitlam government</a> in 1975. Delivering the sermon at St James' during an ecumenical event on 14 October 1993, Archbishop <a href="Desmond%20Tutu">Desmond Tutu</a> thanked Australians for supporting the struggle against <a href="Apartheid%20in%20South%20Africa">apartheid</a>.

During the 20th century both choral and organ musical components developed to a high standard and were integral to the liturgy at St James'. In addition, music was offered to the wider community in the form of recitals, often in ways that elucidate the liturgy and take advantage of church acoustics and sacred settings. Weekday recitals, such as the organ recitals given in 1936 of music by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, continued in addition to the music played on Sundays.

In the 21st century, St James' continues its work in the city centre via its ministry and engagement in the issues of the day. In the 19th century, there were controversies about tractarianism; in the 20th, there was the impact of the two world wars; in the 21st century, the church has confronted the difficult and topical issues of violence, euthanasia, refugees, marriage and sexuality. The church's relationship with government and the legal community began when the colony was under military government and the Church of England was the <a href="State%20religion">established church</a>. Due to the church's history and its proximity to the convict barracks (later an immigration centre), the law courts (both the old and the new ones) as well as the New South Wales parliament, the relationship continues. It is evident in special services attended by the governor as well as the annual service to mark the opening of the <a href="legal%20year">law term</a>.

St James' commitment to <a href="social%20justice">social justice</a> and education began in the 19th century with efforts to serve both convicts and settlers. It continued in the 20th with support for people affected by war, for example, when the church became "a busy centre of war-time life". Since early in the 20th century, service to the community has included visits to those imprisoned or ill as well as practical help to the city's homeless and an annual schedule of educational seminars at the St James' Institute.

On 6 February 2012, the rector Andrew Sempell officiated at a thanksgiving for <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> to mark the <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">sixtieth anniversary</a> of her accession to the throne in a service attended by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal <a href="George%20Pell">George Pell</a> and the <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a>, <a href="Marie%20Bashir">Marie Bashir</a> and on 9 September 2015, when Queen Elizabeth II became the longest-serving British monarch and Queen of Australia, there was a special <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Choral Evensong</a> service to give thanks. At the Jubilee service, the <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Chief Justice of New South Wales</a>, <a href="Tom%20Bathurst">Tom Bathurst</a>, read the first lesson and the service concluded with the <a href="Advance%20Australia%20Fair">Australian National Anthem</a> and an organ postlude of <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a>'s "<a href="Pomp%20and%20Circumstance%20Marches">Pomp and Circumstance March</a> No. 4". On 23 March 2012, a memorial service for <a href="Margaret%20Whitlam">Margaret Whitlam</a>, wife of former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>, <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a>, was attended by Prime Minister <a href="Julia%20Gillard">Julia Gillard</a>, and several former prime ministers.

St James' Church is located at the east end and on the south side of King Street, Sydney and was constructed between 1819-1824. Set on an impressive <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a> base, the building is of face brick with the walls articulated by brick <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a>. The elongated windows have semi-circular heads with radiating rubbed bricks and protective fish-scale pattern, green glazing has been installed in the windows on the north side. On the east <a href="gable">gable</a> is a sandstone commemorative plaque with the inscription 'St James's Church Erected 1820 Lachlan Macquarie Esq. Governor'. The <a href="hipped%20roof">hipped roof</a> is of slate with four gable vents on the north and south sides. The detailing of the lower, eastern extension (built in 1832-1833) is closely comparable with the original but with sandstone piers and pediment and with a domed copper roof. The two small <a href="Portico">porticos</a> on the north and south sides, with sandstone <a href="columns">columns</a> and <a href="Pediment">pediments</a>, complement the original and much larger central porticos. A third small portico, added in 1894-1895, on the north side of the tower is of comparable design. The south portico was filled in before the building was completed and is now enclosed with glass. All of the entrances have slate steps with sandstone risers and are tiled with black and white <a href="marble">marble</a>. The square brick tower at the west end has a timber framed, candle snuffer <a href="spire">spire</a>, clad in sheet copper with <a href="Chevron%20%28insignia%29">chevron</a> pattern, surmounted by a copper orb and cross. There is a peal of eight bells in the tower.

The interior of the church, which is essentially as rebuilt in 1900-1902, faces east and has a raised chancel and sanctuary (the latter set within an apse with gold <a href="mosaic">mosaic</a> semi-<a href="dome">dome</a>) with marble and mosaic flooring, flanked by the organ and choir. The chancel is separated from the main body of the church by a <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> and brass screen with marble base on which stand the cedar pulpit and brass lectern. The western gallery, marble memorials and cedar panelling are parts of the 19th century interior retained in the later work. The pews are open cedar benches and the flooring is of polished timber blocks with white marble <a href="Aisle">aisles</a> with a black key border. The stained glass windows are mainly English and of 20th century date with some 1890s coloured and painted glass, including internal doors and <a href="Fanlight">fanlights</a>. The <a href="pressed%20metal%20ceiling">pressed metal ceiling</a> (installed in 1894-1895) has been adapted to improve ventilation and to accommodate modern pendant lights. The font is on a raised marble platform in the baptistery at the base of the tower. The emblems of St James the Great are incorporated in various decorative elements of the interior including stained and painted glass, pew ends and mosaic flooring. The walls of the Chapel of the Holy Spirit (the southern portico), installed in 1988, are a major contemporary glasswork which the chapel's furniture and fittings were specially designed to complement.

The original building has an extensive <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a> (called the crypt) with sandstone walls and a central corridor with brick groined ceiling and twelve brick barrel vaults. The flooring is concrete with slate tiles. The basement beneath the eastern extension is of similar construction but has a timber ceiling as does the entrance at the base of the tower. The Children's Chapel and columbarium are located in two of the <a href="Bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a> of the crypt. The church is enclosed with a decorative wrought iron fence set on a sandstone base.

St James' Church is an integral part of the group of surviving Macquarie period buildings which also includes the former Hyde Park Barracks, [Old] Supreme Court, General Hospital [the Mint and Parliament House] and Government House offices and stables [Conservatorium of Music]. The church is the only building of this group to retain its original function.

One of Greenway's finest works, St James' is listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. It has been called an "architectural gem" and was featured by <a href="Dan%20Cruickshank">Dan Cruickshank</a> in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television series "<a href="Around%20the%20World%20in%2080%20Treasures">Around the World in 80 Treasures</a>." From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James' appeared on the Australian <a href="Australian%20ten-dollar%20note">Australian ten-dollar note</a> among other Greenway buildings. In 1973, the church appeared on a 50 cent <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a>, one of four in a series illustrating <a href="Architecture%20of%20Australia">Australian architecture</a> issued to commemorate the opening of the <a href="Sydney%20Opera%20House">Sydney Opera House</a>. The <a href="Greenway%20Wing%20%28Supreme%20Court%20of%20New%20South%20Wales%29">Old Supreme Court building</a>, also designed by Greenway with alternations by others, located next to the church is of the same date. Across the square is Greenway's "masterpiece", the <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> World Heritage listed-<a href="Hyde%20Park%20Barracks%2C%20Sydney">Hyde Park Barracks</a>, designed to align with the church. Beside the barracks stands Sydney's oldest public building, part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the <a href="Sydney%20Mint">Mint Building</a>. Separated from the Mint by the present-day <a href="Sydney%20Hospital">Sydney Hospital</a> is <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Sydney">Parliament House, Sydney</a>, of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital, and is now home to the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20State%20Parliament">New South Wales State Parliament</a>.

The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the <a href="vestry">vestries</a> at the eastern end. Apart from these vestries, which retain the established style and proportions, the church externally remains "fine Georgian" much as Greenway conceived it. Relying on the "virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end", Greenway maintained the <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">classical</a> tradition, unaffected by the <a href="Revivalism%20%28architecture%29">Revivalist</a> styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony. He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks, constructed in 1817–19. The two buildings have similar proportions, <a href="pilaster">pilaster</a>s and <a href="gable">gable</a>s and together constitute an important example of <a href="town-planning">town-planning</a>. Before the advent of high-rise buildings, the spire used to "serve as a guide for mariners coming up Port Jackson".

St James' originally took the form of a simple rectangular block, without transepts or <a href="chancel">chancel</a>, with a tower at the western end and a classical portico of the <a href="Doric%20order">Doric order</a> on either side. To this has been added Verge's vestry framed by two small <a href="portico">portico</a>s, and a similar portico as an entrance to the tower. The church is built of local brick, its walls divided by brick pilasters into a series of bays. The walls are pierced by large windows with round arched heads in a colour that separates and defines them against the walls. The roof carries over the end walls with the gable forming triangular <a href="pediment">pediment</a>s of classical proportions carrying a <a href="cornice">cornice</a> across the eaves line. Thus the architectural treatment on the side walls is continued around the end walls.

The original interior differed greatly in layout from that of the present. There was no structural chancel, the focus of the church being a large pulpit. During the mid 19th century galleries overlooked the pulpit from three sides. Of the original galleries, only the western one of <a href="Australian%20Red%20Cedar">Australian Red Cedar</a> remains in place. The <a href="coffer">coffer</a>ed ceiling (an addition from 1882 replacing the original <a href="lath">lath</a> and <a href="plaster">plaster</a> ceiling), the low-backed pews (from shortly after) and the predominantly classical memorials all contribute to the present interior retaining the character of a Georgian church.

At the eastern end, the communion table is set into a small apse with its semi-dome adorned with gold mosaic tiles that were added in 1960. The altar is a commemorative gift from the Lloyd family, whose son was the first server appointed at St James'. It generally has an <a href="altar%20frontal">altar frontal</a> in the colour of the <a href="Liturgical%20year">liturgical season or festival</a>. With no structural choir area, the chancel is built out and into the body of the church as a platform enclosed within gated <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought iron</a> and brass railings and approached by steps. The mosaic floor of the chancel is ornately with designs showing the <a href="seven%20gifts%20of%20the%20Holy%20Spirit">seven gifts of the Holy Spirit</a> (Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Ghostly Strength, Knowledge, Godliness and Holy Fear) along with symbols of St James the Great (the staff, scrip, palm, <a href="scallop%23Shell%20of%20Saint%20James">scallop shell</a> and hat of the <a href="pilgrim">pilgrim</a>). The chancel is framed on either side by the organ pipes.

There are five large stained glass windows on the northern and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the belltower and on the western wall. Most of them are designed by <a href="Percy%20Bacon%20Brothers">Percy Bacon Brothers</a> and the majority were donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910. The stained glass fanlight depicting <a href="James%2C%20son%20of%20Zebedee">James</a> and <a href="John%20the%20Apostle">John</a>, the sons of <a href="Zebedee">Zebedee</a>, was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930. The window behind the <a href="baptismal%20font">baptismal font</a>, depicting Christ with the Children, was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector in the presence of the then Primate, <a href="Peter%20Carnley">Peter Carnley</a>.

Previously enclosed and used as a vestry and then an organ chamber, the south porch became a chapel in 1903. In 1988, the side chapel was remodelled and dedicated as the Chapel of the Holy Spirit. The parish and the <a href="Australian%20Bicentenary">Bicentennial Council of New South Wales</a> funded the redesign which saw the removal of the infilling from between the columns of the portico and its replacement with stained glass. The award-winning "Creation Window", designed by Australian artist David Wright, spreads across the three walls and represents the interaction of earth, air, fire and water, symbolic of the action of the Spirit in creation, in life and in rebirth in Christ. The new furniture for the chapel was designed by Leon Sadubin.

Beneath the church is a large <a href="undercroft">undercroft</a>, built of brick and <a href="groin%20vault">groin vault</a>ed. It has been used for many purposes: as a residence by the widow of Richard Hill and later by a verger; by Canon Allwood as a part-time bedroom; for the parish's schools; and as a shelter by Australian, American and British armed forces during the two world wars. Rector Francis Wentworth-Sheilds gave the city parish "a big role as a drop-in centre for servicemen" during the First World War. During the Second World War bed and bedding were provided to over 30,000 Allied servicemen.

The western bay on the south side of the crypt is the Chapel of St Mary and the Angels, better known simply as the "<a href="Children%27s%20Chapel%2C%20St%20James%27%20Church%2C%20Sydney">Children's Chapel</a>". It was opened in 1929 as a chapel for younger children. A specially adapted form of <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> is celebrated there on the first Sunday of the month. All four walls of the chapel and its ceiling are decorated with <a href="mural">mural</a>s designed by the writer and artist <a href="Ethel%20Anderson">Ethel Anderson</a> and executed by the Turramurra Wall Painters Union, a group of <a href="Modernism">Modernist</a> painters she founded in 1927. The murals underwent extensive conservation in 1992–1993.

The crypt was restored by Geoffrey Danks in 1977–78. In the 21st century, the bays on either side of the crypt's central corridor are used for a variety of purposes. At the eastern end they house a commercial kitchen. Some bays are used as offices; one (The Chapel of All Souls) contains a <a href="columbarium">columbarium</a>; another houses a <a href="lending%20library">lending library</a> for parishioners.

St James' provides a record of important elements of Sydney's history in both physical and documentary form. There are over 300 memorials commemorating important members of 19th century colonial society, people who served the colony generally and parishioners from the 20th century. In addition, many of the stained glass windows and items of furniture have been donated as memorials. For example, the large stained glass window of <a href="Saint%20George">Saint George</a> on the northern wall is a memorial to Keith Kinnaird Mackellar, who died in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> aged 20. He was the brother of poet <a href="Dorothea%20Mackellar">Dorothea Mackellar</a>. These memorials are the reason the church was sometimes called "The <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> of the South". As early as 1876, the wall tablets were described as "full of sad memories to the old inhabitants, interesting reminiscences to those who have studied Australian history".

The first monument erected in the church was the memorial to Commodore Sir <a href="James%20Brisbane">James Brisbane</a>, who died in Sydney on his way to serve in South America in command of <a href="HMS%20Warspite%20%281807%29">HMS Warspite</a>. It was sculpted by <a href="Francis%20Leggatt%20Chantrey">Sir Francis Chantrey</a>, sent to Sydney by Lady Brisbane and installed in the church in 1830. The Brisbane memorial began the tradition of memorial tablets to "prominent people". The memorial to <a href="Robert%20Wardell">Robert Wardell</a> in 1834 rendered "bushranger" into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as "". Four other monuments were installed between 1830 and 1839. The only memorial on which an indigenous Australian appears is that of <a href="Edmund%20Kennedy">Edmund Kennedy</a> (said to have been "a communicant at St James’") on whose tablet <a href="Jackey%20Jackey">Jackey Jackey</a> is remembered. There are memorials to the Macleay family of naturalists, <a href="Alexander%20Macleay">Alexander</a> and <a href="William%20Sharp%20Macleay">William Sharp Macleay</a>. 

The largest single memorial of the 20th century is the <a href="war%20memorial">war memorial</a>, to the design of <a href="William%20Hardy%20Wilson">Hardy Wilson</a>, dedicated on 14 June 1922. It commemorates more than 50 men associated with St James' who were killed in the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, throughout which the roll of honour was regularly read during the Eucharist. In 2014, St James' was part of a series of commemorations of the bicentenary of the death of the colony's first <a href="Governors%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Phillip">Arthur Phillip</a>. On 31 August, a memorial plaque, similar in form to one placed in the nave of Westminster Abbey on 9 July, was unveiled by the 37th Governor, <a href="Marie%20Bashir">Marie Bashir</a>.

The church has all its baptismal and marriage registers dating from 1824 to the present day. These were originally handwritten; printed forms came into existence "by government order" in 1826. Since it was not compulsory to register births, deaths and marriages until after 1855, the records held by St James' are particularly valuable to historians and genealogists and copies are held in the <a href="National%20Library%20of%20Australia">National Library of Australia</a>.

Since its erection, the building has undergone significant repair, renovation and conservation, including work on the building fabric, the stained glass windows, the mosaic floors in the chancel and sanctuary and conservation of the Children's Chapel. Major work was done on the interior and the spire in the 1890s and on the crypt in the 1970s.

The spire was extensively restored from 2008 to 2010, including the tower masonry, the interior framing, the copper covering and the orb and cross. The spire was rededicated on 20 October 2010. The restorations were awarded the <a href="National%20Trust%20of%20Australia">National Trust of Australia</a> Built Heritage Award on 4 April 2011 and the <a href="Australian%20Institute%20of%20Architects">AIA</a> Greenway Award for Heritage. The jury said that the restoration work showed "consummate care by the architect, the engineer and the builder in conserving the original structure and fabric of the building, improving its strength, performance and waterproofing".

Restoration continued with work on the church's <a href="Slate%23Slate%20in%20buildings">slate</a> roof and sandstone perimeter fence. The Spanish slates, installed in the 1970s, proved not to be durable in Sydney's climate due to their high iron content and their poor fixing had resulted in further damage. The solution to the deterioration was to replace the slates using <a href="Slate%20industry%20in%20Wales">Welsh slates</a>. The roof project was completed after a fund-raising effort supported by the National Trust of Australia. In 2013, the interior was repainted after preparation that involved "colour testing and selection, memorial protection and ceiling acoustic repairs". As a heritage-listed building, the church has a program of continual conservation. Its custodians remain "ever mindful" of their responsibility to the wider public as well as to the congregation.

As at 8 April 1995, the Spanish slate roof (1970s) needed replacement with Welsh slate. Substantial modifications and additions have been made to St James' Church since its completion in 1824 but without significant loss of character of the exterior as a Georgian town church. The interior of the church was totally remodelled in 1900-1902 and all earlier fabric removed with the exception of the 19th century memorials, some timber panelling and the basic retention of the western gallery. The form and contents of the interior of the church are essentially as designed and built at this period with the exception of the Chapel of the Holy Spirit (south portico) which was rebuilt in 1988.

St James' offers three <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>s on Sundays: a Said Eucharist, a Sung Eucharist and a Choral Eucharist. There is a regular <a href="Evening%20Prayer%20%28Anglican%29">Choral Evensong</a> on Wednesdays and one Sunday each month. The Eucharist and other services are also celebrated during the week and the robed choir contributes to its "cathedral style worship". Festival services are popular and known for their standard of liturgy and music, particularly those services which celebrate high points of the church year such as <a href="Holy%20Week">Holy Week</a> and Easter, the <a href="Advent">Advent</a> carols, the <a href="Nine%20Lessons%20and%20Carols">Nine Lessons and Carols</a>, the Christmas Eve Midnight Mass and the patronal festival of St James (son of Zebedee, also known as James the Great) in July. A series of orchestral Masses is held in January.

St James' continues to maintain a formal and sacramental liturgy and has weathered the storm of criticism from a diocese with increasingly "<a href="Low%20church">Low church</a>" practices. It is one of the few Sydney Anglican churches that has upheld the norms of mainstream Anglican tradition, including the use of the <a href="Stole%20%28vestment%29">stole</a> by clergy during services, especially during sacraments such as <a href="baptism">baptism</a>s and marriages; the <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a> and sacred church music, including the singing of hymns from a <a href="hymnal">hymnal</a>.

The Constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia "commit[s] Anglicans to mainstream Christian orthodoxy", but its ruling principles direct it to that particular tradition within as "represented by the Church of England". The Australian church had to work out the meaning of its common heritage "in the context of the different cultures of the separate colonies" but "the way in which that faith pedigree was appealed to and interpreted ... has highlighted differences." Peter Carnley, former primate of the Anglican Church of Australia, has described Anglicanism's "unique or essential identity" as having "not so much a body of theological teaching, as a style of theological reflection" that goes back to the Elizabethan theologian <a href="Richard%20Hooker">Richard Hooker</a>. St James' conforms to this Anglican tradition, part of which is a general dislike of what used to be referred to as 'Enthusiasm': that is, a dislike of "pious individualism and emotional exuberance". St James' theological position in the liturgy is evidently consistent with Carnley's explanation that <a href="Incarnation%20%28Christianity%29">incarnational</a> reality "might be experienced with the aid of aesthetic, symbolic or sacramental aids to worship." Such an adherence to the importance of the sacred and the sublime in worship remains in sharp contradistinction to practice in the surrounding mostly evangelical diocese, which typically eschews beauty and holds to an "ultra-low ecclesiastical aesthetic" that is combined with "ultra-conservative social values". Teaching at St James' takes account of both the Biblical and contemporary historical context. In the Sydney diocese, St James's differing view has therefore been controversial since the 19th century as the various rectors led the church towards and away from Anglo-Catholicism. Micklem, for example, renewed Anglo-Catholic churchmanship and Davidson "returned it firmly to a moderate position".

St James' aims to be "an open and inclusive Christian community" that "welcomes all, regardless of age, race, sexual orientation or religion". During the long debate in the diocese about the acceptability of <a href="Ordination%20of%20women%20in%20the%20Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Sydney">women as priests</a> and also as preachers, for example, women clergy were welcome. One of the first women ordained as a priest in the Anglican Church in Australia, the Revd Susanna Pain, served as a deacon at St James' and women in leadership positions in the Anglican Church such as Bishops <a href="Kay%20Goldsworthy">Kay Goldsworthy</a> and <a href="Genieve%20Blackwell">Genieve Blackwell</a>, have been invited to preach. The current rector contributes to the public debate about the role and responsibilities of the church in a secularised world and in response to statements about same-sex marriage from the Archbishop of Sydney, published a dissenting view.

In the beginning, convicts, soldiers, governors and civil authorities attended the church; in the 21st century, regular patronage by, and programs for, governors, politicians, the legal community and the homeless create a similarly diverse mix. In 1900, such a congregation was described by the sixth rector as representing "many types, many classes. Here we find rich and poor, old and new, the Governor and the Domain loafer, the passing visitor, and the grandchildren of those whose memorial tablets testify to a long connection with the church." William Carr Smith's observation was that "this makes the congregation a difficult one to handle."

Nevertheless, the congregation provides volunteer labour and donates funds for many of church's activities, including laundry work, library administration, flower arrangements, bell ringing, singing in the parish choir and hospitality for the Sister Freda mission. Furnishings for the chapel in the Sydney Hospital were provided by the parishioners during Carr Smith's time, when he became chaplain to the hospital.

St James' work for the poor, as well as for the city's legal and medical professions, has been continuous from the 19th century. Since early times work "for the poor of the parish"; the promotion of "overseas and inland missions"; liaison with "the city professions in law and medicine" and running "devotional and discussion groups" has been incorporated into the church's mission. In the 20th century, the ninth and tenth rectors emphasised "the church's responsibility to society" and encouraged St James' role in the city. In the 21st century, these activities have been supplemented by chaplaincy and professional counselling services directed at dealing with the problems associated with the stresses of city life.

The "most direct part of St James' social welfare work" is the Sister Freda Mission, which began in 1899. Among other things, this ministry provides weekly lunches to the needy and a full dinner at Christmas. Sister Freda (Emily Rich) was a member of the <a href="Community%20of%20the%20Sisters%20of%20the%20Church">Community of the Sisters of the Church</a>, a religious order which started the Collegiate School in <a href="Paddington%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Paddington</a> in 1895. Sister Freda and other members of the order took over the organisation of its mission to the homeless in 1899. On Christmas Day in 1901 "about 60 men were entertained at dinner at St James' parish hall, and later in the afternoon 250 unemployed men were treated to tea in the same building by the sisters of the church." After her death in 1936, Sister Freda's name was given to the mission and St James' took over responsibility for its organisation. Since 1954, this service has operated out of the church crypt, relying on donations, including food sourced by <a href="OzHarvest">OzHarvest</a>, and the efforts of volunteer parishioners.

The church's ministry to Sydney's legal fraternity is facilitated by its proximity to buildings used by the profession, including the Law Courts, which is the main building of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Supreme Court of New South Wales</a> and houses the Sydney registry of the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Australia">High Court of Australia</a>; <a href="The%20College%20of%20Law%20%28Australia%29">the College of Law</a> and the St James Campus of the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>, which is the former home of <a href="Sydney%20Law%20School">Sydney Law School</a>, still mainly used for legal education by the university. <a href="Phillip%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Phillip Street</a>, which runs north from the church, is home to a large number of <a href="barristers%27%20chambers">barristers' chambers</a> as well as the <a href="Law%20Society%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Law Society of New South Wales</a>.

Due to this proximity, the church and legal profession have a longstanding relationship, anchored by an annual service to mark the beginning of the <a href="legal%20year">legal year</a> which is attended by judges, solicitors and members of the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">Bar</a> from the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Supreme Court of New South Wales</a> in ceremonial attire. In the 19th century, the relationship was reported in the context of delays to the law and concerns about the need for a suitable set of new courts. In the 20th, it was noted that the "relationship of law and religion" was one of "two co-operating forces, approaching, from different sides, a problem which was common to them both of securing right conduct"; and in the 21st century, the Governor still attends special services. Since 1950, there has also been an annual service for the members of the <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Order of St Michael and St George</a>.

In the 19th century, religious denominations made a major contribution to education at all levels before this was taken over by the state. From its beginnings, St James' was involved in education for both children and adults. Richard Hill, the first incumbent, "began Australia's first kindergarten and <a href="William%20Timothy%20Cape">William Cape</a> managed a school based on new educational principles". Hill worked with the <a href="Benevolent%20Society">Benevolent Society</a>, the <a href="Bible%20society">Bible Society</a>, <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginals</a>, the <a href="Sydney%20Hospital">Hospital</a>, "various convict establishments and a range of schools," including <a href="Industrial%20School">Industrial School</a>s. By 1823 Greenway's school building had been erected in <a href="Elizabeth%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Elizabeth Street</a> and the principal St James' School was situated there until 1882, becoming the Anglican "normal" school with more than 600 students and a range of experienced teachers. In secondary education, a Sydney branch of the <a href="The%20King%27s%20School%2C%20Parramatta">King's School</a> operated briefly in the Greenway building and Bishop Broughton operated the St James' Grammar School in a building erected in <a href="Phillip%20Street%2C%20Sydney">Phillip Street</a>. The Grammar School, presided over by the Revd C. Kemp was described as "of inestimable value to the then youth of the colony". Bishop Broughton also set up St James' College to provide tertiary education for secular students as well as to prepare students for <a href="ordination">ordination</a>. The St James' School closed in 1882 and the government resumed the Greenway building. Tuition for the students of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20College%2C%20University%20of%20Sydney">St Paul's College, University of Sydney</a> was originally provided in the vestry of St James'.

In the 20th century, St James' developed its education program for children and adults and continued them in the 21st century. A Sunday school for children is held in the crypt. Educational activities for adults are offered through the St James' Institute which provides a range of programs open to all to explore the Christian faith and engage in debate about contemporary issues from a theological perspective. For example, in 2012, the Institute hosted a seminar on "Women in the Australian Church: Untold Stories" in conjunction with the International Women's Network and <a href="Movement%20for%20the%20Ordination%20of%20Women">MOWatch</a>. In 2013, there was a meeting of "deans and ministers from Anglican churches that serve the business districts in major cities around world" to discuss the churches' response to the <a href="Financial%20crisis%20of%202007%E2%80%9308">Global Financial Crisis</a>.

The Reverend <a href="Samuel%20Marsden">Samuel Marsden</a> delivered the first sermon on 6 July 1824. In 1836 the first (and only) Bishop of Australia, William Grant Broughton, was installed at St James' as there was still no cathedral. Broughton regularly officiated at St James' as at the first ordination of an Anglican priest in Australia (the Revd T. Sharpe) on 17 December 1836.

The <a href="rector%20%28ecclesiastical%29">rector</a> of St James' is assisted by associate rectors (it was not until the 1890s that the title "rector" was used). The current (sixteenth) rector is the Reverend Andrew Sempell and the associate rector is the Reverend John Stewart.

St James' has had a strong musical and choral tradition "integral" to its liturgies since the 1820s and is known both for the high standard of the <a href="Church%20music">sacred music</a> as well as for its regular public recitals and concerts. St James' has a choir, a fine three-manual <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a> and a peal of bells hung for <a href="change%20ringing">change ringing</a>. <a href="Isaac%20Nathan">Isaac Nathan</a>, who "constituted himself musical laureate to the colony" and is considered "Australia's first composer", created a musical society at St James' in the 1840s.

The original organ, installed in the west gallery, was built by John Gray of London and was played for the first time on 7 October 1827. It received the following praise in the colonial newspaper <a href="The%20Australian%20%281824%20newspaper%29">"The Australian"</a>.

""St. James's new organ pealed its notes of praise for the first time at noon service on Sunday, to an overflowing congregation, more numerous perhaps than any congregation St. James's had ever before witnessed. The organ was not in perfect harmony, owing, in a great measure, to its yet incomplete state. Its intonations, however, in many instances, was full, rich, and harmonious, and those of the congregation were not a few who felt its tones swell on the ear like the welcome voice of a long parted friend!""

The organ was modernised and enlarged in the 1870s by William Davidson. After a number of moves around the galleries, it was placed in what had been intended as the south porch. At the time the church's interior was reconstructed at the turn of the 20th century, it was positioned on either side of the chancel platform at the eastern end where it remains. Organ specialists Hill, Norman & Beard (Aust) Pty Ltd gave the organ a major refurbishment and reconstruction between 1970 and 1971 at a cost of $35,000.

St James' has had a choir since early colonial times. James Pearson accepted the office of choir leader in 1827 and arranged some of the music that was sung. He also offered to teach "a few steady persons, of either sex," if they would volunteer to join the choir. In those early days, the choir was a "mixed one, of male and female voices, some of them professional", but by the end of the 19th century, the choristers were all males. Until Anthony Jennings was appointed Director of Music in 1995, the choirmaster was also the organist. Some choirmasters, such as James Furley, also composed original works for the choir. <a href="Arthur%20J.%20Mason">Arthur J. Mason</a> served 1898–1907 (and was City Organist 1901–1907), was succeeded by George Faunce Allman in the role.

The current choir is composed of about a dozen semi-professional adults. They sing on Sundays at the 11.00 am Choral Eucharist, Wednesdays at the 6:15 pm Choral Evensong, monthly at the 3.00 pm Choral Evensong held on the last Sunday of the month, as well as at a number of midweek <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints%20%28Church%20of%20England%29">feast days</a> held during the year. In January, during the summer holiday period, St James' presents three full orchestral Masses during which <a href="liturgical%20music">liturgical music</a> by composers such as <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a> and <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a> is used for its original purpose and incorporated into the service. On these occasions, the choir is joined by a small orchestra.

On occasion, the St James' choir has combined with other choirs, such as when it joined the Sydney Philharmonia Motet Choir or the choir of St Mary's Cathedral to present <a href="Vespro%20della%20Beata%20Vergine%201610">Monteverdi's Vespers</a> in 2013. It has recorded CDs and premiered new works by composers such as <a href="Ann%20Carr-Boyd">Ann Carr-Boyd</a> and Gordon Kerry, as well as new arrangements of traditional works. They have also performed with international touring groups such as with the Tallis Scholars' Summer School; broadcast on <a href="ABC%20Classic%20FM">ABC Radio</a>, both in their own right as well as with leading ensembles such as Australian <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> Brass.

Musical critique of the choir has appeared in the press from the beginning and continues to the present day. In 1827, one singer was criticised for her diction: "If her pronunciation were as pleasing as her notes, she would be entitled to unqualified praise" wrote a critic in 1827. In 1845, St James' was being described as the "exception" to the prevailing low standard of church music in both England and New South Wales. In 2013, singers from the combined choirs of St James' and St Mary's Cathedral were appraised as creating "a clear, well-defined edge that swirled gloriously".



The church's eight <a href="church%20bell">bells</a> are rung by the Guild of St James' Bellringers which is affiliated with <a href="The%20Australian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Association%20of%20Bellringers">The Australian and New Zealand Association of Bellringers</a>. The tenor bell, weighing 10 <a href="hundredweight">cwt</a>, was cast in 1795 by <a href="Rudhall%20of%20Gloucester">John Rudhall</a> and hung previously in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Bristol">St Paul's Church, Bristol</a>, England. Bells 1 – 7 were cast in 2002 by <a href="John%20Taylor%20Bellfounders">John Taylor Bellfounders</a> in <a href="Loughborough">Loughborough</a>, England. The bells were dedicated on 27 July 2003 and are named after people associated with St James' Church, as follows:

There is also the service bell of 4¼ <a href="Hundredweight">cwt</a>, known as the Mears bell, cast by Thomas Mears II of <a href="Whitechapel%20Bell%20Foundry">Whitechapel Bell Foundry</a> in 1820. It was repaired there in 2011.

As at 7 November 1997, St James' Church is the oldest church building in the <a href="City%20of%20Sydney">City of Sydney</a> and has been in continuous use from its consecration on 11 February 1824 to the present. It is a prime example of the architectural work of the Macquarie period, designed by Francis Greenway and built by convict labour. Subsequent changes to the building and its contents exemplify the development of ecclesiastical thought and practice in the Australian context. The church has always formed a significant element within the city of Sydney, as a spiritual and intellectual stimulus and as a centre of musical excellence and community activity. While this contribution has been realised in various ways over its long history, the reality of its work and its essential characteristics have been maintained. The church has long been regarded as a prime element of Sydney's built environment and its conservation is an example of a long history of heritage concern in the community.

The church contains a rare collection of 19th century marble memorials, its painted Children's Chapel is unique in Australia and it includes amongst its collections and contents rare items of movable heritage.

St James' Church is an integral part of the most extensive surviving group of Macquarie period buildings in Australia, Macquarie's construction of official Sydney in the eastern part of the city, which includes the former Hyde Park Barracks, Supreme Court, General Hospital and <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Sydney">Government House</a> stables. The church is the only building of this group that retains its original function.

St James' Church, Sydney was listed on the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20State%20Heritage%20Register">New South Wales State Heritage Register</a> on 3 September 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.

Lisa del Giocondo

Lisa del Giocondo (; née Gherardini ; June 15, 1479 – July 15, 1542) was an Italian noblewoman and member of the <a href="Gherardini%20family">Gherardini family</a> of <a href="Florence">Florence</a> and <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>. Her name was given to the "<a href="Mona%20Lisa">Mona Lisa</a>", which was her <a href="portrait%20painting">portrait</a> that was commissioned by her husband and painted by Italian <a href="polymath">polymath</a> <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a> circa 1503–06 during the <a href="Italian%20Renaissance">Renaissance</a>.

Little is known about Lisa's life. Born in Florence and married in her teens to a cloth and silk merchant who later became a local official, she was a mother to five children and led what is thought to have been a comfortable and ordinary middle-class life. Lisa outlived her husband, who was considerably her senior.

Centuries after Lisa's death, the "Mona Lisa" became the world's most famous painting and took on a life separate from Lisa, the woman. Speculation by scholars and hobbyists made the work of art a globally recognized icon and an object of commercialization. In 2005, Lisa was definitively identified as the model for the "Mona Lisa".

Lisa's <a href="Florence">Florentine</a> family was old and aristocratic but over time had lost their influence. They were well off but not wealthy, and lived on farm income in a city that was among the largest in Europe. While economically successful, there were great disparities in wealth among Florence's inhabitants.

Antonmaria di Noldo Gherardini, Lisa's father, lost two wives, Lisa di Giovanni Filippo de' Carducci, whom he married in 1465, and Caterina di Mariotto Rucellai, whom he married in 1473. Both died in childbirth. Lisa's mother was Lucrezia del Caccia, daughter of Piera Spinelli, and Gherardini's wife by his third marriage in 1476. Gherardini at one time owned or rented six farms in <a href="Chianti">Chianti</a> that produced wheat, wine and olive oil and where livestock was raised.

Lisa was born in Florence on June 15, 1479, on Via Maggio, although for many years it was thought she was born on Villa Vignamaggio just outside <a href="Greve%20in%20Chianti">Greve</a>, one of the family's rural properties. She is named for Lisa, a wife of her paternal grandfather. The eldest of seven children, Lisa had three sisters, one of whom was named Ginevra, and three brothers, Giovangualberto, Francesco, and Noldo.

The family lived in Florence, originally near <a href="Santa%20Trinita">Santa Trinita</a> and later in rented space near <a href="Santo%20Spirito%2C%20Florence">Santo Spirito</a>, most likely because they were not able to afford repairs when their first house was damaged. Lisa's family moved to what today is called Via dei Pepi, and then near <a href="Santa%20Croce%2C%20Florence">Santa Croce</a>, where they lived near Ser Piero da Vinci, Leonardo's father. They also owned a small country home in St. Donato in the village of Poggio about south of the city. Noldo, Gherardini's father and Lisa's grandfather, had bequeathed a farm in Chianti to the <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Nuova%20%28commune%29">Santa Maria Nuova</a> hospital. Gherardini secured a lease for another of the hospital's farms and, so that he could oversee the wheat harvest, the family spent summers there at the house named Ca' di Pesa.

On March 5, 1495, 15-year-old Lisa married Francesco di Bartolomeo di Zanobi del Giocondo, a modestly successful <a href="textile">cloth</a> and <a href="silk">silk</a> merchant, becoming his third wife. Lisa's dowry was 170 <a href="Italian%20coin%20florin">florins</a> and the San Silvestro farm near her family's country home, which lies between Castellina and San Donato in Poggio, near two farms later owned by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>. The modest dowry may be a sign that the Gherardini family was not wealthy at the time and lends reason to think she and her husband loved each other. Neither poor nor among the most well-to-do in Florence, the couple lived a middle-class life. Lisa's marriage may have increased her <a href="social%20status">social status</a> because her husband's family may have been richer than her own. Francesco is thought to have benefited because Gherardini is an "old name". They lived in shared accommodation until March 5, 1503, when Francesco was able to buy a house next door to his family's old home in the Via della Stufa. Leonardo is thought to have begun painting Lisa's portrait the same year.

Lisa and Francesco had five children: Piero, Camilla, Andrea, Giocondo, and Marietta, four of them between 1496 and 1507. Lisa lost a baby daughter in 1499. Lisa also raised Bartolomeo, the son of Francesco and his first wife Camilla di Mariotto Rucellai, who was about a year old when his mother died. The second wife of Lisa's father, Caterina di Mariotto Rucellai, and Francesco's first wife were sisters, members of the prominent <a href="Rucellai%20family">Rucellai family</a>.

Camilla and Marietta became Catholic nuns. Camilla took the name Suor Beatrice and entered the convent of San Domenico di Cafaggio, where she was entrusted to the care of Antonmaria's sister Suor Albiera and Lisa's sisters Suor Camilla (who was acquitted in a scandalous visitation by four men at the convent) and Suor Alessandra. Beatrice died at age 18 and was buried in the <a href="Basilica%20of%20Santa%20Maria%20Novella">Basilica di Santa Maria Novella</a>. Lisa developed a relationship with Sant'Orsola, a convent held in high regard in Florence, where she was able to place Marietta in 1521. Marietta took the name Suor Ludovica and became a respected member of the convent in a position of some responsibility.

Francesco became an official in Florence. He was elected to the "<a href="Signoria%20of%20Florence">Dodici Buonomini</a>" in 1499 and to the <a href="Signoria%20of%20Florence">Signoria</a> in 1512, where he was confirmed as a "Priori" in 1524. He may have had ties to <a href="Medici%20family">Medici family</a> political or business interests. In 1512 when the government of Florence feared the return of the Medici from exile, Francesco was imprisoned and fined 1,000 florins. He was released in September when the Medici returned.

In June 1537 in his will among many provisions, Francesco returned Lisa's dowry to her, gave her personal clothing and jewelry and provided for her future. Upon entrusting her care to their daughter Ludovica and, should she be incapable, his son Bartolomeo, Francesco wrote, "Given the affection and love of the testator towards Mona Lisa, his beloved wife; in consideration of the fact that Lisa has always acted with a noble spirit and as a faithful wife; wishing that she shall have all she needs…".

In one account, Francesco died in the plague of 1538. Lisa fell ill and was taken by her daughter Ludovica to the convent of Sant'Orsola, where she died on July 15, 1542, at the age of 63. In a scholarly account of their lives, Francesco was nearly 80 years old when he died, and Lisa may have lived until at least 1551, when she would have been 71 or 72.

Like other Florentines of their financial means, Francesco's family members were art lovers and patrons. His son Bartolomeo asked Antonio di Donnino Mazzieri to paint a fresco at the family's burial site in the <a href="Santissima%20Annunziata%2C%20Florence">Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze</a>. <a href="Andrea%20del%20Sarto">Andrea del Sarto</a> painted a <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Madonna</a> for another member of his family. Francesco gave commissions to Leonardo for a portrait of his wife and to <a href="Domenico%20Puligo">Domenico Puligo</a> for a painting of <a href="Francis%20of%20Assisi">Saint Francis of Assisi</a>. He is thought to have commissioned Lisa's portrait to celebrate both Andrea's birth and the purchase of the family's home.

The "Mona Lisa" fulfilled 15th- and early 16th century requirements for portraying a woman of virtue. Lisa is portrayed as a faithful wife through gesture—her right hand rests over her left. Leonardo also presented Lisa as fashionable and successful, perhaps more well-off than she was. Her dark garments and black veil were Spanish-influenced high fashion; they are not a depiction of mourning for her first daughter, as some scholars have proposed. The portrait is strikingly large; its size is equal to that of commissions acquired by wealthier art patrons of the time. This extravagance has been explained as a sign of Francesco and Lisa's social aspiration.

During the spring of 1503, Leonardo had no income source, which may in part explain his interest in a private portrait. But later that year, he most likely had to delay his work on "Mona Lisa" when he received payment for starting "<a href="The%20Battle%20of%20Anghiari%20%28painting%29">The Battle of Anghiari</a>", which was a more valuable commission and one he was contracted to complete by February 1505. In 1506 Leonardo considered the portrait unfinished. He was not paid for the work and did not deliver it to his client. The artist's paintings traveled with him throughout his life, and he may have completed the "Mona Lisa" many years later in France, in one estimation by 1516.

The painting's title dates to 1550. An acquaintance of at least some of Francesco's family, <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a>, wrote, "Leonardo undertook to paint, for Francesco del Giocondo, the portrait of Mona Lisa, his wife" (). The portrait's Italian name "La Gioconda" is the feminine form of her married name. In French it is known by the variant "La Joconde". Though derived from Lisa's married name there is the added significance that the name derives from the word for "happy" (in English, "jocund") or "the happy one".

Speculation assigned Lisa's name to at least four different paintings and her identity to at least ten different people. By the end of the 20th century, the painting was a global icon that had been used in more than 300 other paintings and in 2,000 advertisements, appearing at an average of one new advertisement each week. In 2005, an expert at the <a href="Ruprecht%20Karl%20University%20of%20Heidelberg">University Library of Heidelberg</a> discovered a margin note in the library's collection that established with certainty the traditional view that the sitter was Lisa. The note, written by <a href="Agostino%20Vespucci">Agostino Vespucci</a> in 1503, states that Leonardo was working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo. The "Mona Lisa" has been in custody of France since the 16th century, when it was acquired by <a href="Francis%20I%20of%20France">King Francis I</a>; after the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, however, it came into the possession of the people. Today about six million people visit the painting each year at the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, where it is part of a French national collection.

The episode's writer, <a href="David%20X.%20Cohen">David X. Cohen</a>, developed the idea after visiting the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, and decided to loosely parallel themes from the <a href="Scopes%20Trial">Scopes Monkey Trial</a>. The episode also makes allusions to actual hoaxes, such as the <a href="Cardiff%20Giant">Cardiff Giant</a>. The episode received generally positive reviews.

It has been discussed in the context of <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a>, <a href="ontology">ontology</a>, <a href="existentialism">existentialism</a>, and skepticism; it has also been used in Christian religious education classes to initiate discussion about angels, skepticism, science, and faith.

<a href="Homer%20Simpson">Homer</a> attempts to claim a motorboat from a "police raffle" that turns out to be a <a href="sting%20operation">sting operation</a>. While returning home, the family passes a new mall being built on an area where a large number of <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s were found. Lisa protests and management allows Springfield Elementary to conduct an archaeological dig. During the excavations, Lisa finds a human skeleton with wings. Springfield's residents are convinced it is an angel, and Homer cashes in by moving the skeleton into the family's garage, charging visitors to see it.

Lisa remains skeptical and asks <a href="Stephen%20Jay%20Gould">Stephen Jay Gould</a> to test a sample. When Dr. Gould appears at the Simpson house the next day to tell Lisa that the tests were inconclusive, Lisa goes on television to compare the belief in angels to the belief in <a href="unicorn">unicorn</a>s and <a href="leprechaun">leprechaun</a>s. In response, Springfield's religious zealots go on a rampage to destroy all scientific institutions. Appalled with the violence, Lisa goes into the garage to destroy the skeleton, but finds that it has disappeared. The mob soon converges on the Simpson household and Lisa is arrested and put on trial for destroying the skeleton.

Before the trial begins, the skeleton is seen outside the courtroom. Everyone rushes to it to see a foreboding message that "<a href="Apocalypse">The End</a>" will come at sundown. Sundown approaches and the citizens gather around the skeleton, but nothing occurs. As Lisa starts to reprimand them, the skeleton silences her and is hoisted over to the entrance of the new Heavenly Hills Mall. Lisa realizes the whole saga was a <a href="publicity%20stunt">publicity stunt</a> for the mall and criticizes management. The bargain-loving public goes shopping and Dr. Gould confesses that he actually never tested Lisa's sample. <a href="Marge%20Simpson">Marge</a> says that while it was rising, Lisa believed the angel was real. Lisa denies this, but admits she was frightened and thanks her mother for her support.

"Lisa the Skeptic" was written by <a href="David%20X.%20Cohen">David X. Cohen</a>, and directed by <a href="Neil%20Affleck">Neil Affleck</a>. Cohen was inspired to write the episode after a trip to <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>'s <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, where he decided to turn the visit into a "business trip", and think of a possible episode connection to the museum. He initially wanted Lisa to find a "<a href="transitional%20fossil">missing link</a>" skeleton, and do an episode reminiscent of the <a href="Scopes%20Trial">Scopes Monkey Trial</a>. Writer <a href="George%20Meyer">George Meyer</a> convinced him instead to have the focus be on an angel skeleton, while keeping an emphasis on the <a href="Relationship%20between%20religion%20and%20science">conflict between religion and science</a>. Both Cohen and Meyer acknowledged how silly the "angel skeleton" idea was owing to simple questions raised such as why an angel died and why bones were left behind, but they went forward with the idea anyway.

In an early draft of the script, the skeleton was made of pastry dough baked by the mall's window dresser. Cohen had initially written the Stephen Jay Gould role as a generic scientist or <a href="paleontology">paleontologist</a>, not knowing that they would eventually get Gould. He had taken Gould's Introduction to Paleontology class at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. The only phrase Gould had objected to in the script was a line that introduced him as the "world's most brilliant paleontologist". His original final line was "I didn't do the test. I had more important work to do", but it was cut because the writers felt it would be funnier to give him a short final line. In an earlier version of the episode, Marge would have ended up apologizing to Lisa for not supporting her, letting the ending be more of a nod to Lisa's correct assumptions all along.

Author Joley Wood compared "Lisa the Skeptic" to an <a href="alternate%20reality%20game">alternate reality game</a>, in analyzing the effects of watching the television program "<a href="Lost%20%28TV%20series%29">Lost</a>" on contemporary culture and our own perceptions of reality. Dan O'Brien cited the episode in a discussion of <a href="ontology">ontology</a>, skepticism, and religious faith, in his book "An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge". O'Brien leaves it up to the reader to decide whether or not Lisa was justified in her skepticism. In "", "Lisa the Skeptic" is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a <a href="nerd">nerd</a>. The book also cited the episode in noting that Lisa is not infallible, for when the Angel appeared to speak at the end of the episode she became as frightened as everyone else. Lisa's frustration with the marketing gimmick used by the mall developers is seen by <a href="Chris%20Turner%20%28author%29">Turner</a>'s "<a href="Planet%20Simpson">Planet Simpson: How a Cartoon Masterpiece Documented Defined a Generation</a>" as yet another example of her conflict with <a href="corporation">corporation</a>s throughout the series. Like O'Brien, Turner also analyzed the episode in the context of Lisa's questions about <a href="existentialism">existentialism</a>, self-absorption, and <a href="Consumption%20%28economics%29">consumption</a>. In "<a href="The%20Psychology%20of%20The%20Simpsons">The Psychology of the Simpsons: D'oh!</a>", the authors discuss Lisa's level of anger displayed in the episode, noting that in this particular case her anger gave her the wherewithal both to confront <a href="social%20injustice">social injustice</a>, and keep her mind clear for <a href="critical%20thinking">critical thinking</a>. Mark Demming of "<a href="Allmovie">Allmovie</a>" noted that Lisa symbolically stood for the side of reason, while her mother Marge symbolized belief and spirituality in the episode.

In their 2010 book "The Simpsons in the Classroom", Karma Waltonen and Denise Du Vernay note that the episode is one of the best for teachers and professors to use in religion or cultural studies courses, noting the irony that though Lisa is the only skeptic through most of the episode, she is the only one who is offended at the publicity stunt. Parvin's "The Gospel According to the Simpsons: Leader's Guide for Group Study" is a group study guide companion to Pinsky's "The Gospel According to the Simpsons". In the section pertaining to "Lisa the Skeptic", a skeptic is defined as: "a person who doubts, questions, or suspends judgment on ideas generally accepted by others". The study group is asked to debate the episode in the context of skepticism as related to other unexplained phenomena, including <a href="Unidentified%20flying%20object">UFOs</a>, the <a href="Loch%20Ness%20Monster">Loch Ness Monster</a>, the <a href="yeti">Abominable Snowman</a>, the <a href="Bermuda%20Triangle">Bermuda Triangle</a>, <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>, <a href="near-death%20experience">near-death experience</a>s, <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a>, <a href="mediumship">mediumship</a>, <a href="psychic">psychic</a>s, and <a href="fortune-telling">fortune-telling</a>. In Pinsky's book itself, he noted that Lisa faced the difficult task of confronting <a href="zealotry">religious hysteria</a> and <a href="faith">blind faith</a>, and also attempted to reconcile science within her own belief system. He also wrote that when Lisa asks Stephen Jay Gould to estimate the age of the skeleton, the issue is never raised of why angels or other spiritual entities would even leave skeletons behind in the first place.

The scene in the courtroom where Lisa is put on trial for stealing the skeleton is seen as a reference to the 1920s <a href="Scopes%20Trial">Scopes Monkey Trial</a> in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Tennessee">Dayton, Tennessee</a>, which dealt with issues of <a href="separation%20of%20church%20and%20state">separation of church and state</a> and the debate between <a href="creationism">creationism</a> and <a href="evolution">evolution</a>. The publicity stunt created by the mall developers in the episode has been compared to scientific <a href="hoax">hoax</a>es such as the <a href="Cardiff%20Giant">Cardiff Giant</a> and the <a href="Piltdown%20Man">Piltdown Man</a>. When Lisa asks if the townspeople are outraged at the end of the episode for being fooled by a publicity stunt, <a href="Chief%20Wiggum">Chief Wiggum</a> is about to answer her but is distracted when he catches sight of a <a href="Pottery%20Barn">Pottery Barn</a> in the new Heavenly Hills mall. A shot of the diggers in <a href="silhouette">silhouette</a> against the <a href="sunset">sunset</a> is modeled after "<a href="Raiders%20of%20the%20Lost%20Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>" (1981).

In its original broadcast, "Lisa the Skeptic" finished 37th in ratings for the week of November 17–23, 1997, with a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 9.5, equivalent to approximately 9.3 million viewing households. It was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>" and "<a href="King%20of%20the%20Hill">King of the Hill</a>".

Donald Liebenson wrote for the "<a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>" movie review that "<a href="Bart%20Sells%20His%20Soul">Bart Sells His Soul</a>" and "Lisa the Skeptic" were among the best episodes of "The Simpsons". He also noted, "Without being preachy (or particularly funny), this episode is pretty potent stuff", citing the theme of <a href="Apocalypticism">Apocalypticism</a> towards the end of the episode. In the July 26, 2007 issue of "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>", the scientific journal's editorial staff listed the episode among "The Top Ten science moments in "The Simpsons"". "Lisa the Skeptic" was utilized in a <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a> <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a> <a href="Sunday%20School">Sunday School</a> class in 2003, to stimulate a discussion among fourteen-year-olds about belief in angels, and the juxtaposition of science and faith. The episode was compared and contrasted with .

The episode is used by the <a href="Farmington%20Institute%20for%20Christian%20Studies">Farmington Trust</a> (UK) for Christian <a href="religious%20education">religious education</a>, to teach children about skepticism. The episode is used as a tool, to involve the students in a debate about religion and science, as well as to discuss Lisa's own skepticism, and her respect towards others. A group of "The Simpsons" enthusiasts at <a href="Calvin%20College">Calvin College</a> have also analyzed the religious and philosophical aspects of the episode, including the issue of faith versus science. The episode has been compared with <a href="Gabriel%20Garc%C3%ADa%20M%C3%A1rquez">Gabriel García Márquez</a>'s short story "<a href="A%20Very%20Old%20Man%20with%20Enormous%20Wings">A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings</a>" and utilized as a teaching tool in a <a href="Saugerties%2C%20New%20York">Saugerties, New York</a> <a href="Elementary%20school">grade school</a> class. In an exam on the subject, students were asked to use details from both "A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings" and "Lisa the Skeptic", in order to analyze the quotation "Appearances can be deceiving".

Crazy Taxi

Crazy Taxi is a series of <a href="high%20score">score attack</a> <a href="racing%20game">racing</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a>s that was <a href="video%20game%20developer">developed</a> by <a href="SEGA%20Hitmaker">Hitmaker</a> and <a href="video%20game%20publisher">published</a> by <a href="Sega">Sega</a>. The first game appeared in <a href="Video%20arcade">arcades</a> in <a href="1999%20in%20video%20gaming">1999</a> and was very successful, prompting Sega to <a href="Porting">port</a> the <a href="arcade%20game">arcade version</a> to their <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> console in <a href="2000%20in%20video%20gaming">2000</a>. It is the third <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games%23Dreamcast">best-selling Dreamcast game</a> in the United States, selling over a million copies. The game was later ported to the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube">Nintendo GameCube</a>, and <a href="Personal%20Computer">PC</a> with <a href="sequel">sequel</a>s also appearing on the <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a>, <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a>, and <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> systems.

Each game has the player assume the role of a <a href="taxicab">taxi</a> driver who must accumulate money by delivering passengers to their destinations in the fastest time possible, earning tips by performing "crazy stunts" before the time runs out. The franchise has been recognized for its innovative gameplay design which is easy to learn but difficult to master, its use of <a href="in-game%20advertising">in-game advertising</a>, and its soundtrack music provided by the bands <a href="The%20Offspring">The Offspring</a> and <a href="Bad%20Religion">Bad Religion</a>. The core gameplay mechanic has been <a href="patent">patent</a>ed by Sega, leading to at least one <a href="lawsuit">lawsuit</a> over similar gameplay in "", which has since been settled out of court.

"Crazy Taxi" and its sequels are <a href="score%20attack">score attack</a> games that all employ the same fundamental rules and mechanics. The player controls one of several taxi drivers in a fictional city, looking for fares and then taking them to their destination in the fastest time possible. The player must perform this while time still remains on an overall gameplay clock. Passengers looking for rides are indicated by an overhead marker that is colored to represent the distance to their intended destination. The color marker ranges from red indicating short trips, to yellow for intermediate distances, and to green indicating long ones. When a passenger is picked up, the player is awarded additional time on the countdown time. Furthermore, a second countdown timer is started, representing how quickly the passenger needs to be at their destination. While a passenger is in the taxi, a large green arrow is shown on the player's <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">HUD</a> that points in the general direction of the passenger's destination to help guide the player through the map.

The player can use special "crazy stunt" moves such as drifts, jumps, and near-misses, and consecutive combos of these, to earn extra money from the passenger during the trip. If the destination is reached in time, the player is paid based on distance driven with a possible time bonus based on how quickly the destination was reached. If the passenger's countdown drops to zero, they will exit the taxi and the player will be required to look for another fare. The game continues in this mode as long as time remains on the clock. Once the clock reaches zero, the game is over, and the player is ranked and rated based on the total earned.

Unlike other arcade games, the player cannot continue from where the previous game ended. The game cannot be played indefinitely; while there are hundreds of potential passengers to pick up and deliver, there are only a limited number of fares in the game. The various passengers scattered throughout the city will randomly appear and disappear throughout the game, but once one is picked up that passenger is unavailable for the rest of that game. The core gameplay in the series has been praised as being "deceptively complex"; as stated by the IGN staff for their review of the Dreamcast version of "Crazy Taxi":
Starting with "Crazy Taxi 2", the gameplay included the ability to pick up a party of passengers, each having a different destination. The number of passengers in the car multiplies the tip bonuses earned from stunt driving, while the total fare can only be earned once the last passenger is dropped off in time. Additionally, "Crazy Taxi 2" introduced a new stunt move called the "Crazy Hop" that allowed the player to make the taxi jump to clear some obstacles or reach higher drivable surfaces.

The console games have also featured a set of mini-games that require the player to meet a certain objective using one or more of the various "crazy stunts" within the game. Some of these test the player's handling of a taxi, while others are more exaggerated, such as taxi <a href="bowling">bowling</a> or <a href="pocket%20billiards">pool</a>. Some mini-games require the completion of others before they can be accessed.

Prior to each game session, the player can pick one of several drivers and their associated cars; each car/driver has slightly different performance relating to factors such as speed and turning, that impact the game.

The original arcade game was developed by Hitmaker as a variation from then-current arcade titles. "Crazy Taxi" producer Kenji Kanno noted that the time extension on gameplay was a breakaway of the current "100 yen for 3 minutes" that persisted at the time for arcade games, and rewarded players with longer playing times by performing well in the game. In addition to providing a game that could be played in short sessions, Kanno wanted a game to explore the "daily life and routine" of a taxi driver. In the development of the Dreamcast version of the original arcade game, the developers included a larger map in addition to the arcade one, as to create a feeling of "being lost" and allowing home console players to have fun "learning the town". Mini-games were developed for this version as to "let the player play longer if he improve<nowiki>[d]</nowiki> skill" by offering challenges that were both fun and educational. Over one hundred different ideas for mini-games were developed by the team but then pared down for the Crazy Box mini-game challenges for the game. The addition of the Crazy Hop in "Crazy Taxi 2" came about because the development team noted that "...in New York – where the basic landscape is quite flat – we had to create 3D space by letting the player drive on the buildings" and "We added the Crazy Hop to let the player hop around the roofs of buildings to make short cuts".

Hitmaker had tried to develop an on-line version of "Crazy Taxi", to be called "Crazy Taxi Next" exclusively for the Xbox, which, besides multiplayer game modes, would have included night and day cycles, each with a different set of passengers and destinations, while reusing and graphically updating the maps from "Crazy Taxi" and "Crazy Taxi 2". Ultimately, both multiplayer and day/night cycles were dropped and work on "Crazy Taxi Next" was transferred to "Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller", which included some of the nighttime driving concepts suggested by "Next".

Kenji Kanno has noted that the gameplay in the "Crazy Taxi" series has otherwise not "evolved" with each new game "because basically the whole point of the game is to have a lot of fun in a short period of time, and it's a very concentrated game. So instead of trying to evolve the series necessarily, it's more like taking that concept and putting it in different places – seeing how it works." Kanno is considering bringing the title to newer consoles, but would want to be able to include multiplayer features and having a time cycle within the game that would affect passengers' attitudes and the environment of the game.

Through the series, the cities used within the "Crazy Taxi" games have been influenced by real-world cities, including <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, and <a href="Las%20Vegas%2C%20Nevada">Las Vegas</a>. Certain versions of the "Crazy Taxi" game include in-game counterparts of real-world businesses, including <a href="Pizza%20Hut">Pizza Hut</a>, <a href="KFC">Kentucky Fried Chicken</a>, <a href="Fila%20%28company%29">FILA</a>, and <a href="Tower%20Records%20%28music%20retailer%29">Tower Records</a>; these were often destination targets for the passengers. Although this is one of the most prominent examples of <a href="product%20placement">product placement</a> in video gaming history, it is generally looked upon relatively favorably amongst gamers, perhaps because it gives a sense of realism to the fictional cities in the game. These establishments have been replaced with generic businesses in later games due to licensing difficulties.

The soundtrack of the "Crazy Taxi" series has typically been licensed <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a> and <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> music. The arcade and initial home console versions include selections from punk rock bands <a href="The%20Offspring">The Offspring</a> and <a href="Bad%20Religion">Bad Religion</a>, though these have been removed in both the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> and the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> remakes because of licensing issues. In the case of the Game Boy Advance "Catch a Ride", the game uses instrumental music instead of recorded songs.

Sega applied for and was awarded U.S. <a href="Patent">Patent</a> 6,200,138–"Game display method, moving direction indicating method, game apparatus and drive simulating apparatus" – in <a href="2001%20in%20video%20gaming">2001</a>. The mechanics in the "138 patent" describe an arcade cabinet similar to Sega's previous arcade game "<a href="Harley-Davidson%20%26amp%3B%20L.A.%20Riders">Harley-Davidson & L.A. Riders</a>" (<a href="1997%20in%20video%20gaming">1997</a>), but also describe the arrow navigation system and pedestrian avoidance aspects that were used in "Crazy Taxi".

In <a href="2001%20in%20video%20gaming">2001</a>, <a href="Electronic%20Arts">Electronic Arts</a> and <a href="Fox%20Interactive">Fox Interactive</a> released "", which has been labelled a <a href="rip-off">rip-off</a> of the "Crazy Taxi" formula by game reviewers. In this game, the player controlled one of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>" characters as they drive about <a href="Springfield%20%28The%20Simpsons%29">Springfield</a>, taking passengers to their destinations in the same manner as "Crazy Taxi". Sega sued Fox Entertainment, Electronic Arts, and developer Radical Games Ltd. over infringement of the 138 patent. The case, "Sega of America, Inc. v. Fox Interactive, et al.", was settled in private for an unknown amount. The 138 patent itself remains valid, and is considered to be one of the most important patents in video game development today.

The <a href="Crazy%20Taxi%20%28video%20game%29">arcade version of "Crazy Taxi"</a> was released in <a href="1999%20in%20video%20gaming">1999</a>, and featured only the San Francisco-inspired map (known as "Arcade" in the first console game, and later as "West Coast" in sequels). The "Standard Version" <a href="arcade%20cabinet">arcade cabinet</a> included a cockpit seat, steering wheel, a gear shift lever (for forward and reverse gear) and a brake and acceleration pedal; a more compact "Naomi Cabinet Version" also existed without the cockpit seat. The arcade game was one of the first to use the <a href="Sega%20NAOMI">Sega NAOMI</a> hardware processor, which is based on the Sega Dreamcast and was unveiled as part of Sega's exhibition at the 1999 Amusement Operators Union exposition in Japan.

The <a href="Crazy%20Taxi%20%28video%20game%29">console/home version of "Crazy Taxi"</a> was released for the Dreamcast on January 24, 2000. The Dreamcast and the cabinet arcade version share nearly identical processing hardware, and porting the game to the home console was only made difficult due to the limited internal memory size on the Dreamcast. Sega used "Crazy Taxi" to show the power of the Dreamcast's graphical processor, capable of maintaining 60 <a href="Frame%20rate">frame/s</a> throughout play. In addition to the arcade map, this version included the San Francisco-themed city (entitled "Original"), as well as additional mini-games ("Crazy Box") that can be used to hone the player's taxi handling skills. The new map, much larger than the arcade version, was designed to let the player experience the feeling of "being lost" and allow for exploration, something that could not be done on the arcade version, as well letting "the player enjoy all 3 dimensions."

Once Sega left the hardware market, other companies began to take up some of the franchises, including "Crazy Taxi". Acclaim brought the game to the PlayStation 2 on May 21, 2001 and GameCube on November 18, 2001, while <a href="Activision">Activision</a> and Strangelite ported the game to the PC in <a href="2002%20in%20video%20gaming">2002</a>; only the PlayStation 2 port was more successful than the Dreamcast version, and the rest didn't do as well. The Dreamcast version of "Crazy Taxi" was also playable through <a href="Video%20game%20console%20emulator">emulation</a> via <a href="Gametap">Gametap</a> on PC systems.

"<a href="Crazy%20Taxi%202">Crazy Taxi 2</a>" was released for the Dreamcast on May 28, 2001. The game introduced four <a href="cab%20driver">cab driver</a>s as well as two new maps inspired based on <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> ("Around Apple" and "Small Apple"), and added two gameplay features: the mechanics of collecting multiple passengers from a single spot, and the "Crazy Hop", allowing the taxi to clear traffic and certain obstacles with short jumps. Additionally, the "Crazy Box" mode in the first game was expanded into a "Crazy Pyramid" mode.

"" was released for the Xbox on July 23, 2002, and later released as a PC title in <a href="2004%20in%20video%20gaming">2004</a>. The game reuses the original arcade map modified to allow the use of the "Crazy Hop" introduced in "Crazy Taxi 2", one of the maps from "Crazy Taxi 2", and a new map based on Las Vegas ("Glitter Oasis"). The game adds an additional four characters to select from. The game allows the player to unlock other modes of transport besides the taxi, including a stroller, a pedal bike and a carriage. The mini-games in "Crazy Taxi 3" are featured in a "Crazy X" arrangement. An arcade version, entitled "Crazy Taxi: High Roller" was created in <a href="2003%20in%20video%20gaming">2003</a> using the same three maps as the home console version.

"" was ported to the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> by Graphics State and distributed by <a href="THQ">THQ</a>, and released on April 8, 2003. This version is fundamentally the same as the "Crazy Taxi" console versions, featuring the San Francisco and Los Angeles-themed maps but with a smaller selection of mini-games, adapted to play on the portable device using the Graphics State "Rush" engine. Specifically, while the city and streets are rendered using 3D graphics, the taxi, passengers, and other traffic are represented by <a href="sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprites</a> in order to work on the limited GBA hardware. Richard Whittall, creative director for Graphics State, noted that "Catch A Ride" was "about the most technically challenging game you could do on a handheld machine" at the time of its release.

"" was developed by Sniper Studios with support from members of the original Hitmaker "Crazy Taxi" design team in Japan and released for the PlayStation Portable on August 7, 2007. The game effectively is a port of both "Crazy Taxi" and "Crazy Taxi 2" to this system without any changes to the gameplay, but lacking the in-game advertising and the original soundtracks. While the game includes its own soundtrack, the player can use their own music stored on the PSP; as noted by Jeff Hasson of Sniper Studios, "for those hard core fans that must have The Offspring playing, they have that option with the Custom Music Player." The player can also record up to a minute of gameplay footage that can then be shared with friends. The game includes a multiplayer feature over the PSP's ad-hoc wireless system, allowing players to vie for fares within the same map, including the ability to steal passengers from another player. Multiplayer games such as <a href="time%20trial">time trial</a>s or "C-R-A-Z-Y" runs (a variation of the game "<a href="Horse%20%28game%29">Horse</a>") can also be played sharing a common PSP, with each player taking turns within the game.

"Crazy Taxi City Rush" was announced by Sega in March 2014 as a <a href="free-to-play">free-to-play</a> mobile title for <a href="iOS">iOS</a> and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> systems. "City Rush" is a mission-based runner similar in concept to "<a href="Temple%20Run">Temple Run</a>", where the player does not have direct control of the speed of the taxi but can use touch motions to swerve in traffic and make turns.

"Crazy Taxi Tycoon", previously known as "Crazy Taxi Gazillionaire" is another mobile spin-off game released in 2017 for iOS and Android. Unlike other games, this is a top-down <a href="Construction%20and%20management%20simulation">endless business management simulator</a> and <a href="Incremental%20game">idle clicker</a> where players run a taxi business and hire drivers to defeat a <a href="Ride-sharing">ridesharing</a> <a href="megacorporation">megacorporation</a> called Prestige Mega Corp.

The original Dreamcast version of "Crazy Taxi" was one of the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games">best-selling games</a> for the console. The game was the second largest selling Dreamcast game in the United States in <a href="2000%20in%20video%20gaming">2000</a>, selling nearly 750,000 units, and is the third best-selling Dreamcast game in the United States with over a million units sold. The game was praised for capturing the arcade flavor, and possibly exceeding it by making the controls and execution of the crazy stunts easier to perform. The game did suffer from "pop-up" due to limited <a href="draw%20distance">draw distance</a>s, and loss of frame rate when a large number of cars were on the screen. Critics noted the lack of depth given that it was a port of an arcade game, some difficulties with the destination arrow, and the poor "<a href="Wolfman%20Jack">Wolfman Jack</a>" impersonation of the in-game announcer.

"Crazy Taxi 2" was well received by reviewers with the new features helping to expand play from the original game, though some thought that more drastic changes could have been made in the sequel. Despite the addition of new maps, the lack of new gameplay elements caused "Crazy Taxi 3" to be panned by reviewers. IGN noted in its review for "Crazy Taxi 3" that "It's clear that the creative vibrancy that first imagined the Taxi series has waned considerably."

The ports of the original game to the PS2 and GameCube platforms are not considered as strong as the Dreamcast game. Both were noted to suffer from more "pop-up" than the Dreamcast version, as well as poorer controls, despite having the same gameplay features. Graphic problems plagued the "Crazy Taxi: Catch a Ride" port to the Game Boy Advance; as IGN stated, "it's painfully obvious that the hardware just was never meant to push so much." Both PC ports for "Crazy Taxi" and "Crazy Taxi 3" also suffered from graphics problems.

The PSP ports of "Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars" have had a somewhat better reception than other ports. Reviews have complimented the game on the multiplayer additions and the ability to add a custom soundtrack – which led IGN to comment that "Including this should be a no-brainer, but many PSP titles don't" – but have noted some graphical glitches, the long loading times, and the lack of the original soundtracks for the games. The reviews of the controls of the game have mixed, with some praising the scheme on the PSP, while others have stated that the controls feel stiff and inconsistent. GameSpot's review noted that the gameplay in "Crazy Taxi" does not hold up well compared to more recent racing games across various platforms.

A "Crazy Taxi" segment is featured in the "Sega Carnival" track in "<a href="Sonic%20Riders">Sonic Riders</a>", including a hidden shortcut allowing racers to receive a ride from taxi driver Axel; a Crazy Taxi extreme gear can be unlocked as well. There is also a minigame based on "Crazy Taxi" in the <a href="EyeToy">EyeToy</a> game, "<a href="Sega%20Superstars">Sega Superstars</a>", in which players move around and shout to call one of the taxi drivers. B.D. Joe, who has appeared in most games in the series, appears as a playable character in the cross-series racing game, "<a href="Sonic%20%26amp%3B%20Sega%20All-Stars%20Racing">Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing</a>". Sumo Digital's Steve "S0L" Lycett had to get approval from SEGA AM3 in order to use B.D. Joe in the game. He also appeared in the sequel, "<a href="Sonic%20%26amp%3B%20All-Stars%20Racing%20Transformed">Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed</a>".

Sega has attempted to branch the "Crazy Taxi" franchise beyond the realm of video games, with varied results.

In addition to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a "Crazy Taxi" themed <a href="redemption%20game">redemption game</a> which was released in <a href="2003%20in%20video%20gaming">2003</a>. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model in the center of the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the number of tickets to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.
There have been two attempts to create a movie based on the "Crazy Taxi" franchise. In <a href="2001%20in%20video%20gaming">2001</a>, Goodman-Rosen Productions acquired the rights for the movie, with <a href="Richard%20Donner">Richard Donner</a> lined up to direct the film. Donner had stated "I loved playing 'Crazy Taxi,' and I realized immediately that it had the potential to be a big summer event movie." The movie would have been tied with other merchandise items such as T-shirts and toys, according to Jane Thompson, director of licensing for Sega of America. However, this initial attempt stalled due to an "absence of plot elements" according to Movie Insider. After this option expired, Mindfire Entertainment acquired the rights to a "Crazy Taxi" movie based on the game franchise in <a href="2002%20in%20video%20gaming">2002</a>, with an expected release date in mid-<a href="2003%20in%20video%20gaming">2003</a>. However, since then, no further news on the film has been forthcoming.

In <a href="2003%20in%20video%20gaming">2003</a>, Sega entered a contract with DSI Toys to produce a <a href="remote%20controlled%20car">remote controlled car</a> in their "GearHead" line based on the Crazy Taxi franchise, but DSI filed for <a href="chapter%207%20bankruptcy">chapter 7 bankruptcy</a> later that year. 
Sega has formed the production company Stories International and teaming up with Evan Cholfin for film and TV projects based on theirs games with Crazy Taxi as an animated project.

Fijación Oral, Vol. 1

Fijación Oral, Vol. 1 (English: "Oral Fixation, Vol. 1") is the sixth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>n singer and songwriter <a href="Shakira">Shakira</a>. It was released on 3 June 2005 by <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic Records</a>. After attaining international success in 2001 with her first English record, "<a href="Laundry%20Service">Laundry Service</a>", Shakira wanted to release a fifth Spanish-language project as its followup. In the vein of her earlier work, "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" is a <a href="Latin%20pop">Latin pop</a> album. Shakira enlisted <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> as <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a>, also working with <a href="Gustavo%20Cerati">Gustavo Cerati</a>, <a href="Lester%20Mendez">Lester Mendez</a>, <a href="Luis%20Fernando%20Ochoa">Luis Fernando Ochoa</a> and Jose "Gocho" Torres.

At its release "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" received generally favorable reviews from <a href="Music%20journalism">music critics</a>, who complimented Shakira's evolution from her earlier work. The album debuted at number four on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, with first-week sales of 157,000 copies. It set the record for the highest debut for a full-length Spanish-language album in the country, which still stands. Internationally, the album topped the charts in Argentina, Germany, Mexico and Spain. "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" was the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Latin%20Rock%2C%20Urban%20or%20Alternative%20Album">Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album</a> at the <a href="2006%20Grammy%20Awards">2006 Grammy Awards</a>, and the <a href="Latin%20Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Album of the Year</a> and the <a href="Latin%20Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Album">Best Female Pop Vocal Album</a> at the <a href="Latin%20Grammy%20Awards">Latin Grammy Awards</a>. "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" became the highest selling Latin pop album of the decade in the United States and the second highest selling Latin album overall. As of May 2013, over four million copies of the album were sold worldwide and it is the eighth <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20Latin%20albums%20in%20the%20United%20States">best-selling Latin albums in the United States</a>.

Four singles were released to promote the album. Although its <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a> ("<a href="La%20Tortura">La Tortura</a>") was the only track to reach the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>, the follow-up singles "<a href="No%20%28Shakira%20song%29">No</a>", "<a href="D%C3%ADa%20de%20Enero">Día de Enero</a>" and "<a href="Las%20de%20la%20Intuici%C3%B3n">Las de la Intuición</a>" enjoyed moderate success on the <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">Hot Latin Songs</a>, <a href="Tropical%20Songs">Tropical Songs</a> and <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Airplay">Latin Pop Airplay</a> charts. In November 2005 Shakira supplemented the album with her second English-language record, "<a href="Oral%20Fixation%2C%20Vol.%202">Oral Fixation, Vol. 2</a>". The two were packaged together as a <a href="box%20set">box set</a> and released as "<a href="Oral%20Fixation%2C%20Vol.%201%20%26amp%3B%202">Oral Fixation, Vol. 1 & 2</a>" in January 2007. The projects were promoted with the <a href="Oral%20Fixation%20Tour">Oral Fixation Tour</a> in 2006 and 2007, which visited the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe. A performance in <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a> was filmed and released as a <a href="Oral%20Fixation%20Tour%20%28album%29">live album</a> in November 2007.

After achieving international success in 2001 with her first English album, "<a href="Laundry%20Service">Laundry Service</a>", Shakira released a Spanish-language record as its followup (her first since 1998's "<a href="D%C3%B3nde%20Est%C3%A1n%20los%20Ladrones%3F">Dónde Están los Ladrones?</a>"). Having co-written nearly sixty songs for the project, she decided to divide the release into two volumes and put herself "on the mission of selecting [her] favorite ones" to record. "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" contains all Spanish-language songs and "<a href="Oral%20Fixation%2C%20Vol.%202">Oral Fixation, Vol. 2</a>" features all English-language tracks. Shakira initially said that the second volume would have a "completely new repertory of songs", although the completed album included two English translations of songs from the first record. It was <a href="reissue">reissue</a>d in 2006 as an expanded version with an additional translated recording and her future international-hit single, "<a href="Hips%20Don%27t%20Lie">Hips Don't Lie</a>". When recording the albums, she worked with previous collaborators <a href="Lester%20Mendez">Lester Mendez</a> and Luis Fernando Ochoa and new partners <a href="Gustavo%20Cerati">Gustavo Cerati</a> and Jose "Gocho" Torres.

For the album, Shakira wrote all the lyrics, and the majority of the music. "To start seeing people's first reactions, and how people start relating to these songs and appreciating every single piece of work I have done over the past two years, is the best reward an artist can have after so much hard work," says Shakira. "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten in touch with my own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough. There is a long way to go."

The artwork for both "Oral Fixation" albums was inspired by <a href="Eve">Eve</a>, the first woman; Shakira said she wanted "to attribute to Eve one more reason to bite the forbidden fruit, and that would be her oral fixation" and that "[she always felt] that [she has] been a very oral person. [It is her] biggest source of pleasure". The first volume's cover sees Shakira holding a baby girl in her arms; the artwork for the second album shows a nude Shakira (covered by tree branches), with the infant sitting in the tree. She stated that both covers alluded to psychoanalyst <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a>'s theory that infants begin discovering the world through their mouths during the <a href="oral%20stage">oral stage</a> of <a href="psychosexual%20development">psychosexual development</a>.

For <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "For obvious reasons, [the artwork for the second album is] eye-catching, as was the cover of the Spanish-language companion album, "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1".

On 23 January 2007, "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" and "<a href="Oral%20Fixation%2C%20Vol.%202">Oral Fixation, Vol. 2</a>" were released as a three-disc box set, titled "<a href="Oral%20Fixation%2C%20Vol.%201%20%26amp%3B%202">Oral Fixation, Vol. 1 & 2</a>".

"La Tortura" was the only single from the album to chart on the US <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> (peaking at number twenty-three), and reached number one on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Hot%20Latin%20Songs">Hot Latin Songs</a>, <a href="Tropical%20Songs">Tropical Songs</a>, and <a href="Latin%20Pop%20Airplay">Latin Pop Airplay</a> charts. The song set a record for the most weeks at number one, and additionally became the best-performing Latin single of the year. The track was eventually certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">Gold</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) for selling over 500,000 copies and certified platinum for selling over 1 million mastertones .

The follow-up singles were also successful.

To promote "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" and "Oral Fixation, Vol. 2", Shakira began her <a href="Oral%20Fixation%20Tour">Oral Fixation Tour</a> on 14 June 2006 at the Feria De Muestras in <a href="Zaragoza">Zaragoza</a>, Spain. With assistance from the <a href="Creative%20Artists%20Agency">Creative Artists Agency</a>, she visited twenty-seven cities and performed forty-one shows across five continents. The tour was additionally sponsored by Spanish automobile manufacturer <a href="SEAT">SEAT</a>, with whom Shakira also collaborated to support her <a href="Pies%20Descalzos%20Foundation">Pies Descalzos Foundation</a>. The tour concluded on 9 July 2007 at the <a href="Turkcell%20Kuru%C3%A7e%C5%9Fme%20Arena">Turkcell Kuruçeşme Arena</a> in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>. It grossed over $42 million in North and Latin America, and $100 million worldwide. The <a href="set%20list">set list</a> consisted primarily of Spanish-language songs, and included singles from her earlier career.

In November 2007 <a href="Epic%20Records">Epic Records</a> released the "<a href="Oral%20Fixation%20Tour%20%28album%29">Oral Fixation Tour</a>" <a href="live%20album">live album</a> on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a>, which was filmed during a December 2006 show in <a href="Miami">Miami</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. William Ruhlmann of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> gave it a positive review, complimenting Shakira's vocals and dancing talent.

At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> (which assigns a <a href="standard%20score">normalized</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics) "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" received an <a href="weighted%20mean">average</a> score of 79 based on 13 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that "it's hard to wait for "Oral Fixation, Vol. 2" to arrive", given the strength of the "commercial savvy and smart writing" displayed in the first volume. Matt Cibula of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> shared a similar sentiment, adding that his excitement about "Oral Fixation, Vol. 2" is a "massive understatement". "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s Ernesto Lechner felt that Shakira "has found herself again" by "placing her operatic vocalizing at the service of Spanish poetry", adding that this was her strongest album to date.

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s Dave Simpson noted that "the songs are catchy, with melodies good enough to tempt non-Spanish speakers to sing along". Jon Pareles of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" described the album as "blissfully pan-American", elaborating that "for Shakira it's all pop, taut structures for volatile passion". Barry Walters of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" said that <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a> helped "restore Shakira's artistic integrity by keeping the industry at bay". <a href="Yahoo%21%20Music">Yahoo! Music</a>'s Tom Townsend praised Shakira for being "wide awake and, as they used to say in "<a href="Smash%20Hits">Smash Hits</a>", back, back, BACK!" "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>"s Mark Kemp gave it a mixed review, saying that the record was "stronger overall than "Laundry Service" but not as warm as "Dónde Están los Ladrones?""

In North America, even the largest latin retail chain in the United States refused to sell the album,"Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" debuted at number four on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, with first-week sales of 157,000 copies. It set a record for the highest debut of a full-length Spanish-language album in the country (which it still holds, beating <a href="Ricky%20Martin">Ricky Martin</a>'s 65,000-start with "Almas de Silencio" in 2003. ), and topped the "Billboard" <a href="Top%20Latin%20Albums">Top Latin Albums</a> chart. It sold 77,000 copies in the second week, which is still higher than any other Spanish-language album. According to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>, the album sold over 1,019,000 copies (as of October 2017) in the US, making it the eight bestselling Latin album in the country.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said that releasing the Spanish-language "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" after the success of the English-language "Laundry Service" was a "sharp move", complimenting the album for demonstrating that Shakira "can not only return to her roots, but expand upon them". He described "<a href="La%20Tortura">La Tortura</a>" as a "natural for American radio", and felt that the parent album generated anticipation for the upcoming "<a href="Oral%20Fixation%2C%20Vol.%202">Oral Fixation, Vol. 2</a>". Writing for "PopMatters", Matt Cibula praised the album for its musical departure from "Laundry Service", applauding the integration of subtle <a href="Sampling%20%28music%29">samples</a> across several songs as "great nods to the sounds of the 1980s". Dave Simpson of "The Guardian" compared Shakira to a "Latin American <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a>", describing her vocals as reminiscent of "<a href="Cher">Cher</a> and <a href="Hazel%20O%27Connor">Hazel O'Connor</a>, produced by <a href="Julio%20Iglesias">Julio Iglesias</a>".

Jon Pareles of "The New York Times" found Shakira's "smart or ambitious" image to be uncharacteristic of a <a href="sex%20symbol">sex symbol</a>. He praised the versatility of her multilingual lyrics and her experimentation in a number of genres, citing the "multiplicity" in "the arrangements, in the mixed emotions of the lyrics, [and] in Shakira's mercurial voice". Writing for "Paste", Mark Kemp complimented Shakira for dispelling notions she is "the Latin <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney</a>, the female <a href="Ricky%20Martin">Ricky Martin</a> [and] the pretty pop tart who sings in Spanish and sounds like <a href="Alanis%20Morissette">Alanis</a>"; he compared the mix of musical elements in "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1" to a <a href="Pop-Tarts">Pop-Tart</a> with a "rich and nutritious filling". Tom Townsend of Yahoo! Music called her "the greatest pop star we have", comparing her "consuming artistry" to that of Madonna and <a href="Prince%20%28entertainer%29">Prince</a>. He credited the album for inspiring a revival of pop music, saying that the release proved that the genre "wasn't dead, just sleeping".

Shakira's international success was solidified with "Fijación Oral, Vol. 1"s strong commercial performance.

Banded stilt

The banded stilt ("Cladorhynchus leucocephalus") is a <a href="Bird%20migration%23Short-distance%20and%20altitudinal%20migration">nomadic</a> <a href="wader">wader</a> of the stilt and avocet family, <a href="Recurvirostridae">Recurvirostridae</a>, native to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. It belongs to the <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> genus Cladorhynchus. It gets its name from the red-brown breast band found on breeding adults, though this is mottled or entirely absent in non-breeding adults and juveniles. Its remaining <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is <a href="Piebald">pied</a> and the eyes are dark brown. Nestling banded stilts have white down, unlike any other species of wader.

Breeding is triggered by the filling of inland salt lakes by rainfall, creating large shallow lakes rich in tiny shrimp on which the birds feed. Banded stilts migrate to these lakes in large numbers and assemble in large breeding colonies. The female lays three to four brown- or black-splotched whitish <a href="Bird%20egg">eggs</a> on a <a href="Bird%20nest%23Scrape">scrape</a>. If conditions are favourable, a second brood might be laid, though if the lakes dry up prematurely the breeding colonies may be abandoned.

The banded stilt is considered to be a <a href="species%20of%20least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN). Under the South Australian "<a href="National%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20Act%201972">National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972</a>", however, this bird is considered to be Vulnerable. This is due to the predation of it by <a href="silver%20gull">silver gull</a>s, which are considered to be a serious threat. <a href="Black%20falcon">Black falcon</a>s and <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a>s are also predators, taking the banded stilt and its young.

French ornithologist <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot</a> described the banded stilt in 1816, classifying it in the <a href="avocet">avocet</a> genus "Recurvirostra" and giving it the name "Recurvirostra leucocephala", "L'avocette a tete blanche" ("white-headed avocet"). He only recorded the species as being found in "terres australes", the meaning of which is unclear. Amateur ornithologist <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> interpreted this as Victoria, while <a href="Erwin%20Stresemann">Erwin Stresemann</a> concluded this was <a href="Rottnest%20Island">Rottnest Island</a> in Western Australia. The species name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "leukos" "white", and "kephale" "head". French naturalist <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> described it as "Recurvirostra orientalis" the same year. Belgian ornithologist <a href="Bernard%20du%20Bus%20de%20Gisignies">Bernard du Bus de Gisignies</a> described it as a new genus and species, "Leptorhynchus pectoralis", to the <a href="The%20Royal%20Academies%20for%20Science%20and%20the%20Arts%20of%20Belgium">Royal Academy of Belgium</a> in 1835.

English zoologist <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a> placed the banded stilt in its own genus "Cladorhynchus" in 1840, noting that the name "Leptorhynchus" had been previously used. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek "klados" "twig" and "rhynchos"
"bill". Likewise, German naturalist <a href="Johannes%20von%20Nepomuk%20Franz%20Xaver%20Gistel">Johannes Gistel</a> proposed the name "Timeta" to replace "Leptorhynchus" in 1848. <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> had described the banded stilt as "Himantopus palmatus" in 1837, but recorded it as "Cladorhynchus pectoralis" in his 1865 work "Handbook to the Birds of Australia". Gould also wrote that its distribution was unclear after it was first recorded at Rottnest Island though not elsewhere in Western Australia, and later in South Australia, until large numbers were seen by the British explorer <a href="Charles%20Sturt">Charles Sturt</a> at Lepson's Lake north of <a href="Cooper%20Creek">Cooper Creek</a> in what is now western Queensland. German naturalist <a href="Ludwig%20Reichenbach">Ludwig Reichenbach</a> placed it in a new genus, naming it "Xiphidiorhynchus pectoralis" in 1845. Australian ornithologist Fred Lawson gave it the name "Cladorhynchus australis" in 1904. <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> in his 1913 "List of the Birds of Australia" synonymised all subsequent genus and species names, using "Cladorhynchus australis". He listed his subspecies "rottnesti" from 1913, though this has not been recognised since. Both Joseph G. Strauch in a 1978 study and Philip C. Chu in a 1995 re-analysis of bone and muscle characters found that the banded stilt was <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> to the avocets, with the stilts of the genus "<a href="Himantopus">Himantopus</a>" an earlier offshoot. A 2004 study combining genetics and morphology reinforced its position as sister to the avocet lineage.

English naturalist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> gave the bird the name "oriental avocet" in 1824, after Cuvier's description. "Banded stilt" has been designated the official name by the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a> (IOC). Other common names include "Rottnest snipe" and "bishop snipe". The <a href="Ngarrindjeri">Ngarrindjeri</a> people of the Lower <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a> region in South Australia knew it as "nilkani".

The banded stilt is long and weighs , with a wingspan of . Adults in breeding <a href="plumage">plumage</a> are predominantly white with black wings and a broad well-demarcated u-shaped chestnut band across the breast. The central part of the base of the upper tail is tinted a pale grey-brown. The slender bill is black, relatively straight, and twice as long as the head. The irises are dark brown and the legs and feet are a dark red-pink. The wings are long and slim and have eleven primary flight feathers, with the tenth being the longest. In flight, the wings are mostly black when seen from above, but have a white trailing edge from the tips of the inner primaries. From underneath, the wings are predominantly white with dark tips. White feathers on the head and neck have pale grey bases, which are normally hidden. Non-breeding plumage is similar, but the chest band is less distinct and often diluted to an ashy brown or mottled with white. The legs are a paler- or orange-pink. There is no difference in plumage between the sexes, nor has any geographic variation been recorded.

Juvenile birds resemble adults but have a greyish forehead and <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a>, duller black wings, and lack the characteristic breast band. Adult plumage is attained in the second year. Their legs and feet are grey, becoming more blotched with pink until adulthood. Nestling banded stilts are covered in white down.

A distinctive bird, the banded stilt is hard to confuse with any other species; the <a href="white-headed%20stilt">white-headed stilt</a> lacks the breast band, and the <a href="red-necked%20avocet">red-necked avocet</a> has a chestnut head and neck, and a distinctly upcurved bill.

Adults make a barking call that has been written as "cow" or "chowk", sometimes with two syllables as "chowk-uk" or "chuk-uk". Birds also chatter softly and tunefully while nesting.

The banded stilt is generally found in southern Australia. In Western Australia, it is found predominantly in the southwestern corner, though can be as far north as the <a href="Saltern">saltworks</a> in <a href="Port%20Hedland%2C%20Western%20Australia">Port Hedland</a>. Breeding took place at <a href="Lake%20Ballard">Lake Ballard</a> in the <a href="Goldfields-Esperance">Goldfields-Esperance</a> after heavy rainfall from <a href="Cyclone%20Bobby">Cyclone Bobby</a> in 1995, and then again after flooding in 2014. In 1933 a large colony had been recorded at <a href="Lake%20Grace%20System">Lake Grace</a>, but had succumbed to attack presumably by foxes. The banded stilt has been recorded in southeastern South Australia, as well as the drainage of the <a href="Lake%20Eyre">Lake Eyre</a> system, and in Victoria west of <a href="Port%20Phillip">Port Phillip</a> and the <a href="Wimmera">Wimmera</a>. In July 2010 <a href="Lake%20Torrens">Lake Torrens</a> filled with water, resulting in the influx of around 150,000 banded stilts. The <a href="Natimuk-Douglas%20Wetlands">Natimuk-Douglas Wetlands</a> in western Victoria are an important nesting ground for the species, though lower numbers come here if there is flooding elsewhere in southeastern Australia. In New South Wales, it is most commonly found in the <a href="Riverina">Riverina</a> and western parts of the state, and has reached southern Queensland and the Northern Territory, where it has been found at the sewage ponds at <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a> and <a href="Erldunda">Erldunda</a>. It has been recorded as a vagrant to Tasmania, with significant numbers recorded in 1981.

The preferred habitats are large, shallow <a href="Salt%20lake">saline</a> or <a href="Hypersaline%20lake">hypersaline</a> lakes, either inland or near the coast, including ephemeral salt lakes, salt works, lagoons, salt- or claypans and intertidal flats. The species is occasionally found in brackish or fresh water, including farm dams and sewage ponds.

The banded stilt is highly <a href="Bird%20migration%23Short-distance%20and%20altitudinal%20migration">nomadic</a>, having adapted to the unpredictable climate of Australia's arid interior. Sudden rainfall results in the influx of water to and filling of dry inland salt lakes. The stilts respond by travelling to these areas and breeding, dispersing and returning to the coast once the lakes begin to dry up. How banded stilts on the coast become aware of inland rainfall is unknown. The distances travelled can be large; two birds have been tracked travelling from a drying Lake Eyre in South Australia to a newly filled lake system in Western Australia over away. One of these birds veered northwest over the Gibson Desert, travelling a minimum of in 55.9 hours.

The banded stilt is <a href="Social%20animal">gregarious</a>; birds are almost always encountered in groups, from small troops of tens of birds, to huge flocks numbering in the tens of thousands.

The breeding habits of the banded stilt were unknown until 1930, when a colony was discovered at Lake Grace. Even then they remained poorly known until 2012, when researcher Reece Pedler and colleagues attached tracking devices to 21 birds to gain an insight into the species' movements. They discovered that the birds travel large distances inland and gather at the recently filled bodies of water.

The majority of observed breeding events have occurred at inland salt lakes in South Australia and Western Australia immediately following freshwater inflows. An exception to this exists where some breeding was attempted at <a href="The%20Coorong">The Coorong</a> during a time in which salinity in the Lower Lakes was significantly elevated due to reduced environmental flows down the <a href="Murray%20River">Murray River</a>. Breeding events are initiated by the filling of shallow inland lakes after rainfall and resultant explosion in numbers of food animals such as "Parartemia" brine shrimp. This can happen at any time of year. Breeding sites are generally on low islands, of 1–1.5 m (3–5 ft) elevation, or spits on or alongside large lakes, on clay or gravel and generally with sparse or no vegetation. The nests themselves are <a href="Bird%20nest%23Scrape">scrapes</a> in the soil, up to across and deep, with or without some dead vegetation as lining. Birds on stony soils generally gather vegetation instead of digging scrapes.

Egg clutches number three to four (or rarely five) oval eggs, which vary from <a href="Fawn%20%28colour%29">fawn</a> to white marked with brown to black splotches. They can be long and wide. <a href="Egg%20incubation">Incubation</a> takes 19 to 21 days, with both sexes sharing duties, although the male takes over as sole incubator as the eggs hatch and immediately afterwards. This is thought to allow the females to lay and incubate a second brood if the water and food in the lake persists. Parent birds incubate for one to six days before swapping with the other parent. These intervals are much longer than other waders, and thought to be due to the remoteness of food—either the prey are blown to remote corners of the lakes by the wind or the lakes themselves have receded as they have dried. Parents almost always changeover incubating at night, generally within two hours of nightfall, presumably to avoid predators. On hot days with temperatures over , incubating birds may leave briefly to wet their brood patches to presumably cool the eggs or young. Birds on nests always face into the wind.

The nestlings are born covered in white down—unlike any other waders—and mobile with open eyes (<a href="precocial">precocial</a>) and leave the nest soon after hatching (<a href="nidifugous">nidifugous</a>). Adults lead the young birds to the water by the time they are two days old. Once in the water, they begin to feed on tiny crustaceans.

Banded stilt colonies suffer greatly from predation by <a href="silver%20gull">silver gull</a>s ("Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae"), while <a href="wedge-tailed%20eagle">wedge-tailed eagle</a>s ("Aquila audax"), <a href="white-bellied%20sea%20eagle">white-bellied sea eagle</a>s ("Haliaeetus leucogaster"), <a href="spot-bellied%20eagle-owl">spot-bellied eagle-owl</a>s ("Bubo nipalensis") and <a href="black%20falcon">black falcon</a>s ("Falco subniger") also take stilts and young. Premature drying of the lakes leads to parents abandoning their eggs or nestlings, resulting in the deaths of many thousands of young.

The banded stilt forages by walking or swimming in shallow water, pecking, probing or scything into the water or mud. The bulk of its diet is made up of tiny crustaceans, including <a href="Branchiopoda">branchiopods</a>, <a href="ostracod">ostracod</a>s (seed shrimp), <a href="anostraca">anostraca</a> (fairy shrimp) such as "<a href="Artemia%20salina">Artemia salina</a>" and members of the genus "<a href="Parartemia">Parartemia</a>", both genera of <a href="notostraca">notostraca</a> (tadpole shrimp), and <a href="isopoda">isopods</a> such as the genera "<a href="Deto">Deto</a>" and "<a href="Haloniscus">Haloniscus</a>". They also eat molluscs, including both <a href="Gastropoda">gastropods</a> such as the land snail "<a href="Salinator%20fragilis">Salinator fragilis</a>" and members of the genus "<a href="Coxiella%20%28gastropod%29">Coxiella</a>", and <a href="Bivalvia">bivalves</a> of the genus "<a href="Sphaericum">Sphaericum</a>", insects (such as <a href="Hemiptera">bugs</a>, <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s, <a href="fly">flies</a> and flying <a href="ant">ant</a>s, which they <a href="Gleaning%20%28birds%29">glean</a> from the water surface), and plants such as "<a href="Ruppia">Ruppia</a>". Small fish such as hardyheads ("<a href="Craterocephalus">Craterocephalus</a>" spp.) have also been reportedly eaten.

In 2016, the banded stilt was rated as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> of Endangered species. This was on the basis of its large range—greater than 20,000 km (7700 mi)—and fluctuating rather than declining population. However, it is listed as Vulnerable under the South Australian "<a href="National%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20Act%201972">National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972</a>". The listing was made after breeding attempts observed at <a href="Lake%20Eyre">Lake Eyre</a> revealed heavy predation from silver gulls. The <a href="Department%20of%20Environment%2C%20Water%20and%20Natural%20Resources%20%28South%20Australia%29">Department of Environment, Water and Natural Resources</a> has developed a strategy for managing silver gull predation at chosen banded stilt breeding sites by applying site-specific culling measures. Breeding events observed at ephemeral lakes in Western Australia have proven to be more successful without the need for intervention due to their remoteness.

Twenty-cent piece (United States coin)

The American twenty-cent piece is a coin struck from 1875 to 1878, but only for collectors in the final two years. Proposed by Nevada Senator <a href="John%20P.%20Jones">John P. Jones</a>, it proved a failure due to confusion with the <a href="quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter</a>, to which it was close in both size and value.

In 1874, the newly elected Jones began pressing for a twenty-cent piece, which he stated would alleviate the shortage of small change in the <a href="American%20frontier">Far West</a>. The bill passed Congress, and mint director <a href="Henry%20Linderman">Henry Linderman</a> ordered <a href="pattern%20coins">pattern coins</a> struck. Linderman eventually decided on an <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">obverse and reverse</a> similar to that of other silver coins.

Although the coins have a smooth edge, rather than <a href="reeding">reeded</a> as with other silver coins, the new piece was close to the size of, and immediately confused with, the quarter. Adding to the bewilderment, the obverse, or "heads", sides of both coins were almost identical. After the first year, in which over a million were minted, there was little demand, and the denomination was abolished in 1878. At least a third of the total mintage was later melted by the government. Numismatist Mark Benvenuto called the twenty-cent piece "a chapter of U.S. coinage history that closed almost before it began".

A twenty-cent piece had been proposed as early as 1791, and again in 1806, but had been rejected. The 1806 bill, introduced by Connecticut Senator <a href="Uriah%20Tracy">Uriah Tracy</a>, sought both a <a href="two-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%29">two-cent piece</a> and a "double dime". It was opposed by mint director <a href="Robert%20Patterson%20%28educator%29">Robert Patterson</a>, though his opposition was more to the two-cent piece, which Tracy proposed be struck in <a href="billon%20%28alloy%29">billon</a>, low-grade silver that would be difficult to recover when melting the coins. The bill passed the Senate twice, in 1806 and 1807, but did not pass the House of Representatives. No twenty-cent piece was issued prior to the 1870s, but Americans were familiar with the denomination as the two "reales" piece struck in Spain, known as a "pistareen" in the United States, passed for twenty cents (its Spanish colonial equivalent passed for a quarter).

Several factors converged to make possible a twenty-cent piece in the 1870s. The first was a shortage of small change in the far West, where base-metal coins did not circulate. Government payments in silver and gold had been suspended during the economic chaos caused by the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">civil war</a>—coins containing precious metal were hoarded except on the Pacific Coast, and did not pass at face value in trade. Although the base-metal <a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">nickel</a> was not widely accepted in the far West, the silver <a href="half%20dime">half dime</a> had been struck in increasing numbers at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> until the silver coin, which did not circulate in the East, was abolished by Congress in 1873. A shortage of small change resulted, especially as half dimes were used in the jewelry trade; customers complained they could not get full change for an item costing ten cents for which they paid with a <a href="quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarter</a>. Prices in the West were sometimes in <a href="bit%20%28money%29">bits</a> (12 cents, based on the old <a href="Spanish%20colonial%20real">Spanish colonial real</a>, although those pieces no longer circulated), adding to the change problem. Numismatist David Lange states that a shipment of nickels out West could have solved everything, but that they might not have been accepted due to the prejudice against money which did not contain precious metal.

A second factor was the anxiety of Congress to see more silver made into coin. This was due to pressure from mining and other interests. The <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a> ended the practice of allowing silver producers to have their bullion struck into <a href="Seated%20Liberty%20dollar">silver dollars</a> and returned to them. Although producers had not deposited much silver in the years before 1873 due to high market prices, former mint director <a href="Henry%20Linderman">Henry Linderman</a> foresaw that those prices would fall as mines became accessible due to the completion of the <a href="transcontinental%20railroad">transcontinental railroad</a> across the United States, and that the resultant coinage would inflate the currency. He quietly urged Congress to end the practice, which it did. Within a year, silver prices had dropped, and producers tried vainly to deposit bullion at the mints for conversion into legal tender. Mining interests sought other means of selling silver to the government.
The third was American interest in aligning its currency with the <a href="Latin%20Monetary%20Union">Latin Monetary Union</a> and to bring its weights for coinage into the <a href="metric%20system">metric system</a>. Several times in the 1860s and 1870s, the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> struck <a href="pattern%20coins">pattern coins</a> that were to be used if America joined, in some cases with the equivalent in foreign money struck as part of the design. The twenty-cent piece was to be equivalent to one <a href="French%20franc">French franc</a> in that system, and if in proportion to the smaller silver coins being struck, would weigh five grams, a fact which appealed to advocates of the metric system in Congress. Another purpose for a large issue of silver coins, regardless of denomination, was to retire the <a href="fractional%20currency%20%28United%20States%29">fractional currency</a>—low-value paper money or "shinplasters". Congress passed legislation in 1875 and 1876 for large quantities of silver coins for this purpose.

The father of the twenty-cent piece was Nevada Senator <a href="John%20P.%20Jones">John P. Jones</a>. Part-owner of the Crown Point Mine, he had been elected to the Senate in 1873; on February 10, 1874, he introduced a bill to authorize a twenty-cent piece, one of his first legislative endeavors. In advocating for the proposal, he cited the lack of small change in the West. It was endorsed by mint director Linderman; according to numismatic historian <a href="Walter%20Breen">Walter Breen</a>, "other legislators went along with it, largely as a favor to Sen. Jones". The bill was signed into law by President <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> on March 3, 1875. Like other denominations of silver coin, the twenty-cent piece was made <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> up to five dollars.

In anticipation of the approval of the legislation, Linderman had <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a>s prepared. In August 1874, Philadelphia Mint superintendent <a href="James%20Pollock">James Pollock</a> sent him patterns with an obverse showing a seated <a href="Liberty%20%28goddess%29">Liberty</a> by Philadelphia sculptor <a href="Joseph%20A.%20Bailly">Joseph A. Bailly</a> with a reverse by chief engraver <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William Barber</a>. Pollock did not approve Bailly's proposal, deeming it too similar to the Seated Liberty design which was then on all domestic silver coinage, and so the new coin would too closely resemble the quarter. On March 31, 1875, after the enactment of Jones's bill, Pollock sent Linderman additional patterns, all by Barber, and even more on April 12. Pollock deprecated a reverse design with a shield, but Linderman liked it and stated that it would have been adopted but for the law requiring an eagle to appear on silver pieces larger than the dime. Linderman selected an obverse design near-identical to the other silver coinage (until 1916, the silver coins were given similar appearances). That design, by the late chief engraver, <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a>, following a concept by <a href="Thomas%20Sully">Thomas Sully</a> and <a href="Titian%20Peale">Titian Peale</a>, was first used in 1836 and by 1840 was on all denominations of silver coins then being struck. The right-facing eagle is near-identical to the one which Barber had rendered for the trade dollar, which had debuted in 1873. Linderman had realized that the difference in size between the new coin and quarter was small, and thought a scaled-down version of the trade dollar suitable for the twenty-cent piece; he got his way on the reverse. The eagle carries the arrows of war in its right, or dominant claw, and the olive branch of peace in the left, in heraldry preferring war over peace.
Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> described the twenty-cent piece's obverse as "a pleasing synthesis of traditional elements". He was less complimentary about the eagle on the reverse, calling it awkward and a fatter version of the eagle on 18th-century American coinage. Vermeule admired the pattern designs made by Barber, especially the "Liberty by the Seashore" motif, which the historian believes owes a debt to the British copper coins of that period depicting <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a>—Barber was an Englishman by birth. He deemed it appropriate that the ship that is visible is powered by steam.

Numismatist Yancey Rayburn, in his 1970 article, wrote that the twenty-cent piece is bare of much of the lettering common on US coins: neither "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>" nor ""<a href="E%20Pluribus%20Unum">E Pluribus Unum</a>"" appears on it. At the time, ""E Pluribus Unum"" was required on American coins under the 1873 act; "In God We Trust" was included on different coins at the discretion of the secretary of the treasury. The mottos were excluded as the coin was considered too small to contain them. The act creating the twenty-cent piece did not dictate its design, but provided that the new coin was to be subject to the terms of the 1873 act. Rayburn also admired that the full denomination, "twenty cents", was spelled out; at that time the quarter and fifty-cent piece had the word "dollar" abbreviated as "dol."

The design for the twenty-cent piece was approved on April 12, 1875. It was, however, immediately revised to better define the olive leaves at the right end of the branch (over the "N" and the "T" in "cents"); on the original design, the leaves overlapped with each other. An amended approval was given on April 15. Production began at Philadelphia on May 19, on June 1 at the <a href="Carson%20City%20Mint">Carson City Mint</a> in Jones's home state of Nevada, and between June 1 and 17 at the San Francisco Mint. Only about 40,000 were struck at Philadelphia; the bulk was at the two Western mints with 133,290 minted at Carson City, and 1,155,000 at San Francisco. The price of silver had not dropped to the point where Congress was willing to authorize redemption of paper money with silver coin, and would not until April 1876, lowering the need to strike the pieces at Philadelphia. Additionally, the coin was principally intended for circulation in the West, another reason for a low mintage at Philadelphia. Mint officials had overestimated the need for the piece at San Francisco, where it saw some public acceptance and the large mintage satisfied the modest public demand until treasury officials ordered stocks melted in 1877.

Although the mint had given the twenty-cent piece a smooth rim, rather than the <a href="reeding">reeded</a> one on the quarter, the two pieces were immediately confused. At , the twenty-cent piece was only slightly smaller than the quarter at , and the two pieces had near-identical obverses. Mistakes in change-making were widespread, and the twenty-cent piece quickly became extremely unpopular. In April 1876, when Congress began to allow the redemption of fractional currency with coin, the twenty-cent piece was listed as among the denominations that could be exchanged for the low-denomination paper. Nevertheless, in July, legislation was introduced to abolish the twenty-cent piece. Although the bill did not pass immediately, according to numismatist Vernon Brown in his article on the piece, the pendency of the bill convinced the mint that there was no point in striking further twenty-cent pieces. The mintage for 1876 was low (coining took place at Philadelphia and Carson City), and only <a href="proof%20coinage">proof specimens</a> were coined in 1877 and 1878, at Philadelphia. Most of the 1876 Philadelphia mintage were sold as souvenirs at the <a href="Centennial%20Exposition">Centennial Exposition</a>.

In March 1877, Linderman authorized the melting of 12,359 twenty-cent pieces at Carson City. This included almost the entire mintage from 1876 (about 10,000) and created one of the great American numismatic rarities, the 1876-CC twenty-cent piece. Fewer than two dozen are known; one sold at auction for $564,000 in 2013, making it the record-holder for the denomination. In her 2003 article, numismatist Michele Orzano suggests that the few survivors were souvenirs obtained by visitors to the mint.

Congress abolished the twenty-cent piece on May 2, 1878. The previous day, Linderman had ordered the mints to melt down twenty-cent pieces on hand, for recoinage into other denominations. By then, forces for silver coinage had been victorious in passing the <a href="Bland%E2%80%93Allison%20Act">Bland–Allison Act</a>, requiring the government to purchase large quantities of silver bullion, and strike it into <a href="Morgan%20dollar">dollars</a>. The piece continued to circulate in the West for a few years, but by 1890 was rarely seen. Of the 1,351,540 twenty-cent pieces minted for circulation, over a third were melted by the government between 1895 and 1954, most heavily in 1933. The least expensive twenty-cent piece, according to the 2014 edition of <a href="R.%20S.%20Yeoman">R. S. Yeoman</a>'s "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" (the "Red Book"), is the 1875-S, listed at $110 in <a href="coin%20grading">good-4</a> condition. According to commentary in the "Red Book", the twenty-cent piece failed because "the public was confused over the coin's similarity to the quarter dollar, which was better established as a foundation of American commerce", that fractional currency satisfied the need for small change in the East, and because "the twenty-cent piece was essentially just a substitute for two dimes".

The <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> appears on the reverse beneath the eagle.

Giant mouse lemur

The giant mouse lemurs (members of the genus Mirza) are a genus of <a href="Strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine</a> primates. Two <a href="species">species</a> have been formally described; the <a href="northern%20giant%20mouse%20lemur">northern giant mouse lemur</a> ("Mirza zaza") and <a href="Coquerel%27s%20giant%20mouse%20lemur">Coquerel's giant mouse lemur</a> ("Mirza coquereli"). Like all other <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s, they are native to <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, where they are found in the <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests">western dry deciduous forests</a> and further to the north in the <a href="Sambirano%20River">Sambirano valley</a> and <a href="Sahamalaza%20Peninsula">Sahamalaza Peninsula</a>. First <a href="Species%20description">described</a> in 1867 as a single species, they were grouped with <a href="mouse%20lemur">mouse lemur</a>s and <a href="dwarf%20lemur">dwarf lemur</a>s. In 1870, British zoologist <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a> assigned them to their own genus, "Mirza". The classification was not widely accepted until the 1990s, which followed the revival of the genus by American paleoanthropologist <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a> in 1982. In 2005, the northern population was declared a new species, and in 2010, the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> announced that a southwestern population might also be a new species.

Giant mouse lemurs are about three times larger than mouse lemurs, weighing approximately , and have a long, bushy tail. They are most closely related to mouse lemurs within <a href="Cheirogaleidae">Cheirogaleidae</a>, a <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of small, <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> lemurs. Giant mouse lemurs sleep in nests during the day and forage alone at night for fruit, <a href="Natural%20gum">tree gum</a>, insects, and small <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they do not enter a state of <a href="torpor">torpor</a> during the dry season. The northern species is generally more social than the southern species, particularly when nesting, though males and females may form <a href="pair%20bond">pair bond</a>s. The northern species also has the largest <a href="testicle">testicle</a> size relative to its body size among all primates and is atypical among lemurs for breeding year-round instead of <a href="Seasonal%20breeder">seasonally</a>. <a href="Home%20range">Home range</a>s often overlap, with related females living closely together while males <a href="Biological%20dispersal">disperse</a>. Giant mouse lemurs are vocal, although they also <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">scent mark</a> using saliva, urine, and secretions from the <a href="Scent%20gland">anogenital scent gland</a>.

Predators of giant mouse lemurs include the <a href="Madagascar%20buzzard">Madagascar buzzard</a>, <a href="Madagascar%20owl">Madagascar owl</a>, <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a>, and the <a href="narrow-striped%20mongoose">narrow-striped mongoose</a>. Giant mouse lemurs reproduce once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day <a href="gestation">gestation</a>. Babies are initially left in the nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth and parked in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild is thought to be five to six years. Both species are listed as <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a> due to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under <a href="CITES">CITES Appendix I</a>, which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center</a> coordinated the <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a> of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62 individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.

The first species of giant mouse lemur was <a href="Species%20description">described</a> by the French naturalist <a href="Alfred%20Grandidier">Alfred Grandidier</a> in 1867 based on seven individuals he had collected near <a href="Morondava">Morondava</a> in southwestern Madagascar. Of these seven specimens, the <a href="Type%20%28biology%29%23Lectotype">lectotype</a> was selected in 1939 as MNHN 1867–603, an adult skull and skin. Naming the species after the French entomologist <a href="Charles%20Coquerel">Charles Coquerel</a>, Grandidier placed <a href="Coquerel%27s%20giant%20mouse%20lemur">Coquerel's giant mouse lemur</a> ("M. coquereli") with the <a href="dwarf%20lemur">dwarf lemur</a>s in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Cheirogaleus" (which he spelled "Cheirogalus") as "C. coquereli". He selected this generic assignment based on similarities with <a href="fork-marked%20lemur">fork-marked lemur</a>s ("Phaner"), which he considered to also be members of "Cheirogaleus". The following year, the German naturalist <a href="Hermann%20Schlegel">Hermann Schlegel</a> and Dutch naturalist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Pollen">François Pollen</a> independently described the same species and coincidentally gave it the same specific name, "coquereli", basing theirs on an individual from around the <a href="Bay%20of%20Ampasindava">Bay of Ampasindava</a> in northern Madagascar. Unlike Grandidier, they placed their specimen in the genus "Microcebus" (<a href="mouse%20lemur">mouse lemur</a>s); however, these authors also listed all "Cheirogaleus" under "Microcebus" and based the classification of their species on similarities with the <a href="greater%20dwarf%20lemur">greater dwarf lemur</a> ("M. typicus", now "C. major").

In 1870, the British zoologist <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a> placed Coquerel's giant mouse lemur into its own genus, "Mirza". This classification was widely ignored and later rejected in the early 1930s by zoologists <a href="Ernst%20Schwarz%20%28zoologist%29">Ernst Schwarz</a>, <a href="Guillaume%20Grandidier">Guillaume Grandidier</a>, and others, who felt that its longer fur and bushy tail did not merit a separate genus and instead placed it in "Microcebus". British anatomist <a href="William%20Charles%20Osman%20Hill">William Charles Osman Hill</a> also favored this view in 1953, noting that despite its larger size (comparable to "Cheirogaleus"), its first upper <a href="premolar">premolar</a> was proportionally small as in "Microcebus". In 1977, French zoologist <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Petter">Jean-Jacques Petter</a> also favored the "Microcebus" classification, despite the threefold size difference between Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the other members of the genus.

The genus "Mirza" was resurrected in 1982 by American paleoanthropologist <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a> to represent an intermediate branch between "Microcebus" and "Cheirogaleus", citing the Coquerel's giant mouse lemur's significantly larger size than the largest "Microcebus" and <a href="Animal%20locomotion">locomotor behavior</a> more closely aligned with "Cheirogaleus". Adoption of "Mirza" was slow, though in 1994 it was used in the first edition of "<a href="Lemurs%20of%20Madagascar%20%28book%29">Lemurs of Madagascar</a>" by <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a>. In 1993, primatologist <a href="Colin%20Groves">Colin Groves</a> initially favored the "Microcebus" classification in the second edition of "<a href="Mammal%20Species%20of%20the%20World">Mammal Species of the World</a>", but began supporting the resurrection of "Mirza" in 2001. In 1991, prior to adopting "Mirza", Groves was the first to use the <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "giant mouse lemur". Prior to that, they were popularly referred to as "Coquerel's mouse lemur".

In 2005, Peter M. Kappeler and Christian Roos described a new species of giant mouse lemur, the <a href="northern%20giant%20mouse%20lemur">northern giant mouse lemur</a> ("M. zaza"). Their studies compared the <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, <a href="behavioral%20ecology">behavioral ecology</a>, and <a href="Cytochrome%20b">mitochondrial cytochrome b</a> <a href="Sequencing">sequences</a> of specimens from both <a href="Kirindy%20Forest">Kirindy Forest</a> in central-western Madagascar and around <a href="Ambato%2C%20Madagascar">Ambato</a> in northwestern Madagascar, part of the <a href="Sambirano%20River">Sambirano valley</a>. Their study demonstrated distinct differences in size, <a href="sociality">sociality</a>, and <a href="Reproduction">breeding</a>, as well as sufficient <a href="genetic%20distance">genetic distance</a> to merit specific distinction between the northern and central-western populations. Because Grandidier's description was based on a southern specimen, they named the northern population as a new species.

The <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> (WWF) announced in 2010 that a <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> study from 2009 in the <a href="gallery%20forest">gallery forest</a> of <a href="Ranobe%2C%20Madagascar">Ranobe</a> near <a href="Toliara">Toliara</a> in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species. They noted a significant difference in coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed. However, further testing was required to confirm the discovery.

The etymology of "Mirza" puzzled researchers for many years. Gray often created mysterious and unexplained <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic names</a>—a trend not only continued with his description of "Mirza" in 1870, but also with the genera "Phaner" (fork-marked lemurs) and "Azema" (for "<a href="Brown%20mouse%20lemur">M. rufus</a>", now a synonym for "Microcebus"), both of which were described in the same publication. In 1904, American zoologist <a href="Theodore%20Sherman%20Palmer">Theodore Sherman Palmer</a> attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain these three genera. For "Mirza", Palmer only noted that it derived from the <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> title <a href="Mirza">mîrzâ</a> ("prince"), a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves in 2012. However, because the reference to Persian princes might have come from "<a href="One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">Arabian Nights</a>", a popular piece of literature at the time, Dunkel "et al." also searched the general literature published around 1870. The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy "<a href="The%20Palace%20of%20Truth">The Palace of Truth</a>" by <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>, which premiered in London on 19 November 1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing all three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.

Based on studies using morphology, <a href="immunology">immunology</a>, <a href="Repeated%20sequence%20%28DNA%29">repetitive DNA</a>, <a href="Retrotransposon%23SINEs">SINE</a> analysis, <a href="Locus%20%28genetics%29">multilocus</a> phylogenetic tests, and <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial genes</a> (mtDNA), giant mouse lemurs are most closely related to mouse lemurs within the family Cheirogaleidae, and together they form a <a href="Cladistics">clade</a> with the <a href="hairy-eared%20dwarf%20lemur">hairy-eared dwarf lemur</a> ("Allocebus"). Both dwarf lemurs and fork-marked lemurs are more distantly related, with fork-marked lemurs being either a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> of all cheirogaleids, or more closely related to <a href="sportive%20lemur">sportive lemur</a>s ("Lepilemur").

Although "Mirza", "Microcebus", and "Allocebus" form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, the three lineages are thought to have <a href="Genetic%20divergence">diverged</a> during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade are difficult to determine and may change with further research. All three are thought to have diverged at least 20 <a href="myr">mya</a> (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between "Mirza" and "Microcebus" at 24.2 mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1 mya.

Though giant mouse lemurs are relatively small cheirogaleids, they are more than three times larger than the smallest members of the family, the mouse lemurs. Their body weight averages . At around , their bushy and long tail is longer than their head-body length, which averages . Their forelimbs are shorter than the hind limbs (with an <a href="intermembral%20index">intermembral index</a> of 70), a trait shared with mouse lemurs. The skull is similar to that of dwarf and mouse lemurs, and the <a href="Tympanic%20part%20of%20the%20temporal%20bone">auditory bullae</a> are small.

Like other cheirogaleids, the <a href="Dentition%23Dental%20formula">dental formula</a> for giant mouse lemurs is ; on each side of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, one <a href="Canine%20tooth">canine</a>, three premolars, and three <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a>s—a total of 36 teeth. Their upper teeth converge towards the front of the mouth, but are straighter than those in mouse lemurs. The first upper premolar (P) is relatively small, but nearly as tall as the next premolar (P). Unlike mouse lemurs and more like dwarf lemurs, giant mouse lemurs have a prominent <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23anterior%20and%20posterior">anterior</a> lower premolar (P). Also more aligned with dwarf lemurs, the first two upper molars (M) have a more anterior <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">hypocone</a> that sits opposite the <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">metacone</a>, compared to the mouse lemurs' more <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23anterior%20and%20posterior">posterior</a> hypocone, which is presumably a <a href="Symplesiomorphy">symplesiomorphic (ancestral) trait</a>. Also on M and M, the cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side) comprises two small <a href="Cusp%20%28anatomy%29">cuspules</a>. In all other dental characteristics, giant mouse lemurs are noticeably similar to both dwarf and mouse lemurs.

Giant mouse lemurs have two pairs of <a href="Mammary%20gland">mammae</a>, one on the chest (pectoral) and one on the <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a> (abdominal). Their fur is typically grayish-brown on the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">dorsal</a> (back) side and more gray in color on the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">ventral</a> (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. <a href="Whiskers">Vibrissae</a> are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (buccal), under the lower jaw (genal), near the <a href="Ramus%20of%20the%20mandible">top of the jaw</a> (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.

Ear size is one differentiating factor between the northern giant mouse lemur and Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, with the former having shorter, rounded ears, while the latter has relatively large ears. The northern giant mouse lemur is generally larger and also has a shorter tail and shorter canine teeth. This species also has the largest <a href="testicle">testicle</a>s relative to body size of any living primate, with an average volume of , corresponding to 5.5% of its body weight. If human males had comparably sized testes, they would weigh and be the size of a <a href="grapefruit">grapefruit</a>.

Coquerel's giant mouse lemur has a spotty distribution across <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests">western Madagascar's dry deciduous forests</a> due to the <a href="forest%20fragmentation">forest fragmentation</a> throughout the region. The dry forests in this lowland region vary in elevation from sea level to . The range of this species is divided into northern and southern subpopulations, which are separated by several hundred kilometers. Both historical and current populations between these ranges are uncertain. The southern region is bound by the <a href="Onilahy%20River">Onilahy River</a> in the south and the <a href="Tsiribihina%20River">Tsiribihina River</a> in the north, while the northern population is found in the northwestern corner of the island at <a href="Tsingy%20de%20Namoroka%20Strict%20Nature%20Reserve">Tsingy de Namoroka National Park</a>. They are most commonly found in forests near rivers and ponds.

The northern giant mouse lemur is found in isolated forest patches along the northwest coast in both the more humid Sambirano valley and <a href="Sahamalaza%20Peninsula">Sahamalaza Peninsula</a>, as well as the <a href="Ampasindava%20Peninsula">Ampasindava Peninsula</a>. Its range extends from the <a href="Maeverano%20River">Maeverano River</a> in the south to the <a href="Mahavavy%20River">Mahavavy River</a> in the north. The new population reported by the WWF in 2010 is found in the gallery forests of Ranobe near Toliara in southwestern Madagascar.

Giant mouse lemurs were first studied in the wild by Petter and colleagues in 1971. His observations were secondary to his primary research interest, the fork-marked lemurs north of Morondava. Both northern and southern populations were studied intermittently between 1978 and 1981, and in 1993, long-term social and genetic studies began in Kirindy Forest. Behavioral studies of captive individuals have also been performed at the <a href="Duke%20Lemur%20Center">Duke Lemur Center</a> (DLC) in <a href="Durham%2C%20North%20Carolina">Durham, North Carolina</a> during the 1990s.

Before the recognition of more than one species, differences in <a href="population%20density">population density</a> were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near <a href="Ambanja">Ambanja</a>. Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern giant mouse lemur. The former range between 30 and 210 individuals per square kilometer (250 acres), with lower densities in open areas of the forest, while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1,086 individuals per km. However, in the case of the northern giant mouse lemur, populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced</a> cashew and <a href="mango">mango</a> help sustain these higher populations.

According to studies of Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, <a href="home%20range">home range</a>s of both sexes vary from with frequent overlap, particularly on the periphery of their range. Individuals most heavily use and aggressively defend a smaller core area within their range. Individuals can have up to eight neighbors. Home ranges of males tend to overlap with those of both females and other males, and typically expand to four times the size during the mating season. Female home ranges show no variability in size, and can remain stable for years. At Kirindy Forest, genetic studies showed that the home ranges of related females tend to clump closely together, while unrelated males may overlap their range, suggesting male <a href="Biological%20dispersal">dispersal</a> and migration is responsible for <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a>.

Both species are strictly <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a>, leaving their nests around sunset to stretch and <a href="Personal%20grooming">self-groom</a> for a few minutes. Both species typically forage between above the forest floor, though Coquerel's giant mouse lemur has been observed on the ground. They primarily move by <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedal</a> running and occasionally leaping between branches, and use the same feeding postures as mouse lemurs, such as clinging to tree trunks. When moving through the trees, giant mouse lemurs scurry rapidly like mouse lemurs, unlike dwarf lemurs, which use more deliberate movement. Slow movements are usually seen in lower, denser foliage when hunting for insects, while more rapid motion and leaping is typically seen at moderate heights of . Surveillance of the home range involves slower movements in lighter foliage near the tops of large trees, while movements along the border of a home range is more rapid and occurs at a lower height. Similar movement patterns have been observed in captivity as well.

Giant mouse lemurs begin foraging moments before the sun disappears, occasionally participate in social activities during the last half of the night, and return to one of their nests prior to sunrise. Cold temperatures cause them to leave the nest later and return early, sometime during the second half of the night. During the first half of the night, giant mouse lemurs are more likely to rest for an hour or more, usually at the expense of social activities, but not feeding time. Rest periods are longer when temperatures are low. Unlike many other cheirogaleids, they remain active all year and do not enter daily or seasonal <a href="torpor">torpor</a>.

Both species sleep in round nests up to across made of interlaced <a href="liana">liana</a>s, branches, leaves, and twigs gathered from nearby trees and woven using the mouth and hands. Nests are typically between above the ground in the fork of large tree branches or surrounded by dense lianas. Trees covered in thick lianas as well as trees with year-round leaf cover (e.g. <a href="Euphorbiaceae">Euphorbiaceae</a>) are favored for nest construction, though large bare trees may be used by building the nest higher. In addition to nesting in dense lianas, individual giant mouse lemurs will rotate between 10 and 12 nests every few days to avoid predators. Only females have been observed building nests in the wild, though males, females, and young have been observed building nests in captivity. Multiple nests are sometimes built in the same tree or in nearby trees and are shared by neighboring giant mouse lemurs, fork-marked lemurs, and the introduced <a href="black%20rat">black rat</a> ("Rattus rattus"). Unlike most other nocturnal lemurs, giant mouse lemurs do not appear to sleep in tree holes.

Both species usually are solitary foragers, although the northern giant mouse lemur tends to be the most social, possibly due to its higher population density. Up to eight (typically four) adult males, adult females, and juveniles may be found in a northern giant mouse lemur nest, whereas Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs do not nest communally, except when females share their nest with their offspring. Males do groom and call to females when they come into contact, and according to <a href="Telemetry">radio-tracking</a> and direct observations at <a href="Analabe">Analabe</a> near Kirindy, they form <a href="pair%20bond">pair bond</a>s, sometimes briefly traveling together during the dry season. However, most interactions between adults are infrequent and typically occur later at night and particularly during the dry season in overlapping core areas, often involving chases and other <a href="agonistic%20behavior">agonistic behavior</a>, and only rarely <a href="social%20grooming">social grooming</a>. During the mating season, males act aggressively towards one another, pulling out fur around the head and shoulders and biting the head.

Giant mouse lemurs use at least eight vocalizations, the most common of which are contact calls, which sound like "hum" or a "hein" and are used when moving and when meeting familiar individuals. A "mother-infant meeting call" used at dawn before returning to the nest consists of short, modulated whistles. Both males and females have distinct single note calls used in territorial behavior; the female call sounds like "pfiou" and the male call is a short, loud whistle. Both sexes use an alarm call, which sounds like a "croak", and an agonistic call, which consists of repeated "tisk-tisk-tisk" sounds. Females exhibit a "waking call sequence", sometimes referred to as "loud calls", which start when foraging commences and then switch to quieter "hon" calls possibly to indicate their position to their neighbors. A long "sexual call sequence" consisting of soft whistle and several modulated, hoarse "brroak" calls is used by both sexes during <a href="Estrous%20cycle">estrus</a>. Studies of captive individuals have found other vocalizations, but their purpose has not been determined. The northern giant mouse lemur appears to be the most vocal of the two species. Although vocalizations are the primary form of social communication, they also <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">scent mark</a> using saliva, urine, and secretions from the <a href="Scent%20gland">anogenital scent gland</a> on small branches and other objects.

Reproduction starts in November for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur at Kirindy Forest; the estrous cycle runs approximately 22 days, while estrus lasts only a day or less. The mating season in this southern population is limited to a few weeks, whereas the northern giant mouse lemur is thought to breed throughout the year, a trend seen in only two other species of lemur: the <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a> ("Daubentonia madagascariensis") and the <a href="red-bellied%20lemur">red-bellied lemur</a> ("Eulemur rubriventer"). The northern giant mouse lemur had been observed breeding year-round in captivity if their litter did not survive or was removed, but at the time this population was thought to be Coquerel's giant mouse lemur.

One to three offspring (typically two) are born after 90 days of <a href="gestation">gestation</a>, weighing approximately . Because they are poorly developed, they initially remain in their mother's nest for up to three weeks, being transported by mouth between nests. Once they have grown sufficiently, typically after three weeks, the mother will park her offspring in vegetation while she forages nearby. After a month, the young begin to participate in social play and grooming with their mother, and between the first and second month, young males begin to exhibit early sexual behaviors (including mounting, neck biting, and pelvic thrusting). By the third month, the young forage independently, though they maintain vocal contact with their mother and use a small part of her range.

Females start reproducing after ten months, while males develop functional testicles by their second mating season. Testicle size in the northern giant mouse lemur does not appear to fluctuate by season, and is so large relative to the animal's body mass that it is the highest among all <a href="primate">primate</a>s. This emphasis on sperm production in males, as well as the use of <a href="Mating%20plug">copulatory plugs</a>, suggests a mating system best described as <a href="Polygynandry">polygynandrous</a> where males use <a href="scramble%20competition">scramble competition</a> (roaming widely to find many females). In contrast, male Coquerel's giant mouse lemurs appear to fight for access to females (contest competition) during their breeding season. Males disperse from their natal range, and the age at which they leave varies from two years to several. Females reproduce every year, although postpartum estrus has been observed in captivity. In the wild, the lifespan of giant mouse lemurs is thought to rarely exceed five or six years, though in captivity they can live up to 15 years.

Both species are <a href="Omnivore">omnivorous</a>, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, <a href="Natural%20gum">tree gums</a>, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is thought to opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an individual was found with a half-eaten <a href="gray%20mouse%20lemur">gray mouse lemur</a> ("M. murinus") in a trap. During June and July, at the peak of the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the <a href="larva">larva</a>e of <a href="hemiptera">hemiptera</a>n and <a href="cochineal">cochineal</a> insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on <a href="cashew">cashew</a> fruits during the dry season.

Giant mouse lemurs are often <a href="Sympatry">sympatric</a> with mouse lemurs, such as "M. murinus", though they are typically found higher in the canopy and favor thicker, taller gallery forests. At the <a href="Marosalaza">Marosalaza</a> forest (north of Morondava), Coquerel's giant mouse lemur is sympatric with four other nocturnal lemurs (mouse lemurs, sportive lemurs, dwarf lemurs, and fork-marked lemurs), but manages <a href="niche%20differentiation">niche differentiation</a> by feeding at different times and specializing on insect secretions during the dry season.

<a href="Diurnality">Diurnal</a> <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> such as the <a href="Madagascar%20buzzard">Madagascar buzzard</a> ("Buteo brachypterus") are their most significant predators. Other documented predators of giant mouse lemurs include the <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a> ("Cryptoprocta ferox"), <a href="Madagascar%20owl">Madagascar owl</a> ("Asio madagascariensis"), and the <a href="narrow-striped%20mongoose">narrow-striped mongoose</a> ("Mungotictis decemlineata").

In 2012, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) assessed both Coquerel's giant mouse lemur and the northern giant mouse lemur as <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>. Prior to that, both species had been listed as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>. Populations of both species are in decline due to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>, primarily for <a href="Slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn agriculture</a> and <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> production. Also, they are both hunted for <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>. The population announced by the WWF in 2010 was found outside the limits of a nearby protected area, PK32-Ranobe, which was granted temporary protection status in December 2008 and is co-managed by the WWF. Its forests were not included in the protected area due to existing <a href="Concession%20%28contract%29">concessions</a> for <a href="mining">mining</a> activities.

As with all lemurs, giant mouse lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as "Class A" of the <a href="African%20Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature%20and%20Natural%20Resources">African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a>. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would only be given for scientific purposes or the national interest. In 1973, they were also protected under <a href="CITES%23Appendix%20I">CITES Appendix I</a>, which strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law.

Giant mouse lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, though they breed easily. In 1989, the Duke Lemur Center held more than 70% of the captive population (45 of 62 individuals). At the time, the DLC was coordinating a <a href="captive%20breeding">captive breeding</a> program for Coquerel's giant mouse lemur, and all individuals kept at American facilities were descended from six individuals imported by the DLC in 1982 from the region around Ambanja. As of 2009, the <a href="International%20Species%20Information%20System">International Species Information System</a> (ISIS) recorded only six remaining individuals registered in the United States and Europe, all reclassified as northern giant mouse lemurs and considered a non-breeding population; and in 2015, only a single female remained on record.

Radcliffe, Greater Manchester

Radcliffe is a town in the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Bury">Metropolitan Borough of Bury</a>, <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England. <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">Historically</a> a part of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, it lies in the <a href="Irwell%20Valley">Irwell Valley</a> south-west of <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a> and north-northwest of <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> and is contiguous with <a href="Whitefield%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Whitefield</a> to the south. The disused <a href="Manchester%20Bolton%20%26amp%3B%20Bury%20Canal">Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal</a> bisects the town.

Evidence of <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a>, <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman</a> and <a href="England%20in%20the%20High%20Middle%20Ages%23Normans">Norman</a> activity has been found in Radcliffe and its surroundings. A Roman road passes through the area, along the border between Radcliffe and Bury. Radcliffe appears in an entry of the <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> as "Radeclive" and in the <a href="High%20Middle%20Ages">High Middle Ages</a> formed a small parish and township centred on the <a href="Parish%20Church%20of%20St%20Mary%2C%20Radcliffe">Church of St Mary</a> and the manorial <a href="Radcliffe%20Tower">Radcliffe Tower</a>, both of which are <a href="Grade%20I%20listed%20buildings%20in%20Greater%20Manchester">Grade I listed buildings</a>.

Plentiful <a href="Coal%20mining%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">coal</a> in the area facilitated the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, providing fuel for the <a href="Cotton-spinning%20machinery">cotton spinning</a> and papermaking industries. By the mid-19th century, Radcliffe was an important <a href="mill%20town">mill town</a> with <a href="cotton%20mill">cotton mill</a>s, bleachworks and a road, canal and railway network.

At the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20census%2C%202011">2011 Census</a>, Radcliffe had a population of 29,950. Radcliffe is predominantly a residential area whose few remaining cotton mill buildings are now occupied by small businesses.

The name Radcliffe is derived from the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> words "read" and "clif", meaning "the red cliff or bank", on the River Irwell in the Irwell Valley. The "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>" records the name as "Radeclive". Other archaic spellings include "Radclive" (recorded in 1227), and "Radeclif" (recorded in 1309 and 1360). The <a href="Radcliffe%20Baronets">Radcliffe family</a> took its name from the town.

The <a href="Prehistoric%20Britain%23Mesolithic">first human settlements</a> in the area, albeit seasonal, are thought to have been as far back as 6,000BC during the <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> period. Archaeological excavations in 1949 at Radcliffe E'es (a level plain along the north bank of the Irwell, formed by retreating <a href="glacier">glacial</a> deposits during the previous <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>) found evidence of pre-historic activity, suggesting a lake village site, but dating techniques of the time were unreliable. Further investigations in 1961 revealed rows of sharpened posts and worked timbers, but no further dating evidence was collected. In 1911, while repairs to the bridge at Radcliffe Bridge were underway, a stone axe-hammer was found in the river bed. The large tool artefact weighs and is made from polished <a href="Quartzite">Quartzite</a>, with a bore to take a shaft.

South of the present-day Withins reservoir is a possible location for a <a href="Henge">Hengi-form</a> <a href="Tumulus">Tumulus</a>. During the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Roman period</a>, a <a href="Roman%20roads%20in%20Britannia">Roman road</a> passed through the area on a south-east to north-west axis; tracing an alignment with the modern border between Radcliffe and Bury. The route linked the <a href="castra">Roman forts</a> of <a href="Mamucium">Mamucium</a> (Manchester) and <a href="Bremetennacum">Bremetennacum</a> (<a href="Ribchester">Ribchester</a>). The approximate route was through Higher Lane in nearby Whitefield, through Dales Lane and across the Irwell over Radcliffe E'es through the site of the former East Lancashire Paper Mill. The route passes up Croft Lane, over Cross Lane and over the route of the <a href="Manchester%20Bolton%20%26amp%3B%20Bury%20Canal">Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal</a> under the 10¾ milestone. It then crosses Bury and Bolton Road, and heads through Higher Spen Moor.
Other than placenames, little information about the area survives from the <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Dark Ages</a>. Radcliffe was likely <a href="moorland">moorland</a> and <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s.

Following the 11th century <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman conquest of England</a>, Radcliffe became a parish and <a href="Township%20%28England%29">township</a> in the <a href="Salford%20%28hundred%29">hundred of Salford</a>, and <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">county</a> of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>. One of only four parishes from the hundred mentioned in the "Domesday Book" and held by <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> as a <a href="Royal%20Manor">Royal Manor</a>, it initially consisted of two <a href="Hamlet%20%28place%29">hamlets</a>; Radcliffe, near to the border with Bury and centred on the <a href="Medieval">Medieval</a> <a href="Parish%20Church%20of%20St%20Mary%2C%20Radcliffe">Church of St Mary</a> and the manorial <a href="Radcliffe%20Tower">Radcliffe Tower</a>, and further to the west Radcliffe Bridge, at a crossing of the Irwell. As a Royal Manor, the <a href="Hide%20%28unit%29">hide</a> may originally have been up to four times the size it was when it was recorded in 1212 as being held by William de Radeclive, of the "Radclyffes of the Tower" family.

In the 15th century the <a href="Pilkington%20of%20Lancashire">Pilkington family</a>, who during the <a href="Wars%20of%20the%20Roses">Wars of the Roses</a> supported the <a href="House%20of%20York">House of York</a>, owned much of the land around the parish. Thomas Pilkington was at this time <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Manor">lord</a> of many estates in Lancashire. In 1485 <a href="Richard%20III%20of%20England">Richard III</a> was killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bosworth">Battle of Bosworth</a>. The <a href="Duke%20of%20Richmond">Duke of Richmond</a>, representing the <a href="House%20of%20Lancaster">House of Lancaster</a>, was crowned <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>. <a href="William%20Stanley%20%28Battle%20of%20Bosworth%29">Sir William Stanley</a> may have placed the crown upon his head. As a reward for the support of his family, on 27 October 1485 Henry made <a href="Thomas%20Stanley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Thomas Stanley</a> the <a href="Earl%20of%20Derby">Earl of Derby</a>. Thomas Pilkington was <a href="Attainder">attainted</a>, and in February 1489 Earl Thomas was given many confiscated estates including those of Pilkington, which included the township of <a href="Pilkington%20%28ancient%20township%29">Pilkington</a>, and <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a>. During the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> Radcliffe, along with nearby <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a>, fought on the side of the <a href="Roundhead">Parliamentarians</a> against the <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> Bury.

In 1561, after about 400 years rule by the Radclyffes, Robert Assheton (Lord of the Manor of <a href="Middleton%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Middleton</a>) bought the manor of Radcliffe for 2,000 <a href="Mark%20%28currency%29%23England%20and%20Scotland">Marks</a>. From 1765 the Assheton estates were divided between the two daughters of the late Ralph Assheton, one of whom married <a href="Thomas%20Egerton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Wilton">Thomas Egerton, 1st Earl of Wilton</a>. The manor of Radcliffe appears to have been included in her share, and thereafter was included in the Wilton estates.

The first documented reference to industry in Radcliffe is after 1680, in the Radcliffe <a href="parish%20register">parish register</a>s, which make increasing mention of occupations such as woollen webster (<a href="weaving">weaving</a>), linen webster, and whitster (bleacher). These were <a href="Cottage%20industry">cottage industries</a> which worked alongside local agriculture. In 1780 <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Peel%2C%201st%20Baronet">Robert Peel</a> built the first factory in the town, several hundred yards upstream from Radcliffe Bridge (at the end of Peel Street). With a <a href="weir">weir</a> and <a href="goit">goit</a> providing motive power for a <a href="water%20wheel">water wheel</a>, the factory was built for <a href="Throstle%20frame">throstle spinning</a> and the weaving of cotton—a relatively new introduction to Britain. The water wheel proved to be insufficient, and so around 1804 the goit was extended. The weir (known as Rectory Weir) was made from timber. Conditions were poor; the mill employed <a href="child%20labour">child labour</a> bought from <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>s in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and London. Children were boarded on an upper floor of the building, and bound until they reached the age of 21. They were unpaid, and were kept locked up each night. Shifts were typically 10–10.5 hours in length, and children returning from a day shift would sleep in the same bed as children leaving for a night shift. Peel himself admitted that conditions at the mill were "very bad". In 1784 an outbreak of <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> prompted <a href="Thomas%20Egerton%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Wilton">Lord Grey de Wilton</a> to inform the magistrates of the <a href="Salford%20%28hundred%29">Salford Hundred</a>; keen to prevent the spread of the disease to neighbouring towns and villages, they sent doctors to assess the situation. Their recommendations included leaving the windows of the mill open at night, <a href="fumigation">fumigation</a> of rooms with <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> (as this was thought to discourage disease), regular cleaning of rooms and toilets and occasional bathing of children. The report forced the magistrates, led by <a href="Thomas%20Butterworth%20Bayley">Thomas Butterworth Bayley</a>, to abandon the practice of binding parish apprentices to any mill not adhering to these conditions. The report also prompted Peel to introduce an <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> to improve factory hygiene, which later became the <a href="Factory%20Act%23Factory%20Act%201802">Factory Act of 1802</a>. Over time, conditions at the mill improved; in the mid-1790s the physician <a href="John%20Aikin">John Aikin</a>, a critic of the factory system, praised working conditions at the mill, and in 1823 inspections by local magistrates of conditions in mills across the county revealed that unlike many others, the factory at Radcliffe was adhering to all requirements of the <a href="Factory%20Acts">Factory Acts</a>.

The underlying coal measures throughout the parish were a valuable source of fuel. Radcliffe already had an established textile industry before the arrival of <a href="Steam%20power%20during%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution">steam power</a>. The first recorded instance of coal getting in the <a href="North%20West%20of%20England">North West of England</a> was in 1246, when Adam de Radeclyve was fined for digging "de minera" on <a href="common%20land">common land</a> in the Radcliffe area. Coal outcroppings were not uncommon; as recently as 1936 members of the public were seen carrying away large pieces of coal from a seam revealed by the landslip caused when the <a href="Manchester%20Bolton%20%26amp%3B%20Bury%20Canal">Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal</a> breached at Ladyshore. Mining was initially limited to <a href="bell%20pit">bell pit</a>s until the arrival of steam engines, which along with improved ventilation, made possible much deeper pits. The earliest known local use of such an engine was in 1792 at Black Cat Colliery. The parish of Radcliffe was once home to as many as 50 pits, but with the exceptions of <a href="Outwood%20Colliery">Outwood Colliery</a> and <a href="Ladyshore%20Colliery">Ladyshore Colliery</a>, all were either exhausted or closed by the end of the 19th century. During the <a href="1926%20General%20Strike">1926 General Strike</a> many striking miners illegally took coal from exposed seams around the Coney Green area of the town, to sell to local housewives. In the 1950s to the north of the town the <a href="National%20Coal%20Board">National Coal Board</a> did some <a href="open%20cast%20mining">open cast mining</a> near Radcliffe Moor Road, but the last legal instance of coal mining in Radcliffe was between 1931 and 1949, close to Bury and Bolton Road.

The transformation of the area from an industry based upon water power, to one based upon steam power, may not have been without problems. A story in W. Nicholl's "History and Traditions of Radcliffe" (1900) tells of a "great crowd" of protesters from Bury who marched on Bealey's Works, demanding that work be halted. James Booth ordered the gates closed, gave the ringleaders £5, and promised to halt work the next day. The crowd then marched on other businesses within the town before heading along the canal to Bolton, at which point they were apparently turned back by news of approaching soldiers.
There were many smaller textile concerns in the parish. Thomas Howarth owned a cottage in Stand Lane from where he sent yarn to be dyed and sized. He made his own <a href="Warp%20%28weaving%29">warps</a> which were weaved in the town. He would then travel to <a href="Preston%2C%20Lancashire">Preston</a> and <a href="Kendal">Kendal</a> where <a href="draper">draper</a>s would purchase his products. His nephews founded A. & J. Hoyle's Mill in Irwell Street, which employed power weaving to produce their specialities in <a href="Gingham">Gingham</a>s and <a href="shirt">shirt</a>ing. The mill closed in 1968. Messrs Stott & Pickstone's Top Shop on Stand Lane was the first company to employ powered looms and spinning around 1844. Many of their employees would eventually leave to start their own businesses, such as Spider Mill, built by Robert and William Fletcher, and John Pickstone. This mill closed around 1930.

Radcliffe was at one time home to around 60 textile mills and 15 spinning mills, along with 18 bleachworks of which the Bealey family were prominent owners. However, the textile industry was not the town's major employer; other industries such as mining and paper making were also important sources of employment.

Mount Sion Mill along Sion Street was founded in the early 19th century and during the <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20during%20the%20First%20World%20War%23Industry">First World War</a> manufactured <a href="Nitrocellulose">guncotton</a>. A weir was constructed along with a goit, used to turn a water wheel which powered a <a href="beam%20engine">beam engine</a> to pump water to the reservoirs above.

Radcliffe became well known for its paper industry; its mills included the East Lancashire Paper Mill and Radcliffe Paper Mill. The former was founded by the Seddon family on 29 March 1860, along the banks of the Irwell. Its construction provided much-needed employment: in the 1860s living standards within the town were poor, and local mills often operated on "short time". A reduction in the demand for coal had placed many colliers out of work, and the <a href="Lancashire%20Cotton%20Famine">Lancashire Cotton Famine</a> was starving <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> of raw materials, especially cotton. <a href="Soup%20kitchen">Soup kitchen</a>s were opened by local benefactors, and many local residents were on <a href="poor%20relief">poor relief</a>. The mill began producing low grade paper and newsprint, moving on to other products including high quality printing and writing papers. Radcliffe Paper Mill was formed during the First World War, when it took over from a paper mill and a pipe plant. It originally produced paper suitable for roofing felt, to cater for a national shortage. After World War II the mill employed over 600 people and produced 70,000 tons of paper annually. British Plaster Board Industries (BPB) took over the company in 1961.

Other industries in the town included <a href="Brickworks%23Brick%20making">brick making</a> and chimney pot manufacture. Raw materials were sourced from local collieries. In Mill Street carts, waggons, and bicycles were manufactured from 1855, and elsewhere motor vehicles were also produced until the late 1950s. <a href="John%20Cockerill%20%28industrialist%29">John Cockerill</a> moved to the town from <a href="Haslingden">Haslingden</a> before leaving for continental Europe to become the founder of <a href="Cockerill-Sambre">Cockerill-Sambre</a>. James Cockerill, employed Radcliffe man William Yates as his manager. Several <a href="Foundry">foundries</a> and machine manufacturers were located around the town, including Dobson and Barlow at Bradley Fold, and Wolstenholme's along Bridgewater Street. Munitions, aircraft and tank components were manufactured during the Second World War. Chemicals were manufactured by companies such as Bealey's and J. & W. Whewell.

From the 1950s Radcliffe's textile industry went into terminal decline, and although its paper industry survived to the end of the 20th century, both the town's largest paper mills have now been closed and demolished. One of the larger mills in Radcliffe was the Pioneer Mill, built between 1905 and 1906, and which ceased weaving in July 1980—the last mill in Radcliffe to use cotton. The building is now occupied by several different businesses.

Although the town retains much of its existing <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> and <a href="Edwardian%20architecture">Edwardian</a> housing stock, new estates have been built on former <a href="brownfield%20land">brownfield land</a> including that of the Radcliffe Paper Mill Company. Since <a href="deindustrialisation">deindustrialisation</a> the local population has continued to grow. Radcliffe's housing stock of 23,790 properties is a mixture of mainly <a href="semi-detached">semi-detached</a> and <a href="terrace%20%28building%29">terraced</a> housing, with smaller percentages of <a href="detached">detached</a> housing and flats. In 1974 the town became a part of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Bury">Metropolitan Borough of Bury</a>, and as a result has been described as losing its independence, and to some extent its identity.

Following the <a href="Poor%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201834">Poor Law Amendment Act 1834</a>, Radcliffe formed part of the Bury <a href="Poor%20Law%20Union">Poor Law Union</a>, an inter-parish unit established to provide <a href="social%20security">social security</a>. Radcliffe's first <a href="local%20authority">local authority</a> was an early form of <a href="local%20government%20in%20England">local government in England</a>. In July 1866 the <a href="local%20board%20of%20health">Radcliffe Local Board of Health</a> was established. With reference to the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201858">Local Government Act 1858</a>, it was a regulatory body consisting of 12 members, responsible for standards of hygiene and sanitation in the township. Richard Bealey <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20peace">J.P.</a> was chairman of the local board until April 1876 In the same year, the parish was extended to include parts of the former township of Pilkington, formerly in the parish of <a href="Prestwich-cum-Oldham">Prestwich-cum-Oldham</a>.

Radcliffe became a part of the <a href="Municipal%20Borough">Municipal Borough</a> of Bury in 1876, but following the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201894">Local Government Act 1894</a> it left the district (by then the <a href="County%20Borough%20of%20Bury">County Borough of Bury</a>), becoming an <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a> within the <a href="Administrative%20counties%20of%20England">administrative county</a> of Lancashire. The district boundary was extended to include the Stand Lane district The extension made the area covered by Radcliffe <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">Urban District</a> . Radcliffe Urban District was governed by a council of 24 members, made from six <a href="councillor">councillor</a>s from each of the four <a href="Wards%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">wards</a>, Radcliffe Hall, Radcliffe Bridge, Black Lane, and Stand Lane. Alker Allen J.P. was the first chairman of the new council. A <a href="town%20hall">town hall</a> was built in 1911, replacing an earlier building on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane. It formed the public administrative centre for the district with a large council chamber on the first floor, with public gallery, and four committee rooms.

The Lancashire (Southern Areas) Review Order of 1933 extended the district to include the township of <a href="Ainsworth%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Ainsworth</a>, and a portion of the township of <a href="Outwood%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Outwood</a>. This increased the area covered by Radcliffe District to . A new ward was created for Ainsworth, comprising the former township and a portion of the Black Lane ward. Three councillors were added to the council, and the total number of electors became 15,009. On 21 September 1935 the <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a> received a charter as a <a href="municipal%20borough">municipal borough</a>, which gave it <a href="Borough%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">borough status</a>, and elevated it to the <a href="Municipal%20Borough">Municipal Borough</a> of Radcliffe.

Under the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a> the town's <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a> status was abolished, and Radcliffe has, since 1 April 1974, formed an <a href="unparished%20area">unparished area</a> of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Bury">Metropolitan Borough of Bury</a>, a local government district of the <a href="metropolitan%20county">metropolitan county</a> of <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>.

For electoral purposes, Radcliffe is now divided into three wards; Radcliffe North, Radcliffe East, and Radcliffe West. It is in the <a href="Bury%20South%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Bury South constituency</a> and was represented in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> by <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> member <a href="Ivan%20Lewis">Ivan Lewis</a>; however he was suspended from the party in 2017 and since has sat as an independent.

At (53.5615°, −2.3268°) and northwest of <a href="central%20London">central London</a>, Radcliffe lies in the <a href="Irwell%20Valley">Irwell Valley</a> on the course of the <a href="River%20Irwell">River Irwell</a>. The larger towns of <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a> and <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a> lie to the northeast and northwest. For the purposes of the <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a>, Radcliffe forms a northerly part of the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Urban%20Area">Greater Manchester Urban Area</a>, with <a href="Manchester%20city%20centre">Manchester city centre</a> to the south-southeast.

Radcliffe's position on the River Irwell has proved important in its history and development as the river provided a source of water for local industry. Radcliffe E'es, a level plain formed along the north bank of the Irwell during the previous <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>, is now derelict and the planned location of a new school. From a highpoint of above sea level in the northwest of Radcliffe, the surface gradually descends, particularly in the south and east, being the lowest along the River Irwell. The geology is represented by <a href="coal%20measure">coal measure</a>.

Radcliffe is surrounded by open space and rural land, much of which is visible from the town centre. To the east of the town the <a href="River%20Roch">River Roch</a> flows under Blackford Bridge, and joins the Irwell shortly thereafter, along which several <a href="weir">weir</a>s and <a href="Leat">goits</a> were built as it passes through the town. Flowing from east to west the river divides the town on the north and south sides of the valley respectively. The <a href="town%20centre">town centre</a> sits on the north side of the valley. Two road bridges cross the river: one in the former hamlet of Radcliffe Bridge, and another newer bridge built as part of the <a href="A665%20road">A665 Pilkington Bypass</a>. Another bridge crosses the river along the eastern border with Bury. Various smaller pedestrian footbridges and two railway <a href="viaduct">viaduct</a>s (one disused) also exist.

According to the <a href="Office%20for%20National%20Statistics">Office for National Statistics</a>, at the time of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">United Kingdom Census 2001</a>, Radcliffe had a population of 34,239. The population density in 2001 was , with a 100 to 94.9 female–male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 28.6% were single (never married) and 42.8% married. Radcliffe's 14,036 households included 28.1% one-person, 39.0% married couples living together, 9.2% were co-habiting couples, and 12.3% single parents with their children. The figures for married couples households was below the borough (48.5%) and national average (47.3%), and single parent households were slightly above the average for the whole of Bury (11.6%) and England (10.5%). Of those aged 16–74, 31.1% had no academic qualifications, slightly higher than averages of Bury (29.2%) and England (28.9%).

The residential areas of Radcliffe both to the north and the south of the town centre operate as suburbs of Bury and Manchester, such that their populations are not necessarily linked to the town. The socio-demographic characteristics of the town's population includes a mix of working and suburban middle classes, the layout of which are both linked to neighbouring towns.

Radcliffe is within the Manchester <a href="Larger%20Urban%20Zone">Larger Urban Zone</a>, and within the Manchester <a href="Travel%20to%20Work%20Area">Travel to Work Area</a>.

Radcliffe's first market was built by the <a href="Thomas%20Egerton%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Wilton">Earl of Wilton</a> and opened in 1851. The town was home to twelve <a href="Co-op">Co-op</a> stores, the largest of which was on Stand Lane. The four storey structure, built in 1877, had shops and offices on the ground floor, and a large area for public meetings on the second floor. The building was truncated to two stories in June 1971, and eventually demolished. Two more Co-op stores were located on Bury Street and Cross Lane. The current market hall, built in 1937 on a different site to the old market, suffered a devastating fire in 1980 but was later restored. Radcliffe was once served by several banks including the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Bank">Lancashire and Yorkshire Bank</a>, the <a href="District%20Bank">Manchester and Liverpool District Bank</a>, the <a href="Union%20Bank%20of%20Manchester">Union Bank of Manchester</a>, and <a href="Westminster%20Bank">Parr's Bank ltd</a>. Today both the <a href="Royal%20Bank%20of%20Scotland">Royal Bank of Scotland</a> and <a href="Halifax%20%28United%20Kingdom%20bank%29">Halifax bank</a> have branches in the town.
Radcliffe has two weekly newspapers, the Radcliffe Times, based at the Bury Times offices, in <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a>, and the <a href="City%20of%20Salford">Salford</a>-based The Advertiser, which also covers the neighbouring areas of <a href="Prestwich">Prestwich</a> and <a href="Whitefield%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Whitefield</a>. The main gates to the East Lancashire Paper mill (mill closed in 2001) were, in May 2018, installed in the centre of Radcliffe's Festival Gardens off Church Street.

The construction in the 1980s of the A665 Pilkington Way <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">Bypass</a> relieved traffic congestion along the traditional route through the town, Blackburn Street. A new bridge across the Irwell was constructed for the road, and part of Blackburn Street was <a href="pedestrianised">pedestrianised</a>. The road has attracted developments along former industrial land to the west of the town, including a large <a href="Asda">Asda</a> superstore and petrol filling station which opened in May 1997, when Asda moved out of their town centre store in Green Street, although it has exacerbated the decline of the retail outlets in the town centre. The bypass has created problems for cyclists and pedestrians who appear reluctant to cross the road and visit the town centre. One solution presently under consideration would involve a partial reopening of the pedestrianised section of Blackburn Street to traffic.
The closure of the East Lancashire and Radcliffe Paper Mills, both of which employed thousands of people, has left a large gap in the town's local economy. Along with the decline of local industry the town's shopping centre has suffered a severe loss of trade and is now barely viable as a retail outlet. Radcliffe's market hall compares poorly with the neighbouring <a href="Bury%20Market">Bury Market</a>. Amongst other shops, the town's central shopping precinct retains a <a href="Boots%20the%20Chemist">Boots</a>. A <a href="Dunelm%20Group">Dunelm Group</a>, formerly known as Dunelm Mill, home and soft furnishings store now occupies the former site of the town's Asda supermarket on Green Street. In February 2018 a new Lidl store opened its doors on the site of the old bus station employing around forty people.

"Re-inventing Radcliffe" is the name given on a report of a proposed improvement scheme. The report envisages several initiatives, and includes the creation of new housing both to the north and south of the town. Existing industry to the west of the town and along Milltown Street would be retained and improved, along with sections of the former Radcliffe Paper Mill and Pioneer Mill. The market would be redeveloped along with the <a href="Kwik%20Save">Kwik Save</a> site and bus station, and the town could become a centre for the arts. To improve transport links, new crossings of the Irwell and canal are proposed, along with a new school to replace the two closed <a href="secondary%20school">secondary school</a>s. Finally, the report suggests improving the image of Radcliffe within the Bury area. On 27 June 2018, due to very hot weather, a fire started on the exterior of the complex of shops adjoining the precinct as roofing tar caught alight.

"Newlands" is a regeneration programme run by the <a href="Forestry%20Commission">Forestry Commission</a>. One site under consideration for regeneration is the former waste tip of Radcliffe E'es.

In 1921 2,394 men and 3,680 women were employed in the textile industry. By 1951 these figures had fallen respectively to 981 and 1,852. A more drastic fall is evident in the numbers of people employed in the mining and quarrying industries; in 1921 591 people were employed in both, but in 1951 this had dropped to only 57, reflecting the number of mines in and around Radcliffe that had by that time been completely exhausted.

By 2001, from a working population of 15,972 between the ages of 16–74 only six people were employed in mining. 3,011 people were employed in manufacturing, 103 in <a href="Public%20utility">public utilities</a>, and 985 in construction. 3,371 people worked in wholesale and retailing; repair of motor vehicles, 682 in hotels and catering, and 1,185 in transport; storage and communication. 642 people worked in <a href="Financial%20intermediary">financial intermediation</a>, 1,711 in real estate, 694 in <a href="public%20administration">public administration</a> and defence, 987 in education, 1,876 in health and social work, and 657 in other work.

<a href="Radcliffe%20Tower">Radcliffe Tower</a> is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a>. The structure is a <a href="Grade%20I%20listed%20buildings%20in%20Greater%20Manchester">Grade I listed building</a> and protected as a <a href="Scheduled%20Monument">Scheduled Monument</a>. The construction of a nearby <a href="tithe%20barn">tithe barn</a> is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local <a href="tithe">tithe</a>s (a tenth of a farm's produce). Along with Radcliffe Tower, the <a href="Parish%20Church%20of%20St%20Mary%2C%20Radcliffe">Parish Church of St Mary</a> is a Grade I listed building. The town also has two <a href="Listed%20building">Grade II* listed buildings</a>; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War. <a href="Outwood%20Viaduct">Outwood Viaduct</a>, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by <a href="Viscount%20Grey%20de%20Wilton">Viscount Grey de Wilton</a> (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was <a href="Consecration">consecrated</a> in 1864 by the first <a href="Bishop%20of%20Manchester">Bishop of Manchester</a>, <a href="James%20Prince%20Lee">James Prince Lee</a>. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£ today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£ today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher.

Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road. It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896. The fountain no longer exists at this location.

Built in 1911 the <a href="town%20hall">town hall</a> was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane. For many years after the town lost its <a href="Urban%20district%20%28Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">urban district</a> status, the building was unoccupied. It was converted to private accommodation in 1999.

The Manchester to Blackburn <a href="packhorse">packhorse</a> route passed through the town (hence the name Blackburn Street). The bridge across the Irwell was likely first erected during the late Medieval period at the site of a ford. An <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> in 1754 authorised the first turnpike through the hamlet of Radcliffe Bridge, and included Manchester to Bury via <a href="Crumpsall">Crumpsall</a>, and from <a href="Prestwich">Prestwich</a> to Radcliffe. An Act of 1821 created a turnpike from Bury to Radcliffe, <a href="Stoneclough">Stoneclough</a> and <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a>. An Act of 1836 created a turnpike from Starling Lane to <a href="Ainsworth%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Ainsworth</a>, and Radcliffe to Bury and Manchester Road (near Fletcher Fold). A turnpike from Whitefield to Radcliffe Bridge via Stand Lane was created in 1857 with <a href="toll%20house">toll house</a>s at <a href="Besses%20o%27%20th%27%20Barn">Besses o' th' Barn</a>, Stand Lane, the junction of Dumers Lane and Manchester Road, on Bolton Road near Countess Lane, and on Radcliffe Moor Road at Bradley Fold. Radcliffe New Road was created in an Act of 1860 which enabled the construction of a toll road between Radcliffe and Whitefield. To prevent damage to the road surfaces, weighing machines were used at various strategic positions including at the bridge end of Dumers Lane, at Sandiford turning, and on Ainsworth Road.
During the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, as local <a href="Cottage%20industry%23Cottage%20industry">cottage industries</a> were gradually supplanted by the <a href="factory%20system">factory system</a> the roads became inadequate for use. A convoy of horse-drawn lorries carrying salt between Bealey's Bleach Works and <a href="Northwich">Northwich</a> would take up to two weeks to make a return journey. These problems gave rise to the construction of the <a href="Manchester%20Bolton%20%26amp%3B%20Bury%20Canal">Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal</a>, which reached the town in 1796 and which was navigable throughout in 1808. For 38 years the canal was the town's main route for trade and transport, with a <a href="wharf">wharf</a> near Hampson Street. The proprietors later converted into a railway company and built a line between <a href="Salford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Salford</a> and <a href="Bolton">Bolton</a>, which opened in 1838. A branch from this line was to have been built to <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a>, along the line of the canal, but due to technical constraints this did not happen. Radcliffe's closest railway connection therefore remained several miles distant at <a href="Kearsley%20railway%20station">Stoneclough</a>.

The opening of the <a href="Manchester%2C%20Bury%20and%20Rossendale%20Railway">Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway</a> (later known as the <a href="East%20Lancashire%20Railway%201844%E2%80%931859">East Lancashire Railway</a> (ELR)) in 1846 brought the town a direct connection to Manchester and <a href="Bury%20Bolton%20Street%20railway%20station">Bury</a>. Two stations served the town, <a href="Radcliffe%20Bridge%20railway%20station">Radcliffe Bridge station</a>, and <a href="Withins%20Lane%20railway%20station">Withins Lane station</a> (although this closed in 1851 after only a few years of operation). <a href="Ringley%20Road%20railway%20station">Ringley Road station</a> was located to the south of the parish, close to the civil parish of Pilkington. The line crossed the Irwell over <a href="Outwood%20Viaduct">Outwood Viaduct</a>, an impressive structure which remains to this day.

The <a href="Liverpool%20and%20Bury%20Railway">Liverpool and Bury Railway</a> (L&BR) opened on 28 November 1848, with a station to the north of the town, called <a href="Black%20Lane%20railway%20station%20%28Radcliffe%29">Black Lane station</a>. On 18 July 1872 the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> (L&YR), which had amalgamated with the ELR some years previously, gained an Act of Parliament to construct a railway between Manchester and Bury, via <a href="Whitefield%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Whitefield</a> and <a href="Prestwich">Prestwich</a>. This opened in 1879 with a new station, known as <a href="Radcliffe%20Metrolink%20station">Radcliffe New Station</a>, with a link to the L&BR line at Bradley Fold (near the present day Chatsworth Road), and a new station along Ainsworth Road, <a href="Ainsworth%20Road%20Halt%20railway%20station">Ainsworth Road Halt</a>. The new L&YR route joined the existing ELR route near Withins Lane (North Junction), whereon they shared the connection to Bury. The L&YR gained a further Act of 1877 to construct a link between North Junction and Coney Green Farm (West Junction). The LY&R line was electrified in 1916 for which a substation was constructed, between the canal and the West Fork.
The town also had an extensive <a href="Tram%23Electric%20%28trolley%20cars%29">tram</a> network. The first tram ran from Black Lane (latterly Ainsworth Road) in 1905, with a terminus next to St Andrew's Church on Black Lane Bridge. In 1907 a branch was built to connect to the Bury to Bolton part of the network. A large bus station is located between Dale Street and the river. Officially abandoned in 1961, the canal is currently undergoing restoration on the <a href="Salford%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Salford</a> arm, although a rebuilt bridge along Water Street presents a barrier to its full restoration.

Public transport in Radcliffe is now coordinated by the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Passenger%20Transport%20Executive">Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive</a> (GMPTE), a county-wide public body with direct operational responsibilities such as supporting (and in some cases running) local bus services, and managing <a href="integrated%20ticketing">integrated ticketing</a> in Greater Manchester.

The town is now served only by a single light rail system and regular bus services. The <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Metrolink</a> opened on 6 April 1992 along the L&YR line between Manchester and Bury/Bury and Altrincham (Manchester also servers as a change point for the rest of the Metrolink system as it expands to cover a greater portion of the region, including Oldham). Trams leave from the town's station every six minutes between 7:15 am and 6:30 pm, and every 12 minutes at other times of the day. Radcliffe Bridge station closed on 5 July 1958, and has since been replaced by the path of the A665 Pilkington Way (the new road has been built below the level of the old station). The path of the ELR line is still quite visible from aerial photography, with <a href="Outwood%20Viaduct">Outwood Viaduct</a> fully restored, and the route of the line southwest of the town converted for use as a nature trail forming part of the <a href="Irwell%20Sculpture%20Trail">Irwell Sculpture Trail</a>.

One of the earliest schools in the parish was the Close Wesleyan Day School, a <a href="Dame%20school">Dame school</a> opened around 1840. St Thomas's day school was opened on 4 March 1861, and housed over 500 children. Due to overcrowding and the risk of subsidence caused by local mining activity, the school was rebuilt on a new site along School Street, provided by the <a href="Thomas%20Egerton%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Wilton">Earl of Wilton</a>. It was opened in October 1877 by Lady Wilton. On the opposite side of the town St John's school started life in 1860 as an institute along Irwell Street, and by 1864 contained 120 children. The buildings were enlarged in 1869. In 1897 eight teachers and a monitor taught 358 children. In 1899 the school leaving age was twelve, and many of the senior class were "half-timers" who would spend half the day at school, and the other half at work. This system was abolished in 1919. Regular epidemics of <a href="scarlet%20fever">scarlet fever</a>, <a href="chicken%20pox">chicken pox</a>, <a href="mumps">mumps</a>, and especially <a href="measles">measles</a>, meant that in 1897 and 1903 the school was temporarily closed. St John's School and the nearby church were demolished in the 1970s. Radcliffe also had a technical school on Whittaker Street. Formally opened by Lord Stanley on 7 November 1896, it adjoined the public baths on Whittaker Street. The building is now used as council offices.

Radcliffe County Secondary School was founded in 1933 on the former Peel Park Ground near School Street, but Radcliffe's first secondary school (apart from an endowed <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a> in nearby Stand) was held at the New Jerusalem schoolroom from the early 1860s. Radcliffe East, latterly known as Coney Green County Comprehensive School, was built in 1975 on the site of the former railway goods yard alongside Radcliffe East Fork. Part of the school, known as "Phase One", opened in September 1975, with 150 first-year pupils, and 70 second-year pupils (from Radcliffe County Secondary School). The remainder, known as "Phase Two", opened two years later.

Radcliffe has ten primary schools, but no secondary schools. A new school was proposed to replace the former Coney Green and Radcliffe High schools, but recent developments make the construction of this school uncertain.

In <a href="Romano-British%20culture">Romano–British</a> times, Radcliffe was in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20York">Diocese of York</a>; in <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Saxon</a> times in the Diocese of <a href="Lindesfarne">Lindesfarne</a>, then of York; in <a href="England%20in%20the%20High%20Middle%20Ages">Norman</a> times in the Diocese of <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>; after 1540 in the Diocese of <a href="Chester">Chester</a> and since 1847 in the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Manchester">Diocese of Manchester</a>.

Based on the subdivisions of the dioceses, before 1535 Radcliffe ancient parish was in Manchester and Blackburn <a href="Rural%20Dean">Rural Dean</a>ery. Between this date and 1850 the ancient parish was placed in Manchester Rural Deanery. From 1850 to 1851 it was placed in Bury Rural Deanery; from 1851 to 1872 it was in Prestwich Rural Deanery; from 1872 to 1912, it was placed in Prestwich and Middleton Rural Deanery; and since 1872 it has been in Radcliffe and Prestwich Rural Deanery.

Radcliffe was an ancient parish which in its early history had duties which combined both ecclesiastical and civil matters. In 1821 Radcliffe St. Thomas <a href="ecclesiastical%20parish">ecclesiastical parish</a> was created from the ancient parish, and it was re-founded in 1839. In 1873 further parts of the ancient parish were taken to form Bury St. Peter's ecclesiastical parish. In 1878 parts of the ancient parish as well as part of Radcliffe St. Thomas were taken to form Radcliffe St. Andrew, Black Lane ecclesiastical parish. The <a href="Parish%20Church%20of%20St%20Mary%2C%20Radcliffe">Parish Church of St Mary</a> was built during the 14th century, and the tower added in the 15th century. In 1966 it was designated a <a href="Grade%20I">Grade I</a> <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> by <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> under its former name of the Church of St Mary and St Bartholomew. In 1991 some local parishes were merged, and the church adopted its present name.
Radcliffe is also served by the Parish of St Thomas and St John. St Thomas' is visible on the horizon for many miles. The original church was built in 1819 by Countess Grosvenor and is visible above in the image of Radcliffe Bridge. The building was later considered too small, and in 1862 was demolished and replaced with the present structure (see landmarks). The Church of St John was consecrated on 19 February 1866 at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road. Built at a cost of about £4,000 (£ today) the site was donated to the church by the <a href="Earl%20of%20Derby">Earl of Derby</a>, who in 1897 also made a grant of land for the site of the Mission Church at Chapelfield. The parishes of St John and St Philip were merged with St Thomas' in 1975–76. Radcliffe is also home to the Church of St Andrew on Ainsworth Road, which was consecrated in 1877.

Radcliffe was also home to many smaller churches. The main <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">Roman Catholic</a> church, St. Mary & St. Philip Neri, on Spring Lane, was built in 1894. Other churches included Stand Independent, a <a href="Britain%20Yearly%20Meeting">Quaker</a> church on Foundry Street, Water Lane <a href="Congregational%20church%23United%20Kingdom">Congregational</a>, and several <a href="Methodist%20Church%20of%20Great%20Britain">Wesleyan churches</a>, including one on Bridgefield Street, which in March 2008 was destroyed by fire. The church was built in 1892. The <a href="United%20Reformed%20Church">United Reformed Church</a> has two congregations within the town, one on Lord Street, and the other on Stand Lane. The church was originally formed from a Congregational school in 1848. A <a href="Methodist%20New%20Connexion">Methodist New Connexion</a> church has existed along Smyrna Street since 1844. Other faiths are also catered for, with a <a href="mosque">mosque</a> on Bridgefield Street, and a centre for <a href="Swedenborgianism">Swedenborgianism</a> on Radcliffe New Road.

Radcliffe has a rich history of sport, including <a href="association%20football">football</a>, <a href="rugby%20league">rugby</a>, <a href="cricket">cricket</a> and swimming, but entertainment in Radcliffe once included <a href="bear-baiting">bear-baiting</a>, <a href="bull-baiting">bull-baiting</a>, and <a href="Cockfight">cock-fighting</a>. Cock fights were prevalent in the town and took place in local "hush-shops", generally viewed by invitation only. Bull and bear baiting was held in the Radcliffe Bridge area of the parish. In Nicholls' "History and Traditions of Radcliffe" (1900) the author describes the contents of the diary of a Lord Kenyon, who wrote "W.M. Robt. James, and Thomas Radcliffe, were fined for causing a Bayre to be bayted upon Saturday being the 18th of March 1587–8, at the Bull-Ringe neere the conduite in Manchester." Trained dogs were used to attack a bull, which was donated by the Earl of Wilton. Such entertainment took place where the bridge now stands, along the banks of the river near the ford. Such spectacles were eventually outlawed by Act of Parliament, and the last bull bait in the town was held on 26 September 1838. Horse racing replaced the sport the following year, with a course alongside the river. During the first year of racing the main spectator stand collapsed, injuring many spectators. In 1876 events were moved to a new course approximately one mile in circumference at Radcliffe Moor, upon which site the town's cricket club now stands.

The town is home to <a href="Central%20Lancashire%20Cricket%20League">Central Lancashire Cricket League</a> side <a href="Radcliffe%20Cricket%20Club">Radcliffe Cricket Club</a>. For many years <a href="Sir%20Frank%20Worrell">Sir Frank Worrell</a> played for the club, and a street near the cricket ground was named in his honour. Sir <a href="Garfield%20Sobers">Garfield Sobers</a> joined the club in 1958 at the age of 21. The town also has two <a href="Football%20team">Football team</a>s, <a href="Radcliffe%20Town%20Football%20Club">Radcliffe Town</a>, and <a href="Radcliffe%20Borough%20F.C.">Radcliffe Borough</a>. Former players include <a href="Paul%20Gascoigne">Paul Gascoigne</a> and <a href="Matt%20Derbyshire">Matt Derbyshire</a>.

Radcliffe was also home to <a href="Nellie%20Halstead">Nellie Halstead</a>, who in her time was known as "Britain's greatest woman athlete". A multiple world record holder, she represented Great Britain at the <a href="1932%20Summer%20Olympics">1932 Olympic Games</a> in Los Angeles.

The <a href="Rivers%20Pollution%20Prevention%20Act%201876">Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876</a> posed a problem for the local authorities; disposal of sewage was generally an expensive proposition, and efforts to resolve the practical problems involved were often unsatisfactory. After initial experiments, in 1894 contracts were let for work. Chairman of the Local Board Samuel Walker Esq cut the first sod on 23 April 1894, and the works were completed in the following year.

The town was provided with electricity by a coal-fired power station along the south bank of the river, to the west of the town. Authorised by the Radcliffe Electric Lighting Order of 1894, and inaugurated on 5 October 1904, <a href="Radcliffe%20Power%20Station">Radcliffe Power Station</a> was opened by the <a href="Frederick%20Stanley%2C%2016th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Earl of Derby</a> on 9 October 1905. It originally had two 1,500 kW turbo sets made by <a href="British%20Thomson-Houston">British Thomson-Houston</a>, and was the first power station in the country to transmit electricity over bare electrical conductors.

In 1921 the Radcliffe and Little Lever Joint Gas Board purchased the Radcliffe & Pilkington Gas Company. Constituted in 1921 by an Act of Parliament, the board consisted of six members of the Radcliffe Council and one member of the Little Lever Council. The area supplied included all the districts of Radcliffe and Little Lever, and also Prestwich, Whitefield, Unsworth, Outwood, and Ainsworth. In 1935 the company supplied of gas to 16,748 consumers, and provided gas for public street lighting. Water supplies were provided both by upland <a href="Drainage%20divide">watersheds</a> and by the Bury & District Joint Water Board, of which Radcliffe was a constituent authority.

By 1935 a fire brigade and ambulances were available to protect the town during emergencies. The <a href="Fire%20alarm%20box">Gamewell</a> system of fire alarms was used and consisted of 16 alarm boxes spread throughout the district. Three motor ambulances and a motorised utility van were kept at the <a href="fire%20station">fire station</a>, operated by permanent staff.

The <a href="North%20West%20Ambulance%20Service">North West Ambulance Service</a> provides emergency patient transport, and the <a href="Fire%20service%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">statutory emergency fire and rescue service</a> is now provided by the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Fire%20and%20Rescue%20Service">Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service</a>.

<a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> policing in Radcliffe is provided by the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Police">Greater Manchester Police</a>. The Radcliffe police station that was situated along Railway street was closed due to cost saving measures announced by Greater Manchester Police in November 2015. In July 2016 the building was sold by auction to an anonymous buyer for £150,000. <a href="Waste%20management">Waste management</a> is coordinated by the <a href="local%20authority">local authority</a> via the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Waste%20Disposal%20Authority">Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority</a>. Radcliffe's <a href="Distribution%20Network%20Operator">Distribution Network Operator</a> for electricity is <a href="United%20Utilities">United Utilities</a>.

Born in Radcliffe, the First World War veteran <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">Private</a> <a href="James%20Hutchinson%20%28VC%29">James Hutchinson</a> was a recipient of the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>. Radcliffe was also the birthplace of Canadian author <a href="Donald%20Jack">Donald Jack</a> and the home of Olympic Medal-winning cyclist <a href="Harry%20Hill%20%28cyclist%29">Harry Hill</a> who took bronze at the <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a>. <a href="Nellie%20Halstead">Nellie Halstead</a> was a runner who represented Great Britain in both the <a href="1932%20Summer%20Olympics">1932 Summer Olympics</a> and <a href="1936%20Summer%20Olympics">1936 Summer Olympics</a>. Radcliffe was the birthplace of Oscar-winning film director <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a> and the three times World Champion <a href="snooker">snooker</a> player <a href="John%20Spencer%20%28snooker%20player%29">John Spencer</a>.

Radcliffe's wealth as a mill town gave rise to many outlets for the entertainment of its population. These included cinemas and <a href="public%20house">public house</a>s. Several cinemas were built in the town, including the Picturedrome in Water Street, and an Odeon cinema, built in 1937 along Dale Street. Whittaker Street <a href="Public%20bathing">public baths</a> were built in 1898 and demolished in 1971. The swimming pool on Green Street which replaced the old Whittaker Street baths was itself closed down after storm damaged the main facilities in 2013 disclosing high levels of <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> in the building super-structure. As a replacement a new £945,000 25 metre length modular above-ground swimming pool was erected in 2015 at the recently closed Riverside High School
on Spring Lane (formally Coney Green High School). The pool complex also includes a fully equipped public gymnasium. A public library was opened in 1907 on a site donated by <a href="Andrew%20Carnegie">Andrew Carnegie</a>, who also contributed £5,000 (£ today) towards the cost of the building. Two branch libraries were opened in Ainsworth between 1933 and 1935. A museum was located in the upper rooms of Close House before it was demolished in March 1969.

Radcliffe Brass Band has performed in the town since 1914, when it accompanied one of the <a href="Whit%20Friday%23Whit%20walks">Whit Walks</a> that used to take place on <a href="Whit%20Friday">Whit Friday</a>. Popular as these were, support later dwindled to a point where they were abandoned around 1977. <a href="Rushcart">Rushcart</a> processions were once popular, held on the first Saturday of September, finishing on the following Sunday at the Parish Church.

The town has several parks, including Coronation Park near Radcliffe Bridge and Close Park near Radcliffe Tower. Much of the land for Coronation Park was in 1900 donated by the Earl of Derby. Close House and the grounds around it were formerly the home of the Bealey family, and were donated by the <a href="Bleachers%27%20Association">Bleachers' Association</a>. The town is also along the route of the <a href="Irwell%20Sculpture%20Trail">Irwell Sculpture Trail</a>.

Weight Gain 4000

"Weight Gain 4000" is the second episode of the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> of the American animated television series "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>". It first aired on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> in the United States on August 20, 1997. In the episode, the residents of South Park excitedly prepare for a visit by celebrity <a href="Kathie%20Lee%20Gifford">Kathie Lee Gifford</a>, whom the boys' third-grade teacher <a href="Mr.%20Garrison">Mr. Garrison</a> plans to assassinate because of a childhood grudge. In the meantime, <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a> becomes extremely obese after constantly eating a <a href="bodybuilding%20supplement">bodybuilding supplement</a> called Weight Gain 4000.

The episode was written and directed by series co-founders <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>. After the "South Park" pilot episode, "<a href="Cartman%20Gets%20an%20Anal%20Probe">Cartman Gets an Anal Probe</a>", drew poor test audience results, Comedy Central requested a script for one more new episode before deciding whether or not to commit to a full series. The resulting script for "Weight Gain 4000" helped the network decide to pick up the show. Although the second episode to be produced, it was originally broadcast as the third episode. It was also the first "South Park" episode created completely using computers rather than <a href="construction%20paper">construction paper</a>.

Although some reviewers criticized the episode for its profanity and other material deemed offensive at the time of its original broadcast, several others felt "Weight Gain 4000" was a significant improvement over the pilot, particularly for its satirical element regarding American <a href="consumerism">consumerism</a>. The episode introduced such recurring characters as <a href="Jimbo%20Kern">Jimbo Kern</a>, <a href="List%20of%20supporting%20characters%20on%20South%20Park%23Mayor%20McDaniels">Mayor McDaniels</a>, <a href="List%20of%20students%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Bebe%20Stevens">Bebe Stevens</a> and <a href="List%20of%20students%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Clyde%20Donovan">Clyde Donovan</a>. The show's portrayal of Kathie Lee Gifford was the first time a celebrity was spoofed in "South Park".

South Park Elementary teacher <a href="Mr.%20Garrison">Mr. Garrison</a> announces that <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a> has won the school's "Save Our Fragile Planet" essay contest, much to the anger of his classmate <a href="List%20of%20students%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Wendy%20Testaburger">Wendy Testaburger</a>, who immediately suspects him of cheating. The rest of the town becomes a flurry of excitement upon learning celebrity television host <a href="Kathie%20Lee%20Gifford">Kathie Lee Gifford</a> will come to South Park to present Cartman with an award on national television. <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Mayor%20McDaniels">Mayor McDaniels</a> plans a big event to showcase the town, with hopes of furthering her own career. Mr. Garrison directs rehearsals for a play with the schoolchildren depicting the history of South Park, which is to be shown at the event. Mayor McDaniels is horrified, however, to learn the historically accurate play includes children playing pioneers who attack and brutally beat the students portraying <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>. Garrison later gets fired for badmouthing Gifford.

Unbeknownst to the rest of town, Mr. Garrison relives a traumatic childhood memory in which a young Gifford defeated him in a national talent show. Mr. Garrison is manipulated by his hand puppet, <a href="Mr.%20Garrison%23Mr.%20Hat">Mr. Hat</a>, to assassinate Gifford out of revenge. He purchases a large rifle from <a href="List%20of%20South%20Park%20families%23Jimbo%20Kern">Jimbo</a>'s gun shop and plots to shoot Gifford. Meanwhile, Cartman is excited to appear on live television, and Mayor McDaniels instructs him to get into shape for Gifford's visit. Seeing a television commercial for a <a href="bodybuilding%20supplement">bodybuilding supplement</a> called "Weight Gain 4000", Cartman asks his mother to buy it for him. Cartman becomes extremely fat from the product, although he believes he is in excellent shape and the excess weight is strictly muscle. Back at the school, Wendy looks through Mr. Garrison's papers and confirms Cartman indeed cheated on the contest by writing his name on a copy of "<a href="Walden">Walden</a>" by <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a>. Wendy also learns about Mr. Garrison's assassination plan, and enlists the help of her friend <a href="Stan%20Marsh">Stan</a> to stop him.

Gifford arrives, and most of the town attends the celebratory event, where <a href="Chef%20%28South%20Park%29">Chef</a> sings a song to seduce her. Mr. Garrison takes his position in a tall book depository, but he is frustrated to see that Gifford is hidden behind a <a href="bulletproof%20glass">bulletproof glass</a> bubble. Wendy and Stan arrive and try unsuccessfully to stop Mr. Garrison, saying that they understand his pain, but when Stan accidentally reignites Garrison's anger, he decides to go through with the assassination. Just as he is about to fire, Cartman's new immense weight causes the stage to collapse, catapulting Gifford off it, and causing the bullet to hit <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a> in the head. Kenny is propelled through the air and impaled on a flagpole. Gifford's bodyguards whisk Gifford away, costing a disappointed Cartman his chance to be on television. Wendy takes to the stage and reveals that Cartman cheated on his essay, but the townspeople are too upset about Gifford's departure to care. Mr. Garrison is taken to a mental hospital, where Mr. Hat is placed into a <a href="straitjacket">straitjacket</a>. Mr. Garrison apologizes to the kids for costing the town a chance to be on television, although Kyle explains to him that Cartman is now appearing on talk show "<a href="Geraldo%20%28TV%20series%29">Geraldo</a>" because of his tremendous obesity. Meanwhile, Chef is lying in bed with Gifford post-coital while watching "Geraldo".

"Weight Gain 4000" was written and directed by series co-founders <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>. It was first aired on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> in the United States on August 27, 1997. The "South Park" pilot, "<a href="Cartman%20Gets%20an%20Anal%20Probe">Cartman Gets an Anal Probe</a>", did not do well with test audiences, and Comedy Central executives were unsure whether they wanted to order any additional episodes. However, they paid Parker and Stone to write another script when <a href="Internet">Internet</a> buzz began to generate about the duo and their work on "<a href="The%20Spirit%20of%20Christmas%20%28short%20film%29">The Spirit of Christmas</a>", the 1995 animated short film that served as a precursor to "South Park". The network opted not to commit to a full Comedy Central series until they could read the newly commissioned script. The result was "Weight Gain 4000", which the two "South Park" creators wrote while they were working on their 1997 comedy-action film, "<a href="Orgazmo">Orgazmo</a>".

In writing the script, the duo sought to give Comedy Central executives an idea of what the series would be like and how each show could differ from the others. Parker and Stone also said they would not write another script until the network signed off on the full show with a season of at least six episodes. Comedy Central liked the script and agreed to commit to a series. While "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" was created almost entirely with construction paper, "Weight Gain 4000" was the first "South Park" episode made completely using computers. It was created in little over a month in a studio in <a href="Westwood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Westwood</a>, <a href="California">California</a>, by about 15 animators using <a href="PowerAnimator">PowerAnimator</a>, the <a href="Alias%20Systems%20Corporation">Alias Systems Corporation</a> animation program most commonly known as "Alias", which would be used in subsequent episodes. In the future, "South Park" shows would be created within a week of their broadcast dates and require about 40 animators. "Weight Gain 4000" was animated in chronological order from beginning to end. Although Parker and Stone sought to improve the details and textures of the characters and overall animation, they also specifically chose Alias because it would allow the animation to maintain the show's deliberately crude visual style they first created with construction paper in "The Spirit of Christmas" and "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe".

The "South Park" creators and animators said they were still developing the characters and trying to figure out the future direction of the show with "Weight Gain 4000", which was more slow-paced than the series would eventually become. The 30-page script was shorter than in later episodes, which would average between 45 to 50 pages. The child protagonists also spoke slower. While recording their voice performances, the actors read the lines slowly and the dialogue was then sped up to create the characters' distinctive voices. At that time, Parker and Stone had not mastered the pace at which they needed to speak. The crowd shots in "Weight Gain 4000" took a particularly long time to animate due to the large number of people featured, and the animators were especially proud of the use of depth and motion in the perspective of the <a href="reticle">crosshairs</a> in Mr. Garrison's rifle scope as he tried to assassinate Kathie Lee Gifford. Mr. Garrison's hatred for Gifford was foreshadowed in "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", where the sentence "I'm not positive, but I think Cathy <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="sic">sic</a><nowiki>]</nowiki> Lee Gifford is much older than she claims to be", can be seen on his classroom's chalkboard. During a flashback scene in "Weight Gain 4000", an eight-year-old Mr. Garrison is shown to already be bald on top with gray hair on the side of his ears. This led to an inconsistency in the first season episode "<a href="Cartman%27s%20Mom%20is%20a%20Dirty%20Slut">Cartman's Mom is a Dirty Slut</a>", in which he has a full head of hair during a flashback.

Describing the general tone of the show, Teri Fitsell of "<a href="The%20New%20Zealand%20Herald">The New Zealand Herald</a>" explains that "South Park is a vicious social satire that works by spotlighting not the immorality of these kids but their amorality, and contrasting it with the conniving hypocrisy of the adults who surround them." The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real ... Don't people remember what they were like in third grade? We were little bastards."

Although these elements were established in "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe" and the "Spirit of Christmas" precursor cartoons, "Weight Gain 4000" further pushed the conventions of television, and especially of animated television entertainment. In addition to a continued stream of profanities and the promiscuous activities of Chef, an elementary school employee, the episode presents the character of Mr. Garrison as more and more unhinged. Although entrusted with the care of an elementary school class, Mr. Garrison demonstrates a questionable gender identity, poor teaching and unusual relationship with his Mr. Hat hand puppet.

"Weight Gain 4000" served as a commentary on American <a href="consumerism">consumerism</a>, the equation of personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions. This satire is particularly demonstrated by Cartman's blind faith in the Weight Gain 4000 bodybuilding supplement product despite strong evidence that the product fails at its primary function. Specifically, the product promises to build muscle, and Cartman believes it has fulfilled this function even after he only becomes extremely overweight. This blind faith is also illustrated by the complete disregard Cartman demonstrates for warnings that Weight Gain 4000 carries a risk of permanent damage to the liver and kidneys. The tremendous amount of product Cartman buys is further indicative of American purchasing habits.

Cartman's impulse to buy a bodybuilding supplement based on a single commercial has been described as a satire of the concept of "identity shopping". The concept involves the obtaining of an identity through what one owns, wears or buys, just as Cartman seeks to remake himself as a bodybuilder by buying Weight Gain 4000. "Weight Gain 4000" also satirizes the obsession with celebrity prevalent among most Americans, particularly through the town's overly enthusiastic reaction to Kathie Lee Gifford's appearance. Additionally, <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> theologian Paul F. M. Zahl has suggested Cartman's addiction to food in the episode, combined with his blind faith in the Weight Gain 4000 supplement and his insistence to "follow your dreams", reflects the idea that many people falsely cling to the notion of <a href="free%20will">free will</a> when they in fact lack any self-control whatsoever. Zahl wrote, "The two writers of "South Park" see through the myth of 'free will.'"

"Weight Gain 4000" introduced several characters who would maintain important recurring roles throughout the rest of the series. Among them were Jimbo Kern, Mayor McDaniels, and Wendy's best friend <a href="List%20of%20students%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Bebe%20Stevens">Bebe Stevens</a>. It also introduces <a href="List%20of%20students%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Clyde%20Donovan">Clyde Donovan</a>, a student from Mr. Garrison's class who would eventually play significant roles in future seasons, although he was not identified by name. The characters demonstrate the wide range of often-extreme personalities among the adult residents of "South Park", as well as serving as individual satires. McDaniels, who imagines herself an instant star upon being seen on television with Gifford, is portrayed as more caring about her own fame than the needs of her constituents, and the neglect with which Jimbo sells a gun to an obviously unstable Mr. Garrison serves as a satire of <a href="Gun%20politics%20in%20the%20United%20States">gun control</a>. Jimbo and his friend <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Ned%20Gerblansky">Ned</a> (who was not introduced until "<a href="Volcano%20%28South%20Park%29">Volcano</a>") were inspired by caricatures Parker used to draw during high school. In creating McDaniels, Parker and Stone envisioned a sophisticated mayor who was convinced she was better than the other residents of South Park. The episode also marked the first reference to "<a href="Jesus%20and%20Pals">Jesus and Pals</a>", the <a href="public-access%20television">public-access television</a> talk show hosted by <a href="Jesus%20%28South%20Park%29">Jesus Christ</a>. The fictional show is mentioned twice in the background during commercials on television sets, although footage from the show itself is not shown until "<a href="Big%20Gay%20Al%27s%20Big%20Gay%20Boat%20Ride">Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride</a>" later in the season. "Jesus and Pals", and the idea of Jesus as a South Park resident, are references to the original "The Spirit of Christmas" cartoon. <a href="Debbie%20Liebling">Debbie Liebling</a>, who served as a "South Park" producer at the time of the episode's broadcast, said the inclusion of a television show hosted by Jesus helped convey for audiences the idea of South Park as a place where "anything can happen".

Kathie Lee Gifford, then a <a href="television%20host">television host</a>ess on the morning talk show "<a href="Live%20with%20Regis%20and%20Kelly">Live with Regis and Kathie Lee</a>", was the first of many celebrities to be spoofed in a "South Park" episode. The "South Park" creators said they chose Gifford completely at random, not based on any particular reason or distaste for her. Shortly after "Weight Gain 4000" aired, the tabloid "<a href="The%20Globe%20%28tabloid%29">The Globe</a>" hired <a href="Suzen%20Johnson">Suzen Johnson</a> to film herself seducing <a href="Frank%20Gifford">Frank Gifford</a>, Kathie Lee's husband, for a newspaper story. The incident was the first of what Parker and Stone called the "South Park Curse", in which something tragic or embarrassing supposedly happens to a celebrity shortly before or after they were featured in "South Park". Actress <a href="Karri%20Turner">Karri Turner</a> provided the voice of Gifford in "Weight Gain 4000", marking her first and only guest appearance on "South Park". Gifford appears at a parade hidden inside a bulletproof glass bubble. The bubble was inspired by an appearance <a href="Pope">Pope</a> <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">John Paul II</a> made in the <a href="Popemobile">Popemobile</a> during a trip to <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, which was attended by Parker and Stone. They thought the design of the Popemobile, which has a bulletproof booth built into the back of a modified truck, was "hilarious". The design of the trophy that Gifford was to give to Cartman is a reference to Parker and Stone's 1997 film "Orgazmo".

The line "<a href="Beefcake">Beefcake</a>", which Eric Cartman enthusiastically screams after hearing it on a Weight Gain 4000 commercial, became a well-known catchphrase following the episode's broadcast, and clothing items with Cartman shouting the line became very popular. One of the earliest and largest "South Park" fan sites was called www.beef-cake.com. Matt Stone and site creator Taison Tan decided to shut the site down in April 2001 when the official site "South Park Studios" launched. "", a 1999 video game from developer <a href="Acclaim%20Entertainment">Acclaim</a>, included a mini-game called "Beefcake", in which players control a Cartman character who moves back and forth between the screen eating cans of Weight Gain 4000 that are thrown down at him. The salesmen from "Weight Gain 4000" are featured as antagonists in the mini-game. The "beefcake" commercial featured in the episode is also briefly seen in the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%203%29">third season</a> episode "<a href="Two%20Guys%20Naked%20in%20a%20Hot%20Tub">Two Guys Naked in a Hot Tub</a>", when Stan is quickly flipping through channels on his television.

When "Weight Gain 4000" was released, many writers in the mainstream media were still debating the longevity and overall quality of "South Park". With the series still in its earliest stages, the episode continued to shock many with its frequent use of profanities by children and the apparent instability of school teacher Mr. Garrison. Audiences were especially shocked by the violence depicted among children during a South Park history play, which included the use of guns and portrayed the bloody slaughter of Native Americans at the hands of white settlers. Audiences were also shocked and offended by Chef's sexually suggestive song about Gifford. Nevertheless, several reviewers declared "Weight Gain 4000" a significant improvement over the pilot, "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", and felt it went in a much more satirical direction.
Jeff Simon of "<a href="The%20Buffalo%20News">The Buffalo News</a>", who did not like "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", felt "Weight Gain 4000" proved the series could be funny. He specifically complimented the episode's commentary on American consumerism. Simon wrote, "It's all very bitter social satire, and if it weren't on Comedy Central, believe me, no one in networkland would think it ready for prime time. And you know what else? It's funny." Likewise, "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" critic <a href="Tom%20Shales">Tom Shales</a> strongly criticized "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", but said the second episode was funny and included "cleverly intertwined" plot-lines. Shales said, "[It] suggests the show may be an attempt at satire and not just poopy humor ... Yes, it's still sick and still twisted, but somehow this episode at least appears to have some comic ingenuity behind it, whereas the first was just a smutfest." In 2006, "Weight Gain 4000" was identified by "<a href="Winnipeg%20Free%20Press">Winnipeg Free Press</a>" as one of the ten most memorable "South Park" episodes, and ranked twelfth in a list of the top 25 greatest Cartman moments, as determined by voters on the Comedy Central website. The "<a href="Daily%20Record%20%28Scotland%29">Daily Record</a>" in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> listed the episode's ending, and the "Beefcake!" line, as one of the six most memorable moments in the series.

"Weight Gain 4000" was released, alongside five other episodes, in a three-<a href="VHS">VHS</a> set on May 5, 1998, marking the first time "South Park" was made available on video. It was released on the "Volume II" video, along with "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride"; other featured episodes included "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", "Volcano", "<a href="An%20Elephant%20Makes%20Love%20to%20a%20Pig">An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig</a>" and "<a href="Death%20%28South%20Park%29">Death</a>". "Weight Gain 4000", along with the other 12 episodes from the first season, was also included in the DVD release "South Park: The Complete First Season", which was released on November 12, 2002. Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode, but they were not included with the DVDs due to "standards" issues with some of the statements. They refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released in a CD separately from the DVDs. In 2008, the duo made "Weight Gain 4000" and all other "South Park" episodes available to watch for free on the show's official website, "South Park Studios".

Volcano (South Park)

"Volcano" is the third episode of the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> of the American animated television series "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>". It originally aired on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> in the United States on August 27, 1997. In the episode, <a href="Stan%20Marsh">Stan</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a>, <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a> and <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a> go on a hunting trip with Stan's uncle <a href="List%20of%20South%20Park%20families%23Jimbo%20Kern">Jimbo</a> and his war buddy <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Ned%20Gerblansky">Ned</a>. While on the trip, Stan is frustrated by his inability to shoot a living creature and Cartman tries to scare the hunting party with tales of a creature named Scuzzlebutt. Meanwhile, the group is unaware that a nearby volcano is about to erupt.

The episode was written by series co-creators <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>. It was inspired by the 1997 disaster films "<a href="Volcano%20%281997%20film%29">Volcano</a>" and "<a href="Dante%27s%20Peak">Dante's Peak</a>", both of which Parker and Stone strongly disliked. The plot was also based on the large amount of hunting Parker and Stone witnessed while growing up in Colorado; Stan's hesitation about the sport mirrors Parker's real-life feelings about hunting. "Volcano" was the third episode produced, but it was broadcast as the second. Parker and Stone felt the computer animation in "Volcano" had greatly improved compared to the early episodes; they were particularly pleased with the lava, which was made to resemble orange <a href="construction%20paper">construction paper</a>.

"Volcano" received generally positive reviews and was nominated for a 1997 <a href="Environmental%20Media%20Awards">Environmental Media Award</a>. Slightly more than 1 million viewers watched the original broadcast, according to <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>. The episode featured the first appearances of recurring characters Ned Gerblansky and <a href="Randy%20and%20Sharon%20Marsh">Randy Marsh</a>. The latter, who is also the town geologist, is established as Stan's father in later episodes. It also marked the first of two appearances for Scuzzlebutt, who became a popular minor character and appeared in the video games "" and "<a href="South%20Park%20Rally">South Park Rally</a>". The episode parodied the <a href="Duck%20and%20Cover">Duck and Cover</a> educational videos from the 1950s and 1960s that advised people to hide under tables in the event of a nuclear attack.

<a href="Stan%20Marsh">Stan</a>'s <a href="List%20of%20South%20Park%20families%23Jimbo%20Kern">Uncle Jimbo</a> and his <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> buddy <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Ned%20Gerblansky">Ned</a> take Stan, <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a>, and <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a> on a hunting trip in the mountains. As they arrive, Jimbo explains to the boys how to hunt. Whenever they see a creature, they shoot it after yelling, "It's coming right for us!", so they can claim the shooting was in self-defense. Stan does not have the proper temperament to enjoy hunting, and finds himself unable to shoot a living target. Unlike Stan, Kenny is able to shoot animals, impressing Jimbo. Meanwhile, South Park geologist <a href="List%20of%20South%20Park%20families%23Randy%20and%20Sharon%20Marsh">Randy</a> discovers that the mountain on which the boys are hunting is a volcano that is about to erupt. He reports his findings to the <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Mayor%20McDaniels">Mayor</a>, who directs one of her aides to make appropriate decisions about the crisis.

During the hunting trip, Jimbo proclaims Kenny his honorary nephew, upsetting Stan. When night falls, Cartman tells the story of Scuzzlebutt, a creature that has a piece of celery in place of one of its hands and <a href="Patrick%20Duffy">Patrick Duffy</a> for a leg. The boys are skeptical, so Cartman decides to dress up as the creature the next morning in order to convince and scare them. When he disappears the next morning, the others set out to find him. They then see Cartman disguised as Scuzzlebutt and start shooting at him. When they catch up with Cartman at the base of the mountain, Stan tries to shoot him in order to redeem himself in his uncle's eyes. However, he is unable to do so and the delay gives Cartman time to remove the costume. At a lower elevation, Randy orders the South Park residents to dig a trench to divert the lava away from the town.

Suddenly the volcano erupts. The hunters try to flee, but find themselves trapped on the other side of the trench. The real Scuzzlebutt then appears, and Jimbo apologizes to the boys for their seemingly imminent deaths, just before realizing that Scuzzlebutt is weaving a wicker basket to carry the hunting party to safety. The lava then flows through the trench just as Randy planned, but due to a miscalculation he made, the trench leads the lava to <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, destroying it. However, in a misguided attempt to prove he can kill something and impress his uncle, Stan kills Scuzzlebutt. Jimbo is less than impressed, telling Stan that "some things you do kill and some you don't". Ned states that he now understands the folly of guns and drops his rifle, which accidentally fires, killing Kenny. Stan does not understand, since Jimbo tried to kill Scuzzlebutt earlier and other animals and wanted to impress Jimbo like Kenny did, Jimbo points out that Kenny is dead and that Stan will always be Jimbo's nephew. Finally, the boys decide that hunting is stupid and confusing, thus decided to go home to watch cartoons.

"Volcano" was written and directed by series co-creators <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>. The episode was inspired by volcano-related <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> <a href="disaster%20films">disaster films</a>, such as "<a href="Dante%27s%20Peak">Dante's Peak</a>" (1997) and "<a href="Volcano%20%281997%20film%29">Volcano</a>" (1997), which came out around the time they were writing the script; Parker and Stone considered the films two of the worst ever made. Stone said, "If you watch this episode and then go watch "Volcano", this makes more sense than "Volcano" does." <a href="Debbie%20Liebling">Debbie Liebling</a>, who served as a "South Park" producer at the time of the episode's broadcast, said the volcano erupting in South Park helped establish the setting as a place where "anything can happen". Although Stone and Parker acknowledged that a volcano could not actually erupt in this Colorado town, they felt they were entitled to create the episode anyway because the "Volcano" film was set in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>; Stone said, "If they could do it, we could." Similarly, the duo acknowledge the tunnel built in the episode would not really divert the lava, but they included it because Parker said, "Any movie today, that's basically how dumb they are."

Another influence on the plot was the large amount of hunting Parker and Stone saw around them while growing up in Colorado. Neither of them were hunters, and Parker said Stan's hesitation about hunting was based largely on himself and his father, who hated the idea of killing an animal even though Parker's grandfather, like Jimbo, was enthusiastic about the sport. Parker said he feels many of the first-season episodes considered taboo in 1997 would have been considered less controversial five years later, but that "Volcano" is an exception. Since the episode involved children drinking beer and threatening each other at gunpoint during hunting trips, Parker said he did not believe Comedy Central would have aired it following the <a href="Columbine%20High%20School%20massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a> in 1999. Parker said, "Back then, it was just sort of funny, kids pointing guns at each other, and it's just not so funny now."

"South Park" animators spent the first four episodes of the show trying to perfect the animation of the characters. By "Volcano" – which was produced after "<a href="Weight%20Gain%204000">Weight Gain 4000</a>" –, Parker and Stone felt the textures were improved, as well as smaller details like the lines around the eyes of the characters. While the series pilot "<a href="Cartman%20Gets%20an%20Anal%20Probe">Cartman Gets an Anal Probe</a>" was animated with <a href="construction%20paper">construction paper</a>, subsequent episodes were made using computers. Nevertheless, Parker and Stone wanted the show to maintain its crude paper look; for example, they specifically asked for the night sky in this episode to look like a black piece of paper with holes cut into it for stars, just as it was in the pilot episode. Stone and Parker were especially proud of the animation of the lava, which they said took hours to perfect, although they acknowledged it ended up simply resembling orange construction paper. The lava ball shooting out of the volcano and almost killing Kenny was directly inspired by the "Volcano" film. Parker and Stone came up with the character of Scuzzlebutt during a random conversation with Comedy Central executive Debbie Liebling. While meeting with her, they simply started drawing the character, and decided to add a celery hand and Patrick Duffy leg for no particular reason. Scuzzlebutt also appeared in a second episode, "<a href="City%20on%20the%20Edge%20of%20Forever%20%28South%20Park%29">City on the Edge of Forever</a>" from the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%202%29">second season</a>. Scuzzlebutt turning out to be a real character rather than a ridiculous story was the first instance of a common characteristic of the Cartman character, in which Cartman says outrageous and completely unrealistic things that turn out to be true. Stone commented, "He's right more often than he's wrong."

The "Volcano" episode was in production when "South Park" debuted on August 13, 1997. Comedy Central executives did not object to most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in. A cat featured in the background of one of the outdoor scenes was designed to look exactly like Parker's cat, Jake. The scene in which Ned catches fire was based on an experience Parker had during a Colorado camping trip where he tried to do an "Indian Fire Trick", in which one pours gasoline onto a fire to create large flames. Although nobody caught fire, Parker said the trick misfired and he nearly burned down the forest. After finishing the episode, Parker and Stone realized "Volcano" was about two minutes shorter than the time length required for the episode. In order to add time to the episode, Parker and Stone added the scene with Ned singing the song "<a href="Kumbaya">Kumbaya</a>" around the fire, as well as the long freeze-frame on a shocked Chef and Mayor McDaniels reacting to the news of the volcano's imminent eruption.

In addition to Scuzzlebutt, "Volcano" included the first appearances of recurring characters Randy Marsh and Ned Gerblanski. In this first appearance, Randy is identified only as the South Park geologist, and it is only in the episode "<a href="An%20Elephant%20Makes%20Love%20to%20a%20Pig">An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig</a>" that he is first introduced as Stan's father. Parker, who provides the voice of Randy Marsh, said the design, voice, and personality of the character are based on his real-life father, who works as a geologist for the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a>. Parker said his father is very calm in real life and Randy's relaxed reaction to learning of the volcano—calmly sipping his coffee—is "about how my dad would react to anything". The look of the Ned character was based on a drawing Parker made in high school, although the character did not originally have a voice box. The voice was inspired by a waitress who worked at a <a href="Kentucky%20Fried%20Chicken">Kentucky Fried Chicken</a> restaurant in <a href="Boulder%2C%20Colorado">Boulder, Colorado</a>, where Parker and Stone would visit while attending the <a href="University%20of%20Colorado%20at%20Boulder">University of Colorado</a>. The duo said they would go to the restaurant just to hear her voice, but that it was so low they would lose their appetite when she took their orders. Stone and Parker had trouble creating the right voice for the character; they tried putting the microphone directly on their throat, and also bought an actual voice box, but ultimately decided that the best way to provide the character's voice was with natural voice simulation.

"Volcano" was released alongside five other episodes in a three-VHS set on May 5, 1998, marking the first time "South Park" was made available on video. The episode was released on the "Volume I" video along with "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"; other featured episodes included "<a href="An%20Elephant%20Makes%20Love%20to%20a%20Pig">An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig</a>", "<a href="Death%20%28South%20Park%29">Death</a>", "<a href="Weight%20Gain%204000">Weight Gain 4000</a>", and "<a href="Big%20Gay%20Al%27s%20Big%20Gay%20Boat%20Ride">Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride</a>". "South Park: The Complete First Season", a DVD box set featuring all thirteen episodes, including "Volcano", was released on November 12, 2002. Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode, but the tracks were not included on the DVDs due to "standards" issues with some of the statements; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released on a separate CD.

The episode features a fictional education film called "Lava and You", which says lava will pass harmlessly over potential victims who duck and cover their heads. The film was inspired by actual "<a href="Duck%20and%20Cover">Duck and Cover</a>" films from the 1950s and 1960s, in which children were instructed to hide under tables or lean against walls in the case of a <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a> attack; Parker and Stone, like many critics of the films, found the methods painfully simplistic and did not believe they would actually help in the case of such an attack. Jimbo and Ned are described as veterans of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, the military conflict between <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> and <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> that lasted from 1959 to 1975; Cartman, who is far too young to have participated in the war, claims to have flashbacks to his experiences in it. <a href="Patrick%20Duffy">Patrick Duffy</a>, the American television actor best known for his roles in the shows "<a href="Dallas%20%281978%20TV%20series%29">Dallas</a>" and "<a href="Step%20by%20Step%20%28TV%20series%29">Step by Step</a>", appears in the episode as the living leg of Scuzzlebutt. Matt Stone claimed there was no particular reason Duffy was chosen as the leg except that he is such a nondescript actor: "He's just super bland. Like, how could you possibly be a fan of Patrick Duffy?"

The scene where Scuzzlebutt puts a star on top of a tree is a reference to a similar scene in the 1964 television special "<a href="Rudolph%20the%20Red-Nosed%20Reindeer%20%28TV%20special%29">Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer</a>", in which the <a href="Yeti">Abominable Snow Monster</a> places a Christmas star atop a large tree. Mount Evanston, the fictional mountain in "Volcano", was named after the real <a href="Mount%20Evans">Mount Evans</a> in the <a href="Front%20Range">Front Range</a> region of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> in <a href="Clear%20Creek%20County%2C%20Colorado">Clear Creek County, Colorado</a>; Nichols Canyon in the episode was named after Kirt Nichols, a friend of Trey Parker. Jimbo blames the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> for passing overly restrictive laws on hunters and gun owners. Upon learning children are in danger due to the volcano, Mayor McDaniels seeks publicity for herself by contacting the television news programs "<a href="Entertainment%20Tonight">Entertainment Tonight</a>" and "<a href="Inside%20Edition">Inside Edition</a>".

Several lines of dialogue from "Volcano" became especially popular among "South Park" fans, including "It's coming right for us!" by Jimbo, and the two Cartman lines, "Democrats piss me off!" and "Cartoons Kick Ass!", the last of which was featured on T-shirts. Despite the relatively small role Scuzzlebutt played in the series, he nevertheless became a popular minor "South Park" character. He was included in the "South Park" video games "" and "<a href="South%20Park%20Rally">South Park Rally</a>". The song "Hot Lava", sung by the Chef in the episode, was featured on the 1998 soundtrack "".

"Volcano" originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on August 20, 1997. "Volcano", like the early "South Park" episodes preceding it, was viewed by slightly more than 1 million viewers, according to <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen ratings</a>. This was considered high for a <a href="Cable%20television%20in%20the%20United%20States">cable program</a> in the United States at the time. The <a href="Environmental%20Media%20Association">Environmental Media Association</a> nominated the episode for an <a href="Environmental%20Media%20Award">Environmental Media Award</a> in the "TV Episodic Comedy" category. However, the eventual recipient of the award was "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>", for the episode "<a href="The%20Old%20Man%20and%20the%20Lisa">The Old Man and the Lisa</a>".

"Volcano" received generally positive reviews. "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" critic Matt Roush praised the episode, especially the "Duck and Cover" films. "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">The Advertiser</a>" called the episode "outrageously lewd" and "hysterically funny". "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" critic <a href="Tom%20Shales">Tom Shales</a> considered the episode funnier than its precedent "Weight Gain 4000". Peter Hawes of "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Star-Times">The Sunday Star-Times</a>" in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, said the episode was funny and intelligent. He said of the episode, "Once again, the US national psyche is imperishably captured by a crude cartoon." He liked the way adults were portrayed as less sensible than the children, and he particularly enjoyed the "Duck and Cover" videos: "It is terrifyingly funny, for it is a word-for-word recreation of the insane Atom-bomb Safety film, created and distributed in 1952 by the US government, who never for a second thought it would work." The "<a href="Daily%20Record%20%28Scotland%29">Daily Record</a>" of <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, praised the episode and described it as "hardcore humour": "Love it or loathe it, you can't ignore the adult animation series whose bite is worse than its bark."

Damien (South Park)

"Damien" is the tenth episode of the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> of the American animated television series "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>". It originally aired on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> in the United States on February 4, 1998. In the episode, the boys' class is joined by a new student named <a href="List%20of%20students%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Others">Damien</a>, who has been sent by his father <a href="Satan%20%28South%20Park%29">Satan</a> to find <a href="Jesus%20%28South%20Park%29">Jesus</a> and arrange a boxing match between the two. The majority of South Park's residents bet on Satan to win the match due to his enormous size and muscular physique, but Satan ultimately throws the fight and reveals he bet on Jesus, thus winning everybody's money.

The episode was written by series co-creators <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>, with additional dialogue by <a href="Dave%20Polsky">Dave Polsky</a>, and directed by Parker. The episode serves as a satire on religion, faith and the nature of good and evil, as well as a commentary on <a href="commercialism">commercialism</a>, the <a href="Famous%20for%20being%20famous">cult of celebrity</a> in America and the nature of children. It was originally conceptualized as a <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> special, but the original broadcast was pushed forward when Parker and Stone decided instead to make "<a href="Mr.%20Hankey%2C%20the%20Christmas%20Poo">Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo</a>" the season's holiday episode.

"Damien" received generally positive reviews and was viewed by 3.2 million households when it was first broadcast, making it the highest rated cable program the week it aired. The episode marked the first appearance of Satan, who would become a recurring "South Park" character, as well as the character of Damien himself, who was inspired by the antagonist of the 1976 horror film "<a href="The%20Omen">The Omen</a>". Parker and Stone also said the episode introduced several key characteristics of the <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a> character that have endured throughout the rest of the series. <a href="Michael%20Buffer">Michael Buffer</a>, the boxing ring announcer best known for the catchphrase "<a href="Let%27s%20get%20ready%20to%20rumble%21">Let's get ready to rumble!</a>", makes a guest appearance as himself.

<a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a> is excited about his upcoming birthday party and lets everyone invited know what present he expects to receive from each. When they protest, he threatens to ban them from eating the food his mother makes, something that immediately convinces them. They encounter a new student named <a href="Damien%20%28South%20Park%20character%29">Damien</a>, son of <a href="Satan">Satan</a>. The other boys mock the "new kid" and, in response, Damien turns <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a> into a <a href="platypus">duck-billed platypus</a>. Damien informs <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> that Satan will rise for a final battle with him of good versus evil. South Park residents immediately begin making bets on the fight. Cartman is angered to learn the event is scheduled for the same time as his party, and the children struggle to choose between the two events.

The entire town bets on Jesus to win the fight, but begin to lose faith when Satan appears for the weigh-in. He is huge and weighs a little over , while Jesus weighs a mere , and the citizens of South Park begin changing their bets. Jesus confronts the South Park residents about their changed betting slips after learning only one person is still betting on Jesus to win. Distraught, Jesus asks <a href="Stan%20Marsh">Stan</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a> and <a href="Chef%20%28South%20Park%29">Chef</a> to help him train. Damien gets counseling from <a href="Mr.%20Mackey">Mr. Mackey</a>, who recommends he just try being nice no matter what the other kids do, just like with unpopular British child <a href="List%20of%20students%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Pip%20Pirrup">Pip</a>. Damien tries to apologize to the boys for setting fire to the playground and turning Kenny into a duck-billed platypus, stating that he was "doing his father's bidding" and he did not have a choice. The boys, however, still continue to act negatively towards Damien. Cartman's birthday party begins, as does the fight. Damien and Pip arrive uninvited to the party, but the kids finally accept Damien after he hurls Pip in the air and makes him explode in a shower of fireworks. However, a furious Cartman ends his party early after opening Kyle's present to discover that it's not what he had in mind.

Meanwhile, Jesus is disheartened by the town's lack of faith in him, and he does not retaliate to Satan's attacks against him, despite Satan's apparent taunting of "hit me". Chef and the kids make it for the end of the fight and offer Jesus some words of encouragement. Inspired, Jesus finally throws a single weak punch. However, Satan then takes a dive and goes down for the count. Afterward, Satan reveals that his plan had, in fact, been to bet on Jesus and then throw the fight, winning him a lot of money and real estate from the South Park residents. The townspeople are angered by this, until Stan reminds them that Jesus told them not to bet on Satan. The whole town then asks forgiveness of Jesus, who accepts the apology. Kenny dies when <a href="Jimbo%20Kern">Jimbo</a> identifies him as a rare duck-billed platypus and shoots him. Damien bids goodbye to Stan and Kyle since his dad "is always on the move" he has to leave. Meanwhile, Cartman has continued his party even after kicking everyone out and having eaten all the food himself.

"Damien" was written by series co-creators <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a> and <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>, with additional dialogue by <a href="Dave%20Polsky">Dave Polsky</a>, and was directed by Parker. "Damien" first aired on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> in the United States on February 4, 1998. It was highly anticipated in part because it was the first new episode of "South Park" in about two months, since the extremely popular <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> special "<a href="Mr.%20Hankey%2C%20the%20Christmas%20Poo">Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo</a>" aired on December 17, 1997. Before "Damien" even ran, Mike Duffy of "<a href="Detroit%20Free%20Press">Detroit Free Press</a>" said the episode was "certain to become one of the show's signature moments". In fact, Parker and Stone originally intended for "Damien" to be the season's Christmas episode. Although they had long planned to feature a talking piece of feces in the show, called Mr. Hankey, they did not decide to make him a Christmas character until halfway through the filming of "Damien", during which time they decided to make a separate holiday episode instead, centered around the Mr. Hankey character. Nevertheless, they decided to finish production of "Damien" first, even though it would not air until after the "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo" episode.

Parker said he and Stone did not intend for "Damien" to be offensive to Christians or any other religion: "In "South Park", Jesus is a great guy, he's on our show, and in this episode he's the hero. We're not in the business of offending people. We're in the business of making people laugh." The mean way Damien is treated by his fellow students when he joins the school, as well as Damien's reactions to the treatment, were inspired by Parker's experience of the second grade, when he started at a <a href="Cheyenne%2C%20Wyoming">Cheyenne, Wyoming</a> elementary school in the last three weeks of the school year. Parker said, "It was brutal ... Everybody already had their little groups and the year was almost over, so I wasn't going to fit into any of them, and I just wanted to destroy and kill, which was the inspiration for this show."

<a href="Michael%20Buffer">Michael Buffer</a>, the boxing ring announcer best known for his catchphrase, "<a href="Let%27s%20get%20ready%20to%20rumble%21">Let's get ready to rumble!</a>", made a guest appearance as himself in "Damien". Parker and Stone originally planned to use the catchphrase without Buffer, but when they learned that Buffer had legally trademarked the phrase, they included him in the episode since getting the rights for the catchphrase cost nearly as much as hiring Buffer for a guest appearance. Parker and Stone both said Buffer was friendly and they enjoyed working with him. Voice actor <a href="Mike%20Judge">Mike Judge</a>, star of "<a href="Beavis%20and%20Butt-Head">Beavis and Butt-Head</a>" and "<a href="King%20of%20the%20Hill">King of the Hill</a>", had originally been slated to provide the voice of the Damien character, and even recorded several lines for the part. However, since Judge lives in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>, it proved too difficult to for him to come back and rerecord lines as the script and episode changed, so Stone instead provided the character's voice. Judge later provided Kenny's un-muffled line when he removed his parka in "".

By the time "Damien" was animated, much of the drawing and animation responsibilities that had previously been handled by Parker and Stone were now being delegated to a team of animators. The duo were particularly proud of the animation during the boxing match between Jesus and Satan, which used elements of perspective and three-dimension seldom used in the series before; Parker said it was "definitely the most action [oriented] stuff we'd done [so far]". While animating Jesus, Parker and Stone deliberately left glitches in the animation that made it appear skin was showing beneath the beard on the left-hand side of the character's face. Parker said this was done because it was the way Jesus appeared in the crudely animated "<a href="The%20Spirit%20of%20Christmas%20%28short%20film%29">The Spirit of Christmas</a>", a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone that served as a precursor to "South Park", and they wanted to maintain that nuance for the character.

Parker and Stone said a number of Cartman's characteristics which have endured throughout the "South Park" series started in "Damien". Specifically, his voice took on a higher-pitch that was more nasally and whiney than in previous episodes; Stone described it as a "self-indulgent accent". Some of his regular vocal mannerisms were also developed in the episode, including his use of the sound "Nyah" while saying the word "Here", and the way he says "Hey you guuuuuuys" while talking to his friends. Parker, who provides the voice of Cartman, said the characteristics came about naturally while filming the episode: "This show for some reason, for whatever reason, maybe I just lost interest, but I was trying all these messed up things with him and all these things sort of stuck."

"Damien" included the first appearance of Satan, who would become a commonly recurring character throughout the series. Although Satan displays an evil and unscrupulous personality in "Damien", he is portrayed in later episodes as a thoughtful, sensitive and often deeply conflicted character. "Damien" was the first episode Parker and Stone wrote that included school counselor Mr. Mackey and local religious leader Priest Maxi, but they were also included in "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", which aired before "Damien" even though it was produced afterward. Although Jesus had been introduced as a "South Park" character in previous episodes, "Damien" marked the first time he interacted with the main characters outside of his public access talk show, "<a href="Jesus%20and%20Pals">Jesus and Pals</a>". Parker said many viewers thought the character was a crazy person who falsely believed he was Jesus, and he and Stone wanted to show in this episode that he was supposed to be the actual Jesus. "Damien" is also the first episode to feature South Park's bar, which is simply called "Bar".

Prior to the broadcast, Parker and Stone said "Damien" would be the first episode in which Kenny would not be killed; ultimately, however, Kenny was shot by Jimbo at the end of the pay-per-view fight. Kenny is turned into a duck-billed platypus in the episode, which Parker said was done because, "Duck billed platypuses are something I've always been infatuated with. They're just so bizarre." In the original script, Pip, the unpopular British student inspired by the character of the same name in <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' "<a href="Great%20Expectations">Great Expectations</a>", was originally supposed to be killed and permanently removed from the show after "Damien", in which Damien projects Pip into the air and blows him up in a shower of fireworks. However, Parker and Stone decided they should not kill any student characters except for Kenny, so they decided not to kill Pip and to bring him back for future episodes.

"Damien" was later released, along with eleven other episodes, in a three-<a href="DVD">DVD</a> set in November 1998. It was included in the second volume, which also included the episodes "<a href="An%20Elephant%20Makes%20Love%20to%20a%20Pig">An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig</a>", "<a href="Death%20%28South%20Park%29">Death</a>" and "<a href="Pinkeye%20%28South%20Park%29">Pinkeye</a>". The episode, along with the other twelve from the first season, was also included in the DVD release "South Park: The Complete First Season", which was released on November 12, 2002. Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode, but they were not included with the DVDs due to "standards" issues with some of the statements; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released in a CD completely separately from the DVDs.

"Damien" has been described as a satire on religion, faith and the nature of good and evil, as well as a commentary on <a href="commercialism">commercialism</a> and the <a href="cult%20of%20celebrity">cult of celebrity</a> in American culture. Parker said the writers sought to satirize the speed and ease at which the followers of Jesus lose faith in him and bet against him. Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the abandonment of Jesus demonstrates, "Like many people in the real world, the faith of the town's people cannot withstand the hard times." Parker said, "Everybody puts their trust in Satan and ends up getting screwed. There is a bigger message – all in all, a pretty wholesome message. That's why South Park works. Sometimes we have a message."

Parker also said he and Stone purposely wrote the episode to present Jesus as the hero from a "<a href="humanism">humanist</a> approach"; Clasquin said this is demonstrated by the fact that Jesus becomes caught up in people's expectations for the fight and becomes offended when people bet against him: "This satirical gesture beautifully draws attention to the sheer humanity of Jesus. He really is a man, just as we are men and women. He is open to fear and uncertainty." Several writers said the episode also lampooned the way Americans can turn anything, even a religious situation, into a commercially hyped event. <a href="Matt%20Zoller%20Seitz">Matt Zoller Seitz</a> of "<a href="The%20Star-Ledger">The Star-Ledger</a>" said: "They aren't making fun of organized religion (though they have in the past). They're making fun of those who would turn religion into entertainment and entertainment into a kind of religion." Seitz said the episode mocks "morality cops who misbehave in private" like <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20South%20Park%20characters%23Father%20Maxi">Priest Maxi</a>, who secretly bets the parish against Jesus even as he admonished congregation members for siding with Satan.

Religious writer Michel Clasquin said the episode also demonstrates the ease with which people blend their religious convictions with lessons from pop culture, particularly with Stan's confusion of a "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" quote with a lesson from Jesus Christ. Additionally, Clasquin said the fact that even Priest Maxi recognizes Jesus as "that guy from the public access show" demonstrates that even the supposedly most religious people are not always the most open to genuine religious experiences. Clasquin also said elements of the <a href="Crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">Crucifixion of Jesus</a> are alluded to in the boxing match with Satan.

In addition to the religious themes, the cruel way in which Damien is treated by the other children is a satire on the tendency of schoolchildren to relentlessly pick on new students. Stone said of this aspect of the episode, "The whole basis of "South Park" was that kids are little shitheads and civilization and society controls them. Instead of what a lot of hippies and <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> think, which is we're born innocent and pure and society corrupts us. We believe the first way, that society controls you and makes you a better person, ultimately, because when you're little, you're just a little asshole."

The voice for Satan, provided by Parker, was inspired by the voice of the <a href="Pinhead%20%28Hellraiser%29">Pinhead</a> character at the ending of the 1988 horror film, "", when Pinhead emotionally recalls his old life, when he was a good person. The animators went through several sketch drafts for Satan because, in Parker's words, "There's so many ways to go with him and we couldn't figure out the right one for a long time". The large and muscular look of the character stemmed from the fact that the script called for Satan to massively outweigh Jesus, and that look has persisted for the character throughout the rest of the series.

The character of Damien himself was also first featured in this episode; although he appeared as a background character in a handful of future episodes, he seldom has a speaking role and is never again featured as prominently as he was in "Damien". The character was inspired by <a href="Damien%20Thorn">Damien Thorn</a>, the child <a href="antichrist">antichrist</a> character in the 1976 horror film "<a href="The%20Omen">The Omen</a>". The music which plays in the episode whenever Damien performs magic is also directly inspired by the music from that film; that same demonic chorus would later be reused in the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%2012%29">twelfth season</a> episode "<a href="Britney%27s%20New%20Look">Britney's New Look</a>". (The lyric "Rectus Dominus" repeatedly sung by the demonic chorus in the episode translates from Latin as "Ass Master".) The scene in which the boys tell Damien his mom is "a real dog" is also a reference to "The Omen". In that film, the actual Antichrist's mother was a jackal.
In addition to Michael Buffer, the American boxing promoter <a href="Don%20King%20%28boxing%20promoter%29">Don King</a> is featured prominently in "Damien" as Satan's promoter. Parker said he and Stone decided to spoof King only because "it's just sort of who annoyed us that week. It's so random ... there is no point to who we're ripping on. It's definitely nothing personal." <a href="Nancy%20Kerrigan">Nancy Kerrigan</a>, the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic</a> <a href="figure%20skating">figure skater</a> attacked on orders of fellow skater <a href="Tonya%20Harding">Tonya Harding</a> at the <a href="1994%20Winter%20Olympics">1994 Winter Olympics</a>, is referred to in a pep talk Stan gives Jesus. Stan wrongfully claims Kerrigan won the <a href="gold%20medal">gold medal</a> until Kyle reminds him she won the <a href="silver%20medal">silver</a>; Parker said this was done because he felt the perception of Kerrigan was extremely high among Americans considering she only actually achieved second place. During that same pep talk, Stan tells Jesus, "You know, someone once said, 'Don't try to be a great man, just be a man.'" Although Stan says this was a quote from Jesus himself, it was actually a line from the 1996 film, "". "Damien" also includes a reference to singer <a href="Nancy%20Sinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a>, the daughter of legendary crooner <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>. Mr. Garrison, while discussing great singers of the <a href="baroque">baroque</a> period, goes on to say that "Nancy Sinatra was quite a choice piece of ass".

The Jesus Vs. Satan pay-per-view event "Boutin' at the Mountain" is a parody of similarly advertised pay-to-watch boxing events featured on the premium cable channel <a href="HBO">HBO</a>. Before Jimbo shoots Kenny in his platypus state, he screams, "It's coming right for us!" This is a reference to the previous "South Park" episode "<a href="Volcano%20%28South%20Park%29">Volcano</a>", in which Jimbo takes the children hunting and tells them to shout the phrase before shooting anything to get around restrictive hunting laws. Cartman insults Damien by asking if he got his haircut from <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, a blind soul and R&B singer. For his birthday, Cartman wants the complete line of a set of action figures called Mega Man. Although named <a href="Mega%20Man">Mega Man</a>, the multi-colored figures were actually inspired by the <a href="Mighty%20Morphin%20Power%20Rangers">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</a>, the 1993 children's action series which was still popular at the time of the episode's original broadcast. The script was originally written with direct references to the Power Rangers, but Comedy Central asked Parker and Stone to change the name due to copyright issues. Cartman receives "<a href="Ants%20in%20the%20Pants">Ants in the Pants</a>", an actual children's tabletop game, as a birthday present. Stone described "Ants in the Pants" as "the lamest game ever", which is why Cartman responds so negatively to the gift in the episode.

"Damien" received a 6.4 <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a>, a record high for the show until it was broken two weeks later by the episode "<a href="Mecha-Streisand">Mecha-Streisand</a>" (which received a 6.9 rating, translating to 5.4 million viewers in 3.2 million households). It was the highest rated cable program the week it aired, with viewership among 18- to 49-year-olds being higher than the number of households. The network averages viewer ratings of 276,000 households during prime time and, prior to "South Park", the channel's highest rating was from the second-season premiere of "<a href="Absolutely%20Fabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a>", which was seen by 1.24 million households.

Parker said following the tremendous success of "Mr Hankey, the Christmas Poo", much of the direct feedback he received for "Damien" was negative. Parker described it as the "first sort of backlash" he had experienced with "South Park", with fans claiming the show was losing its edge and that Parker and Stone had "sold out". Parker said, "We kept hearing that word so much. We were like, 'What does that mean, sold out? What did we get and what did we do?' We just kept doing what we thought was funny, we didn't go start making commercials or anything. But everybody was saying we sold out." Nevertheless, the episode received generally positive reviews, and has been described as one of "South Park" "classic episodes".

"<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" contributor Doug Pratt called it a "high point" of the first season. Kinney Littlefield of the "<a href="Orange%20County%20Register">Orange County Register</a>" said of the episode, "All this proves once again that animated series are great platforms for hot topics that live action shows don't dare grab head on. "South Park" allegory of good and evil is more apt and knowing than anything seen on <nowiki>'</nowiki>"<a href="Christy%20%28TV%20series%29">Christy</a>" or <nowiki>'</nowiki>"<a href="Touched%20by%20an%20Angel">Touched by an Angel</a>". Funnier too." However, Littlefield also said some of the show's graphic dialogue, like the phrase "poop on a stick", was growing "pretty darn redundant". Gary Budzak of "<a href="The%20Columbus%20Dispatch">The Columbus Dispatch</a>" described the "Damien" episode as perhaps "the most outrageous yet". Virginia Rohan of "<a href="The%20Record%20%28Bergen%20County%29">The Record</a>" praised the episode, saying, "The episode is funny, and ultimately, good does conquer evil, albeit for all the wrong reasons." "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" writer Lon Grahnke gave the episode three stars and called it simultaneously strange and funny. Eric Mink of the "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">New York Daily News</a>" called the episode "awfully funny" and praised its satirical element, although he warned it was potentially very offensive to some viewers: "A scene in which the kids offer profane between-rounds encouragement to Jesus could make even thick-skinned viewers wince a bit." Likewise, "Star-Ledger" reporter Matt Zoller Seitz said, "Tonight's episode is crazy, vulgar and borderline blasphemous; it is also, if you're in the right frame of mind, paralyzingly funny."

Starvin' Marvin

"Starvin' Marvin" is the eighth episode of the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%201%29">first season</a> of the American animated television series "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>". It first aired on <a href="Comedy%20Central">Comedy Central</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> on November 19, 1997. In the episode, <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a>, <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a>, <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a> and <a href="Stan%20Marsh">Stan</a> send money to an African charity hoping to get a sports watch, but are instead sent an Ethiopian child whom they dub "Starvin' Marvin". Later, Cartman is accidentally sent to Ethiopia, where he learns activist <a href="Sally%20Struthers">Sally Struthers</a> is hoarding the charity's food for herself. In an accompanying subplot, after genetically engineered turkeys attack South Park residents, <a href="Chef%20%28South%20Park%29">Chef</a> rallies the residents to fight back, in a parody of the film "<a href="Braveheart">Braveheart</a>".

The episode was written and directed by series co-creator <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a>. "Starvin' Marvin" was the first "South Park" <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a>-themed episode. The episode simultaneously served as a satire on American indifference toward impoverished countries and the humanitarianism industry.

The episode received generally positive reviews and several commentators have described it as a classic "South Park" episode. According to <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen Media Research</a>, it was viewed by about 2.2 million households during its original broadcast, which at the time was roughly eight times Comedy Central's average viewership. Parker and Stone said they were unhappy with the turkey <a href="subplot">subplot</a>, which they wrote only because they felt obligated to include a B story. Sally Struthers was reportedly deeply offended by her portrayal in the episode. In addition to Starvin' Marvin, who became a popular minor character, the episode introduced regular characters Kyle's father <a href="Gerald%20Broflovski">Gerald Broflovski</a> and Kenny's family members <a href="Stuart%20and%20Carol%20McCormick">Stuart, Carol</a> and <a href="List%20of%20South%20Park%20families%23Kevin%20McCormick">Kevin McCormick</a>.

After seeing a commercial about starving children in <a href="Africa">Africa</a>, <a href="Eric%20Cartman">Cartman</a>, <a href="Stan%20Marsh">Stan</a>, <a href="Kenny%20McCormick">Kenny</a> and <a href="Kyle%20Broflovski">Kyle</a> send money to <a href="Sally%20Struthers">Sally Struthers</a>' charity organization, the <a href="Christian%20Children%27s%20Fund">Christian Children's Fund</a>. They do not care about the cause, but want the free sports watch that comes with the sponsorship. However, due to a miscommunication, an Ethiopian boy is delivered to the boys instead of the watch. Although initially shocked, the four boys befriend him, and Cartman names the boy Starvin' Marvin ("Marvin" being given to him by the apparent pronunciation of his name when he was talking in his native language). Meanwhile, mobs of <a href="wild%20turkey">wild turkey</a>s begin attacking and killing South Park residents. Mad scientist <a href="List%20of%20recurring%20characters%20in%20South%20Park%23Dr.%20Alphonse%20Mephesto%20and%20Kevin">Dr. Mephisto</a> tries to warn <a href="List%20of%20South%20Park%20residents%23Mayor%20McDaniels">Mayor McDaniels</a> that genetically engineered turkeys he had been breeding to feed to the poor have gone crazy and are now attacking humans. Mephisto is instead ignored and ridiculed by McDaniels.

The boys take Marvin to an all-you-can-eat buffet, where he is shocked by how much food the townsfolk consume compared to his home country, and by how wasteful Cartman is with his food. Back at school, <a href="Mr.%20Garrison">Mr. Garrison</a> announces the food drive is a failure because students have brought in only a few cans of creamed corn. The boys present Marvin to the class during <a href="Show%20and%20tell%20%28education%29">show and tell</a>, after which Mr. Garrison and <a href="List%20of%20staff%20at%20South%20Park%20Elementary%23Principal%20Victoria">Principal Victoria</a> tell the boys they will have to call <a href="International%20Committee%20of%20the%20Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> and send Marvin home. Meanwhile, Dr. Mephisto shows Chef that the turkey <a href="DNA">DNA</a> is growing so rapidly that the turkeys might take over the world if they are not stopped.

The <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> arrives to take Marvin back to Ethiopia, but Marvin tricks them into taking Cartman instead. Cartman, who had previously cared little for the impoverished in Africa, is unable to bear the lack of food and poor living conditions there; furthermore, he attempts to convince the Red Cross there that he's not one of the Africans, but fails. While praying to God in <a href="Addis%20Ababa">Addis Ababa</a>, Cartman says he is sorry he made fun of poor people. He eventually finds a Red Cross shack, where Sally Struthers is hoarding all the food meant for charity. After a brief argument, Cartman exposes all of Struthers's hoarding of the food supply to the Ethiopians, who then take control of the food supply.

Back in South Park, Chef rallies the townspeople (in a parody of "<a href="Braveheart">Braveheart</a>") to fight the genetically engineered turkeys; in response, one of the turkeys also rallies the other turkeys to fight the townspeople. A massive battle ensues in which Kenny is killed (his eye is poked and gouged out), but eventually the South Park residents kill all the turkeys and claim victory. The FBI returns Cartman to South Park and takes Marvin home, but not before he brings the bodies of the dead turkeys back to Ethiopia for everyone to eat. Marvin is then hailed as a hero by his people while they pass Struthers being bound and gagged over a fire.

In the end, back in South Park, Kenny's family give their Thanksgiving blessings as they prepare to eat a can of green beans, but realize afterward that they do not have a can opener.

"Starvin' Marvin" was written by <a href="Trey%20Parker">Trey Parker</a>, <a href="Matt%20Stone">Matt Stone</a>, and <a href="Pam%20Brady">Pam Brady</a>. Directed by Parker, it was the first official "South Park" <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a> episode. Parker and Stone said "Starvin' Marvin", like other holiday episodes, proved difficult to make because they felt a responsibility to constantly top other previous holiday shows. Stone provided the voice of Marvin. According to the official "South Park" website, the character was not named after the <a href="Starvin%27%20Marvin%27s">Starvin' Marvin's</a> brand of American gas stations, and that the similarity between the two names is just a coincidence. <a href="Jerry%20Seinfeld">Jerry Seinfeld</a>, comedian and star of the popular sitcom "<a href="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>", contacted Parker and Stone and asked if he could record a guest voice performance because he was a fan of the show. Parker and Stone offered Seinfeld the throwaway background part of one of the turkeys, but Seinfeld was "a bit put off" by the offer and did not accept.

The episode was partially inspired by the commercials for the <a href="Christian%20Children%27s%20Fund">Christian Children's Fund</a>, in which Sally Struthers encourages viewers to donate money to provide food for starving children in Africa. Parker said he did not really believe Struthers was hoarding food from the charity, but he came up with the concept because he found it funny that such an obese woman would make a public plea for food for others. Parker said he had always wondered how a starving African child would react if they were taken to a large buffet dinner at an American restaurant, with "people leaving tons of food on their plates", which served as further inspiration for the episode. Parker and Stone originally planned for Struthers to die at the end of the episode and have the African children eat her and live off her fat; Comedy Central executives told the duo they could not kill Struthers, although celebrities have been killed off in subsequent episodes without any objections from the network.

Parker and Stone were unhappy with the turkey attack subplot, which they felt "never really went anywhere" and ended abruptly without any satisfying conclusion. They nevertheless included it because they felt obligated to include a <a href="subplot">B story</a>, since every episode in the season so far had included one. Later in the series, they said they realized this was not necessary and made many episodes without a B story. Although the duo liked the "payoff" of the Starvin' Marvin main plot, they did not know how to end the turkey subplot, so they simply had the characters kill all the turkeys and claim that there were none left; they decided this sudden ending was the funniest possible option. Stone said of the subplot, "The turkeys were just an excuse to have the "<a href="Braveheart">Braveheart</a>" sequence." The animators enjoyed creating the turkey battle scene, which was designed to be shown in <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> aspect ratio while the rest of the episode was animated normally. However, the animation proved to be very difficult and took a long time to do because it involved a larger number of characters and animals in one scene than had ever been featured previously in the show. Some of the characters in the far background were animated in a gray and shadowyy style, which Parker said was not so much a visual effect as it was a "lighting effect meaning we didn't want to draw all these people".

In addition to Starvin' Marvin himself, the episode included the first appearances of several regular characters: Kyle's father <a href="Gerald%20Broflovski">Gerald Broflovski</a>, as well as <a href="Stuart%20and%20Carol%20McCormick">Stuart, Carol</a>, and <a href="List%20of%20South%20Park%20families%23Kevin%20McCormick">Kevin McCormick</a>, father, mother, and brother (respectively) of Kenny, who were portrayed as incredibly poor and unhygienic. In a <a href="continuity%20error">continuity error</a>, the couple killed by the turkeys at Stark's Pond can be seen alive and unharmed during the turkey battle scene.

Psychologists Gilbert Reyes and Gerard Jacobs have cited "Starvin' Marvin" as one example of popular culture voicing criticisms of <a href="humanitarianism">humanitarianism</a> "as an overblown industry leeching off others' suffering and harming its purported beneficiaries". The episode also highlights America's <a href="consumerism">consumerist</a> society and American indifference toward impoverished countries. The moral of the episode, explained by Stan in the final scene, encourages viewers to see suffering citizens of impoverished countries as real people, rather than images on television screens, which tend to make the viewers feel detached and alienated from them.

"Starvin' Marvin" explores and satirizes <a href="gluttony">gluttony</a> in the US, particularly through its unflattering portrayal of Sally Struthers, who gorges on donated food meant for starving children. The greed and wastefulness shown in the buffet scene, as well as Cartman's overall greediness and lack of understanding regarding the plight of starving African children, has been said to demonstrate an over-abundance and decadence typically associated with Americans. The destructive rampage of the turkeys provides a commentary on <a href="genetic%20engineering">genetic engineering</a>. Scott Calef, a philosophy professor who studies popular culture, said the destruction caused by the turkeys, despite the best of intentions by Dr. Mephisto, are indicative of the unpredictable nature and ethical ambiguity of the use of genetic engineering for the betterment of humankind.

Starvin' Marvin proved to be a popular minor character, even though he would appear in only one more episode, the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%203%29">third season</a> episode "<a href="Starvin%27%20Marvin%20in%20Space">Starvin' Marvin in Space</a>". The character was later featured in "<a href="South%20Park%20Rally">South Park Rally</a>", a 2000 racing video game from developer <a href="Acclaim%20Entertainment">Acclaim</a>, in which Marvin races the other characters in a motorized wheat sack. Marvin is also featured in "", a <a href="platform%20game">platform</a> <a href="mobile%20game">mobile game</a> featuring a number of "South Park" characters. Eric Cartman's line, "That's a bad Starvin' Marvin!", became one of the most popular lines from the first season of the show. Starvin' Marvin is from the African nation Ethiopia, which experienced <a href="1984%E2%80%931985%20famine%20in%20Ethiopia">two famines in the mid-1980s</a>. The American authorities who address his parents identify his family's surname as "Click Click Derk".

The scenes in which Chef, and later the lead turkey, don blue and white war paint and speak inspirational words to their armies are a parody of "<a href="Braveheart">Braveheart</a>", the 1995 <a href="Mel%20Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>-directed film about Scottish historical hero <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a>. Parker said it was the first of many times a film was spoofed in a "South Park" episode, even though both said they enjoyed "Braveheart". During class, Mr. Garrison incorrectly tells the children the internationally known English pop singer <a href="Engelbert%20Humperdinck%20%28singer%29">Engelbert Humperdinck</a> was the first man to walk on the moon. Also in the classroom, when it is suggested some poor people would rather die than go to a poorhouse, Cartman says, "Well then perhaps they should – and decrease the surplus population!" The line is lifted word-for-word from the <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> novella "<a href="A%20Christmas%20Carol">A Christmas Carol</a>", prompting Mr. Garrison to respond, "Okay, kids, that's enough Dickens for one day." Kyle incorrectly tells Stan that Sally Struthers appeared on "<a href="Full%20House">Full House</a>", an American sitcom that ran from the late 1980s to early 1990s; she actually starred in the 1970s series "<a href="All%20in%20the%20Family">All in the Family</a>". When Dr. Mephisto asks Chef to look into his microscope, Chef says he sees "an extreme close-up of <a href="Vanessa%20Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a>'s private parts", a reference to the <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>-winning English actress. At the end of the episode, Stan said it is important to remember the images of starving children on television are "just as real as you or I". Kyle says by that logic, <a href="MacGyver">MacGyver</a> is a real person too, a reference to the secret agent protagonist from the <a href="MacGyver%20%281985%20TV%20series%29">1980s television series of the same name</a>.

Tom Vogt, who served as the editor of "South Park" for several years, watched a bootleg copy of "Starvin' Marvin" and several other episodes of "South Park" before driving to Colorado to seek a job with the show. He was hired as the editor after contacting one of the "South Park" animators who used to work for the same company as he had.

"Starvin' Marvin" first aired in the United States on Comedy Central on November 19, 1997. In its original American broadcast, "Starvin' Marvin" received a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 4.8, meaning the episode was seen by about 2.2 million households in the US. Television journalists described the rating as "astonishing" by Comedy Central standards; at the time, the network averaged a 0.6 rating (276,000 households) during prime time, and prior to "South Park", the channel's highest rating was a 2.7 (1.24 million households) for the second-season premiere of "<a href="Absolutely%20Fabulous">Absolutely Fabulous</a>". Several reviewers have described "Starvin' Marvin" as one of "South Park"s "classic episodes". Parker said the emotional moment when Starvin' Marvin returned home with all the turkeys made his mother cry, marking the first time he and Stone heard of an emotional reaction to their show.

After the episode aired, Parker and Stone received feedback that audiences felt "Starvin' Marvin" was especially unkind to Struthers. Although they did not speak to her themselves, the duo received word that Struthers was a fan of the show until "Starvin' Marvin" aired, after which she was very upset and reportedly reacted emotionally over her portrayal. Struthers was particularly saddened by the fact that her character steals food from the same starving children she had been working to help. Parker and Stone were slightly remorseful when they learned of her reaction and have said they did not have anything against Struthers personally. Nevertheless, Struthers was portrayed in an even less flattering way in the <a href="South%20Park%20%28season%203%29">third season</a> episode "<a href="Starvin%27%20Marvin%20in%20Space">Starvin' Marvin in Space</a>" as a <a href="Jabba%20the%20Hutt">Jabba the Hutt</a>-like creature. In a <a href="DVD">DVD</a> commentary track, Parker said of Struthers, "Dude, you're really setting yourself up if you're going to be that fat and go on the air talking about [starving children]. ... We don't think she's a bad person, she's probably nice to try to do this, but cut down on the <a href="Twinkie">Twinkie</a>s a little bit before going on the air."

Tom Carson, television critic for "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", praised the episode, which he said "featured some amazing sick jokes about American affluence and obliviousness". Dianne Williamson of the "<a href="Telegram%20%26amp%3B%20Gazette">Telegram & Gazette</a>" praised "Starvin' Marvin" for taking a chance with the source material, and said, "Often I'm in awe at the courage of these ["South Park"] creators." "The Advertiser" of <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Louisiana">Lafayette</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, called the episode "hysterical" and particularly praised its satire of American consumerism. The "<a href="St.%20Paul%20Pioneer%20Press">St. Paul Pioneer Press</a>" described the episode as "hilarious" and said, "We know we shouldn't laugh, but we can't help it." Vicki Englund of "<a href="The%20Courier-Mail">The Courier-Mail</a>" complimented the "really bizarre storyline" and the moral of the episode, and especially praised the jokes about Struthers: "It might be a good idea not to eat during the hilarious second episode. Enough said."

Vern Perry, a reviewer with the "<a href="Orange%20County%20Register">Orange County Register</a>", called "Starvin' Marvin" his favorite "South Park" episode. The "Starvin' Marvin" episode was featured in a 1998 "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" list of the top ten reasons for the popularity of "South Park". The "Chicago Tribune" also included "Starvin' Marvin" in a 2003 list of the top ten funniest episodes. Bill Ward, of the "<a href="Star%20Tribune">Star Tribune</a>", described "Starvin Marvin" as Cartman's "finest half-hour". Not all reviews were positive; "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">Boston Globe</a>" writer Matthew Gilbert, who described "South Park" as immature and low-brow, called "Starvin' Marvin" a particularly "uncuddly episode". Brian Boyd of "<a href="The%20Irish%20Times">The Irish Times</a>" criticized the episode for making jokes at the expense of starving African children.

"Starvin' Marvin" was released, along with eleven other episodes, in a three-DVD set in November 1998. It was included in the third volume, which also included the episodes "<a href="Mecha-Streisand">Mecha-Streisand</a>", "<a href="Mr.%20Hankey%2C%20the%20Christmas%20Poo">Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo</a>" and "<a href="Tom%27s%20Rhinoplasty">Tom's Rhinoplasty</a>". "Starvin' Marvin" was also one of six episodes included on a 1998 <a href="VHS">VHS</a> called "South Park Festival Special", which included "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo", "<a href="Merry%20Christmas%2C%20Charlie%20Manson%21">Merry Christmas, Charlie Manson!</a>", "<a href="Mr.%20Hankey%27s%20Christmas%20Classics">Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics</a>", "<a href="Korn%27s%20Groovy%20Pirate%20Ghost%20Mystery">Korn's Groovy Pirate Ghost Mystery</a>" and "<a href="Pinkeye%20%28South%20Park%29">Pinkeye</a>". The episode, along with the other twelve from the first season, was also included in the DVD release "South Park: The Complete First Season", which was released on November 12, 2002. Parker and Stone recorded commentary tracks for each episode, but they were not included with the DVDs due to "standards" issues with some of the statements; Parker and Stone refused to allow the tracks to be edited and censored, so they were released in a CD separate from the DVDs. In 2008, Parker and Stone made "Starvin' Marvin" and all "South Park" episodes available to watch for free on the show's official website, "South Park Studios".

Anglo-Zanzibar War

The Anglo-Zanzibar War was a military conflict fought between the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom</a> and the <a href="Zanzibar%20Sultanate">Zanzibar Sultanate</a> on 27 August 1896. The conflict lasted between 38 and 45 minutes, marking it as the shortest recorded war in history. The immediate cause of the war was the death of the pro-British <a href="Sultan">Sultan</a> <a href="Hamad%20bin%20Thuwaini%20of%20Zanzibar">Hamad bin Thuwaini</a> on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of <a href="Khalid%20bin%20Barghash%20of%20Zanzibar">Sultan Khalid bin Barghash</a>. The British authorities preferred <a href="Hamud%20bin%20Muhammed%20of%20Zanzibar">Hamud bin Muhammed</a>, who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for <a href="Enthronement">accession</a> to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British <a href="consul%20%28representative%29">consul</a>, and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a "<a href="casus%20belli">casus belli</a>" and sent an <a href="ultimatum">ultimatum</a> to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.

The ultimatum expired at 09:00 <a href="East%20Africa%20Time">East Africa Time</a> (EAT) on 27 August, by which time the British had gathered three <a href="cruisers">cruisers</a>, two <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a>s, 150 <a href="Royal%20Marines">marines</a> and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area. The Royal Navy contingent were under the command of <a href="Rear-Admiral">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="Harry%20Rawson">Harry Rawson</a> while their Zanzibaris were commanded by <a href="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</a> <a href="Lloyd%20Mathews">Lloyd Mathews</a> of the Zanzibar army (who was also the <a href="First%20Minister">First Minister</a> of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment, opened at 09:02, set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari <a href="royal%20yacht">royal yacht</a> <a href="HHS%20Glasgow">HHS "Glasgow"</a> and two smaller vessels, and some shots were fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40.

The sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received asylum in the German consulate before escaping to <a href="German%20East%20Africa">German East Africa</a> (in the mainland part of present <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>). The British quickly placed Sultan Hamud in power at the head of a <a href="puppet%20government">puppet government</a>. The war marked the end of the <a href="Sultanate%20of%20Zanzibar">Zanzibar Sultanate</a> as a <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign state</a> and the start of a period of heavy British influence.

Zanzibar was an island country in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, off the coast of <a href="Tanganyika">Tanganyika</a>; today it forms part of <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>. The main island, <a href="Unguja">Unguja</a> (or Zanzibar Island), had been under the nominal control of the <a href="Sultan%20of%20Oman">Sultans of Oman</a> since 1698 when they expelled the <a href="Portugal">Portuguese</a> settlers who had claimed it in 1499. Sultan <a href="Majid%20bin%20Said%20of%20Zanzibar">Majid bin Said</a> declared the island independent of Oman in 1858, which was recognised by Great Britain, and split the sultanate from that of Oman. <a href="Barghash%20bin%20Said%20of%20Zanzibar">Barghash bin Said</a>, the second sultan and Khalid's father, had been forced by British ultimatum and a threat of blockade to abolish the slave trade in June 1873, though it was later discovered that instructions from London would have prohibited aggressive action being taken immediately if that ultimatum had been rejected.

The subsequent sultans established their capital and seat of government at <a href="Zanzibar%20Town">Zanzibar Town</a> where a palace complex was built on the sea front. By 1896, this consisted of the palace itself; the Beit al-Hukm, an attached <a href="harem">harem</a>; and the <a href="Beit%20al-Ajaib">Beit al-Ajaib</a> or "House of Wonders"—a ceremonial palace said to be the first building in East Africa to be provided with electricity. The complex was mostly constructed of local timber and was not designed as a defensive structure. All three main buildings were adjacent to one another in a line, and linked by wooden covered bridges above street height.

Britain had recognised Zanzibar's <a href="sovereignty">sovereignty</a> and its sultanate in 1886, after a long period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans. However, <a href="Germany">Germany</a> was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century. Sultan <a href="Khalifah%20bin%20Said%20of%20Zanzibar">Khalifah</a> had granted rights to the land of <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a> to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands. Many of the <a href="Arab">Arab</a> ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which <a href="Abushiri%20Revolt">resulted in some unrest</a>. In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the <a href="flag%20of%20the%20Zanzibar%20Sultanate">flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate</a>, which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population. One such conflict in <a href="Tanga%2C%20Tanzania">Tanga</a> claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.

Sultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General <a href="Lloyd%20Mathews">Lloyd Mathews</a>, a former <a href="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, to restore order in Tanganyika. The operation was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong. Further conflicts erupted at <a href="Bagamoyo">Bagamoyo</a>, where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at <a href="Ketwa">Ketwa</a>, where German officials and their servants were murdered. Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the <a href="Imperial%20British%20East%20Africa%20Company">Imperial British East Africa Company</a> (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade. Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 <a href="Ali%20bin%20Said%20of%20Zanzibar">Ali bin Said</a> ascended to the sultanate. Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as <a href="First%20Minister">First Minister</a> to lead his <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">cabinet</a>. The British were also guaranteed a veto over the future appointment of sultans.

The year of Ali's ascension also saw the signing of the <a href="Heligoland-Zanzibar%20Treaty">Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty</a> between Britain and Germany. This treaty officially <a href="demarcation%20line">demarcated</a> the <a href="sphere%20of%20interest">spheres of interest</a> in East Africa and ceded Germany's rights in Zanzibar to the United Kingdom. This granted the <a href="British%20government">British government</a> more influence in Zanzibar, which they intended to use to eradicate slavery there, an objective they had held as early as 1804.

Sultan Ali's successor was <a href="Hamad%20bin%20Thuwaini%20of%20Zanzibar">Hamad bin Thuwaini</a>, who became sultan in 1893. Hamad maintained a close relationship with the British, but there was dissent among his subjects over the increasing British control over the country, the British-led army and the abolition of the valuable slave trade. In order to control this dissent, the British authorities authorised the sultan to raise a Zanzibari palace bodyguard of 1,000 men, but these troops were soon involved in clashes with the British-led police. Complaints about the bodyguards' activities were also received from the European residents in Zanzibar Town.

Sultan Hamad died suddenly at 11:40 EAT (08:40 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a>) on 25 August 1896. His 29-year-old nephew <a href="Khalid%20bin%20Barghash%20of%20Zanzibar">Khalid bin Bargash</a>, who was suspected by some of his assassination, moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in contravention of the treaty agreed with Ali. The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed towards them. Khalid was warned by the consul and diplomatic agent to Zanzibar, <a href="Basil%20Cave">Basil Cave</a>, and General Mathews to think carefully about his actions. This course of action had proved successful three years earlier when Khalid had tried to claim the sultanate after the death of Ali, and the British consul-general, Rennell Rodd, had persuaded him of the dangers of such an action.

Khalid ignored Cave's warning, and his forces began mustering in the Palace Square under the command of Captain Saleh of the palace bodyguard. By the end of the day, they numbered 2,800 men armed with rifles and muskets. The majority were civilians, but the force included 700 Zanzibari <a href="Askari">Askari</a> soldiers who had sided with Khalid. The sultan's artillery, which consisted of several <a href="Maxim%20machine%20gun">Maxim machine gun</a>s, a <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a>, a 17th-century bronze cannon and two 12-pounder <a href="field%20guns">field guns</a>, was aimed at the British ships in the harbour. The 12-pounders had been presented to the sultan by <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Wilhelm II</a>, the German emperor. The sultan's troops also took possession of the Zanzibari Navy, which consisted of one wooden sloop, the <a href="HHS%20Glasgow">HHS "Glasgow"</a>, built as a <a href="royal%20yacht">royal yacht</a> for the sultan in 1878 based on the British frigate <a href="HMS%20Glasgow%20%281861%29">"Glasgow"</a>.

Mathews and Cave also began to muster their forces, already commanding 900 Zanzibari <a href="askari">askari</a>s under Lieutenant <a href="Arthur%20Edward%20Harington%20Raikes">Arthur Edward Harington Raikes</a> of the <a href="Wiltshire%20Regiment">Wiltshire Regiment</a> who was seconded to the Zanzibar Army and held the rank of <a href="brigadier-general">brigadier-general</a>. 150 sailors and marines were landed from the <a href="Pearl%20class%20cruiser">"Pearl"-class</a> <a href="protected%20cruiser">protected cruiser</a> <a href="HMS%20Philomel%20%281890%29">"Philomel"</a> and the <a href="gunboat">gunboat</a> <a href="HMS%20Thrush%20%281889%29">"Thrush"</a>, which were anchored in the harbour. The naval contingent, under the command of Captain O'Callaghan, came ashore within fifteen minutes of being requested to deal with any rioting caused by the general population. A smaller contingent of sailors under Lieutenant Watson of "Thrush" were put ashore to guard the British consulate, where British citizens were requested to gather for protection. <a href="HMS%20Sparrow%20%281889%29">HMS "Sparrow"</a>, another gunboat, entered the harbour and was anchored opposite the palace next to "Thrush".

Some concerns were raised among the British diplomats as to the reliability of Raikes' askaris, but they proved to be steady and professional troops hardened by <a href="military%20drill">military drill</a> and several expeditions to East Africa. They would later become the only land troops to be fired upon by the defenders. Raikes' troops were armed with two Maxim guns and a nine pounder cannon, and were stationed at the nearby customs house. The sultan attempted to have the US consul, <a href="Richard%20Dorsey%20Mohun">Richard Dorsey Mohun</a>, recognise his accession, but the messenger was told that "as his accession had not been verified by Her Majesty's government, it is impossible to reply."

Cave continued to send messages to Khalid requesting that he stand down his troops, leave the palace and return home, but these were ignored, and Khalid replied that he would proclaim himself sultan at 15:00. Cave stated that this would constitute an act of rebellion and that Khalid's sultancy would not be recognised by the British government. At 14:30, Sultan Hamad was buried, and exactly 30 minutes later a <a href="21-gun%20salute">royal salute</a> from the palace guns proclaimed Khalid's succession. Cave could not open hostilities without government approval and telegraphed the following message to the <a href="Foreign%20Office">Foreign Office</a> of <a href="Lord%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury's</a> administration in London: "Are we authorised in the event of all attempts at a peaceful solution proving useless, to fire on the Palace from the men-of-war?" Meanwhile, Cave informed all other foreign consuls that all flags were to remain at half mast in honour of the late Hamad. The only one that did not was a large red flag flying from Khalid's palace. Cave also informed the consuls not to recognise Khalid as sultan, to which they agreed.

At 10:00 on 26 August, the "Archer"-class protected cruiser <a href="HMS%20Racoon%20%281887%29">"Racoon"</a> arrived at Zanzibar Town and was anchored in line with "Thrush" and "Sparrow". At 14:00, the <a href="Edgar%20class%20cruiser">"Edgar"-class</a> protected cruiser <a href="HMS%20St%20George%20%281892%29">"St George"</a>, <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of the Cape and East Africa Station, steamed into the harbour. On board were <a href="Rear-Admiral">Rear-Admiral</a> <a href="Harry%20Rawson">Harry Rawson</a> and further British marines and sailors. At around the same time Lord Salisbury's reply arrived authorising Cave and Rawson to use the resources at their disposal to remove Khalid from power. The telegraph read: "You are authorised to adopt whatever measures you may consider necessary, and will be supported in your action by Her Majesty's Government. Do not, however, attempt to take any action which you are not certain of being able to accomplish successfully."

Cave attempted further negotiations with Khalid, but these failed and Rawson sent an <a href="ultimatum">ultimatum</a>, requiring him to haul down his flag and leave the palace by 09:00 on 27 August or he would open fire. During the afternoon, all merchant vessels were cleared from the harbour and the British women and children removed to "St. George" and a <a href="British-India%20Steam%20Navigation%20Company">British-India Steam Navigation Company</a> vessel for their safety. That night, Consul Mohun noted that: "The silence which hung over Zanzibar was appalling. Usually drums were beating or babies cried but that night there was absolutely not a sound."

At 08:00 on the morning of 27 August, after a messenger sent by Khalid requested <a href="parley">parley</a> from Cave, the consul replied that he would only have salvation if he agreed to the terms of the ultimatum. At 08:30 a further messenger from Khalid declared that "We have no intention of hauling down our flag and we do not believe you would open fire on us"; Cave replied that "We do not want to open fire, but unless you do as you are told we shall certainly do so." At 08:55, having received no further word from the palace, aboard "St George" Rawson hoisted the signal "prepare for action".

At exactly 09:00, General Lloyd Mathews ordered the British ships to commence the bombardment. At 09:02 Her Majesty's Ships "Racoon", "Thrush" and "Sparrow" opened fire at the palace simultaneously, "Thrush's" first shot immediately dismounted an Arab 12-pounder cannon. Three thousand defenders, servants and slaves were present in the largely wooden palace, and even with barricades of crates, bales and rubber, there were many casualties from the <a href="high%20explosive">high explosive</a> shells. Despite initial reports that he had been captured and was to be exiled to <a href="India">India</a>, Sultan Khalid escaped from the palace. A <a href="Reuters">Reuters</a> news correspondent reported that the sultan had "fled at the first shot with all the leading Arabs, who left their slaves and followers to carry on the fighting", but other sources state that he remained in the palace for longer. The shelling ceased at around 09:40, by which time the palace and attached harem had caught fire, the Sultan's artillery had been silenced and his flag cut down.

During the bombardment a small naval engagement occurred when, at 09:05, the obsolete "Glasgow" fired upon the "St George" using her armament of 7 nine-pounder guns and a Gatling gun, which had been a present from Queen Victoria to the sultan. The return fire caused "Glasgow" to sink, though the shallow harbour meant that her masts remained out of the water. "Glasgow"s crew hoisted a British flag as a token of their surrender, and they were all rescued by British sailors in <a href="launch%20%28boat%29">launches</a>. "Thrush" also sank two steam launches whose Zanzibari crews shot at her with rifles. Some land fighting occurred when Khalid's men fired on Raikes' askaris, with little effect, as they approached the palace. The fighting ceased with the end of the shelling. The British controlled the town and the palace, and by the afternoon Hamud bin Muhammed, an Arab favourable to the British, had been installed as sultan with much reduced powers. The British ships and crews had fired around 500 shells, 4,100 machine gun rounds and 1,000 rifle rounds during the engagement.

Approximately 500 Zanzibari men and women were killed or wounded during the bombardment, most of the dead a result of the fire that engulfed the palace. It is unknown how many of these casualties were combatants, but Khalid's gun crews were said to have been "decimated". British casualties amounted to one <a href="Petty%20Officer">Petty Officer</a> severely wounded aboard "Thrush" who later recovered. Although the majority of the Zanzibari townspeople sided with the British, the town's <a href="India">India</a>n quarter suffered from opportunistic looting, and around twenty inhabitants lost their lives in the chaos. To restore order, 150 British <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> troops were transferred from <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a> to patrol the streets. Sailors from "St George" and "Philomel" were landed to form a <a href="fire%20brigade">fire brigade</a> to contain the fire, which had spread from the palace to the nearby customs sheds. There was some concern about the fire at the customs sheds as they contained a sizeable store of explosives, but no explosion occurred.

Sultan Khalid, Captain Saleh and around forty followers sought refuge in the German consulate following their flight from the palace, where they were guarded by ten armed German sailors and marines while Mathews stationed men outside to arrest them if they tried to leave. Despite <a href="extradition">extradition</a> requests, the German consul refused to surrender Khalid to the British as his country's extradition treaty with Britain specifically excluded political prisoners. Instead, the German consul promised to remove Khalid to <a href="German%20East%20Africa">German East Africa</a> without him "setting foot on the soil of Zanzibar". At 10:00 on 2 October, <a href="SMS%20Seeadler">SMS "Seeadler"</a> of the <a href="Kaiserliche%20Marine">German Navy</a> arrived in port; at high tide, one of Seeadler's boats made it up to the consulate's garden gate, and Khalid stepped directly from consular grounds to a German war vessel and hence was free from arrest. He was transferred from the boat onto the "Seeadler" and was then taken to <a href="Dar%20es%20Salaam">Dar es Salaam</a> in German East Africa. Khalid was captured by British forces in 1916, during the <a href="East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">East African Campaign</a> of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and exiled to <a href="Seychelles">Seychelles</a> and <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> before being allowed to return to East Africa, where he died at <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a> in 1927. The British punished Khalid's supporters by forcing them to pay reparations to cover the cost of shells fired against them and for damages caused by the looting, which amounted to 300,000 <a href="Indian%20rupee">rupees</a>.

Sultan Hamud was loyal to the British and acted as a <a href="puppet%20ruler">figurehead</a> for an essentially British-run government, the sultanate only being retained to avoid the costs involved with running Zanzibar directly as a <a href="crown%20colony">crown colony</a>. Several months after the war, Hamud, with British prompting, abolished slavery in all its forms. The emancipation of slaves required them to present themselves to a government office and proved a slow process—within ten years only 17,293 slaves had been freed, from an estimated population of 60,000 in 1891.

The badly damaged palace complex was completely changed by the war. The harem, lighthouse and palace were demolished as the bombardment had left them unsafe. The palace site became an area of gardens, while a new palace was erected on the site of the harem. The House of Wonders was almost undamaged and would later become the main <a href="wikt%3Asecretariat">secretariat</a> for the British governing authorities. During renovation work on the House of Wonders in 1897, a clocktower was added to its frontage to replace the lighthouse lost to the shelling. The wreck of the "Glasgow" remained in the harbour in front of the palace, where the shallow waters ensured that her masts would remain visible for several years to come; it was eventually broken up for scrap in 1912.

The British protagonists were highly regarded by the governments in London and Zanzibar for their actions leading up to and during the war, and many were rewarded with appointments and honours. General Raikes, leader of the askaris, was appointed a First Class (Second Grade) member of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Brilliant%20Star%20of%20Zanzibar">Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar</a> on 24 September 1896, a First Class member of the Zanzibari <a href="Order%20of%20Hamondieh">Order of Hamondieh</a> on 25 August 1897 and later promoted to Commander of the Zanzibar armies. General Mathews, the Zanzibari army commander, was appointed a member of the <a href="Grand%20Order%20of%20Hamondieh">Grand Order of Hamondieh</a> on 25 August 1897 and became First Minister and Treasurer to the Zanzibari government. Basil Cave, the consul, was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> on 1 January 1897 and promoted to consul-general on 9 July 1903. Harry Rawson was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a> for his work in Zanzibar and would later be <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a> in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and receive promotion to <a href="Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">admiral</a>. Rawson was also appointed a first class member of the Order of the Brilliant Star of Zanzibar on 8 February 1897 and the Order of Hamondieh on 18 June 1898.

Perhaps due to the effectiveness shown by the Royal Navy during the bombardment, there were no further rebellions against British influence during the remaining 67 years of the protectorate.

The war, lasting less than three quarters of an hour, is considered the shortest in recorded history. Several durations are given by sources, including 38, 40 and 45 minutes, but the 38-minute duration is the most often quoted. The variation is due to confusion over what actually constitutes the start and end of a war. Some sources take the start of the war as the order to open fire at 09:00 and some with the start of actual firing at 09:02. The end of the war is usually put at 09:40, when the last shots were fired and the palace flag struck, but some sources place it at 09:45. The logbooks of the British ships also suffer from this with "St George" indicating that cease-fire was called and Khalid entered the German consulate at 09:35, "Thrush" at 09:40, "Racoon" at 09:41, and "Philomel" and "Sparrow" at 09:45.

Acid2

Acid2 is a test page published and promoted by the <a href="Web%20Standards%20Project">Web Standards Project</a> to expose <a href="web%20page">web page</a> <a href="rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">rendering</a> flaws in <a href="web%20browser">web browser</a>s and other <a href="Browser%20engine">applications that render HTML</a>. Named after the <a href="acid%20test%20%28gold%29">acid test for gold</a>, it was developed in the spirit of <a href="Acid1">Acid1</a>, a relatively narrow test of compliance with the <a href="Cascading%20Style%20Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> 1.0 (CSS1) <a href="Technical%20standard">standard</a>, and was released on 13 April 2005. As with Acid1, an application passes the test if the way it displays the test page matches a reference image.

Acid2 tests aspects of HTML markup, CSS 2.1 styling, <a href="Portable%20Network%20Graphics">PNG</a> images, and <a href="data%20URI">data URI</a>s. The Acid2 test page will be displayed correctly in any application that follows the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web%20Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> and <a href="Internet%20Engineering%20Task%20Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> specifications for these technologies. These specifications are known as <a href="web%20standards">web standards</a> because they describe how technologies used on the web are expected to function.

Acid2 was designed with <a href="Microsoft%20Internet%20Explorer">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a> particularly in mind. The creators of Acid2 were dismayed that Internet Explorer did not follow web standards. It was prone to display web pages differently from other browsers, causing web developers to spend time <a href="tweaking">tweaking</a> their web pages. Acid2 challenged Microsoft to make Internet Explorer comply with web standards.

Acid2 was released on 13 April 2005. On 31 October 2005, <a href="Safari%20%28web%20browser%29">Safari</a> 2.0.2 became the first browser to pass Acid2. <a href="Opera%20%28web%20browser%29">Opera</a>, <a href="Konqueror">Konqueror</a>, <a href="Firefox">Firefox</a>, and others followed. With the release of <a href="Internet%20Explorer%208">Internet Explorer 8</a> on 19 March 2009, the latest versions of all major desktop web browsers now pass the test until <a href="Internet%20Explorer%2010">IE10</a> was released, which fails the test. Its successor, <a href="Microsoft%20Edge">Microsoft Edge</a>, is able to render it correctly as of Windows 10 version 1607. Acid2 was followed by <a href="Acid3">Acid3</a>.

The test fails when browsers become compliant with current CSS collapse and margin standards.

Acid2 was first proposed by <a href="H%C3%A5kon%20Wium%20Lie">Håkon Wium Lie</a>, chief technical officer of <a href="Opera%20Software">Opera Software</a> and creator of the widely used <a href="Cascading%20Style%20Sheets">Cascading Style Sheets</a> <a href="web%20standard">web standard</a>. In a 16 March 2005 article on <a href="CNET">CNET</a>, Lie expressed dismay that <a href="Microsoft%20Internet%20Explorer">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a> did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a> to design <a href="Internet%20Explorer%207">Internet Explorer 7</a>, then in development, to achieve a greater degree of standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original <a href="Acid1">Acid1</a> test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.

Lie and a colleague, <a href="Ian%20Hickson">Ian Hickson</a>, created the first draft of the test in February 2005. Ian Hickson coded the final test in collaboration with the <a href="Web%20Standards%20Project">Web Standards Project</a> and the larger web community. It was officially released on 13 April 2005 and at that time, every web browser failed it spectacularly.

On 23 April 2005, Acid2 was updated to fix a bug that made the mouth appear too close to the nose. After several complaints, the test was again updated in January 2006 to remove a test for unpopular <a href="SGML">SGML</a>-style comments that were never widely implemented. In browsers that do not implement SGML-style comments, the original test displayed the word "ERROR" on the bottom part of the face.

In March 2008, Ian Hickson released <a href="Acid3">Acid3</a> as a follow-up to Acid2. While Acid2 primarily tests CSS, Acid3 focuses more on <a href="JavaScript">JavaScript</a> and other "<a href="Web%202.0">Web 2.0</a>" technologies.

In July 2005, <a href="Chris%20Wilson%20%28open%20web%20advocate%29">Chris Wilson</a>, the Internet Explorer Platform Architect, stated that passing Acid2 was not a priority for <a href="Internet%20Explorer%207">Internet Explorer 7</a>, describing the test as a "wish list" of features rather than a true test of standards compliance. In December 2007, Microsoft announced that all the changes required to pass Acid2 would be made available in <a href="Internet%20Explorer%208">Internet Explorer 8</a>, but that the changes would not be turned on by default, meaning that IE8 would not actually pass the test. The concern was that switching to a new behavior would cause too many problems in web pages expecting Internet Explorer's old, non-compliant behavior. Then in March 2008 Microsoft released IE8 beta 1 and turned on the changes by default after all. James Pratt, product manager for IE8, explained that this decision was made so that "developers can spend more time building features and cool stuff, and less time just trying to tweak their sites across different browsers."

Another unresolved standards compliance issue caused IE8 beta 1 to fail if not all elements of the test were hosted from the same server. In August 2008 Microsoft released IE8 beta 2, which resolved the issue. As of that beta, however, standards mode is not turned on by default for pages loaded in the "<a href="Intranet">Intranet</a> Zone". This zone is active for pages loaded via <a href="UNC%20path">UNC path</a>s, named addresses without dots (like <nowiki>http://mysite/</nowiki>), and sites that bypass the <a href="Proxy%20server">proxy</a> settings. As such, IE8 will not pass the Acid2 test if loaded in these cases.

Acid2 tests a variety of <a href="web%20standards">web standards</a> published by the <a href="World%20Wide%20Web%20Consortium">World Wide Web Consortium</a> and the <a href="Internet%20Engineering%20Task%20Force">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>. With the exception of CSS 2.1, all web standards tested were codified before the year 2000. CSS 2.1 was a candidate recommendation at the time of Acid2's release, and was still a candidate recommendation as of 23 April 2009.

Specifically, Acid2 tests:

Because Acid2 is not a comprehensive test, it does not guarantee total conformance to any particular standard. A variant of the Acid2 test that does not test for data URI support is also available from the Web Standards Project.

A passing score is only considered valid if the browser's default settings were used. Actions such as changing font sizes, zoom level, and applying user stylesheets can break the display of the test. This is expected and is not relevant to a browser's compliance.

The following browser settings and user actions invalidate the test:

If rendered correctly, Acid2 will appear as a <a href="smiley">smiley</a> face below the text "<a href="Hello%20World%21">Hello World!</a>" in the user's browser, with the nose turning blue when the mouse cursor hovers over it. At the time of the test's release, every browser failed it, but now a number of browsers pass it. See the list below.


Even though <a href="Opera%20Mini">Opera Mini</a> is based on the same rendering engine as <a href="Opera%20%28web%20browser%29">Opera</a> for <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s, it does not pass the Acid2 test. This is because Opera Mini intentionally reformats web pages to try to make them more suitable for devices with small screens.

The following is a list of releases noting significant releases of applications that passed the test. New applications that have passed Acid2 since their first official release are not included in the timeline.

Kingdom Hearts II

"Kingdom Hearts II" is the third game in the "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>" series. It picks up one year after the events of "". <a href="Sora%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Sora</a>, the protagonist of the first two games, returns to search for his lost friends while battling the sinister <a href="Organization%20XIII">Organization XIII</a>, a group of antagonists previously introduced in "Chain of Memories". Like the previous games, "Kingdom Hearts II" features a large cast of characters from Disney films and "Final Fantasy" games.

The game was critically acclaimed and earned year-end awards from numerous <a href="video%20game%20journalism">video gaming websites</a>. In Japan, it shipped more than one million copies within a week of its release. One month after its North American release, it had sold over one million copies and was the second best-selling game of 2006. By April 2007, the game had shipped over four million copies worldwide. The game has been included by gaming publications in lists of <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">the greatest video games of all time</a>.

The "Final Mix" version of the game was re-mastered in high definition and released globally in 2014 as a part of the "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20HD%202.5%20Remix">Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix</a>" collection for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>.

The gameplay of "Kingdom Hearts II" is similar to the <a href="action%20RPG">action RPG</a> and <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> gameplay of the first "Kingdom Hearts" game, though developers made an effort to address some of the complaints with the previous game. The player directly controls Sora from a <a href="virtual%20camera%20system">third-person</a> camera angle, though first-person perspective is available via Select button. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. The game is driven by a linear progression from one story event to the next, usually told via <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s, though there are numerous <a href="quest%20%28gaming%29">side-quests</a> available that provide bonuses to characters.

Like many traditional <a href="role-playing%20video%20game">role-playing video game</a>s, "Kingdom Hearts II" features an <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a> system which determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player and allies culminate experience to "level up", in which the <a href="player%20character">playable characters</a> grow stronger and gain access to new <a href="Skill%20%28role-playing%20games%29">abilities</a>.

Combat in "Kingdom Hearts II" is in real-time and involves heavy <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> elements with button presses which initiate attacks by the on-screen character. A role-playing game menu on the screen's bottom left, similar to those found in "Final Fantasy" games, provides other combat options such as using magic or items, summoning beings to assist in battle, or executing combination attacks with other party members. A new feature is the "Reaction Command", special enemy-specific attacks that are triggered when the player presses the triangle button at the correct time during battle. Reaction Commands can be used to defeat regular enemies or avoid damage, and are sometimes necessary to complete a <a href="boss%20%28video%20games%29">boss</a> battle. In addition to the main character, two party members are usually present who also participate in combat. Although these characters are computer-controlled, the player is allowed to customize their behavior to a certain extent through the menu screen, such as attacking the same enemy Sora targets.

In response to criticism, the "Gummi Ship" feature of the first game was re-imagined to be "more enjoyable". Although retaining its basic purpose of travel, the system was completely redone to resemble a combination of <a href="rail%20shooter">rail shooter</a> and "Disney theme park ride". In the world map, the player must now control the Gummi Ship from a <a href="Top-down%20perspective">top-down view</a> and fly to the world the player wishes to enter. Worlds are no longer open from the beginning—the player must unlock the routes to them by entering a new level, controlling the ship from a third-person point of view, and battling enemy ships. After the route is opened, travel to the world is unimpeded, unless it is blocked again due to a plot-related event. The player may also gain new Gummi Ships from completing routes, which is also a new feature from the first game.

One of the new features is a meter known as the "Drive Gauge". The Drive Gauge has dual functions: to transform Sora into a "Drive Form" or to summon a special character. While in a Drive Form, Sora bonds with party members to become more powerful and acquire different attributes; all but two Forms also allow the use of two Keyblades. When a Drive is executed, Sora's combat statistics are heightened. Drive Forms also give Sora new abilities that can be used in normal form, called "Growth Abilities." Sora's first two Drive Forms only combine power with one party member; later-obtained Drive Forms require him to bond with both party members. When allies are used in a Drive, they are temporarily removed from battle for its duration. Unlike the <a href="Health%20%28game%20mechanic%29">HP</a> and <a href="magic%20%28gaming%29">MP</a> gauges, the Drive Gauge is not refilled at save points.

Like in the first game, Sora can summon a Disney character to aid him in battle. Summons will replace the two computer-controlled characters and fight alongside Sora for as long as the Drive Gauge allows, or until Sora's HP runs out. Instead of being limited to only one action, Summons now have a menu of their own and are capable of performing solo or cooperative actions with Sora. These actions are performed by pressing the triangle button. The Summon ability and each Drive Form are leveled up separately and by different criteria; obtaining higher levels allows for extended use and in the case of Drive Forms, access to new abilities.

"Kingdom Hearts II" begins one year after the events of "Kingdom Hearts" and "Chain of Memories". The game's setting is a collection of various <a href="level%20%28video%20games%29">levels</a> (referred to in-game as "worlds") that the player progresses through. As in the first game, the player can travel to various Disney-based locales, along with original worlds specifically created for the series. While Disney-based worlds were primarily derived from the <a href="List%20of%20Disney%20theatrical%20animated%20features">Disney animated features canon</a> in the first game, "Kingdom Hearts II" introduces worlds that are based on <a href="List%20of%20Disney%20feature%20films">Disney live-action films</a> as well. Each world varies in appearance and setting, depending on the Disney film on which it is based. The graphics of the world and characters are meant to resemble the artwork style of the environments and characters from their respective Disney films. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately; with few exceptions, players travel from one world to another via a Gummi Ship.

Some worlds featured in the previous games reappear, but with new and expanded areas. There are also new worlds that are introduced, including the Land of Dragons (based on "<a href="Mulan%20%281998%20film%29">Mulan</a>"), Beast's Castle ("<a href="Beauty%20and%20the%20Beast%20%281991%20film%29">Beauty and the Beast</a>"), Timeless River ("<a href="Steamboat%20Willie">Steamboat Willie</a>"), Port Royal (""), Pride Lands ("<a href="The%20Lion%20King">The Lion King</a>"), and Space Paranoids ("<a href="Tron">Tron</a>"). Twilight Town, an original world first seen in "Chain of Memories", has a greater role as the introductory world. The World That Never Was is a new world that serves as the headquarters of Organization XIII.

The three <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a>s of the game are <a href="Sora%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Sora</a>, a 15-year-old boy chosen as a wielder of the Keyblade, a mystical key-shaped weapon that can combat darkness; <a href="Donald%20Duck">Donald Duck</a>, the court magician of Disney Castle; and <a href="Goofy">Goofy</a>, the captain of the Disney Castle guards. Both Donald and Goofy are under orders from their missing king, <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>, to find and stay with the "key", which refers to Sora and his Keyblade. Other original characters include <a href="Riku%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Riku</a> and <a href="Kairi%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Kairi</a>, Sora's friends from his home world of <a href="Universe%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Original%20worlds">Destiny Islands</a>; <a href="Roxas%20%28Kingdom%20Hearts%29">Roxas</a>, a boy who can also wield the Keyblade and is playable in the game's beginning sequence; and <a href="DiZ">DiZ</a>, a man in red robes with a vendetta against <a href="Organization%20XIII">Organization XIII</a>, who is later revealed to be Ansem the Wise, the mentor of <a href="Xehanort">Xehanort</a>.

As in the previous games, there are numerous appearances of characters from both Disney and Square Enix works. While some make a return from "Kingdom Hearts", new characters from Disney fiction are also introduced, such as <a href="Scar%20%28The%20Lion%20King%29">Scar</a> from "The Lion King" and <a href="Scrooge%20McDuck">Scrooge McDuck</a>. <a href="Pete%20%28Disney%29">Pete</a> appears as a persistent enemy who works with the resurrected <a href="Maleficent%20%28Disney%29">Maleficent</a>. Nearly twenty characters from "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" games appear, notably <a href="%C4%80ron">Auron</a> of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20X">Final Fantasy X</a>", <a href="Tifa%20Lockhart">Tifa</a> from "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VII">Final Fantasy VII</a>", and the return of <a href="Squall%20Leonhart">Squall Leonhart</a>, <a href="Cloud%20Strife">Cloud</a>, and <a href="Sephiroth%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Sephiroth</a>. It was stated that although the first game strictly stuck to characters <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> designed, this time around they were going to "take some risks", implying that characters not directly designed by Nomura might make an appearance. Other new characters to series are <a href="Vivi%20%28Final%20Fantasy%29">Vivi</a> of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20IX">Final Fantasy IX</a>" and <a href="Setzer%20Gabbiani">Setzer</a> of "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20VI">Final Fantasy VI</a>".

The various worlds that Sora explores often have an optional party character from the film on which the world is based. Such party members include <a href="Fa%20Mulan">Fa Mulan</a>, the woman who passes as a man in order to take her ailing father's place in the army; <a href="Jack%20Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a>, a pirate who seeks to reclaim his ship, the <a href="Black%20Pearl">Black Pearl</a>; <a href="Simba">Simba</a>, the self-exiled lion who is the rightful king of the Pride Land; and "<a href="Tron%20%28franchise%29">Tron</a>", a security program in Hollow Bastion's computer network who seeks to end the dictatorship of the Master Control Program.

Organization XIII, a group of powerful Nobodies—the "empty shells" left over when a strong-hearted person becomes a Heartless—introduced in "", is established as the primary group of antagonists early on. <a href="Characters%20of%20Kingdom%20Hearts%23Xemnas">Xemnas</a>, the leader of Organization XIII, serves as the main antagonist and <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29%23Final%20boss">final boss</a> of the game. Villains unique to the worlds are still prevalent, and are often presented as challenges that Sora's group must overcome.

Sora, Donald, and Goofy have been in <a href="suspended%20animation">suspended animation</a> for the past year to regain their lost memories. Roxas, Sora's Nobody, is trapped in a virtual simulation of Twilight Town created by DiZ to merge him with his original self to restore Sora's power. DiZ's plans are threatened when Nobodies led by Axel, Roxas's former friend in Organization XIII, infiltrate the virtual town to extract Roxas. However, Roxas is able to repel the Nobodies and finally merge with Sora. Sora, Donald, and Goofy awaken in the real Twilight Town and meet King Mickey and <a href="Yen%20Sid">Yen Sid</a>, who send them on another journey; their goal is to find Riku and uncover the Organization's plans. Afterward, Maleficent is resurrected and joins with Pete to continue her quest for power.

Sora travels to familiar and unfamiliar worlds, where he resolves several problems caused by Organization XIII, the Heartless, and various local villains. During a visit to Hollow Bastion, they reunite with Mickey, who explains that the Heartless "Ansem" they defeated is an imposter named Xehanort, whose Nobody Xemnas is the Organization's leader. The Organization also reveal that they seek the power of Kingdom Hearts, creating one from the hearts Sora has released from the Heartless with his Keyblade, to regain their lost hearts; in addition, Sora discovers that the Organization is holding Kairi hostage to force him to comply. Sora revisits the worlds to solve lingering problems and new complications while seeking a path to the World That Never Was, Organization XIII's base of operations. Throughout his endeavors, Sora is secretly aided by a hooded figure whom Sora believes to be Riku.

Following a lead, Sora, Donald, and Goofy enter a passageway to the World That Never Was through Twilight Town, where Axel sacrifices himself to give them safe passage. Sora finds Kairi and Riku, the latter of whose appearance has been changed to that of Xehanort's Heartless as a result of capturing Roxas. Mickey encounters DiZ, who reveals himself to be the true Ansem, Xehanort's mentor. Ansem uses a device that dissipates some of Kingdom Hearts' power, but a system overload causes the device to self-destruct, both engulfing Ansem and miraculously returning Riku to his original form. Atop of the Castle That Never Was, Sora and company battle Xemnas, who uses what remains of Kingdom Hearts to fight them. After Sora and Riku destroy Xemnas, the two become trapped in the realm of darkness, where they discover a portal to the realm of light in a bottled letter sent by Kairi, allowing them to return to the Destiny Islands and reunite with their friends. In a <a href="post-credits%20scene">post-credits scene</a>, Sora, Kairi, and Riku receive and reading a letter from Mickey, the contents of which are hidden from the player.

Development plans for "Kingdom Hearts II" began around the completion of "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20Final%20Mix">Kingdom Hearts Final Mix</a>", but specific details were undecided until July 2003. Nomura noted several obstacles to clear before development could begin on a sequel. One such obstacle was the development team's desire to showcase Mickey Mouse more, which required Disney's approval. The game was developed by Square Enix's Product Development Division-1, with most of the original staff from the first game. The game was originally supposed to have been released after "Kingdom Hearts". Nomura had planned for the sequel to take place a year after the first and originally intended for the events of that year to be left unexplained. To bridge the gap between the two games, "Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" was developed. To explain the loss of all the abilities from the first game at the beginning of "Kingdom Hearts II", Nomura had Sora's memories scrambled in "Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories".
Many aspects of the gameplay were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others were meant to be included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right analog stick of the <a href="DualShock">DualShock</a> controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.

Like the first game, "Kingdom Hearts II" features music by <a href="Yoko%20Shimomura">Yoko Shimomura</a> and <a href="Hikaru%20Utada">Hikaru Utada</a>. The Original Soundtrack for "Kingdom Hearts II" was composed by Shimomura and released on January 25, 2006. The opening orchestration and ending credits theme were arranged and orchestrated by <a href="Kaoru%20Wada">Kaoru Wada</a> and performed by the <a href="Tokyo%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. The main vocal theme for the original Japanese release was "<a href="Passion%20%28Hikaru%20Utada%20song%29">Passion</a>", written and performed by Utada. The English version of "Passion", "Sanctuary", was used in the Western releases. Utada's involvement was announced on July 29, 2005. According to Nomura, the vocal theme ties in even more closely with the game's story than "<a href="Hikari%20%28Hikaru%20Utada%20song%29">Hikari</a>" ("<a href="Colors%20%28Utada%20Hikaru%20song%29">Simple and Clean</a>") did with "Kingdom Hearts" and "Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories". The CD single for "Passion" was released on December 14, 2005 and "Sanctuary" was first previewed on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s official website in early 2006.

"Kingdom Hearts II" features well-known voice actors for both the Japanese and English versions. Many of the original voice actors from the first "Kingdom Hearts" reprised their roles; <a href="Miyu%20Irino">Miyu Irino</a> and <a href="Haley%20Joel%20Osment">Haley Joel Osment</a> as Sora, <a href="Mamoru%20Miyano">Mamoru Miyano</a> and <a href="David%20Gallagher">David Gallagher</a> as Riku, and <a href="Risa%20Uchida">Risa Uchida</a> and <a href="Hayden%20Panettiere">Hayden Panettiere</a> as Kairi. New voice actors included <a href="K%C5%8Dki%20Uchiyama">Kōki Uchiyama</a> and <a href="Jesse%20McCartney">Jesse McCartney</a> as Roxas, <a href="Iku%20Nakahara">Iku Nakahara</a> and <a href="Brittany%20Snow">Brittany Snow</a> as Naminé, and <a href="Genz%C5%8D%20Wakayama">Genzō Wakayama</a> and <a href="Christopher%20Lee">Christopher Lee</a> as DiZ. A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors from the Disney movies used in "Kingdom Hearts II". Many actors reprised their Disney roles for the game, including <a href="Ming-Na">Ming-Na</a> as Mulan, <a href="James%20Woods">James Woods</a> as Hades, <a href="Bruce%20Boxleitner">Bruce Boxleitner</a> as Tron, and <a href="Zach%20Braff">Zach Braff</a> as Chicken Little. Some voice actors from the related television series or <a href="direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a> sequels were chosen over original voice actors where applicable, such as <a href="Robert%20Costanzo">Robert Costanzo</a> as Philoctetes rather than <a href="Danny%20DeVito">Danny DeVito</a> or <a href="Cam%20Clarke">Cam Clarke</a> as Simba instead of <a href="Matthew%20Broderick">Matthew Broderick</a>. Some characters were given new voice actors in the English version; Ansem, Aerith, Leon, Sephiroth and Hercules, who were originally voiced by <a href="Billy%20Zane">Billy Zane</a>, <a href="Mandy%20Moore">Mandy Moore</a>, <a href="David%20Boreanaz">David Boreanaz</a>, <a href="Lance%20Bass">Lance Bass</a>, and <a href="Sean%20Astin">Sean Astin</a> respectively in the first game, were voiced by <a href="Richard%20Epcar">Richard Epcar</a>, <a href="Mena%20Suvari">Mena Suvari</a>, <a href="Doug%20Erholtz">Doug Erholtz</a>, <a href="George%20Newbern">George Newbern</a>, and <a href="Tate%20Donovan">Tate Donovan</a> (Hercules' original voice actor), and newcomer Tifa was voiced by <a href="Rachael%20Leigh%20Cook">Rachael Leigh Cook</a>.

Besides English translation and <a href="language%20localisation">localization</a>, the international version of "Kingdom Hearts II" differs from the original Japanese version in the content of gameplay and several scenes. The <a href="Lernaean%20Hydra">Hydra</a> boss in the "<a href="Hercules%20%281997%20film%29">Hercules</a>"-themed world Olympus Coliseum had its green blood from the original Japanese version (which was taken from the film) changed into black and purple smoke in the English version. In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth in the Japanese version; this was later changed into drool in the English version. There is also a scene in Disney Castle where, after chasing Donald around for missing a date, <a href="Daisy%20Duck">Daisy Duck</a> pounds him on the backside in the Japanese version, whereas she merely tells him off inaudibly in the English version.

<a href="Organization%20XIII%23Xigbar">Xigbar</a>'s <a href="telescopic%20sight">telescopic sight</a> was changed from a <a href="crosshair">crosshair</a> and black shading around the sides to three glowing circles. An attack animation was also altered; in the Japanese version, Xigbar combines his two hand-held guns to create a sniper rifle, which is used to shoot the player's party during the telescoping sight sequence. In the English version, Xigbar does not combine his guns, but twirls them around and shoots at Sora with a single gun. The death of Organization XIII member <a href="Organization%20XIII%23Axel">Axel</a> was slightly edited; in the original, he bursts into flames during his suicide attack, while in the English version he simply fades away after using up all of his power.

Port Royal, based on "", contains the most content edits. Cutscenes were edited to remove some of the violence, such as William Turner threatening to commit suicide while aiming a gun at his neck, as in the film. Unlike the Japanese version, the undead pirates do not catch fire when affected by Fire magic, and their muskets were modified to resemble crossbows, though the crossbows still fire with an audible musket shot sound effect.

An unlockable trailer in "Kingdom Hearts" and "Kingdom Hearts Final Mix" hinted at the possibility of a sequel. Rumors for a sequel on the PlayStation 2 were spurred in Japan when the video game website Quiter stated that "an internal (and anonymous source) at Square Japan" confirmed that development of "Kingdom Hearts II" had begun. It was not until "Kingdom Hearts II" was announced, along with "Chain of Memories", at the <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a> in September 2003 that rumors were confirmed. Initial details were that it would take place some time after "Chain of Memories", which takes place directly after the first game. Other details included the return of Sora, Donald, and Goofy, as well as new costumes. Information about Mickey Mouse's involvement was kept to a minimum.

At the 2004 Square Enix E3 Press conference, producer <a href="Shinji%20Hashimoto">Shinji Hashimoto</a> said that many mysteries of the first game would be answered. Square Enix launched the official Japanese website in May 2005, followed by the English website in December 2005. The websites featured videos and information regarding characters and worlds. Commercials were aired in Japan which highlighted the numerous Disney characters in the game. Although the game was announced in September 2003, a release date for the game was not set until two years later. Nomura admitted that the game was announced too early and information regarding the game was not released until a debut period was in sight.

Within a week of its Japanese release, "Kingdom Hearts II" shipped one million copies, selling almost 730,000 copies. The <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a> reported that "Kingdom Hearts II" was the highest-selling console game in North America during March 2006 with 614,000 copies. In the month after its release in North America, "Kingdom Hearts II" sold an estimated one million copies. <a href="GameStop">GameStop</a> listed the game as their best-selling title for the first quarter of 2006. The game was also on <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s "Top 10 Sellers in 2006". By December 2006, over 3.5 million copies of "Kingdom Hearts II" had been shipped worldwide with 700,000 in <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>s, 1.1 million in Japan, and 1.7 million in North America. By March 31, 2007, Square Enix had shipped over 4 million units worldwide.

"Kingdom Hearts II" received critical acclaim upon release, garnering positive reviews. The game received numerous awards and high ratings among reviews including a <a href="Satellite%20Award">Satellite Award</a> in <a href="11th%20Satellite%20Awards">2006</a> for "Outstanding Game Based on Existing Medium". It tied with "<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>" as "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>"s "Game of the Year" 2005. "Famitsu"s readers ranked the game 29th on their "All Time Top 100" feature, ten places below "Kingdom Hearts". It was ranked number one on IGN's 2006 "Reader's Choice" for PlayStation 2 games. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> ranked it 34th on their "Top 50 Games of 2006" list. Video game magazine "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" awarded it "Best Sequel" of 2006, and "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>" listed it among the "Top 50 games of 2006". "VideoGamer.com" featured it 10th in their article "Top 10: Role playing games". "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" named it the 25th best RPG title of all time. "Kingdom Hearts II" also received a near-perfect score, 39/40, from the Japanese gaming magazine "Famitsu".

Critics commended many aspects of the game. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> praised the quality of the voice acting and cited the graphics as "on par with the best of Square's productions to date." They also commented on the realistic and accurate character models for the characters from "Pirates of the Caribbean". IGN rated the graphics a 9/10 and stated that the "worlds look very much like their filmed counterparts." Japanese gaming site Gpara.com also praised the look of the worlds. <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a> awarded "Kingdom Hearts II" "Best Voice Over" and "Best Soundtrack" in their 2006 "<a href="G-Phoria">G-Phoria</a>" awards show.

Like its predecessors, the gameplay received mixed reviews. Many compliments were directed at the new camera controls and combat interactions between party members. "GamePro" stated that the beginning was "sluggishly slow", but praised the action-oriented combat. GameSpot said that the fixed <a href="virtual%20camera%20system">camera system</a> and new gameplay dynamics improved the experience, but they felt the game was far too easy and that there was too much button-mashing. IGN also commented on the button-mashing aspect of the gameplay and criticized the party member's <a href="Game%20artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>, citing it as "absolutely terrible", but praised the story, presentation, and new battle features. Gpara.com had positive comments about the ease of combo attacks and complimented the steady pacing of the story and gameplay.

"Kingdom Hearts II" has been released in four different versions. The first three are the normal regional releases in Japan, North America, and <a href="PAL%20region">PAL region</a>s, which only differ nominally in content editing and localization. The European and Australian PAL releases were reformatted to run at 50 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a> to fit the definition size of <a href="PAL">PAL encoding systems</a>. The fourth version has additional content and was released under the title "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix". Like the previous titles, both Square and Disney released numerous types of merchandise before and after the game came out. Merchandise ranged from toys and figurines to clothing items and books. The game has also been adapted into both <a href="manga">manga</a> and novel series. Prior to the game's release, an "<a href="Ultimania">Ultimania</a>" book titled "Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania α ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~" came out. It provides extended information on the first two "Kingdom Hearts" games, as well as information on the unreleased "Kingdom Hearts II". After the release of the game, "Kingdom Hearts II Ultimania", which focuses on the game itself, came out. Another book, titled "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+ Ultimania", was released after the "Final Mix" version came out. Released along with "Final Mix", "Kingdom Hearts -Another Report-" was a hardback book which includes game information, visuals by <a href="Shiro%20Amano">Shiro Amano</a>, and a director interview. In North America, <a href="BradyGames">BradyGames</a> published two strategy guides—a standard guide and a limited edition version. The latter version was available in four different covers and included a copy of Jiminy's Journal along with 400 stickers.

Because the first game was re-released, there was speculation whether <a href="Tetsuya%20Nomura">Tetsuya Nomura</a> would do the same with "Kingdom Hearts II". In a "<a href="Weekly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Jump">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a>" interview with Nomura, he expressed interest in a possible <a href="Video%20game%20localization">international version</a> of "Kingdom Hearts II," although there were no definite plans. He said that should a "Final Mix" version arise, he had a "trump card" in mind, with such features as the Mushroom Heartless found in the first "Kingdom Hearts" game. In September 2006, Square Enix announced "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix", featuring new scenes and gameplay elements. Like the first re-release, this version would combine English audio with Japanese text and also use the "Sanctuary" theme song instead of "Passion". New cutscenes, however, used Japanese voice acting, as they mostly featured Organization XIII members from "Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories" who did not yet have English voice actors; these scenes were later re-dubbed into English for the "HD 2.5 Remix" release.

"Kingdom Hearts II" was re-released in Japan on March 29, 2007 as a 2-disc set titled "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+". The first disc contains "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix" with a new secret movie and additional battles and items. The second disc contains "Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories", a 3D PlayStation 2 remake of "" with extra scenes and voice acting. The battle system maintains the card gameplay, with the addition of Reaction Commands from "Kingdom Hearts II". Like the first game's Final Mix, the two games serve as a <a href="canon%20%28fiction%29">canonical</a> update to the series. The book "Kingdom Hearts -Another Report-" was included along with the game for those who reserved a copy. Based on <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> figures, "Final Mix+" was the number one PlayStation 2 game in sales during the week of its release in Japan. Nomura cited the presence of "Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories" to explain why "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix+" was so popular. Nevertheless, in a "Famitsu" poll in July 2011, "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix" was voted the most popular entry so far.

It was released for the first time outside Japan as part of "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20HD%202.5%20Remix">Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix</a>".

A manga series based on the game started its serialization in the June 2006 issue of the magazine "<a href="Monthly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Gangan">Monthly Shōnen Gangan</a>", published by Square Enix. The artist is Shiro Amano, who also did the "Kingdom Hearts" and "Chain of Memories" manga series. The first volume was released in Japan in December 2006. As a result of Amano working in the "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20358/2%20Days">Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days</a>" manga, the series has been on hiatus and resumed publication in October 2012. <a href="Tokyopop">Tokyopop</a> licensed the manga and released volume one in North America on July 3, 2007. The second volume was released the following year.

The game has also been novelized by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. The first volume, titled "Roxas—Seven Days", was released on April 22, 2006 and covers Roxas' story to when Sora wakes up and leaves Twilight Town. The novel depicts extra scenes that were added in the "Final Mix" version, such as interaction between Organization XIII members and between Axel, Naminé and Riku. The second book, "The Destruction of Hollow Bastion", was released on July 16, 2006, the third book, "Tears of Nobody," revolving around Roxas' past, was released on September 29, 2006, and the fourth book, "Anthem—Meet Again/Axel Last Stand," came out in February 2007.

In the credits of "HD 1.5 Remix", clips of "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix" were shown, hinting at its inclusion in another collection. On October 14, 2013, Square Enix announced "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20HD%202.5%20Remix">Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix</a>", a second compilation exclusively for the PlayStation 3 after "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20HD%201.5%20Remix">HD 1.5 Remix</a>", that includes both "Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix" and "<a href="Kingdom%20Hearts%20Birth%20by%20Sleep%20Final%20Mix">Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix</a>" in HD and trophy support. Additionally, the collection includes HD cinematic scenes from "" and was released in Japan on October 2, 2014, North America on December 2, 2014, Australia on December 4, 2014, and Europe on December 5, 2014.

Mayabazar () is a 1957 Indian <a href="epic%20film">epic</a> <a href="fantasy%20film">fantasy film</a> directed by <a href="Kadiri%20Venkata%20Reddy">Kadiri Venkata Reddy</a>. It was produced by <a href="B.%20Nagi%20Reddy">B. Nagi Reddy</a> and <a href="Aluri%20Chakrapani">Aluri Chakrapani</a> under their banner, <a href="Vijaya%20Vauhini%20Studios">Vijaya Vauhini Studios</a>. The film was shot in both <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> and <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> with the same title, but with a few differences in the cast. The story is an adaptation of the <a href="Folklore%20of%20India">folk tale</a> <a href="Sasirekha%20Parinayam">Sasirekha Parinayam</a>, which in turn is based on the epic "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>". It revolves around the roles of <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a> (<a href="N.%20T.%20Rama%20Rao">N. T. Rama Rao</a>) and <a href="Ghatotkacha">Ghatotkacha</a> (<a href="S.%20V.%20Ranga%20Rao">S. V. Ranga Rao</a>), as they try to reunite <a href="Arjuna">Arjuna</a> son <a href="Abhimanyu">Abhimanyu</a> (Telugu: <a href="Akkineni%20Nageswara%20Rao">Akkineni Nageswara Rao</a>, Tamil: <a href="Gemini%20Ganesan">Gemini Ganesan</a>) with his love, <a href="Balarama">Balarama</a> daughter (<a href="Savitri%20%28actress%29">Savitri</a>). The Telugu version features <a href="Gummadi%20Venkateswara%20Rao">Gummadi Venkateswara Rao</a>, <a href="Mukkamala">Mukkamala</a>, <a href="Ramana%20Reddy">Ramana Reddy</a>, and <a href="Relangi%20Venkata%20Ramaiah">Relangi Venkata Ramaiah</a> in supporting roles, with <a href="D.%20Balasubramaniam">D. Balasubramaniam</a>, <a href="R.%20Balasubramaniam">R. Balasubramaniam</a>, V. M. Ezhumalai, and <a href="K.%20A.%20Thangavelu">K. A. Thangavelu</a> playing those parts in the Tamil version.

The first <a href="Hindu%20mythology">mythological</a> film produced by their studio, "Mayabazar" marked a milestone for Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani. In addition to the technical crew, 400 studio workers – including light men, carpenters, and painters – participated in the development of the film. Director Reddy was meticulous with the <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a> and <a href="casting%20%28performing%20arts%29">casting</a> phases, which took nearly a year to complete. Though Rama Rao was initially reluctant to play the lead role, his portrayal of Krishna received acclaim and yielded more offers to reprise the same role in several unrelated films. The soundtrack features twelve songs, with most of the musical score composed by <a href="Ghantasala%20%28singer%29">Ghantasala</a>. Telugu lyrics were written by <a href="Pingali%20Nagendrarao">Pingali Nagendrarao</a> and Tamil lyrics were written by Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass. Four of the songs were composed by <a href="S.%20Rajeswara%20Rao">S. Rajeswara Rao</a> prior to his unexplained departure from the project. One of them was accompanied by the first illusion of moonlight in Indian cinema, shot by cinematographer <a href="Marcus%20Bartley">Marcus Bartley</a>.

"Mayabazar"s Telugu version was released on 27 March 1957; the Tamil version was released two weeks later, on 12 April. Both were critically and commercially successful, with a theatrical run of 100 days in 24 theatres, and it became a <a href="Silver%20jubilee%23South%20Asian%20film%20terminology">silver-jubilee</a> film. The Telugu version of "Mayabazar" was also dubbed into <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a>. The film is considered a landmark in both Telugu and Tamil cinema, with praise for its cast and technical aspects, despite the limitations of technology at the time. "Mayabazar" was screened at the <a href="Public%20Gardens%2C%20Hyderabad">Public Gardens in Hyderabad</a> for its 50th anniversary on 7 April 2007. <a href="Raavi%20Kondala%20Rao">Raavi Kondala Rao</a> <a href="novelization">novelized</a> the film's script based on Venkata Reddy's screenplay. A May 2013 <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a> poll selected "Mayabazar" as the greatest Indian film of all time.

"Mayabazar" became the first Telugu film to be digitally remastered and <a href="film%20colorization">colourised</a>, at an estimated cost of 75 million (valued at about US$1.7 million in 2010), after Hyderabad-based company Goldstone Technologies acquired <a href="negative%20pickup%20deal">world negative rights</a> to fourteen films including that of "Mayabazar" in late November 2007. The updated version was released on 30 January 2010 in 45 theatres in <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>. It was a commercial success that generated mostly positive reviews, one critic only expressing a preference for the original.

<a href="Subhadra">Subhadra</a> (the sister of <a href="Balarama">Balarama</a> and <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a>) marries a <a href="Pandava">Pandava</a> named <a href="Arjuna">Arjuna</a>. Their son <a href="Abhimanyu">Abhimanyu</a> falls in love with Balarama's daughter, Sasirekha. The families consent to their marrying when they reach adulthood. When Abhimanyu and Sasirekha have grown up, Krishna introduces them to each other. One day, the Pandavas are invited by <a href="Duryodhana">Duryodhana</a>, the eldest of the <a href="Kaurava">Kaurava</a>s to join in a game of dice. Duryodhana's uncle, <a href="Shakuni">Shakuni</a>, manipulates the results of the game, thereby costing the Pandavas their wealth, their liberty and their wife <a href="Draupadi">Draupadi</a>. Duryodhana's brother, <a href="Dushasana">Dushasana</a>, attempts to disrobe Draupadi. He is seen by Krishna, who, furious, comes to her rescue. On hearing what happened to the Pandavas, Balarama decides to teach the Kauravas a lesson and travels to their capital <a href="Hastinapur">Hastinapur</a>am. Shakuni and Duryodhana approach Balarama with an insincere respectful manner, then seek his approval of a marriage between Sasirekha and Duryodhana's son <a href="Laxman%20Kumara">Lakshmana Kumara</a>. Their true goal is to force Balarama and Krishna to support them if the Pandavas wage war. Unaware of their real intentions, Balarama agrees to the marriage.

Because of the Pandavas' ruined financial state, Balarama's wife, <a href="Revati">Revati</a>, refuses to honour her commitment to marry Sasirekha and Abhimanyu and expresses her support for the alliance with the Kauravas. Krishna, who is aware of Duryodhana and Shakuni's real intentions, orders his charioteer Daaruka to take Subhadra and Abhimanyu through the forests to <a href="Ghatotkacha">Ghatotkacha</a> hermitage. Ghatotkacha, who happens to be Abhimanyu's brother, at first thinks they are intruders in his forest and attacks them but later apologises for the misunderstanding. When Subhadra explains the change in the marriage arrangements, Ghatotkacha decides to wage war against both the Kauravas and Balarama. At the urging of his mother, Hidimbi, and Subhadra, Ghatotkacha abandons his plans and is advised instead to try some trickery in <a href="Dv%C4%81rak%C4%81">Dvaraka</a>. With the knowledge of Krishna and Sasirekha's servant, he carries the sleeping Sasirekha in her bed from Dvaraka, and flies to his hermitage. Assuming Sasirekha's form, he returns to Dvaraka and, with the help of his assistants Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, wreaks havoc on her wedding to Lakshmana Kumara, preventing the marriage from being carried out.

With the help of Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jambu, Ghatotkacha creates a magical town consisting of an illusory marketplace and palace. He names the town "Mayabazar" and invites the Kauravas to stay there. Chinnamaya, Lambu and Jamu introduce themselves to the Kauravas as servants appointed by Balarama to look after them. They manage to trick Sarma and Sastry, Shakuni's <a href="lackey%20%28manservant%29">lackeys</a>. Ghatotkacha (in Sasirekha's form) makes Duryodhana's wife rethink the marriage arrangement and teases Lakshmana Kumara. He plans the wedding of the real Sasirekha and Abhimanyu in his hermitage which is attended by Krishna. Using his divine powers, Krishna also attends as a guest for the marriage taking place in the "Mayabazar".

On the wedding day, Ghatotkacha appears before Lakshmana Kumara in various tantalising form while, at the hermitage, Sasirekha marries Abhimanyu. When Shakuni discovers what has really happened, he blames Krishna. <a href="Satyaki">Satyaki</a>, Arjuna's disciple, asks Shakuni to speak standing on a magical box. He proceeds to stand on the box, which makes him involuntarily explain the Kauravas' real intentions behind the marriage proposal. Ghatotkacha then reveals his identity. After humiliating the Kauravas, Ghatotkacha sends them back to Hastinapuram. Sasirekha's parents accept her marriage. They thank Ghatotkacha, who credits Krishna as the mastermind behind everything, including Abhimanyu and Sasirekha's marriage.



After the success of "<a href="Pathala%20Bhairavi">Pathala Bhairavi</a>" (1951), the production company, <a href="Vijaya%20Vauhini%20Studios">Vijaya Productions</a>, selected the film's technical crew for an adaptation of "Sasirekha Parinayam" (1936), also known as "<a href="Mayabazar%20%281936%20film%29">Mayabazar</a>". The eighth adaptation of the folk tale <a href="Sasirekha%20Parinayam">Sasirekha Parinayam</a>, it was the studio's first mythological film.

<a href="Kadiri%20Venkata%20Reddy">Kadiri Venkata Reddy</a> wrote and directed "Mayabazar", assisted by <a href="Singeetam%20Srinivasa%20Rao">Singeetam Srinivasa Rao</a>, and it was produced by <a href="B.%20Nagi%20Reddy">B. Nagi Reddy</a> and <a href="Aluri%20Chakrapani">Aluri Chakrapani</a> of Vijaya Productions. Nearly a year was spent on pre-production and casting. Pingali Nagendrarao assisted with the story, script, and lyrics. <a href="Ghantasala%20%28singer%29">Ghantasala</a> composed the film's score, and <a href="Marcus%20Bartley">Marcus Bartley</a> was the <a href="cinematographer">cinematographer</a>. "Mayabazar" was <a href="film%20editing">edited</a> by C. P. Jambulingam and G. Kalyanasundaram; Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar were the film's <a href="art%20director">art director</a>s.

The film was produced in <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a> and <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> versions, with a slightly different cast for each. <a href="Gemini%20Ganesan">Gemini Ganesan</a> appeared as <a href="Abhimanyu">Abhimanyu</a> in the Tamil version, which was portrayed by Akkineni Nageswara Rao in Telugu. <a href="Savitri%20%28actress%29">Savitri</a> was retained as the female lead in Tamil also, where her character was named Vatsala instead of Sasirekha. <a href="Sachu">Sachu</a> played the younger version of the character in Tamil. <a href="N.%20T.%20Rama%20Rao">N. T. Rama Rao</a>, hesitant to play <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a> after a negative response to his cameo appearance in "<a href="Sonta%20Ooru%20%281956%20film%29">Sonta Ooru</a>" (1956), agreed at Venkata Reddy's insistence and special care was taken with his costume and body language; "Mayabazar" was the first of Rama Rao's many appearances as Krishna. According to Rama Rao's widow <a href="Lakshmi%20Parvathi">Lakshmi Parvathi</a>, Nagi Reddy and Chakrapani had initially rejected Venkata Reddy's proposal to cast Rama Rao as Krishna, but he persuaded them into believing that Rama Rao was good for the role. As Rama Rao had a broad chest, Venkata Reddy suggested a slight narrowing to look apt as Krishna. In addition to following other suggestions by Venkata Reddy, Rama Rao read the Mahabharata, the <a href="Bhagavata%20Purana">Bhagavata</a> and other <a href="puranas">puranas</a> to understand Krishna's character and present it properly. <a href="S.%20V.%20Ranga%20Rao">S. V. Ranga Rao</a>, described by Nageswara Rao as the film's male lead in interviews, played the character of Ghatotkacha.

In the Telugu version, <a href="Gummadi%20Venkateswara%20Rao">Gummadi Venkateswara Rao</a> and <a href="Mikkilineni%20Radhakrishna%20Murthy">Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy</a> were cast as <a href="Balarama">Balarama</a> and <a href="Karna">Karna</a>, respectively, whilst Sita had a supporting role as Sasirekha's maid. <a href="Relangi%20Venkata%20Ramaiah">Relangi Venkata Ramaiah</a> portrayed Lakshmana Kumara, Duryodhana's son; his popularity inspired a song with him and Savitri. <a href="Allu%20Rama%20Lingaiah">Allu Rama Lingaiah</a> and <a href="Vangara%20Venkata%20Subbaiah">Vangara Venkata Subbaiah</a> enacted the parts of Shakuni's lackeys, Sarma and Sastry. Kanchi Narasimha Rao played Krishna, disguised as an old man who stops Ghatotkacha when he enters Dwaraka. The playback singer <a href="Madhavapeddi%20Satyam">Madhavapeddi Satyam</a> made a cameo appearance as Daaruka, singing "Bhali Bhali Bhali Deva". <a href="Ramana%20Reddy">Ramana Reddy</a> portrayed Chinnamayya, a <a href="Tantra">tantrik</a> who teaches witchcraft at Ghatotkacha's <a href="ashram">ashram</a>, with Chadalavada and Nalla Ramamurthy playing his apprentices Lambu and Jambu. <a href="Nagabhushanam%20%28actor%29">Nagabhushanam</a> played <a href="Satyaki">Satyaki</a>. <a href="Valluri%20Balakrishna">Valluri Balakrishna</a> was cast as Sarathi, and appeared only in the Telugu version of the film.

During rehearsals, Venkata Reddy timed his actors with a stopwatch, calculating the length of each scene (including songs) to determine the film's length. D. S. Ambu Rao, Bartley's assistant, said that "Mayabazar" was shot according to the screenplay and Bartley's lighting. The song "Lahiri Lahiri" was shot in <a href="Ennore">Ennore</a>, a suburb of <a href="Chennai">Chennai</a>. Its outdoor filming lasted for 10 to 15 seconds. Bartley then created an illusion of moonlight, which according to Ambu Rao was a first for an Indian film. Nageswara Rao was injured on the film's set, and action sequences featuring himself and Ranga Rao were shot only after his recovery, causing a three-month delay in the release of the film. Ganesan volunteered to act as Nageswara Rao's <a href="body%20double">body double</a> in a scene where Abhimanyu's character would jump from a second-floor balcony.

In addition to the principal technicians and actors, a crew of 400, including light men, carpenters, and painters, worked on "Mayabazar" during production. For the <a href="Dv%C4%81rak%C4%81">Dvaraka</a> set, 300 unique miniature houses were created in an approximately electrified space at Vauhini Studios under the supervision of Madhavapeddi Gokhale and Kaladhar. The desired effect in the "<a href="Laddu">laddoo</a> gobbling" shots of Ghatotkacha in the song "Vivaha Bhojanambu" took four days to film. The entire song was filmed using <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a> animation. In the scene where Ghatotkacha (disguised as Sasirekha) stamps Lakshmana Kumara's foot with his own, the expression is Savitri's; the stamping foot belongs to choreographer Pasumarthy Krishnamurthy, who pasted false hair on his foot to make it appear demonic.

After writing the music for four songs – "Srikarulu Devathalu", "Lahiri Lahiri", "Choopulu Kalisina Shubhavela" and "Neekosame" – <a href="S.%20Rajeswara%20Rao">S. Rajeswara Rao</a> left the project. Following his departure, Ghantasala orchestrated and recorded Rajeswara Rao's compositions with N. C. Sen Gupta and A. Krishnamurthy, and composed the rest of the film's score. The soundtrack album has 12 songs with lyrics by Pingali Nagendrarao and Thanjai N. Ramaiah Dass for the Telugu and Tamil versions, respectively, and was mixed by A. Krishnan and Siva Ram. The album was engineered by N. C. Sen Gupta and orchestrated by A. Krishnamurthy. <a href="P.%20Leela">P. Leela</a> said in an interview that one of her songs took 28 takes to record, and her fifth song was finished by Ghantasala. "Lahiri Lahiri" ("Aaga Inba Nilavinile" in Tamil) was based on the <a href="Mohanam">Mohanam</a> <a href="raga">raga</a>. "Vivaha Bhojanambu" ("Kalyana Samayal Saadham" in Tamil) was heavily based on lyrics from <a href="Surabhi%20%28theatre%20group%29">Surabhi Nataka Samajam</a>'s 1950s plays, which were influenced by 1940s "Janaki Sapadham" <a href="harikatha">harikatha</a> records by B. Nagarajakumari.

Nagarajakumari was inspired by a song written by <a href="Gali%20Penchala%20Narasimha%20Rao">Gali Penchala Narasimha Rao</a> for "Sasirekha Parinayam" (1936), directed by P. V. Das. That song's melody was inspired by <a href="Charles%20Penrose%20%28entertainer%29">Charles Penrose</a>'s 1922 song "<a href="The%20Laughing%20Policeman%20%28song%29">The Laughing Policeman</a>", written by Penrose under the pseudonym of Charles Jolly. According to M. L. Narasimham of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", music "flowed at its mellifluous best" in "Mayabazar". He added that Ghantasala "gave a new lease of life" to the song "Vivaha Bhojanambu", despite it being a borrowed tune.

The Telugu version of "Mayabazar" was released on 27 March 1957, and the Tamil version two weeks later on 12 April. Both versions have a film-reel length of . A commercial success, "Mayabazar" had a theatrical run of 100 days in 24 theatres and went on to become a <a href="silver%20jubilee">silver jubilee</a> film. After the film's release, 40,000 colour calendars of Rama Rao as Krishna were distributed to the public. The Telugu version of "Mayabazar" was dubbed into <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a> with the same name in 1965; it remained the last Indian film to be dubbed into Kannada until the announcement of a dubbed version of "<a href="Kochadaiiyaan">Kochadaiiyaan</a>" (2014) after 50 years.

<a href="Dasari%20Narayana%20Rao">Dasari Narayana Rao</a> remade the film later with the same title. "Mayabazar" was shown at the <a href="Public%20Gardens%2C%20Hyderabad">Public Gardens in Hyderabad</a> on 7 April 2007 for the film's 50th anniversary, at a celebration organised by the <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> Department of Culture, the Film, TV and Theatre Development Corporation and Kinnera Art Theatres. Nageswara Rao and <a href="C.%20Narayana%20Reddy">C. Narayana Reddy</a>, who were associated with the film, were honoured on the occasion. The former released a book written by <a href="Raavi%20Kondala%20Rao">Raavi Kondala Rao</a> at Lalitha Kala Thoranam located in the Public Gardens. Kondala Rao novelised the film's script based on Venkata Reddy's screenplay.

The film received positive reviews from critics, particularly for the work of its technical crew. In 2006, W. Chandrakanth of "The Hindu" wrote: The greatness of the director lies here – he successfully reduces all characters to ordinary mortals displaying all the follies of human beings except Ghatothkacha or Krishna. And then he injects into the Yadava household a Telugu atmosphere, full with its simile, imagery, adage, sarcasm and wit. The result – a feast for the eyes and soul. That is "Mayabazar" for you. Vijaysree Venkatraman wrote for "The Hindu" in 2008 that the "special effects in this summer's Hollywood superhero movies were spectacular, but, for me, the mythological hasn't lost any of its magic", adding, "If watching the genial half-demon polish off a wedding feast single-handedly remains a treat, seeing the greedy duo from the groom's side get whacked alternately by the furniture and the wilful carpet has me in splits". "The Hindu" film critic M. L. Narasimham wrote: "Though there were several movie versions in various Indian languages, the 1957 Vijaya Productions' "Mayabazar" is still considered the best for its all round excellence". According to "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>", "With a powerful cast and a strong script, this movie is a stealer. Savitri, NTR [N. T. Rama Rao], ANR [Akkineni Nageswara Rao], SV Rangarao and not to mention Suryakantam add layers to their characters. Of course, the language and the dialogues, simply unbeatable. Some of the scenes are simply hilarious."

In his 2013 book "Bollywood Nation: India through Its Cinema", Vamsee Juluri wrote, ""Maya Bazar" appeal is of course as much in its story as in its stars. But the performances and the beautiful songs and sets aside, the film also reveals an interesting feature of the Telugu mythological in its Golden Ageit is a story about something not very important from a doctrinal view of religion at all". Juluri also termed Ranga Rao's performance as "mighty and majestic". In April 2013, <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a> referred to "Mayabazar" as a "pioneer in every sense". They praised its cinematography and music, adding that Rama Rao "proved his calibre as a method actor". In their 2015 book, "Transcultural Negotiations of Gender: Studies in (Be)longing", Saugata Bhaduri and Indrani Mukherjee opined that "Mayabazar" "both breaks and perpetuates the stereotypes for masculine and feminine "bhavas" by making a single female actor Savitri perform both the set of emotions".

"Mayabazar" was the first colourised Telugu film, with its audio remastered from monaural to a <a href="DTS%20%28sound%20system%29">DTS</a> 5.1-channel system. In late November 2007 a Hyderabad company, Goldstone Technologies, acquired world negative rights to 14 Telugu films produced by Vijaya Vauhini Studios, including that of Mayabazar, to digitally remaster them in colour. C. Jagan Mohan of Goldstone Technologies' experience at <a href="Akashvani%20%28radio%20broadcaster%29">All India Radio</a> gave him the idea of converting the film's audio to DTS. The audio was restored, sound effects remastered, distortion eliminated, and the volume of the vocals increased, and musicians re-recorded the film's background music on seven tracks instead of one.
A team of 165 people worked for eight months; Mohan used 180,000 shades of colour to create a tone similar to human skin, and employed 16.7-million-shade colour technology. Apart from colouring clothing and jewellery, Mohan said that the song "Vivaha Bhojanambu" and the wedding scene in the climax were the most challenging sequences, and that the food should look more realistic after colourisation. In the wedding scene, Mohan explained: "Each and every rose petal strewn on the pathway had to be coloured. Further, each frame in the climax has many actors. In technical parlance, we refer to a set of colours used for skin tone, clothes, jewelry and so on as different masks. If five or six masks were used on one character, the presence of many actors in a frame called for that much more work." Three songs ("Bhali Bhali Deva", "Vinnavamma Yashodha" and "Choopulu Kalisina Subha Vela") and many poems were cut from the remastered colour version to maintain print quality.

With an estimated digitalisation budget of 75 million (valued at about US$1.7 million in 2010), "Mayabazar" was released in colour on 30 January 2010 in 45 Andhra Pradesh theatres. The colourised version was distributed by <a href="R.%20B.%20Choudary">R. B. Choudary</a> under his production banner, Super Good Films. Nageswara Rao, Gummadi Venkateswara Rao, Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy and Sita were the only cast members still alive for the release of the digitally remastered version. The colour version received positive reviews and was commercially successful. M. L. Narasimham of "The Hindu" called the new version "laudable, but the soul was missing", adding, "Get a DVD of the original (Black & White) movie, watch it and you will agree with ANR [Akkineni Nageswara Rao] who while talking about "Mayabazar" once exclaimed, 'What a picture it was!'".

According to a 29 January 2010 government order, the remastered version was exempted from <a href="entertainment%20tax">entertainment tax</a>, although theatre owners charged full price because they and other film producers were uncertain of the order's validity. Despite "Mayabazar" success, Mohan decided not to remaster the remaining 14 films; according to him, most producers who sold negative rights to TV channels lost control of them, and he cited legal and copyright issues.

The Film Heritage Foundation announced in March 2015 that they would be restoring "Mayabazar", along with a few other Indian films from 1931 to 1965, as a part of their restoration projects carried out in India and abroad in accordance with international parameters. The foundation opposed digital colourisation, stating that they "believe in the original repair as the way the master or the creator had seen it".

"Mayabazar" is considered a classic of Telugu cinema, particularly in its use of technology. The film is memorable for Nagendra Rao's dialogue: "Evaru puttinchakunte maatalela pudathayi" ("How would words emerge if no one invented them?") and "Subhadra, aagadalu, aghaaityalu naaku paniki raavu" ("Subhadra, these atrocities mean nothing to me."). Various words and phrases, such as "antha alamalame kada" ("Is everything fine?"), "Asamadiyulu" ("Friends"), "Tasamadiyulu" ("Enemies"), "Gilpam" and "Gimbali" ("bed-" and "room-mat"), later became part of Telugu vernacular. The success of "<a href="Donga%20Ramudu">Donga Ramudu</a>" (1955) and "Mayabazar" prompted Venkata Reddy to produce the 1958 Telugu film "<a href="Pellinaati%20Pramanalu">Pellinaati Pramanalu</a>" ("Vazhkai Oppantham" in Tamil). It recovered its investment and won the silver medal at the annual <a href="National%20Film%20Awards">National Film Awards</a>.

A <a href="Aha%20Naa%20Pellanta%20%281987%20film%29">1987 Telugu film</a> directed by <a href="Jandhyala%20Subramanya%20Sastry">Jandhyala Subramanya Sastry</a> and a <a href="Aha%20Naa%20Pellanta%20%282011%20film%29">2011 Telugu film</a> directed by Veerabhadram Chowdary were named after the song "Aha Naa Pellanta" from the film; both were successful. Jandhyala Subramanya Sastry named his 1988 Telugu films "<a href="Vivaaha%20Bhojanambu">Vivaaha Bhojanambu</a>" and "<a href="Choopulu%20Kalisina%20Shubhavela">Choopulu Kalisina Shubhavela</a>" after the songs of the same
name. Telugu comedian <a href="Mallikarjuna%20Rao%20%28actor%29">Mallikarjuna Rao</a> considered "Mayabazar" to be the "greatest comedy film ever", adding that it represents "one of the most transcendental and joyful experiences any movie-lover can hope for". Telugu director <a href="Mohan%20Krishna%20Indraganti">Mohan Krishna Indraganti</a> named his second film "Mayabazar" (2006, also a fantasy film). Regarding his title, Indraganti said he was a fan of "Mayabazar" and named his film (produced by B. Satyanarayana) at the insistence of writer D. V. Narasaraju.

In January 2007, M. L. Narasimham of "The Hindu" listed "Mayabazar" with "<a href="Mala%20Pilla">Mala Pilla</a>" (1938), "<a href="Raithu%20Bidda">Raithu Bidda</a>" (1939), "<a href="Vara%20Vikrayam%20%28film%29">Vara Vikrayam</a>" (1939), "<a href="Bhakta%20Potana">Bhakta Potana</a>" (1942), "<a href="Shavukaru">Shavukaru</a>" (1950), "<a href="Malliswari%20%281951%20film%29">Malliswari</a>" (1951) "<a href="Peddamanushulu">Peddamanushulu</a>" (1954) and "<a href="Lava%20Kusa">Lava Kusa</a>" (1963) as films that have influenced society and Telugu cinema. Rama Rao reprised the role of Krishna in several films over a two-decade career.

Singeetam Srinivasa Rao used "Mayabazar" storyline in his 2008 multilingual animation film "<a href="Ghatothkach">Ghatothkach</a>". Director <a href="Krishna%20Vamsi">Krishna Vamsi</a> called "Mayabazar" more an "epic, than a mere classic" and said that the film's tagline, "Sasirekha Parinayam", inspired the title of his <a href="Sasirekha%20Parinayam%20%28film%29">2009 Telugu film</a>. In February 2010, acting coach and director L. Satyanand compared "Mayabazar" to films such as "<a href="The%20Ten%20Commandments%20%281956%20film%29">The Ten Commandments</a>" (1956), "<a href="Ben-Hur%20%281959%20film%29">Ben-Hur</a>" (1959), "<a href="Sholay">Sholay</a>" (1975) and "<a href="Avatar%20%282009%20film%29">Avatar</a>" (2009), saying that they "are evergreen and never fade away from the mind", with continued appeal. Satyanand praised Bartley's cinematography, saying that the film ... was definitely ahead of its time. It is still a mystery how Marcus Bartley could morph Sasirekha through the ripples in the pond. It was an absolute masterpiece, considering the equipment in use, those days. In the absence of hi-def cameras, computer generated visual effects and high-end computers, the direction, cinematography and visual effects were efforts of sheer human genius.

In the period drama "<a href="Rajanna">Rajanna</a>" (2011), the central character Mallamma (played by Baby Annie) listens to "Mayabazar" songs. Although this was criticised as <a href="anachronism">anachronistic</a>, director <a href="K.%20V.%20Vijayendra%20Prasad">K. V. Vijayendra Prasad</a> said that "Rajanna" was set in 1958, a year after "Mayabazar" release. In <a href="Ram%20Gopal%20Varma">Ram Gopal Varma</a> "<a href="Katha%20Screenplay%20Darsakatvam%20Appalaraju">Katha Screenplay Darsakatvam Appalaraju</a>" (2011), its protagonist Appalaraju (played by <a href="Sunil%20%28actor%29">Sunil</a>), an aspiring director, is shown enjoying a sequence from the song "Lahiri Lahiri" in the song "Mayabazaaru". In her article "The making of Tollywood", commemorating the 81st anniversary of the Indian Telugu film industry, Sunita Raghu of "<a href="The%20New%20Indian%20Express">The New Indian Express</a>" called "Mayabazar" the "tour de force" of Telugu cinema. In November 2012, "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" listed "Mayabazar" along with other unrelated films such as "<a href="Missamma">Missamma</a>" (1955), "<a href="Gundamma%20Katha">Gundamma Katha</a>" (1962), "<a href="Nartanasala">Nartanasala</a>" (1963), and "<a href="Bommarillu">Bommarillu</a>" (2006) in the list "Telugu classics to watch along with family this Deepavali". For the April 2013 centennial of Indian cinema, CNN-News18 included "Mayabazar" in its list of "The 100 greatest Indian films of all time", and a May 2013 CNN-News18 poll ranked it the greatest Indian film of all time. In commemoration of the centennial of Indian cinema, "The Hindu" listed "Mayabazar" along with "<a href="Pathala%20Bhairavi">Pathala Bhairavi</a>" (1951), "Missamma", "Gundamma Katha", "<a href="Maduve%20Madi%20Nodu">Maduve Madi Nodu</a>" (1965), "<a href="Ram%20Aur%20Shyam">Ram Aur Shyam</a>" (1967), "<a href="Julie%20%281975%20film%29">Julie</a>" (1975), and "<a href="Shriman%20Shrimati">Shriman Shrimati</a>" (1982) as the iconic films produced by Nagi Reddy.

CNN-News18 included "Mayabazar" on its February 2014 list of "12 Indian films that would make great books", and in May 2014 Rediff included the film on its list of "The Best Mythological Films of Tamil Cinema". The Tamil film "<a href="Kalyana%20Samayal%20Saadham">Kalyana Samayal Saadham</a>" (2013) was named after the song of the same name. The Andhra Pradesh state government planned to introduce the film as part of the tenth standard English syllabus in 2014. The fourth unit of the English textbook, "Films and Theatres", mentions "Mayabazar" and its actors and has two stills from the film. In March 2012, film historian <a href="Mohan%20Raman">Mohan Raman</a> stated in an interview with "The Times of India" that "Mayabazar", which "perfected the art of trick photography", was "among the significant black and white films of yore", along with "<a href="Andha%20Naal">Andha Naal</a>" (1954) and "<a href="Uthama%20Puthiran%20%281940%20film%29">Uthama Puthiran</a>" (1940).

The scene in which Krishna reveals his identity to Ghatotkacha at Dvaraka was used in "<a href="Gopala%20Gopala%20%282015%20film%29">Gopala Gopala</a>" (2015), with <a href="Pawan%20Kalyan">Pawan Kalyan</a> as Krishna. References were made to Shakuni's character in the film "<a href="Pataas">Pataas</a>" (2015) starring Rama Rao's grandson <a href="Nandamuri%20Kalyan%20Ram">Nandamuri Kalyan Ram</a>. Director <a href="S.%20S.%20Rajamouli">S. S. Rajamouli</a> told film critic <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> that Venkata Reddy's work in "Mayabazar" was a "huge inspiration" for him to make "" (2015) and "". Writing for DailyO, an online opinion platform from the <a href="India%20Today">India Today</a> Group, actor <a href="Rana%20Daggubati">Rana Daggubati</a> opined that films like "Mayabazar" were "truly cutting edge" and added, "Considering the technological limitations technicians were working with back then, these were phenomenally commendable instances of the Indian cinema". In an interview with "The Hindu" in November 2015, actor <a href="Kamal%20Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a> noted, "Visual appeal has always gone hand-in-hand with content, since the days of "<a href="Chandralekha%20%281948%20film%29">Chandralekha</a>" and , not just after "Baahubali"." A 90-minute theatrical adaptation of the film was staged in December 2016 by Bangalore Little Theatre.

Cerro Azul (Chile volcano)

Cerro Azul (, "blue hill" in <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>), sometimes referred to as Quizapu, is an active <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a> in the <a href="Maule%20Region">Maule Region</a> of central <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, immediately south of <a href="Descabezado%20Grande">Descabezado Grande</a>. Part of the <a href="Andean%20Volcanic%20Belt">South Volcanic Zone</a> of the <a href="Andes">Andes</a>, its summit is above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>, and is capped by a summit crater that is wide and opens to the north. Beneath the summit, the volcano features numerous <a href="scoria">scoria</a> <a href="Volcanic%20cone%23Cinder%20cone">cone</a>s and flank vents.

Cerro Azul is responsible for several of South America's largest recorded eruptions, in 1846 and 1932. In 1846, an <a href="effusive%20eruption">effusive eruption</a> formed the vent at the site of present-day <a href="%23Quizapu%20Crater">Quizapu crater</a> on the northern flank of Cerro Azul and sent lava flowing down the sides of the volcano, creating a <a href="lava%20field">lava field</a> 8–9 square kilometres (3–3.5 square miles) in area. <a href="Phreatic">Phreatic</a> and <a href="Strombolian">Strombolian</a> volcanism between 1907 and 1932 excavated this crater. In 1932, one of the largest explosive eruptions of the 20th century occurred at Quizapu Crater and sent of ash into the atmosphere. The volcano's most recent eruption was in 1967.

The South Volcanic Zone has a long history of eruptions and poses a threat to the surrounding region. Any <a href="volcanic%20hazards">volcanic hazard</a>—ranging from minor ashfalls to <a href="pyroclastic%20flow">pyroclastic flow</a>s—could pose a significant risk to humans and wildlife. Despite its inactivity, Cerro Azul could again produce a major eruption; if this were to happen, relief efforts would probably be quickly organized. Teams such as the <a href="Volcano%20Disaster%20Assistance%20Program">Volcano Disaster Assistance Program</a> (VDAP) are prepared to effectively evacuate, assist, and rescue people threatened by volcanic eruptions.

<a href="Andean%20Volcanic%20Belt">Volcanism in the Chilean Andes</a> is caused by <a href="subduction">subduction</a> of the <a href="Nazca%20Plate">Nazca</a> and <a href="Antarctic%20Plate">Antarctic</a> <a href="tectonic%20plate">tectonic plate</a>s under the <a href="South%20American%20Plate">South American Plate</a>. Volcanoes in Chile occur in the <a href="Central%20Volcanic%20Zone">Central</a> (CVZ), <a href="South%20Volcanic%20Zone">South</a> (SVZ), and <a href="Austral%20Volcanic%20Zone">Austral</a> Volcanic Zones (AVZ). The gap that separates the Central and South Volcanic Zones is caused by shallow-angle subduction in the <a href="Pampean%20flat-slab%20segment">Pampean flat-slab segment</a> where the more buoyant <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Ridge">Juan Fernández Ridge</a> subducts under the South American continent. This buoyant region prevents the <a href="Slab%20%28geology%29">slab</a> (subducting tectonic plate) from diving deep into the <a href="mantle%20%28geology%29">mantle</a>, where the heat and pressure would destabilize the mineral <a href="Chlorite%20group">chlorite</a>, releasing water that would in turn cause <a href="flux%20melting">melting</a> and <a href="volcanism">volcanism</a>. The <a href="Patagonian%20Volcanic%20Gap">Patagonian Volcanic Gap</a>, which separates the South and Austral Volcanic Zones, is caused by the subduction of the <a href="Chile%20Ridge">Chile Ridge</a>, though it is less clear whether this gap also is due to <a href="flat-slab%20subduction">flat-slab subduction</a>; it may instead arise because melting of the subducting slab there produced <a href="felsic">felsic</a> <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a>s instead of volcanoes.

Offshore volcanism also occurs in Chile. Intraplate volcanism generated from the <a href="Easter%20hotspot">Easter</a> and <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20hotspot">Juan Fernández</a> <a href="Hotspot%20%28geology%29">hotspot</a>s has formed many Chilean islands, including <a href="Isla%20Salas%20y%20G%C3%B3mez">Isla Salas y Gómez</a>, <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>, and the <a href="Juan%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Islands">Juan Fernández Islands</a>. Underwater volcanism occurs due to <a href="seafloor%20spreading">seafloor spreading</a> along the Chile Ridge.

Nearly 100 <a href="Quaternary">Quaternary</a> (<a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>- or <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>-age) independent volcanoes exist in the country, in addition to 60 volcanic complexes and <a href="caldera">caldera</a> systems. Of the 200 historically active volcanoes in the Andean Range, 36 are found in Chile.

Cerro Azul is part of the South Volcanic Zone, which runs through central and western Chile and extends south to Argentina. This range includes at least nine <a href="volcanic%20field">caldera complexes</a>, more than 70 of Chile's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields that have been active in the Quaternary, and hundreds of minor eruptive centres. The South Volcanic Zone is the most volcanically active region in Chile, and produces around one eruption per year. Its largest historical eruption was at Quizapu Crater, located on the north side of Cerro Azul's summit (see below), and its most active volcanoes are <a href="Llaima">Llaima</a> and <a href="Villarrica%20%28volcano%29">Villarrica</a>.

Cerro Azul, just south of <a href="Descabezado%20Grande">Descabezado Grande</a> volcano, is part of the Descabezado Grande–Cerro Azul eruptive system, a volcanic field that comprises its two large namesake volcanic edifices and several smaller vents, including 12 Holocene calderas. Both volcanoes lie on top of the Casitas Shield, a plateau built of over 100 <a href="lava%20flow">lava flow</a>s that erupted in at least 12 volcanic episodes during the Quaternary period. The upper lava layers are dated at 340,000 years.

As with the majority of the Andean volcanoes, Cerro Azul is a <a href="stratovolcano">stratovolcano</a>, meaning that it consists of layers, or <a href="stratum">strata</a>, of <a href="volcanic%20ash">volcanic ash</a> and <a href="lava%20flows">lava flows</a>. The cone of Cerro Azul has a total volume of about , and is a young feature, formed in the Holocene. It is made of agglutinated <a href="pyroclast">pyroclast</a>s and some <a href="dacite">dacite</a>–<a href="andesine">andesine</a> lavas. The cone has a few volcanic craters; the majority of its eruptions in <a href="recorded%20history">recorded history</a> have originated from Quizapu Crater on the northern flank of Cerro Azul's cone. Other craters lying on the flanks of the main cone are Caracol ("Snail"), Crater los Quillayes, Crater la Resolana, and Crater sin Nombre ("Nameless Crater"). All of the craters lie between in elevation, except Quizapu, which is up the volcano. The summit of Cerro Azul is crowned by an asymmetric crater about in diameter. Pleistocene glacial activity is evident in the form of 500 meter (1,640 ft) deep struts in the volcanoes' sides. These deep cuts have revealed strata of older rock.

Quizapu, which formed during the 1846 eruption, is the most prominent crater. It is also known as Cerro del Medio ("Middle Hill") or Volcan Nuevo ("New Volcano"). The volcanic vent formed during an effusive eruption involving <a href="hornblende">hornblende</a>–dacite flows accompanied by <a href="tephra">tephra</a>, and the crater was excavated by <a href="phreatic%20eruption">phreatic</a> and <a href="strombolian%20eruption">Strombolian</a> eruptions between 1907 and 1932. Pent-up pressure within the volcano spawned an enormous <a href="Plinian%20eruption">Plinian eruption</a> in 1932. The volume of lava ejected during this single event is roughly equal to that ejected during the rest of the eruptive history at Quizapu, since its formation in 1846. Although of material was ejected, no <a href="subsidence">subsidence</a> was detected from the removal of magma. Because of <a href="drag%20%28physics%29">aerodynamic drag</a>, a Plinian eruption excavates a circular crater. As the earlier eruptions had already formed an approximately circular caldera, the Plinian eruption was able to proceed efficiently, with minimal drag and minimal reshaping of the crater.

The Quizapu Crater is almost perfectly circular, and rises to a prominence of above the surrounding portions of the volcano. Cresting at in elevation, Quizapu is one of the highest known Plinian craters. The radius of the crater floor, which is the current inner vent, is around , while the radius of its rim is . The crater floor lies at , and the rim lies above that, giving the walls an average slope of 34–35 degrees (close to the <a href="angle%20of%20repose">angle of repose</a>). The western wall is cut by two long, dacitic lava flows: probably the remnants of a <a href="lava%20dome">dome</a> or an eruption. The crater is surrounded by debris from its 1932 eruption, and topped by layers— thick—of mafic <a href="scoria">scoria</a> and ash.

Cerro Azul is situated in a <a href="Mediterranean%20climate">Mediterranean climate</a> zone, characterized by hot and dry summers but mild and wet winters. The temperatures and <a href="Precipitation%20%28meteorology%29">precipitation</a> are strongly dependent on topography. In the Andes the annual average maximum temperatures lie in the range , while minimum temperatures are below . Annual precipitation is up to 800 mm (31.5 inches).

Vegetation in the Andes varies with elevation. Above 1,600 meters (5,249 ft) the slopes of mountains are covered by <a href="Alpine%20climate">Alpine</a>-like <a href="steppe">steppe</a>, while below there are zones of "<a href="Nothofagus">Nothofagus</a>" forest, "Hygrophilous" forest, <a href="Mediterranean%20forests%2C%20woodlands%2C%20and%20scrub">"Sclerophylous" forest</a>, and <a href="matorral">matorral</a>. The number of plant species is likely to exceed 2,000, although no comprehensive study of the flora of Central Chile has been undertaken.

Cerro Azul has a history of eruptions dating back to at least 1846. The known events include effusive eruptions (lava flows), which created the Quizapu vent, <a href="explosive%20eruption">explosive eruption</a>s, and phreatic eruptions. <a href="Pyroclastic%20flow">Pyroclastic flow</a>s have also been observed as a result of some of these explosive eruptions. The earliest recorded eruption began on November 26, 1846, while the volcano's last eruption began on August 9, 1967. The volcano has produced two of the largest eruptions in South America in recorded history, in 1846 and 1932. Both released of the dacitic magma.

On November 26, 1846, Cerro Azul erupted. This was the first report of activity at the volcano, and no trace of <a href="fumarole">fumarole</a>s, adjacent vents, or pre-eruptive activity exists. Most descriptions of the eruption come from the backcountry herdsmen (<a href="arriero">arriero</a>s). One, who was camped in a valley approximately east of Quizapu, heard "a great noise and a cloud of ash" emanate from the mountain in the late afternoon. No precursor activity was reported, and the herdsman claimed that there were no earthquakes during the late afternoon eruption.

That night, two herdsmen near the site heard a continuous roar, punctuated by loud bangs and crackling sounds "like that of great rockslides". Lightning and thunder accompanied the spectacle. They saw many blue flames, and were choked by <a href="sulfur">sulfurous gas</a>. Observers in <a href="Talca%2C%20Chile">Talca</a> away heard the eruption noises, and the sulfurous odors reached them the day after the eruption. None of the reports mention earthquakes or ash fall, though the crackling and banging sounds could be from <a href="block%20lava">block lava</a>s (aā).

This first recorded eruption of Cerro Azul was effusive, and formed the volcanic vent at Quizapu. Hornblende–dacite lava erupted with small masses of tephra, which had been <a href="degassing">degassed</a> shortly before the eruption. Lava flowed over the <a href="Estero%20Barroso%20Valley">Estero Barroso Valley</a> and westward into the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Blanquillo%20Valley">Río Blanquillo Valley</a>. By November 28, the volcano appeared at rest, and the herdsman returned to the place of first observation. There, they found a blocky lava field. The lava was still hot, fuming and crackling with gas and flame. Fascinated by the volcano, <a href="Ignacy%20Domeyko">Ignacy Domeyko</a> traveled to Chile to study the field and found its width to be . By 1992 the field had grown to twice that size.

Cerro Azul was quiet from 1846 to the beginning of the 20th century. After a possible precursor explosive event in 1903, Cerro Azul once again erupted in 1907. Between 1907 and 1914, plumes and clouds of ash frequently rose out of the caldera, and at least a few of these events were explosive. On September 8, 1914, an explosive eruption sent a <a href="Eruption%20column">plume</a> 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4 mi) into the air over 8 minutes. By 1916, these eruptions had produced a caldera nearly identical to the one in existence today.

The volcano also erupted phreatically several times, as recorded by Vogel in 1913 and 1920, with its activity increasing from 1916 to 1926. During these years, the eruptions grew more frequent and more violent. A major outburst on November 2, 1927 started a period of nearly continuous violent eruptions that lasted until 1929. During this period, Cerro Azul sometimes erupted daily, sending columns of ash as far as 6 or 7 kilometers (about 4 mi) into the air. Quizapu Crater grew slightly during this eruptive period.

Pre-1932 volcanism was largely phreatic or fumarolic, as evidenced by the lack of tephra generated by these eruptions. Photographs from 1912 show vapor plumes containing little ash, rising above the crater.

By 1932, Quizapu had produced many phreatic events and one effusive eruption, but no large Plinian eruptions. This frequency of minor eruptive activity proved to be a precursor for a major eruption. On 25 January 1932, observers in <a href="Malargue">Malargue</a> saw a large black cloud over the summit. By 9 April, the volcano emitted green gas and started to "bellow like a bull". On April 10, Cerro Azul finally erupted, releasing a towering column or plume of white gas. After 10 AM, the plume turned black with ash and began to form an umbrella shape. The ash was carried by wind into <a href="Puesto%20El%20Tristan">Puesto El Tristan</a> in Argentina, about away, where beginning at 1 PM it rained down for hours. At 4 PM, coarser sandy material and some <a href="pumice">pumice</a> <a href="lapilli">lapilli</a> began to fall.

Cerro Azul's April 1932 eruption was one of the largest of the 20th century. Releasing of lava, the volcano ejected primarily dacitic tephra, accompanied by <a href="rhyodacite">rhyodacite</a>, <a href="andesite">andesite</a>, and minuscule amounts of andesitic and <a href="basalt">basalt</a>ic scoria. At least one eruptive period lasted for 18  hours, creating an "exceptionally uniform" deposit. Eruption columns, extending into the air, were sighted. <a href="Phenocrysts">Phenocrysts</a> were similar to the effusive eruption in 1846. Soon after, both the <a href="Tinguiririca%20%28volcano%29">Tinguiririca</a> and Descabezado Grande volcanoes began erupting, sending clouds of ash into Argentina. The eruption had a <a href="Volcanic%20Explosivity%20Index">Volcanic Explosivity Index</a> (VEI) of at least 5.

Since the eruption of 1932 Quizapu has been quiet. In 1949 and 1967 small ash clouds were reported, while in the 1980s there were no signs of activity other than fumaroles.

Cerro Azul is in the South Volcanic Zone, where many volcanoes pose a threat to human life. Among the other active volcanoes of the South Volcanic Zone are <a href="Mount%20Hudson">Mount Hudson</a>, Llaima, and Villarrica. Villarrica and Llaima together have more than 80 reported episodes of volcanism since 1558, and at least 40 South Volcanic Zone volcanoes have had Holocene-age eruptions.

Every known type of eruption (<a href="Hawaiian%20eruption">Hawaiian</a>, Strombolian, Plinian, <a href="Subplinian%20eruption">subplinian</a>, phreatic, <a href="Phreatomagmatic%20eruption">phreatomagmatic</a>, and <a href="Vulcanian%20eruption">Vulcanian</a>) has occurred at some point in the range. Cerro Azul itself has experienced phreatic, Strombolian, and Plinian activity in human history. The type of eruption tends to correspond with lava composition. Strombolian eruptions at Llaima, Antuco, Villarrica, and elsewhere have been produced by basaltic to basaltic–andesitic activity. Dacitic to <a href="rhyolite">rhyolitic</a> lavas have been linked to subplinian and Plinian eruptions, such as those at Quizapu (1932) and Hudson (1991). Because of this variability, volcanic hazards from Cerro Azul and the surrounding region could come in many different forms. Historical eruptions typically have produced lahars, lava flows, and ashfalls. Lava flows and <a href="lahar">lahar</a>s could wipe out entire cities or towns. Ashfall produced by explosive eruptions could interfere with air traffic. Most threatening of all is the risk of pyroclastic flows or avalanches, which have historically traversed as far as in the region.

Past eruptions of Quizapu Crater ejected enormous amounts of ash that traveled as far as Brazil. After the 1932 eruption, the local vegetation was devastated, and the area remained barren until the 1990s, though human life was not impacted. Despite the extent of its eruptions, the threat to humans from Quizapu is relatively small because of the remote location of Cerro Azul. Nevertheless, the size of past eruptions is large enough for scientists to be worried. Evidence of a potentially deadly threat lies in a lahar at Descabezado Grande. Historically, lahars have killed thousands in the Andes. There is, however, a possibility that a large reservoir of rhyodacite magma may exist under the Azul–Descabezado complex. If this is the case, all previous eruptions in 1846–1967 were only preliminary, preclimactic leaks from the large magma chamber beneath, and a large caldera-forming eruption may be expected in the future.

If Cerro Azul were to erupt, relief efforts could be orchestrated. The Volcanic Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP) formed in response to the <a href="Armero%20tragedy">famous eruption</a> of <a href="Nevado%20del%20Ruiz">Nevado del Ruiz</a> in <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a>, and responded to the 1991 eruption of Mount Hudson in Chile. The team's stated aim is to "reduce eruption-caused fatalities and economic losses in developing countries". Made up of various USGS offices (such as the <a href="Cascades%20Volcano%20Observatory">Cascades Volcano Observatory</a>; CVO that are responsible for monitoring <a href="Mount%20St.%20Helens">Mount St. Helens</a>), the team is outfitted with equipment capable of monitoring any volcano. This equipment allows them to predict volcanic eruptions effectively and rapidly, and to evacuate nearby homes.

Walt Disney World Railroad

The Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR) is a 3-foot () <a href="narrow-gauge%20railway">narrow-gauge</a> <a href="heritage%20railway">heritage railroad</a> and attraction located within the <a href="Magic%20Kingdom">Magic Kingdom</a> theme park of <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Walt Disney World</a> in <a href="Bay%20Lake%2C%20Florida">Bay Lake, Florida</a>, in the United States. Its route is in length and encircles most of the park, with <a href="train%20station">train station</a>s in three different park areas. The rail line, constructed by <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Imagineering">WED Enterprises</a>, operates with four historic steam locomotives originally built by <a href="Baldwin%20Locomotive%20Works">Baldwin Locomotive Works</a>. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's <a href="main%20line%20%28railway%29">main line</a> loop. On a typical day, the railroad has two trains in operation; on busy days, it has three trains.

The WDWRR's development was led by <a href="Roger%20E.%20Broggie">Roger E. Broggie</a>, who also oversaw the construction of the <a href="Disneyland%20Railroad">Disneyland Railroad</a> in <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> in <a href="Anaheim%2C%20California">Anaheim, California</a>. The attraction's locomotives were acquired from the <a href="Ferrocarriles%20Unidos%20de%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucatán</a>, a narrow-gauge railroad system in Mexico. After being shipped to the United States, they were altered to resemble locomotives built in the 1880s and restored to operating condition. Each locomotive was also given a set of passenger cars, which were built from scratch.

The WDWRR opened to the public for the first time on October 1, 1971, the same day that the Magic Kingdom park opened. Since then, the WDWRR has become one of the world's most popular steam-powered railroads, with about 3.7 million passengers each year. The WDWRR closed temporarily on December 3, 2018, due to the construction of the <a href="Tron%20Lightcycle%20Power%20Run">Tron Lightcycle Power Run</a> roller coaster attraction near the <a href="Tomorrowland%23Magic%20Kingdom">Tomorrowland</a> section.

The development of the Walt Disney World Railroad (WDWRR) from the late 1960s to its opening in 1971 was overseen by Roger E. Broggie, vice president and general manager of Mapo, Inc., WED Enterprises' research and manufacturing branch. Broggie previously supervised the building of the Disneyland Railroad in Disneyland in Anaheim, California. From his experience with the railroad at Disneyland, Broggie determined that it was better to use existing steam locomotives, rather than building them entirely from scratch like the Disneyland Railroad's first two locomotives. To this end, he contacted rail historian <a href="Gerald%20M.%20Best">Gerald M. Best</a> who informed him that locomotives could be obtained at a railroad boneyard in <a href="M%C3%A9rida%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Mérida, Yucatán</a>, Mexico, owned by the Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucatán. This was a narrow-gauge system, the same gauge as the Disneyland Railroad. Broggie, along with fellow Disney employee and railroad-building expert Earl Vilmer, went to Mérida in 1969 to investigate. They determined that four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works could potentially be salvaged, along with a fifth locomotive built by <a href="Pittsburgh%20Locomotive%20and%20Car%20Works">Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works</a>, which was in front of the railroad company's headquarters.

Broggie paid a total of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>32,750 for all five locomotives ($8,000 for each of the four locomotives in the boneyard plus an additional $750 for the fifth locomotive). The locomotives, along with an assortment of brass fittings and other spare parts given away for free, were immediately shipped by rail back to the United States.

The five locomotives and spare parts acquired by Roger Broggie were sent to the Tampa Ship Repair & Dry Dock Company in <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>, to receive the aesthetic and mechanical restorations necessary to run on the planned WDWRR. At the time, this was the closest facility to the Walt Disney World site in Bay Lake, Florida with the space and equipment needed to accommodate full-size railroad <a href="rolling%20stock">rolling stock</a>. Here, Transportation Superintendent Earl Vilmer, who had accompanied Broggie on his trip to Mexico, along with Project Engineer Bob Harpur and the facility's Machinist Supervisor George Britton, were tasked with the project's completion.

The general idea for the restoration was to make the locomotives appear as if they were built in the 1880s. The original, dilapidated <a href="fire-tube%20boiler%23Locomotive%20boiler">boilers</a> of the four locomotives built by Baldwin Locomotive Works were replaced with new, smaller boilers built by Dixon Boiler Works. Their worn-out wood and steel <a href="cab%20%28locomotive%29">cabs</a> were replaced with new ones made of <a href="fiberglass">fiberglass</a>, and they were given new <a href="tender%20%28rail%29">tenders</a>, which used the <a href="bogie">trucks</a> from the originals. Many of the smaller original parts on the locomotives such as the domes and brass bells on top of the boilers, the wheels, and the <a href="coupling%20rod">side rods</a> were successfully refurbished and retained. The locomotives' <a href="firebox%20%28steam%20engine%29">fireboxes</a> were also modified to burn <a href="diesel%20fuel">diesel oil</a>. Replicas of their builder plates were also made to replace the originals.

The Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works locomotive acquired along with them could not be restored. Built in 1902, this locomotive was the oldest of the five locomotives purchased and was determined to have too many problems to be rebuilt. It was stored out of use in California for a period before being sold to an unknown locomotive broker. Some of its parts were used to help restore the four Baldwin locomotives, including its <a href="chimney%20%28locomotive%29">smokestack</a>, which was fitted to the WDWRR's No. 4 locomotive.

The restoration of the WDWRR's four locomotives, as well as the construction of five new open-air <a href="passenger%20car%20%28rail%29%23Narragansett-style%20excursion%20car">Narragansett-style excursion cars</a> for each of them (twenty in total), was completed in less than two years. The first completed set of five passenger cars was delivered to the Magic Kingdom park in April 1971 and the first completed locomotive arrived on May 15, 1971, several months before the park's opening. Like the steam trains running on the Disneyland Railroad during Disneyland's opening day on July 17, 1955, the steam trains for the WDWRR were the first attraction in the Magic Kingdom park to be finished, and they have been operating in the park ever since it opened on October 1, 1971. George Britton, who was instrumental in getting the WDWRR's locomotives refurbished, became the railroad's foreman from the time the railroad opened until his retirement on April 6, 2006. The WDWRR would eventually become one of the most popular steam-powered railroads in the world with about 3.7 million passengers each year.

For the first few months after the WDWRR opened to the public, Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, modeled after the former <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian-style</a> <a href="Saratoga%20Springs%20station">Saratoga Springs station</a> in <a href="Saratoga%20Springs%2C%20New%20York">Saratoga Springs, New York</a>, was the only stop for passengers along its route, making only complete round trips possible. On May 1, 1972, the first Frontierland Station opened just northwest of <a href="Melody%20Time%23Pecos%20Bill">Pecos Bill</a> Tall Tale Inn and Café in the Frontierland section on the park's western edge. It was one of the last changes made to the WDWRR prior to the retirement of Roger Broggie on October 1, 1973. Frontierland Station was demolished in November 1990 to make way for the new <a href="Splash%20Mountain%23Magic%20Kingdom">Splash Mountain</a> attraction and was replaced by the current Frontierland Station, which opened in December 1991 just north of the original station site. During construction of the Splash Mountain attraction and the current Frontierland Station, the WDWRR was temporarily renamed "Backtrack Express" and operated a single train, which only traveled back and forth along the section of track between the Main Street, U.S.A. section and the Mickey's Starland section. Between 1976 and 1977, the <a href="Auto-Train%20Corporation">Auto-Train Corporation</a> sponsored the WDWRR.
The WDWRR's third station, Mickey's Birthdayland Station, opened on June 18, 1988, in the Magic Kingdom park's brand-new <a href="Mickey%27s%20Toontown%23Magic%20Kingdom">Mickey's Birthdayland</a> section adjacent to the Fantasyland section in the park's northeast corner, and the railroad was briefly renamed "Mickey's Birthdayland Express" to promote it. When the Mickey's Birthdayland section was renamed "Mickey's Starland" in 1990 and Mickey's "Toontown Fair" in 1996, the signage for its WDWRR station changed both times, but the station's structure remained the same. In 2004, the station was demolished and completely rebuilt with an identical appearance to the original station. On February 11, 2011, the Mickey's Toontown Fair section closed to make way for the new Storybook Circus area, part of a new expansion of the Fantasyland section. The current Fantasyland Station, built on the site of the former Mickey's Toontown Fair Station, opened on March 12, 2012. In April 2012, the water tower and maintenance buildings adjacent to Fantasyland Station were re-themed to match the station's new design. 

The WDWRR temporarily closed on December 3, 2018, to accommodate construction of the Tron Lightcycle Power Run attraction in the Tomorrowland section. During this time, one of the WDWRR's trains will be on display at Main Street, U.S.A. Station.

Beginning at Main Street, U.S.A. Station adjacent to the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, the trains of the WDWRR travel along its single track in a clockwise direction on its circular route. It takes about 20 minutes for each train to complete a round trip on the WDWRR's main line, and on any given day, either two or three trains run, with two running on a typical day. Each train is operated by an <a href="railroad%20engineer">engineer</a> and <a href="fireman%20%28steam%20engine%29">fireman</a> in the locomotive, as well as a <a href="conductor%20%28rail%29">conductor</a> at the rear of the train who supervises the passengers.

As the train departs Main Street, U.S.A. Station, it crosses an access road in the <a href="Adventureland%20%28Disney%29%23Magic%20Kingdom">Adventureland</a> section, travels over a small bridge, enters a small tunnel, then crosses a second access road in the Frontierland section. After entering a tunnel through the Splash Mountain <a href="log%20flume%20%28ride%29">log flume</a> attraction, the train stops at Frontierland Station.

Continuing down the line, the train passes the <a href="Big%20Thunder%20Mountain%20Railroad%23Magic%20Kingdom%20version">Big Thunder Mountain Railroad</a> <a href="mine%20train%20roller%20coaster">mine train roller coaster</a> attraction and traverses a fully functional <a href="swing%20bridge">swing bridge</a>, which crosses a canal connecting the <a href="Rivers%20of%20America%20%28Disney%29%23Magic%20Kingdom">Rivers of America</a> to a <a href="dry%20dock">dry dock</a> area. This bridge was originally located in <a href="Wabasso%2C%20Florida">Wabasso, Florida</a>, and was previously owned by the <a href="Florida%20East%20Coast%20Railway">Florida East Coast Railway</a>. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and <a href="Audio-Animatronics">Audio-Animatronic</a> displays of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an <a href="overpass">overpass</a>, passes the <a href="branch%20line">spur line</a> leading to the WDWRR's <a href="motive%20power%20depot">roundhouse</a> where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.

In the final segment of the train's journey around the park, it climbs a two-percent <a href="ruling%20gradient">grade</a> through the Tomorrowland section, passes the <a href="Space%20Mountain%20%28Magic%20Kingdom%29">Space Mountain</a> <a href="roller%20coaster">roller coaster</a> attraction, and travels over a small bridge before it arrives back at Main Street, U.S.A. Station. This completes what the park refers to as "The Grand Circle Tour".

The WDWRR does not run during fireworks shows, given that its track runs close to the fireworks staging area. Since 1999, a separately-priced tour of the WDWRR named "Disney's The Magic Behind Our Steam Trains Tour" has been available once daily, and includes access to the railroad's otherwise-restricted roundhouse.

When working on the line, each WDWRR locomotive consumes of fuel and of water per hour, and each tender can hold of fuel and of water. In the past, all four locomotives received overhauls at the <a href="Tweetsie%20Railroad">Tweetsie Railroad</a> in <a href="Blowing%20Rock%2C%20North%20Carolina">Blowing Rock, North Carolina</a>. Each of the four locomotives pulls a set of five passenger cars with seating capacity for 75 passengers per car, for a total of 375 passengers per train. Steam-driven generators at the rear of the tenders supply electricity to the locomotives and passenger cars. The locomotives do not contain <a href="railway%20brake">brakes</a>, but the passenger cars do.

The WDWRR uses <a href="automatic%20block%20signaling">block signals</a> to notify the engineers, firemen, and conductors on each train whether the track segments along the railroad's of main-line track are clear or occupied by other trains. They are also used to notify WDWRR personnel when the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad attraction's swing bridge connecting the ride portion and maintenance portion of its track is swung over the WDWRR's track. The WDWRR's track is divided into seven such segments, or blocks, and each block has a track-side block signal to communicate its status. Block signals are located at each of the three stations, alongside the three main-line blocks between the stations, and alongside the spur line connecting the WDWRR's roundhouse to the main line.

Late in life he worked to memorialize the Trail, repeatedly retracing the trip of his youth. Once known as the "Hop King of the World", he was the first mayor of <a href="Puyallup%2C%20Washington">Puyallup, Washington</a>.

Meeker was born in <a href="Butler%20County%2C%20Ohio">Butler County, Ohio</a>, to Jacob and Phoebe Meeker. His family relocated to <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a> when he was a boy. He married Eliza Jane Sumner in 1851; the following year the couple, with Ezra's brother and with their newborn son, set out for the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a>, where land <a href="Donation%20Land%20Claim%20Act">could be claimed</a> and settled on. Although they endured hardships on the Trail in the journey of nearly six months, the entire party survived the trek. Meeker and his family briefly stayed near <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, then journeyed north to live in the <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a> region. They settled at what is now Puyallup in 1862, where Meeker grew <a href="hops">hops</a> for use in brewing beer. By 1887, his business had made him wealthy, and his wife built a large mansion for the family. In 1891 an infestation of hop <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s destroyed his crops and took much of his fortune. He later tried his hand at a number of ventures, and made four largely unsuccessful trips to the <a href="Klondike%2C%20Yukon">Klondike</a>, taking groceries and hoping to profit from <a href="Klondike%20Gold%20Rush">the gold rush</a>.

Meeker became convinced that the Oregon Trail was being forgotten, and he determined to bring it publicity so it could be marked and monuments erected. In 1906–1908, although in his late 70s, he retraced his steps along the Oregon Trail by wagon, seeking to build monuments in communities along the way. His trek reached New York, and in Washington, D.C. he met President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. He traveled the Trail again several times in the final two decades of this life, including by oxcart in 1910–1912 and by airplane in 1924. During another such trip, in 1928, Meeker fell ill but was succored by <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>. On his return to Washington state, Meeker became ill again and died there on December 3, 1928 at age 97. Meeker wrote several books; his work has continued through the activities of such groups as the <a href="Oregon-California%20Trails%20Association">Oregon-California Trails Association</a>.

Ezra Manning Meeker was born in <a href="Butler%20County%2C%20Ohio">Butler County, Ohio</a>, near Huntsville, on December 29, 1830, the son of Jacob (1804–1869) and Phoebe (Baker) Meeker (1801–1854). His paternal ancestors had been among the early settlers of <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a>, where their ancestral home was located. In the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, about twenty Meekers fought for the new nation. Ezra was the fourth of the six children Jacob and Phoebe had together, with older brothers John, Manning (died at age one week) and Oliver, and a younger sister Hannah and brother Clark.

Jacob was a miller and farmer. In 1839, the family moved from Ohio to Indiana, close to <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>—Ezra and his older brother Oliver walked behind the family wagon for . Ezra had little formal education; he later estimated a total of six months. Phoebe, seeing that her son's mind was not well adapted to formal learning, allowed him to earn money through odd jobs. He obtained work as <a href="printer%27s%20devil">printer's devil</a> at the "<a href="Indianapolis%20Journal">Indianapolis Journal</a>", where his duties involved delivering the newspaper to subscribers, among them local pastor <a href="Henry%20Ward%20Beecher">Henry Ward Beecher</a>. In 1845, Phoebe's father, a <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati</a> merchant, gave his daughter $1,000, enough to buy the family a farm. As both Jacob and Ezra Meeker realized the boy enjoyed the outdoor life more than inside work, Jacob placed Ezra in charge of the farm, allowing the elder Meeker to work as a miller.

Ezra Meeker married his childhood sweetheart, Eliza Jane Sumner, in May 1851. The Sumners lived about four miles from Indianapolis, and like the Meekers were family farmers who did not hire help. When he asked her for her hand, he told her he wanted to farm, which she accepted as long as it was on their own property. In October 1851, the couple set out for <a href="Eddyville%2C%20Iowa">Eddyville, Iowa</a>, where they rented a farm. They had heard that land in Eddyville would be free, but this was not the case. Ezra, working in a surveyor's camp, decided that he did not like Iowa's winters—a prejudice shared by his pregnant wife. Reports were circulating through the prairies about the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a>'s free land and mild climate. Also influencing the decision was the urging of Oliver Meeker who, with friends, had outfitted for the trip to Oregon near Indianapolis, and had come to Eddyville to recruit his brother. Ezra and Eliza Jane Meeker vacillated on the decision, and it was not until early April 1852, more than a month after the birth of their son Marion, that they decided to travel the <a href="Oregon%20Trail">Oregon Trail</a>.
That April, Ezra, Eliza Jane, Oliver, and Marion Meeker set out to journey to Oregon, some in all. With their wagon, they had two <a href="yoke">yoke</a>s of oxen, one of cows and an extra cow. They were accompanied by William Buck, who would remain with them much of the way before separating from them to go to California. Buck outfitted the wagon, Meeker selected the animals, and with his wife carefully prepared food supplies. The wagons of Meeker's grouping traveled together by informal agreement; there was no wagon master in overall charge.

A number of Oliver Meeker's friends from Indianapolis joined the group before the party left Iowa. They crossed the <a href="Missouri%20River">Missouri River</a> at the small Mormon settlement of Kanesville (today <a href="Council%20Bluffs%2C%20Iowa">Council Bluffs, Iowa</a>). Meeker recounted that, as he stood on the far side of the Missouri, he felt as if he had left the United States. As they journeyed westward along the <a href="Platte%20River">Platte River</a> in <a href="Nebraska%20Territory">Nebraska Territory</a>, there were such large numbers traveling that they were never out of sight of the tens of thousands of other pioneers journeying west that year. Sometimes several wagons advanced side by side. The Meekers chose a slow, steady pace, unlike many who sought to rush along as quickly as possible. Piles of abandoned possessions lined the way, cast aside to lighten loads. As the party went further west, they passed some of those who had hurried past them, and whose wagons had broken down or whose oxen had died as a result of failure to care for them properly. Disease was an ever-present risk; at the present site of <a href="Kearney%2C%20Nebraska">Kearney, Nebraska</a>, Oliver Meeker was stricken with illness. This led to a division of the group when most of Oliver's friends, including later <a href="Idaho%20Territory">Idaho Territory</a> governor <a href="David%20W.%20Ballard">David W. Ballard</a>, refused to wait. Oliver recovered after four days, and was one of the lucky ones—his brother later estimated that one in ten of those who took the Trail perished during the journey. Ezra Meeker remembered meeting one wagon train, slowly moving east against the flow of traffic. That group had made it as far as <a href="Fort%20Laramie">Fort Laramie</a> (today in Wyoming) before losing the last of its menfolk, and the women and children turned back, hoping to regain their homes in the East. He never learned if they made it. According to local historians Bert and Margie Webber, "all of these deaths made a great impression on the young man".
They encountered <a href="Plains%20Indians">Native Americans</a>, who would sometimes demand provisions for passage, but none were given and none of the incidents ended with violence. The travelers' stores were supplemented by shooting <a href="American%20bison">bison</a>, which roamed the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a> in huge numbers. Despite being a source of food, the bison were a danger as their stampedes could destroy property and kill irreplaceable stock. In southeastern Idaho, the <a href="California%20Trail">California Trail</a> separated from the Oregon, and Buck and some of the rest of the party split off there; they settled in California and remained friends with Meeker until their deaths.

Meeker found that the final stretch between <a href="Fort%20Boise">Fort Boise</a> (now <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise, Idaho</a>) and <a href="The%20Dalles%2C%20Oregon">The Dalles</a> was the most difficult. The section is filled with mountains and deserts, and there was little chance of supplementing stores. Those who entered this segment with exhausted teams or minimal supplies often died along it. Others shed baggage brought across half a continent, saving only provisions. Parties who feared this part of the journey sometimes tried to float down the <a href="Snake%20River">Snake</a> and <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>s; many were wrecked in the rapids and died. At The Dalles, where river passage was available to <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>, the Meeker party found a motley crowd of emigrants. With the money earned at the ferry, they booked passage downriver. Oliver Meeker brought the livestock ahead overland, and met Ezra and his family on their arrival in Portland on October 1, 1852, where they slept inside a house for the first time since leaving Iowa. Ezra Meeker had lost and possessed $2.75 in cash. All of the party survived, although Jacob Davenport, one of Oliver Meeker's friends from Indiana, became ill on the final part of the trip and died some weeks after reaching Portland. All but one of the livestock completed the trip—a cow was lost while crossing the Missouri River. Ezra Meeker considered his journey over the Oregon Trail to have been the making of him as a man.

Meeker's first employment in the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a> was unloading a ship that had docked at Portland. He moved to the nearby town of <a href="St.%20Helens%2C%20Oregon">St. Helens</a>, where construction of a wharf in competition with Portland's was under way—Oliver rented a house to lodge workers in, and Ezra went to help his brother. By this time, Ezra Meeker and his wife were determined to fulfill their original plan to farm, and when work was abandoned on the wharf, he went to find land which could be cultivated.

Meeker first made a claim in January 1853 about downriver from Portland, on the current site of <a href="Kalama%2C%20Washington">Kalama, Washington</a>. There, he built a log cabin and began his first farm. He did not build close to the water, which proved fortunate as there was a major flood on the Columbia soon after he claimed the land. Instead, he profited from the incident, selling logs the river left on his claim, together with trees he chopped down, for lumber.

In April 1853, Meeker heard that the lands north of the Columbia would become a separate <a href="Territories%20of%20the%20United%20States">territory</a> (named <a href="Washington%20Territory">Washington Territory</a>), with its capital on <a href="Puget%20Sound">Puget Sound</a>, an inlet of the Pacific. He decided to travel north with his brother to scout for lands to claim around the waterway. There were as yet only about 500 European-descended inhabitants in the Puget Sound region, of which 100 were in the village of <a href="Olympia%2C%20Washington">Olympia</a>, which would become the territorial (and later state) capital. Despite there only being a few settlers, there was considerable activity in the area—the lumber of Puget Sound fueled San Francisco's building boom. The Meekers' first view of Puget Sound was unprepossessing; the tide was out, exposing mud flats. Nevertheless, they pressed on, building a <a href="skiff">skiff</a> to travel by water. They were met by friendly Indians, who sold them clams and taught them how to cook the shellfish. Engaging one of the Native Americans as guide, they explored the area, looking for good, well-located farmland. At one point, they entered the <a href="Puyallup%20River">Puyallup River</a>, in a region where no white settlers lived, and camped on the present site of <a href="Puyallup%2C%20Washington">Puyallup</a>, but were deterred by the large number of huge trees, which would make it difficult to clear land for farming. They decided on tracts on <a href="McNeil%20Island">McNeil Island</a>, not far from the thriving town of <a href="Steilacoom%2C%20Washington">Steilacoom</a>, where the farm's produce could be sold. Oliver remained on the island to build a cabin while his brother went back to fetch family and possessions, and sell their old claims at Kalama. He returned to a cabin in which they installed a glass window that looked over the water to Steilacoom, with a view of <a href="Mount%20Rainier">Mount Rainier</a>. The Meeker claim was later the site of <a href="McNeil%20Island%20Corrections%20Center">McNeil Island Corrections Center</a>.
Later in 1853, Ezra and Oliver Meeker received a three-month-old letter from their father, stating that he and other family members wanted to emigrate, and would do so if Oliver Meeker could return to assist them. They immediately responded that Oliver would return to Indiana by early the following year, and put their plans on hold to prepare for and finance his journey by steamship and rail. In August 1854, Ezra Meeker received word that his relatives were en route, but were delayed and short on provisions. He quickly went to their aid, intending to guide them through the <a href="Naches%20Pass">Naches Pass</a> into the Puget Sound area. When he found his family's party close to the first <a href="Fort%20Walla%20Walla">Fort Walla Walla</a> (near <a href="Richland%2C%20Washington">Richland, Washington</a>), he learned that his mother and a younger brother had died along the Trail. He guided the survivors through the pass and to his claim on McNeil Island.

Jacob Meeker saw only limited prospects on the island, and the family took claims near <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>, where they operated a general store in Steilacoom. On November 5, 1855, Ezra Meeker claimed of land called Swamp Place, near Fern Hill, southeast of Tacoma. He began to improve the land, planting a garden and an orchard.

Pursuant to the 1854 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Medicine%20Creek">Treaty of Medicine Creek</a>, settlers purchased lands from the Indians. The agreement, signed under duress, restricted the Native Americans to inadequate reservations, and in 1855, the <a href="Puget%20Sound%20War">Puget Sound War</a> broke out, bringing unrest to the region over the following two years. Ezra Meeker had maintained good relations with the Native Americans, and did not fight in the conflict, though he accompanied one expedition to recover possessions captured by the Indians. A controversial aspect of the war was the trials and hanging of <a href="Chief%20Leschi">Chief Leschi</a>, deemed responsible for killing during the conflict. Meeker sat on the jury in the first trial, which resulted in a <a href="hung%20jury">hung jury</a>, with Meeker and another man holding out for acquittal on the grounds that Leschi was a combatant in wartime. A second trial convicted Leschi, and he was hanged. Meeker described the execution as wrongful, and in later years wrote of the incident. In 1895, Meeker chartered a special train to bring whites to Leschi's reburial on tribal land, and in 2004 the <a href="Washington%20State%20Senate">Washington State Senate</a> passed a resolution that Leschi had been unjustly treated; a special historical tribunal made up of past and present justices of the <a href="Washington%20Supreme%20Court">Washington Supreme Court</a> also exonerated Leschi as both he and the man he was said to have killed were combatants.

Ezra Meeker's farm at Swamp Place was not a success as the land was too poor to grow crops. The family continued to run the store in Steilacoom. On January 5, 1861, Oliver Meeker drowned while returning from a buying trip to San Francisco, when his ship, the "Northerner", sank off the California coast. The Meekers had borrowed to finance the trip, and the losses from this disaster reduced Ezra Meeker to near penury. He secured the squatter's claim of Jerry Stilly on land in the Puyallup Valley, and moved his wife and children there in 1862. While clearing his own holdings, he earned money by helping to clear the land of others. His father and surviving brother, John Meeker, also had claims in the valley. John Meeker had come to Washington Territory by ship in 1859 and had settled in the Puyallup Valley. Ezra Meeker ran for the <a href="Washington%20State%20Legislature">Washington Territorial Legislature</a> in 1861, but was defeated. In 1869, Meeker ran for <a href="Pierce%20County%2C%20Washington">Pierce County</a> Surveyor; he was defeated by James Gallagher, 138 votes to 116.

In 1865, Olympia brewer Isaac Wood imported some <a href="Humulus%20lupulus">hop roots</a> from the United Kingdom, hopeful that they would do well in the Pacific Northwest. As <a href="hops">hops</a>, used to flavor beer, were not then grown locally, the cost of transport from Britain or New York made his beer expensive, and he hoped Puget Sound-area farmers would grow hops and supply him. He was a friend of Jacob Meeker, and gave him the roots to grow. Jacob passed some of them on to Ezra. The plants grew extremely well, and at the end of the season, the Meekers earned $185 from selling Wood the crop. Such a sum was rarely seen in the Puyallup Valley at that time, and a hop-growing boom promptly began. Ezra Meeker, with his head start, was able to repeatedly expand operations, he eventually had of hop-growing lands. He also built one of the first hop-drying kilns in the valley. For years Meeker supplied Portland brewer <a href="Henry%20Weinhard">Henry Weinhard</a>.
The fertile soil and temperate climate of the valley proved ideal for hops. Not only did the plants thrive, farmers were able to obtain four or five times the usual yield. Meeker, never one to miss an opportunity, formed his own hop brokerage business. In 1870, he penned an 80-page pamphlet, "Washington Territory West of the Cascades", to promote investment in the region. He took ship for San Francisco, then journeyed east by the new transcontinental railroad, hoping to get the railroads to expand to his region. He met with newspaper editor <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a> (known for his famous advice, "<a href="Go%20West%2C%20young%20man">Go West, young man</a>") and with railroad mogul <a href="Jay%20Cooke">Jay Cooke</a> as part of his promotional blitz. Cooke, who was building the <a href="Northern%20Pacific%20Railway">Northern Pacific Railway</a> to cross the northern tier of the country, not only bought up Meeker's pamphlets to give away to potential investors, but hired Meeker to drum up interest in his railroad. While working from a Manhattan office, Meeker dressed like city dwellers, but did not entirely lose his frontier habits, often stirring a lump of butter into his coffee.

In 1877, Meeker filed a <a href="plat">plat</a> for a townsite to surround his cabin. He named the town <a href="Puyallup%2C%20Washington">Puyallup</a>, using the local Indian words for "generous people", according to Meeker. The local post office had previously been called "Franklin", a common designation in the United States; Meeker, the town's first postmaster, stated that the new name was likely to remain unique. He later admitted that the pronunciation of Puyallup caused confusion when he visited England—it still remains difficult for non-locals.

Meeker strove to improve life in the region, and donated land and money towards town buildings and parks, a theatre and a hotel while defraying the start-up costs of a wood products factory. The Ezra Meeker Historical Society, in their 1972 pamphlet on his life, wrote of his activities:

Hops made many farmers wealthy, including Meeker, who at one point claimed he had earned a half million dollars for his crop. In 1880, he wrote his first book, "Hop Culture in the United States", and soon after became known as the "Hop King of the World". By the 1880s, he was the wealthiest man in the territory, and had formed a London branch of his hop brokerage. He served as Washington Territory's representative at the 1885–1886 North Central & South American Exposition in New Orleans; he also took exhibits to London's Colonial and Indian Exposition after the New Orleans fair closed. In 1886, Meeker sought the Republican nomination for <a href="Washington%20Territory%27s%20at-large%20congressional%20district">territorial delegate to Congress</a>, but was defeated after many ballots at the party convention. He became a supporter of women's suffrage, which was the subject of a long-running political battle in Washington Territory, a dispute which lasted well after statehood in 1889.

Eliza Jane felt that the family should live in a better house than their original cabin, and between 1887 and 1890 built what became known as the Meeker Mansion in Puyallup. The cost was $26,000, a very large sum at the time. An Italian artist lived with the Meekers for a year, painting careful details on the ceilings. The Meekers moved in during 1890, the same year Puyallup was formally incorporated under state law—they donated their old homesite to the town for a park. In 1890, Meeker served as first mayor of Puyallup. He was elected to a second, non-consecutive term for 1892.

In 1891, a blight of <a href="List%20of%20hop%20diseases">hop aphids</a> struck the hop-growing West Coast from British Columbia to California. Although sprays of various liquids were used in an attempt to defeat the insects, use of such pesticides damaged the hops. In 1892, the crop decreased to half of what it had been before the infestation. Meeker had advanced money to many growers, who were unable to repay him. The problems in the valley were made worse by the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a>, a severe worldwide depression. Business after business in which Meeker had invested failed, such as the Puyallup Electric Light Company. He was overextended, and lost much of his fortune, and eventually his lands to foreclosure.

Meeker spent part of the winter of 1895–1896 in London, recouping what he could from his interests there. In 1896, gold was discovered both in Alaska and in Canada, and when Meeker returned from the United Kingdom, he found his sons, Marion and Fred, preparing to leave for <a href="Cook%20Inlet">Cook Inlet</a>, Alaska. They found all the worthwhile claims had already been taken. Nevertheless, the Meeker family saw the finds as a possible road to financial recovery, and founded a company to buy and sell mining claims, though they knew little about the trade. In 1897, Meeker and his sons journeyed to the <a href="Kootenays">Kootenay country</a> of southeastern British Columbia, where gold had been found. Despite the fact Meeker was aged 66, he undertook a full share of the labor. Both Meeker sons filed claims in Canada, but the mines required additional investment. Meeker raised money to travel to New York to speak with his old contacts, where he received more promises than cash. On the return leg he failed to raise money in visits in Illinois and Minneapolis and by July 1897, he was back in the Kootenays, working the claim. When the gold discovery in the <a href="Klondike%2C%20Yukon">Klondike</a> in northwestern Canada was publicized that year, Meeker saw that as a better opportunity, and sent his son Fred to investigate. Fred Meeker returned with a report in November; the Meekers sought to finance a mining expedition to the Klondike, but failed to raise adequate money from investors.
Despite his inability to raise funds for mining, Meeker was certain there was a way to make money from the gold rush. He and Eliza Jane spent much of the winter of 1897–1898 drying vegetables, and Ezra Meeker departed for <a href="Skagway%2C%20Alaska">Skagway, Alaska</a>, on March 20, 1898 with of dried produce—Fred Meeker and his wife Clara were already across the border in what would soon be designated as the <a href="Yukon%20Territory">Yukon Territory</a>. The 67-year-old Meeker, with one business associate, climbed the steep <a href="Chilkoot%20Pass">Chilkoot Pass</a>. With thousands of others in boats and on rafts, he floated down the <a href="Yukon%20River">Yukon River</a> once the ice broke up in late May, and sold his vegetables in two weeks in <a href="Dawson%20City">Dawson City</a>. He returned to Puyallup in July, only to set out again with more supplies the following month. This time, he and his son-in-law, Roderick McDonald, opened a store, the Log Cabin Grocery, in Dawson City, and remained through the winter.
Meeker returned to the Yukon twice more, in 1899 and 1900. Most of the money earned through groceries was invested in gold mining, and was lost. When he departed the Klondike for the last time in April 1901, he left behind him the body of his son Fred, dead of pneumonia in Dawson City on January 30, 1901. In his writings, Meeker ascribed his sudden departure from the Yukon in 1901 to mining losses and his upcoming 50th wedding anniversary. Meeker scholar Dennis M. Larsen in his book on the pioneer's Klondike adventure suggests that a more likely reason was attempts by those who had lost money in Meeker's enterprises in the 1890s to gain the family's remaining major asset, the Meeker Mansion. That property was sold by Eliza Jane Meeker to her daughter Caroline and son-in-law Eben Osborne for $10,000 in mid-1901 and later that year both Ezra and Eliza Jane executed documents stating that the house had been her separate property, paid for with funds not deriving from Ezra. The sale to the Osbornes included provisions that Ezra and Eliza Jane were to have lifetime residence and $50 per month. Ezra Meeker did not live there after his wife's death in 1909, and the Osbornes sold the house in 1915. Eben Osborne died in 1922, survived by his 91-year-old father in law.

Meeker spent the years after the Klondike in Puyallup, where he wrote and served as president of the <a href="Washington%20State%20Historical%20Society">Washington State Historical Society</a>, which he had helped to found in 1891. The Ezra Meeker Historical Society described their namesake's situation after the Klondike expeditions:

Meeker had long contemplated the idea of marking the Oregon Trail, over which he had traveled in 1852, with granite monuments. By the early 20th century, he was convinced that the Trail was in danger of being forgotten. Farmers were plowing up the Trail bit by bit, and as towns and cities grew along it, the Trail vanished under streets and buildings. Meeker viewed its preservation as an urgent matter because of this slow disappearance. He wanted the Trail properly marked, and monuments erected to honor the dead.

Meeker came up with a scheme to travel along the Trail again by ox-drawn wagon, raising public awareness for his cause. He believed that public interest would provide enough money both to build markers and maintain himself along the way. Though many hucksters traveled by wagon, selling <a href="patent%20medicine">patent nostrums</a>, Meeker felt that he would stand out, as an authentic pioneer able to tell real stories of the Trail—especially if he used authentic gear. He felt that it was likely that once newspapers got wind of his travels, they would give him ample coverage.
Meeker did not have much money, so he raised it from friends. Ox-drawn wagons were not a common sight in the Puyallup of 1906; Meeker was unable to find an authentic complete wagon, and eventually used metal parts from the remains of three different ones. The construction was done by Cline & McCoy of Puyallup. Meeker found a pair of oxen; even though one proved unsuitable, the owner insisted on him purchasing both. The one Meeker kept, named Twist, was lodged at the stockyards in Tacoma as he sought another. Meeker fixed on a herd of <a href="cattle%23Terminology">steers</a> which had been brought in from Montana. He decided on one which was particularly heavy, which he named Dave. Although Dave gave Meeker much difficulty, beginning with the drive home to Puyallup after the purchase, the animal eventually helped pull the wagon over .
Although Meeker had not had a dog in his wagon in 1852, he knew that people liked them, and sought to add one to his crew. Jim, a large, friendly collie who became an expedition member and Meeker's companion for the next six years, had belonged to one of Meeker's neighbors, a Mr. James. Meeker was impressed by the way Jim drove James' chickens out of the area where the family grew berries, by moving slowly. Five dollars to one of James' children secured the purchase. Some of Meeker's friends tried to talk him out of the trip; one local minister warned against this "impracticable project", stating that it was "cruel to let this aged man start on this journey only to perish by exposure in the mountains".

Meeker had taken an ox team and wagon to Portland's Lewis and Clark Exposition in 1905; en route he had kept his eyes open for places to set up suitable monuments on the <a href="Cowlitz%20Trail">Cowlitz Trail</a>, on which pioneers had journeyed from the Columbia River to Puget Sound. He made arrangements with locals in towns along that trail to raise money to build monuments there. He gave lectures as a fundraiser, but raised little money. He took his team and wagon for daylong shakedown trips, despite the mocking of some who remembered him as Hop King. After several days camped on his lawn as practice for the trip, and then in other nearby locales, Meeker set out from Olympia on February 19, 1906.

According to Larsen in his book on Meeker's journey east,

The first stop after Olympia for "The Old Oregon Trail Monument Expedition" was <a href="Tenino%2C%20Washington">Tenino, Washington</a>, where Meeker went ahead by train on February 20, 1906, to make arrangements for the first monument of the trip. He still had no driver, and had his wagon pulled to Tenino by horses, with the oxen trailing behind. He appealed to a local quarry for a suitable stone, which was carved and was dedicated in Tenino at a ceremony on the 21st. He had less success as he journeyed south towards <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a>; at none of the remaining Washington stops was a monument erected, and although Meeker placed wooden posts where monuments should go, most of the designated towns did not follow through. The lack of enthusiasm about Meeker's mission continued in Portland, where the Unitarian church elders voted against allowing Meeker the use of the building to give a fundraising lecture, pledging to do nothing to "encourage that old man to go out on the Plains to die".

In Portland, Meeker lost his remaining helpers (one refused to take a pay cut, the others for personal reasons). One stayed on for the boat voyage up the Columbia before leaving at <a href="The%20Dalles%2C%20Oregon">The Dalles</a>, where Meeker hired a driver/cook, William Mardon, at $30 per month. He remained with Meeker for the next three years. Meeker also installed an <a href="odometer">odometer</a> on his wagon, calling The Dalles "Mile Zero" of his expedition. In The Dalles, Meeker engaged in activities which would set the pattern for his progress along the Trail: He showed off himself, his wagon and animals, to the public, and sold tickets for a lecture (fifty cents for adults, half that for children) he would give about the Oregon Trail, including images shown with a <a href="stereopticon">stereopticon</a>. He also met with members of civic committees to raise money for a local monument. Often these monuments were erected after Meeker passed: he would position a post to designate its location. According to reporter James Aldredge in his 1975 article on Meeker's trip, "for a septuagenarian he must have been blessed with remarkable health and endurance ... When the curious procession got underway, not the least impressive part of it was Meeker himself, with his face framed by his flowing white hair and his patriarchal beard." According to reporter Bart Ripp in his 1993 article on Meeker, "the first expedition east in 1906 was supposed to be a speaking tour, but people were more interested in seeing the old coot in a covered wagon. It was the 20th century, and Americans wanted a show."

As he journeyed east from The Dalles, Meeker met with more enthusiasm than in his home state as he slowly passed through Oregon and Idaho. As word began to spread, he sometimes found the townsfolk prepared for him, or with a stone ordered or even ready. The monument in <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise</a>, dedicated by Meeker on April 30, 1906, stands on the grounds of the <a href="Idaho%20State%20Capitol">Idaho State Capitol</a>. On the road, he camped as he had a half century before, but in towns most often took a hotel room, though who paid for this is uncertain. Near Pacific Springs, at <a href="South%20Pass%20%28Wyoming%29">South Pass</a> in Wyoming, Meeker had a stone inscribed to mark where the Trail passes through the <a href="Continental%20Divide%20of%20the%20Americas">Continental Divide</a>. 

Meeker remembered in a memoir,

Nebraska proved resistant to Meeker's sales pitch, and near <a href="Brady%2C%20Nebraska">Brady</a>, the ox Twist died, possibly after eating a poisonous plant. Meeker had to wire home to supporters for money. He hired teams of horses to pull the wagon on a temporary basis, and an attempt with two cows was not successful. He was able to temporarily yoke Dave with a cow which proved more suitable. At the <a href="Omaha%20Stockyards">Omaha Stockyards</a>, Meeker found another ox, which he named Dandy, and broke him in on the way to <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, near where Meeker had once lived and by road from Puyallup. Beginning in Nebraska, Meeker began to sell postcards from photos taken on the way—there was then a craze for postcards in the United States. He also arranged for the printing of a book about his 1852 trip, much of which he wrote during noontime halts on his 1906 trip. The funds from the sales of these items allowed him to meet expenses on the road. Meeker's exploits were closely followed in newspapers on the West Coast as eastern and midwestern stories about him were reprinted there—when westerners perceived any slights towards Meeker, indignant editorials followed.
After a visit to <a href="Eddyville%2C%20Iowa">Eddyville, Iowa</a>, from where he had set out in 1852, Meeker spent several weeks in Indianapolis, leaving on March 1, 1907, when his permit to sell on the streets there expired. With the Oregon Trail run completed, he proceeded east through Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York State, seeking to both raise public awareness and earn some money for himself through sales of his merchandise. He often spent several days in a location, so long as sales of postcards and books flourished. When the expedition reached New York City, Mayor <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan%20Jr.">George B. McClellan Jr.</a> was absent but the acting mayor told Meeker that, although he could not grant him a permit, he would instruct the police not to molest him. The message was apparently not well-communicated, as at 161st and Amsterdam Avenue a policeman arrested Meeker's helper, Mardon, for driving cattle upon the streets of New York in violation of a local ordinance. A stalemate followed as Meeker refused to move his oxen and the police had no means of doing so. The situation was resolved when higher authority ordered Mardon's release. Meeker wanted to drive the length of Broadway; it took a month to get the legal problems resolved. It took him six hours to drive the length of Manhattan. He had arranged with the press for photographers, who took shots of him at the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="Federal%20Hall">the sub-Treasury building</a> across <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a>. Later in his stay, he drove across the Brooklyn Bridge.
After a small family reunion at the old Meeker homestead near <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20New%20Jersey">Elizabeth, New Jersey</a>, Meeker headed south towards Washington, D.C. He had hoped to meet President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> at his summer home in <a href="Oyster%20Bay%20%28hamlet%29%2C%20New%20York">Oyster Bay, New York</a>, but Roosevelt's staff declined, offering a meeting in Washington instead. Members of the Washington State congressional delegation cleared the way, and Meeker met Roosevelt on November 29, 1907. The President went outside the White House to view Meeker's wagon and team, and expressed support for Meeker's activities, and for a Meeker proposal for a cross-country highway (there were then none) in honor of the pioneers. After Washington, the tour wound down: Meeker went home to Puyallup from Pittsburgh by train to see his ailing wife. On his return to the East, he arranged for transport by riverboat and train, with a journey across Missouri by wagon. The expedition was offloaded from the train in Portland, and Meeker proceeded north across Washington State (receiving a much warmer reception) on a slow route, finishing in Seattle on July 18, 1908.

Meeker ran a large pioneer exhibit and restaurant at the 1909 <a href="Alaska-Yukon-Pacific%20Exposition">Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition</a> in Seattle; he later ruefully stated the Exposition had cost him his earnings from the book and card sales during his wagon tour. Later that year, he spent time in California, journeying with his wagon and team. Eliza Jane Meeker died in 1909 in Seattle—she had been in poor health for some years. Ezra Meeker was in San Francisco, peddling his wares, when his wife died—it took three days to locate him, after which he journeyed north for the funeral before returning to his work. On New Year's Day 1910, Meeker and his wagon and team participated in the <a href="Tournament%20of%20Roses%20Parade">Tournament of Roses Parade</a> in Pasadena.

In 1910, the Humphrey Bill, to appropriate money for monuments to mark the Trail, passed the House of Representatives and was introduced in the Senate, with a proviso that no money would be spent unless the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> could certify that the work would not require any further appropriations. Ezra Meeker set out that year on another two-year-long expedition, with the emphasis this time on locating and marking where the Trail had been, rather than on building monuments. Sometimes the ruts in the ground from the emigrants' wagons still existed and made it obvious, but other times he had to rely on the memories of old settlers. He journeyed to Texas, but had no success in interesting people in his project there. His tour was ended in 1912 in Denver when a flood struck the city, resulting in damage to his books. Nevertheless, according to Green, Meeker's two trips resulted in the placement of 150 monuments. A version of the Humphrey Bill passed the Senate in 1913, but died when the House of Representatives took no action. Despite this failure, groups began marking western trails: the <a href="Sons%20of%20the%20American%20Revolution">Sons</a> and <a href="Daughters%20of%20the%20American%20Revolution">Daughters of the American Revolution</a> put up plaques along the Cowlitz Trail in 1916.
Beginning in 1913, Meeker began to plan his role in the 1915 <a href="Panama-Pacific%20Exposition">Panama-Pacific Exposition</a> in San Francisco. He had donated his wagon and oxen to a park in Tacoma: when officials there expressed concern about the cost of building a proper pavilion for them, Meeker reclaimed them and set off with them to California. Deeming Dandy unfit for the road, Meeker had him slaughtered in Portland in June 1914 and had the hide shipped back to Tacoma for taxidermy; in November, the same fate met Dave in California. Meeker's wagon was exhibited at the Exposition in San Francisco. His tales of the Oregon Trail became one of the star attractions of the Exposition. Nevertheless, he quarreled with the administrators of the Washington State Building, feeling that it should be open on Sundays, when the largest crowds came to the grounds. On his return, the oxen and wagon were mounted as an exhibit at the Washington State History Museum until it closed for a move to new premises in 1995. The wagon was then deemed too fragile for display.

In 1916, the 85-year-old Meeker made another trip, this time by <a href="Pathfinder%20%281912%20automobile%29">Pathfinder automobile</a>. The Pathfinder Company, of Indianapolis, lent Meeker a car with a covered-wagon-style top and a driver as a publicity stunt. Meeker also received a small stipend, and journeyed in the vehicle from Washington, D.C. to Olympia. Meeker saw the use of a motor vehicle as publicizing the need for a transcontinental highway. During this trip, he lectured on the need for a national highway; before he left he met with President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> and discussed the topic with him.

Bernard Sun, <a href="Tom%20Sun%20Ranch">whose grandparents</a> were Oregon Trail pioneers in Wyoming, remembered another side of Meeker:

Although <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a> distracted public attention from Meeker and his activities, he used the time to plan for the future. On December 29, 1919, his 89th birthday, he began work on another book, "Seventy Years of Progress in Washington", which was published to favorable reviews. In association with Dr. <a href="Howard%20R.%20Driggs">Howard R. Driggs</a>, a professor of English education at the <a href="University%20of%20Utah">University of Utah</a> and later at <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a>, he published a revised version of his memoirs, "Ox-Team Days on the Oregon Trail". In 1922, he fell ill for one of the few times in his life. Newspapers reported that he refused to stay in bed, and his grandson, a physician, stated that he was going to put Meeker back to bed and "I am going to keep him there—if I can. If I can."

Recovered, the nonagenarian Meeker began making fresh travel plans. With the International Air Races to be held at <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, in 1924, Meeker tried to get the War Department to allow him to fly there. He was successful, and flew with the Army pilot, <a href="Oakley%20G.%20Kelly">Oakley G. Kelly</a>. At a stop in Boise, Meeker quipped they were making better time than with his ox team, and in Dayton met aviation pioneer <a href="Orville%20Wright">Orville Wright</a>, to whom he commented, "You'd be surprised at the difference between riding in a Prairie Schooner and in an airplane." The publicity was so favorable that the Army had Kelly fly Meeker the rest of the way to Washington, D.C., where the onetime pioneer met President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> in October 1924. Meeker returned to Seattle by train. Wanting the government to build a road over Naches Pass, where he had guided his father's party seventy years before, Meeker ran for the <a href="Washington%20House%20of%20Representatives">Washington House of Representatives</a> in 1924 from the 47th district but was defeated in the Republican primary by 35 votes. In 1925, Meeker drove an ox team for several months while touring in J.C. Miller's Wild West Show.

By 1925, Congress had still not passed an appropriation to mark the Trail. One means of federally sponsored fundraising at that time was to get Congress to authorize a commemorative coin (usually a half dollar) and designate a sponsoring organization to buy the issue at face value from the government and sell it to the public at a premium. Meeker got the idea from a group of Idahoans seeking a coin to further their preservation work at <a href="Fort%20Hall">Fort Hall</a>; he arranged a merger of efforts. Beginning in 1925, Meeker pressed for such a half dollar to honor the pioneers and provide money for his efforts, and in April 1926 he appeared before a Senate committee, urging the passage of legislation. Congress obliged, and Coolidge signed the bill on May 17, 1926 at a ceremony which Meeker attended.
Meeker had founded the Old Oregon Trail Association in 1922. In early 1926, it was incorporated in New York as the <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20Association">Oregon Trail Memorial Association</a> (OTMA), and was given office space there by the National Highways Association. The legislation authorizing the new coin designated the OTMA as the organization which could purchase <a href="Oregon%20Trail%20Memorial%20half%20dollar">Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar</a>s from the government. The piece was designed by <a href="Laura%20Gardin%20Fraser">Laura Gardin Fraser</a> and her husband, <a href="James%20Earle%20Fraser%20%28sculptor%29">James Earle Fraser</a> (who had designed the <a href="Buffalo%20nickel">Buffalo nickel</a>). Six million coins were authorized, and a beginning was made by the striking of 48,000 for the Association at the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a>; when those ran low, 100,000 more were coined at the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a>. Meeker was less successful with the later issue, and many remained unsold. Although the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Bureau of the Mint</a> struck more in 1928, these remained impounded until after Meeker's death, with tens of thousands of the earlier issues unsold.

Seattle had been Meeker's home since moving out of the mansion, but in the mid-1920s the citizens of Puyallup sought to honor him by the erection of a statue in Pioneer Park, the site of Meeker's one-time homestead. They also sought to preserve the home site, over which Eliza Jane Meeker had planted ivy a half-century before, building a <a href="pergola">pergola</a> to support the plant. With the statue and pergola completed, Meeker returned to Puyallup for the dedication ceremony in 1926. The same year, at age 95, Meeker published his first and only novel, "Kate Mulhall, a Romance of the Oregon Trail".
Meeker was again advocating better roads, and gained the support of <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a>, who built him a <a href="Ford%20Model%20A%20%281927%E2%80%931931%29">Model A</a> car with a covered wagon-style top, dubbed the Oxmobile, to be used in another expedition over the Trail to publicize Meeker's highway proposals. In October 1928, Meeker was hospitalized with pneumonia in Detroit. He returned to Seattle, where he fell ill again. Meeker was taken to a room in the Frye Hotel, where he told his daughter Ella Meeker Templeton, "I can't go. I have not yet finished my work." Ezra Meeker died there on December 3, 1928, just under a month short of his 98th birthday. His body was taken in procession back to Puyallup, where he was interred beside his wife Eliza Jane in Woodbine Cemetery. Under a plaque based on the Oregon Trail Memorial coin Ezra Meeker had inspired, their gravestone, erected by the OTMA in 1939, reads, "They came this way to win and hold the West".

Howard Driggs succeeded Meeker as president of the OTMA, and remained in that capacity at the association and its successor, the American Pioneer Trails Association (APTA), until his own death at age 89 in 1963. The year 1930, marking 100 years since both Meeker's birth and the first wagon train leaving St. Louis for the <a href="Oregon%20Country">Oregon Country</a>, was proclaimed the Covered Wagon Centennial. The largest event was at one of the landmarks along the Oregon Trail, Wyoming's <a href="Independence%20Rock%20%28Wyoming%29">Independence Rock</a>, on July 3–5, 1930. This event included the dedication of a plaque depicting Meeker, embedded in the rock. For many years, the OTMA made it a practice to go out each summer and dedicate monuments along the Oregon Trail. Although the APTA no longer exists, that mission has been continued by state historical societies and organizations which share its purpose, such as the <a href="Oregon-California%20Trails%20Association">Oregon-California Trails Association</a>.

The commemorative half dollars were struck in small numbers in most years of the 1930s; after collectors complained about the lengthy series and high prices, Congress forbade further strikings in 1939. The first route across America, the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a>, was completed in the 1920s, and others soon followed. Although Meeker's highway along the Trail was not built, <a href="U.S.%2030">U.S. 30</a> generally parallels the route of the Oregon Trail. A number of sites relating to Meeker remain in Puyallup. In addition to his gravesite, and the Meeker Mansion (now owned by and being restored by the Ezra Meeker Historical Society) there is Pioneer Park, where the ivy-covered pergola and the statue of Meeker may be found.
Local historian Lori Price noted, "Throughout his long life of nearly 98 years, the word for Meeker was action." Historian David Dary, in his book on the Oregon Trail, deems Meeker primarily responsible for re-awakening public interest in it. According to Bert Webber, "There would be no 'Oregon Trail' to enjoy today if Ezra Meeker had not set out, by himself, and without government subsidy, to preserve it." Driggs stated of Meeker after his death:

Ontario Highway 61

King's Highway 61, commonly referred to as Highway 61 and historically known as the Scott Highway, is a <a href="Provincial%20highways%20in%20Ontario">provincially maintained highway</a> in the Canadian province of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. The route connects the Pigeon River Bridge, where it crosses into the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and becomes <a href="Minnesota%20State%20Highway%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B61">Minnesota State Highway 61</a>, with a junction at <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2011">Highway 11</a>, <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2017">Highway 17</a> and the <a href="Harbour%20Expressway">Harbour Expressway</a> in <a href="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</a>. The highway forms part of the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Superior Circle Tour</a>.

Highway 61 was added to the highway system on October 6, 1937, following the amalgamation of the Department of Northern Development into the Department of Highways. Prior to that it was known as the Scott Highway. The bridge over the <a href="Pigeon%20River%20%28Minnesota%E2%80%93Ontario%29">Pigeon River</a> was originally known as The Outlaw, as it was constructed without formal approval of the Canadian or American governments.

Crossing the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">American border</a>, the Pigeon River Bridge is west of the <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20International%20Bridge">Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge</a> and east of the <a href="Fort%20Frances-International%20Falls%20International%20Bridge">Fort Frances-International Falls International Bridge</a>, and is near a visitor center. Highway 61 begins at the Ontario-Minnesota border at the Pigeon River; the road continues south to <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth</a> as State Highway 61 on the American side. Proceeding north from the border, the route passes the <a href="customs">customs</a> station and curves to the north. Passing its former routing along <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20593">Highway 593</a>, the highway curves eastward to avoid mountains. It zig-zags around a range of mountains, eventually turning northward and passing to the west of Cloud Bay. The highway continues north for through <a href="Neebing%2C%20Ontario">Neebing</a>, running between mountain ranges on either side. It rises at Moose Hill, meets <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20608">Highway 608</a> and enters one of the few agricultural areas in northwestern Ontario. Shortly thereafter, Highway 61 curves to the east, passing the southern terminus of <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20130">Highway 130</a> along the way. It then enters the outskirts of Thunder Bay.
The highway passes Chippewa Road, its former route through <a href="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</a>, and returns to its northward orientation. It officially enters the city as it crosses the <a href="Kaministiquia%20River">Kaministiquia River</a>. The highway swerves east at <a href="Thunder%20Bay%20International%20Airport">Thunder Bay International Airport</a> as it widens to four lanes then continues north, crossing Arthur Street. North of Arthur Street, the highway is also known as the <a href="Thunder%20Bay%20Expressway">Thunder Bay Expressway</a>. It continues north for and ends at the <a href="Harbour%20Expressway">Harbour Expressway</a> and <a href="Trans-Canada%20Highway">Trans-Canada Highway</a>.

The northernmost section in Thunder Bay is a four-lane, undivided <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a>. The remainder of Highway 61 is a conventional two-lane highway. Traffic volumes along the southern portion of the highway are generally low, with an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 1,000 vehicles. This increases progressing north; within Thunder Bay the AADT peaks at 17,200 vehicles.

Highway 61 also forms a small portion of the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Superior Circle Tour</a>, a tourist route of highways following the shoreline of <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>. To the south, the tour continues along Minnesota State Highway 61; to the north it continues along Highway 17 towards <a href="Sault%20Saint%20Marie%2C%20Ontario">Sault Saint Marie</a>.

The road that would become Highway 61 was first constructed in 1916. The Pigeon River Timber Company had cleared lands surrounding the towns of <a href="Port%20Arthur%2C%20Ontario">Port Arthur</a> and <a href="Fort%20William%2C%20Ontario">Fort William</a>, but no road existed to connect to locations outside. A narrow wilderness trail reached as far as the Pigeon River, and was chosen as the route for the new road. The <a href="Department%20of%20Mines%20and%20Resources">Department of Mines and Resources</a> agreed to fund the project, and citizens proceeded to lay a new road as far as the river, beginning in 1913. This road was initially known as the "Scott Highway" after lumberman William Scott. On the opposite shore, <a href="Cook%20County%2C%20Minnesota">Cook County</a> and the State of Minnesota constructed a new road north from <a href="Grand%20Marais%2C%20Minnesota">Grand Marais</a>. The roads were completed by late 1916, but no bridge existed to connect them.

In response, the <a href="Rotary%20Clubs">Rotary Clubs</a> of Port Arthur and Duluth met to discuss a solution. As an international crossing, any bridge over the river would require federal approval from both governments. Both sides agreed that the approval process would be too slow, and decided to construct the bridge regardless. "The Outlaw" bridge was opened by a travelling motorcade on August 18, 1917, finally permitting travel between Ontario and Minnesota.
To the surprise of the Rotary Clubs, J. E. Whitson, Roads Commissioner of Northern Ontario, and <a href="Howard%20Ferguson">Howard Ferguson</a>, Minister of Lands, Forest and Mines, were present at the opening, and agreed to pay the $768,000 ($ in ) bridge cost. The bridge and the Canadian road approaching it fell under the jurisdiction of the <a href="Department%20of%20Highways">Department of Highways</a> (now the Ministry of Transportation) on April 1, 1937, and the Scott Highway became Highway 61 on October 6. The Outlaw was rebuilt as a <a href="steel%20truss">steel truss</a> structure in 1934 following several accidents.
By 1962, construction was underway to bypass the inland route of the highway as well as the bridge. This bypass opened on November 1, 1963;
the American approach was rebuilt along the shore of Lake Superior, and a new bridge constructed over the river to the east. This bridge was opened on May 23, 1964. Highway 61 was realigned as a result; the former route was redesignated as <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20593">Highway 593</a> on September 1, 1964.

In 1963, <a href="Charles%20MacNaughton">Charles MacNaughton</a>, minister of the Department of Highways, announced plans for the Lakehead Expressway to be built on the western edge of the twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William (which amalgamated in 1970 to form Thunder Bay).
Construction began in the late 1960s and progressed rapidly.
Following its completion by late 1970, Highway 61 was rerouted along it as far north as Arthur Street.
The former route followed Chippewa Road, turned north on James Street and then east on Frederica Street. From there, it turned north along Ford Street and followed it and Kingsway to Highway 11 and Highway 17 at Arthur Street. This route was renumbered as Highway 61B; it remained in place into the 1990s,
but was decommissioned by 1999.

Beginning in 1991, Highway 61 was completely reconstructed south of Thunder Bay to the border in preparation for the <a href="FIS%20Nordic%20World%20Ski%20Championships%201995">1995 World Nordic Ski Championships</a>. This involved replacing eight bridges, improving sightlines, and adding five <a href="passing%20lanes">passing lanes</a> and paved shoulders throughout the length of the highway.
The highway was extended to the north on August 17, 2007, when the Shabaqua Highway opened, redirecting Highway 11 and Highway 17 off Arthur Street.

Fremantle Prison

<onlyinclude>

Fremantle Prison, sometimes referred to as Fremantle Gaol or Fremantle Jail, is a former <a href="List%20of%20Australian%20prisons">Australian prison</a> and <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> in <a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a>, Western Australia. The site includes the prison cellblocks, gatehouse, perimeter walls, cottages, and tunnels. It was initially used for <a href="Convict%20era%20of%20Western%20Australia">convicts transported from Britain</a>, but was transferred to the colonial government in 1886 for use for locally-sentenced prisoners. <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>s were held in 1898 and 1911, and instigated some reform to the prison system, but significant changes did not begin until the 1960s. The government department in charge of the prison underwent several reorganisations in the 1970s and 1980s, but the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent culminated in <a href="Fremantle%20Prison%20riot">a 1988 riot</a> with guards taken hostage, and a fire that caused $1.8 million worth of damage. The prison closed in 1991, replaced by the new maximum-security <a href="Casuarina%20Prison">Casuarina Prison</a>.

The prison was administered by a <a href="Comptroller%20General%20of%20Convicts%20%28Western%20Australia%29">comptroller general</a>, sheriff, or director, responsible for the entire convict or prison system in Western Australia, and a superintendent in charge of the prison itself. Prison officers, known as warders in the 19th century, worked under stringent conditions until they achieved representation through the <a href="Western%20Australian%20Prison%20Officers%27%20Union">Western Australian Prison Officers' Union</a>. Convicts were initially of good character as potential future colonists, but less desirable convicts were eventually sent. As a locally-run prison, Fremantle's population was generally short-sentenced white prisoners in the 1890s, with very few Aboriginal prisoners. By the late 20th century, most prisoners were serving longer sentences, a higher proportion of them were violent, and Aboriginal people were over-represented.

Prison life at Fremantle was extremely regulated. Meals were an important part of the day, eaten in the cells throughout the operational life of the prison. Convict or prisoner labour was used on public infrastructure works until around 1911; subsequently, only work inside the prison was allowed, though there was never enough to fully occupy the inmates. Punishments varied over the years, with <a href="flogging">flogging</a> and time in <a href="leg%20irons">irons</a> eventually replaced by lengthening of sentences and deprivation of visitors or entertainment. More than 40 hangings were carried out at Fremantle Prison, which was Western Australia's only lawful place of execution, between 1888 and 1984. Prominent escapees included <a href="Moondyne%20Joe">Moondyne Joe</a>, as well as <a href="John%20Boyle%20O%27Reilly">John Boyle O'Reilly</a> and six other <a href="Fenian">Fenian</a>s in the 19th century, and <a href="Brenden%20Abbott">Brenden Abbott</a> in 1989. There have been various riots and other disturbances, with major riots causing damage in 1968 and 1988.

Since 1991, Fremantle Prison has been conserved as a recognised heritage site, and various restoration works have been undertaken. New uses have been found for some buildings within the prison, which has also become a significant tourist attraction. The process of obtaining World Heritage listing as part of the <a href="Australian%20Convict%20Sites">Australian Convict Sites</a> submission focused historical interpretation and conservation efforts on the prison's convict era (18501886), at the expense of its more recent history, including Aboriginal prisoners held there.

Fremantle Prison was built on a land grant of about from limestone quarried on-site. A tall boundary wall encloses the prison grounds, with a gatehouse in the centre of the western wall, facing The Terrace. Other roads bounding the site are Knutsford Street to the north, <a href="Hampton%20Road">Hampton Road</a> to the east, and Fothergill Street to the south. Cottages, which housed prison workers and officials, are located outside the wall either side of the gatehouse. Inside the walls, the parade ground is located east of the gatehouse. Beyond it is the Main Cell Block at the centre of the site, which contains two chapels. North of the main block is New Division, and west of that, in the north-western corner, is the former Women's Prison, previously the cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry. The hospital building stands in the north-eastern corner, while the former workshops are located in the south-eastern corner, as well as to the north of the gatehouse. A system of underground tunnels, constructed to provide fresh water from an <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>, runs under the eastern edge of the site.

North of the gatehouse, located at 2, 4, and 6 The Terrace, are cottages built in <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> style, in contrast to the <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> style of the other houses. Number 10 is a double-storey house, initially built in 1853 for the chaplain, but taken over by the superintendent in 1878 and later used by the prison administration. An adjoining single-storey at number 12, finished in 1854, was the home of the gatekeeper, located on the north side of the gatehouse. Number 16 The Terrace, south of the gatehouse, is a double-storey house that accommodated first the superintendent, and later the resident magistrate. It remained in use as housing for prison officers until the 1970s. Number 18, the southernmost house on The Terrace, and number 8, the northernmost of the initial buildings, both featured two sitting rooms, three bedrooms, and two dressing rooms, as well as a kitchen, <a href="water%20closet">water closet</a> and shed, but with mirrored layouts. Number 18 was expanded with additions built in the 1890s.

The gatehouse and associated entry complex was constructed between 1854 and 1855 using convict labour. It was designed by Royal Engineer and Comptroller General <a href="Edmund%20Henderson">Edmund Henderson</a>, and constructed out of limestone. The gatehouse has two towers either side of a narrow gate, reminiscent of those found in 13th century English castles or walled cities. Iron that had been scavenged from shipwrecks was used to make the gate, while the clock at the top of the structure was imported from England. As the main entrance, the gatehouse has remained a significant feature and landmark; since the closure of the prison, it has housed a café and office areas. Restoration was carried out in 2005, preserving the original stone facade and removing non-original rendering.

Little-changed since its construction in the 1850s by convicts, the Main Cell Block was designed to hold up to 1000 prisoners. The central, four-storey high cell block is flanked on either end by large dormitory wards, called the Association Rooms. Here, as many as 80 men slept in hammocks, either as a reward for good behaviour or because they would soon receive their <a href="ticket%20of%20leave">ticket of leave</a>. In contrast, the cramped cells measured just . Although each cell initially had a basin connected to running water, the installation was before the advent of <a href="S-bend">S-bend</a>s; the smells coming up the pipes led to their removal by the 1860s. Following a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>, the cells were enlarged by removing a dividing wall from between two cells. Electric lighting was installed in the 1920s, but there were never any toilets – buckets were used for the duration of the prison's operation. Since the prison's closure, six cells have been restored to represent the varying living conditions at different times in the prison's history. The main block also houses the <a href="gallows">gallows</a>, <a href="solitary%20confinement">solitary confinement</a> cells, and two chapels – <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> and <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a>.

Fremantle Prison's New Division building was constructed between 1904 and 1907, as a response to overcrowding. It also allowed prison administrators to implement the "<a href="separate%20system">separate system</a>", whereby prisoners were completely isolated for the first three months of their sentence. A <a href="panopticon">panopticon</a> in the exercise yard was initially used to facilitate this concept during the prisoners' hour of exercise each day. The system was not successful, and considered a dated prisoner management strategy, leading to its removal within five years. New Division was the first building to have electricity, with underground wiring. During World War II, the Australian Army appropriated the division, to keep their prisoners separate from the main population. In 1994 the building was retrofitted to cater for offices, small business premises, and meeting rooms.

The north-western complex was originally a service area with a cookhouse, bakehouse and laundry, built in the 1850s. A place for women prisoners was needed following the closure of <a href="Perth%20Gaol">Perth Gaol</a> and the transfer of prisoners to Fremantle. The buildings were converted to a prison, and a wall built around them, creating Western Australia's first separate prison for women. Population and crime growth led to them being extended in the 1890s and 1910s. The construction of <a href="Bandyup%20Women%27s%20Prison">Bandyup Women's Prison</a> saw Fremantle's Women's Prison close in 1970, with the space used for education and assessment until the main prison's closure in 1991.

Built between 1857 and 1859, the hospital was a crucial component of Fremantle Prison. Public works during the convict era relied on convict labour, which could only be provided if the convicts were healthy. From 1886 to 1903, medical services were relocated to the main cell block, with the former building used to keep invalids and female prisoners. The hospital was refurbished and reopened in 1904. It subsequently remained in continuous operation until the prison's closure in 1991.

The original workshop was a blacksmith's shop, one of the first buildings to be constructed on the prison site. Later known as the East Workshops, other workshops included carpenter's, plumber's and painter's, a printing office, and from the 1850s, a metal shop. The West Workshops were built at the start of the twentieth century, providing more work for prisoners through a paint shop, mat maker, shoe maker, book binder and tailor shop.
In 1993 the four northern workshops were adapted for use as <a href="technical%20and%20further%20education">TAFE</a> art workshops.

In the 1850s, shafts were sunk into the <a href="limestone">limestone</a> bedrock to provide the prison with fresh water from an <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>, and a tank was installed in 1874 to offer the town of Fremantle an alternative water supply. Prisoners worked a pump to fill the tank, which was connected to the jetties through <a href="Gravity%20feed">gravity-fed</a> pipes. In 1896, a town reservoir was constructed on Swanbourne Street, fed from the prison by a <a href="triple-expansion">triple-expansion</a> steam-driven pump that could take more than per day from the prison tunnels. Prisoners, relieved of manual pumping, were employed to supply wood and stoke boilers. The tunnels were closed in 1910, though the groundwater continued to be used for the prison's gardens. In 1989, oil leaking from nearby tanks contaminated the water; however, the pollution was cleared by 1996 through <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a>. The tunnels were re-opened in mid-2005, and had been refurbished within a year to improve the experience for visitors.

While the Swan River Colony was established as a "free settlement" (unlike the <a href="penal%20colonies">penal colonies</a> on the east coast), by the 1840s demand for cheap labour overcame an early reluctance, and the colony agreed to accept some convicts from Britain. The arrival of the first convict ship "<a href="Scindian">Scindian</a>" on 2 June 1850 was unexpected, as a sailing ship that had been sent ahead had been blown off-course. The colony's <a href="Round%20House%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Round House</a> jail was full, so the 75 convicts had to be left on the ship until a temporary prison was built. Comptroller General of Convicts Edward Henderson looked for a place to build a permanent convict establishment, and ultimately settled on the current site, on a hill overlooking Fremantle.

The design for Fremantle Prison was based on the <a href="Pentonville%20Prison">Pentonville Prison</a> in Britain, but with diagonal cell blocks replaced with a four-storey linear structure, which would be the longest, tallest prison cell block in the southern hemisphere. Construction began in 1851, and work rapidly progressed following the arrival of the Royal Engineers later that year. They trained convicts to work with limestone, which was quarried on-site. The first priority was the construction of accommodation for Henderson and the prison warders, to relieve the expense of paying for private lodging.

The prison walls were constructed between 1853 and 1855, while the gatehouse and associated entry complex was built in 1854 and 1855. Construction of the southern half of the Main Cell Block began in 1853 and was finished in 1855, with prisoners transferred from the temporary prison on 1 June 1855. Construction of the northern wing followed. The <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a> saw the Royal Engineers recalled, leaving only one of their number, <a href="Henry%20Wray">Henry Wray</a>, to oversee the building's construction, which was completed by the end of 1859.

During <a href="Convict%20era%20of%20Western%20Australia">Western Australia's convict era</a>, the prison was known as the Convict Establishment, and was used for prisoners transported from Britain. Longer term locally-sentenced prisoners were also held there from 1858, at a cost to the colonial government. In 1868, <a href="penal%20transportation">penal transportation</a> to Western Australia ceased, and the number of convicts in the colony gradually declined, down to 83 in the mid-1880s. Due to the great expense of sending these convicts back to Britain, the authorities there negotiated with the colonial government to relinquish jurisdiction over them, as well as the prison complex – demolition was considered too expensive. Early negotiations had broken down, but were restarted in August 1883. After one and a half years, a compromise was reached, and the transfer was finalised on 31 March 1886.

Once the prison came under the control of the colonial government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison. All prisoners in Perth Gaol were transferred to Fremantle, and from 1887 female prisoners were also imprisoned there, in their own separate section. The <a href="Western%20Australian%20gold%20rushes">Western Australian gold rushes</a> of the 1890s resulted in strong economic growth, and a massive increase in population: doubling from almost 50,000 in 1891 to more than 100,000 by 1895, and to 184,000 by 1901. This influx included desperate, dishonest people, from elsewhere in Australia and overseas, and Fremantle Prison was soon overcrowded.
The 1890s also saw a growing public unease with the treatment of prisoners. In September 1898 a Royal Commission was established by the Governor of Western Australia to investigate the colony's penal system. The commission heard evidence from almost 240 witnesses, including a range of prisoners. Three reports were made between December 1898 and June 1899, dealing with the most recognisable and prominent issues including classification, sentencing, punishments, and diet. In particular, they considered the philosophy of the prison system – the causes of crime, as well as the types of punishments and their justifications – and in light of this, the practicality of various reform proposals.

Within a year of the enquiry, almost 100 cells had been enlarged by knocking down the inner wall between two cells, and a classification system was introduced. Internal walls were constructed in the main block, creating four separate divisions. Following the urgings of the prison Superintendent George and various official enquiries, new workshops were built to provide increased useful employment for prisoners. Five spaces were designed for tailors, bookbinders, shoemakers, mat makers and painters.

New regulations for prison officers were published in the Government Gazette in 1902, and a new Prisons Act was passed in 1903. While in theory the passing of the Act should have resulted in significant prison reform, this did not eventuate. The legislation left much of the changes to executive regulation, at the discretion of the governor, and was described by the media as a feeble document.

New Division, completed in 1907 and occupied in 1908, resulted from the 1899 Commissioners' report recommending a modified version of the separate system. The new division was similar in design to Henderson's 1850s structure, but was constructed in an L-shape, was only three stories tall, and had electric lighting. It also differed in its use from the main cell block. Unlike occupants of the earlier building, prisoners remained continuously in their cells except when exercising in separate yards, watched panopticon-style by a warder in a central tower.
In 1911 another Royal Commission investigation into Fremantle Prison recommended closing the facility. Its report was ignored by the state government, which was more concerned with building infrastructure such as roads and schools than the plight of its prisoners. However, there was a rapid change in prison policy, with the appointment of a superintendent, Hugh Hann, who had recent English and colonial experience, and the election of a <a href="Scaddan%20Ministry">Labor government</a> with members interested in penal reform. One immediate result was the dismantling of the separate system at Fremantle Prison and the demolition of the separate exercise yards in 1912.

Fremantle Prison was partially used as a <a href="military%20prison">military prison</a> during both world wars – for the detention of military personnel, as well as an internment centre. From 1940 until 1946, it was one of more than 50 military prisons across Australia holding a combined total of more than 12,000 <a href="enemy%20alien">enemy alien</a>s and <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a>. Fremantle accommodated up to 400 military prisoners and up to 160 civilian prisoners by October 1945. The World War II takeover necessitated the commissioning of Barton's Mill Prison in 1942.

Prison outstations were established as part of the reforms in the 20th century, and to reduce the overcrowding at Fremantle. <a href="Pardelup%20Prison%20Farm">Pardelup Prison Farm</a> opened in 1927, near Mount Barker, while Barton's Mill, though planned to be a temporary measure, remained open as a prison after World War II. Significant reform to Western Australia's prison system did not begin until the 1960s, lagging behind those which occurred elsewhere in Australia and the world after World War II. Seven new prisons were opened between 1960 and 1971, and in 1970, female prisoners and staff were moved from Fremantle to the new Bandyup Women's Prison. New legislation regarding probation, parole, and convicted drunkards was also introduced, which provided alternatives to imprisonment. With these new arrangements, and more variety in prisons and prison types, a classification board was set up in 1963 to assess prisoners.
The appointment of Colin Campbell as comptroller general in 1966 fostered substantial changes within Fremantle Prison itself. One of his first changes was to clear the classification committee's backlog of prisoners awaiting assessment. Campbell also established an officer training school, as well as an assessment centre to evaluate new prisoners. Work release and community service programs were also introduced, along with training programs, social workers and welfare officers. Within the midst of Campbell's reforms, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections in 1971, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department.

In 1972 a Royal Commission was appointed to investigate mistreatment of and discrimination against Aboriginal prisoners. Its 1973 report found that there was not "any appreciable discrimination", however, <a href="racial%20stereotype">racial stereotype</a>s are present throughout the report, and the testimony of Aboriginal prisoners was considered unreliable. The report also made recommendations regarding various aspects of prison life, including additional, independent, trained welfare officers.

William Kidston succeeded Campbell in 1977, and oversaw a shift in policy from "paternalistic rehabilitation" of prisoners to merely providing opportunities for rehabilitation. A new Prisons Act was passed in 1981, which updated the 1903 Act with modern philosophies and practices. This act was, however, slanted towards prisoner management and safety, and the department was at the same time renamed the Prisons Department once more, to emphasise imprisonment as its primary responsibility. Ian Hill became Director of the Prisons Department in 1983, and reorganised the department several times, striving for increased efficiency. Whilst the changes of the 1980s were effective throughout most of Western Australia's prison system, the culture of Fremantle Prison was resistant to change. Growing prisoner discontent eventually culminated in the <a href="Fremantle%20Prison%20riot">1988 prison riot</a>, investigated by an official enquiry later that year.

The state government made the decision to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991. Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at <a href="Casuarina%20Prison">Casuarina</a>. There were divergent views in the community over the site's future, whether it should be preserved or redeveloped. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.

The Fremantle Prison Trust was established in 1992 to advise the <a href="Minister%20for%20Works%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Minister for Works</a> on the management of the site. Various new uses were found for different parts of the prison, including <a href="wedding">wedding</a> services in the chapels, the Coastal Business Centre in New Division, and the <a href="Fremantle%20Children%27s%20Literature%20Centre">Fremantle Children's Literature Centre</a> in the hospital; the prison also became a tourist attraction. A private company, the Fremantle Prison Guardians, organised the tourist operation for ten years under contract, until the end of 2001; subsequently, the state government took control. A <a href="hostel">hostel</a> providing short-stay accommodation in the Women's Prison opened in May 2015.

Western Australia's first comptroller general of convicts, Edmund Henderson,<ref name="Hasluck 1959/1991 Unwilling emigrants"></ref> administered the convict establishment for thirteen years. The primary responsibilities of the comptroller general were to "direct convict labour and be responsible for convict discipline". With the transfer of Fremantle Prison to the colonial government in 1886, the role of the comptroller was replaced by that of the <a href="sheriff">sheriff</a>, responsible for all of the prisons in the colony. The position of comptroller general was recreated, with duties split off from the sheriff's office, in early 1911. In 1971, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department. While the comptroller, sheriff, or director was responsible for the overall convict or prison system, largely centred around Fremantle Prison, the responsibility of the prison itself lay with the superintendent.

On convict ships, the convicts were guarded by <a href="Pensioner%20Guards">pensioner guards</a>, who were soldiers awarded pensions for their service in areas such as China, Crimea, and Afghanistan. Some remained in the military, but many opted to stay in the colony as settlers, having brought their wives and children with them. The pensioner guards were expected to help deal with any incidents of unrest at the prison.

Fremantle Prison's officers were known as warders until the early 20th century. They lived in specially built <a href="terrace%20houses">terrace houses</a> within walking distance of the prison, and their lives were just as regimented as the prisoners. In the 1890s warders still had stringent living and working conditions, including ten- to twelve-hour working days. Due to a high turnover rate, many had little knowledge of either official policies or unofficial rules and traditions. The warder's role, previously unwritten, only became clearly defined in 1902. As well as guarding against escapes and enforcing discipline, they oversaw prisoner work and instructed inmates in trades. The warders were also supposed to be moral role models for prisoners, while maintaining a formal, distant, relationship.

The prison officer's role in the 20th century did not change much, with the job still entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. Officer training became a priority under Campbell's administration, from the late 1960s. Training courses were set up for staff inductions and promotions, and seminars were started for senior officers. The most significant change in this period, however, was that prison officers achieved representation through the <a href="Western%20Australian%20Prison%20Officers%27%20Union">Western Australian Prison Officers' Union</a>. The strength of the union was based on the ability to almost cripple the prison system through <a href="strike%20action">strike action</a>, first taken in 1975.

Convicts were introduced into Western Australia for three main purposes: inexpensive labour, additional labour, and an injection of British government spending into the local economy. During the initial years of transportation, convicts were generally young, from a rural background, and of good character, having only committed minor offences – potential future colonists, after their sentence had been served. By the 1860s the majority were older, more serious offenders from urban areas, including <a href="political%20prisoner">political prisoner</a>s considered to be "difficult and dangerous". Following the transfer of Fremantle Prison to local control in 1886, it became Western Australia's primary prison. In the late 1880s and 1890s the number of inmates swelled dramatically. This increase predominantly comprised prisoners serving shorter sentences of under three months. The number of inmates in 1897 was 379, and Inspector of Prisons James Roe viewed the prison as "inconveniently full".

Despite a large expansion of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative to the rest of Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.

In the Convict Establishment of 1855, the day began with the wakeup bell at 4:30 am, and the officers and prisoners assembled in the parade ground at 5:25 am. Prisoners were sent to work before and after breakfast (in their cells), before assembling for muster at midday. This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and more work throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm.
The transfer of the Convict Establishment to the colonially-run Fremantle Prison saw little change, and no new regulations.

A similar routine, but with fewer working hours, is described in the 1930s:
Not much had changed by the 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45 am. After a prisoner count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast and headed back to their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20 pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 there was another parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30 pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.

Prisoners ate meals in their cells, from the early years of the prison through to its closure in 1991. Bread from the prison bakehouse was included in every meal in the convict era. It was served with black tea for breakfast, and with either tea or cocoa in the evening. The main meal, called dinner, was in the middle of the day, and also featured soup, meat, and vegetables.
By the 1890s food was still very limited in variety, with few vegetables. Porridge was given for breakfast, usually too fluid or overly solid, and the general standard of the prison's food was quite low, particularly in 1897 and 1898. However, the quality soon improved, as noted by the 1898 Royal Commission, which recommended decreasing rations to reduce costs.

In the 1960s, food preparation was overseen by a qualified chef, who also trained prisoners. The diet consisted of quality food, but "without trimmings". Breakfast was porridge, with a third of a pint of milk, a hot drink (tea, unless the prisoner bought coffee or cocoa), and either <a href="Vegemite">Vegemite</a>, honey, or margarine, depending on the week. Lunch and dinner had more variation. Both meals consisted of a meat dish – corned beef, sausages, or mince pie – as well as mashed potato and cabbage, although there was occasionally a <a href="roast%20dinner">roast dinner</a>. Meat, vegetables and bread were still a prominent part of the diet in 1991.

As well as being used to build the prison itself, convict labour, with convicts in <a href="chain%20gang">chain gang</a>s, was used for other public works in the Fremantle and surrounding Perth area, including <a href="The%20Causeway">The Causeway</a>, <a href="Perth%20Town%20Hall">Perth Town Hall</a> and <a href="Stirling%20Highway">Stirling Highway</a>.
The work undertaken by a convict depended on their behaviour and demeanour. Upon arrival to Western Australia, convicts were kept within the prison for a period of observation. If found to have a reasonable disposition, the convict would be sent to work, in a gang under the control of a warder. Typical activities included "quarrying, filling swamps, burning lime, constructing public buildings, roads and jetties" around Fremantle and Perth.

After some time, they might be sent to work on road or other projects away from these main settlements. Continued good behaviour could see the convict granted a ticket-of-leave, allowing private employment in a specified district of the colony, and eventually a Conditional Pardon, allowing most freedoms, except for returning to England. A Certificate of Freedom would only be granted at the end of a sentence. Misbehaviour would result in demotion through these levels of work, including returning to convict status within the prison. Re-offenders and captured escapees, after <a href="corporal%20punishment">corporal punishment</a> and time in solitary confinement, would be placed on a chain gang undertaking hard labour, typically on roads near Fremantle.

Outside work, mostly on public infrastructure, continued beyond the convict era, but gradually declined due to discipline concerns, the rise of trade unions that saw such work as "a threat to free labour", and an increasing emphasis on work as rehabilitation rather than punishment. By 1911 outside work had all but ceased, but could not adequately be replaced by employment within the prison walls; a lack of suitable work plagued the prison throughout its lifetime. Work in the 19th century consisted of cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the prison, tailoring, bootmaking, and printing. However, demand exceeded the availability of such work – increasingly so in the later years of the 19th century – so prisoners were also given activities with no practical value other than keeping them occupied. These included breaking stones, operating a water pump, and <a href="oakum">oakum</a> picking. Even with these extra activities, by 1899, 60 to 70 men were employed at the pump, each doing only a few minutes work per hour, and occupied the rest of the time with recreation such as <a href="draughts">draughts</a>.

New workshops built in 1901 allowed prisoners to work in bootmaking and tailoring, and from 1904, printing. Only a small fraction of prisoners were allocated to the workshops – 35 out of an average of 279 prisoners in 1902. In 1908, there were still few men employed in the workshops, 20 in tailoring, 15 in bootmaking, and 12 in mat making, with only half of these working at a time, and little improvement by the 1911 Royal Commission. The 20th century saw little change in the work prisoners did. There were similar workshops, with the addition of metal work, and similar jobs around the prison complex, including in the laundry, in the kitchen, and cleaning the prison. In 1984, 90% of prisoners were reported to be employed, either full-time or part-time. The meaningfulness of the work was nominal, as work was viewed as "a management option rather than [for] production", but security concerns and discipline restricted the rehabilitative value of the work, and limited much of the work to jobs non-existent outside of prison.

In the convict era, particularly during Hampton's term as governor, misbehaving prisoners were punished with <a href="flogging">flogging</a>, solitary confinement, and working in chain gangs at gunpoint. Particularly difficult prisoners were put to work hand pumping groundwater into the prison's reservoir. Known as cranking, it was especially despised by the prisoners. Staff disliked giving the lashings – in 1851, out of a total of 400 lashings ordered, 150 were remitted as the superintendent could not find anyone to undertake the task. The role was so disliked that inducements were offered, including extra pay or improved lodgings.

By the 1880s, punishments also included a restricted diet of bread and water (for a short time span), time in <a href="leg%20irons">irons</a>, and a lengthening of a prisoner's sentence by a visiting magistrate. The <a href="cat%20o%27%20nine%20tails">cat o' nine tails</a>, which had been used since the early days of the prison, was abolished during the post-1911 Royal Commission reforms. Other reforms in this period saw the number of punishments inflicted decrease from 184 in 1913 to 57 in 1914, and 35 in 1915.

Flogging was discontinued in the 1940s, with the last incident occurring in 1943. From that decade, punishments were decided by the superintendent after hearing the case against a prisoner, or by a magistrate for grievous violations. Lesser transgressions could result in solitary confinement, or restriction from visitors, education, and concerts; serious offences were punishable by the cancellation of any remission earned and a bread-and-water diet, normally over a two-week period.

As soon as Fremantle Prison came under local control in 1886, a refractory block with gallows was planned. It was completed in 1888, and first used in 1889 to execute a convicted murderer, Jimmy Long, a Malayan. The gallows room was the only lawful place of <a href="Capital%20punishment">execution</a> in Western Australia between 1888 and 1984. At least 43 men and one woman were hanged in this period. <a href="Martha%20Rendell">Martha Rendell</a> was the only woman to be hanged at the prison, in 1909. The last person to be hanged was serial killer <a href="Eric%20Edgar%20Cooke">Eric Edgar Cooke</a>, executed in 1964.

From the day of sentencing to death, prisoners were kept in a concrete-floored cell in New Division. They were vigilantly observed to prevent them escaping their sentence through suicide. With hangings taking place on Monday mornings, at 8:00 am, condemned prisoners were woken three hours earlier, and provided with a last meal, shower, and clean clothes. Afterwards, handcuffed, they were moved to a holding or "condemned cell" nearby the gallows, and allowed a couple of sips of brandy to calm their nerves. Shortly before 8:00 am, they were hooded, led up to the execution chamber, which could hold as many as eleven witnesses, stood over the trap door, had a noose put around their neck, and were hanged by dropping through the opening trap door. After medical examination, the deceased was removed for burial.

There were a multitude of attempted escapes from Fremantle Prison. Prominent escapees included <a href="Moondyne%20Joe">Moondyne Joe</a> in 1867, <a href="John%20Boyle%20O%27Reilly">John Boyle O'Reilly</a> in 1869 and six other <a href="Fenian">Fenian</a>s in 1876, and <a href="Brenden%20Abbott">Brenden Abbott</a> in 1989.

Joseph Bolitho Johns, better known as Moondyne Joe, was Western Australia's best known <a href="bushranger">bushranger</a>. In July 1865, Johns was sentenced to ten years penal servitude for killing a steer. He and another prisoner absconded from a work party in early November, and were on the run for nearly a month, during which time Johns adopted the nickname Moondyne Joe. For absconding and for being in possession of a firearm, Moondyne Joe was sentenced to twelve months in irons, and transferred to Fremantle Prison. In July 1866 he received a further six months in irons for trying to cut the lock out of his door, but in August Moondyne Joe succeeded in escaping again. Moondyne Joe formulated a plan to escape the colony by travelling overland to South Australia, but was captured on 29 September about north-east of <a href="Perth">Perth</a>.

As punishment for escaping and for the robberies committed while on the run, Moondyne Joe received five years hard labour on top of his remaining sentence. Extraordinary measures were taken to ensure that he did not escape again. He was transferred to Fremantle Prison where a special "escape-proof" cell was made for him, built from stone, lined with <a href="Eucalyptus%20marginata">jarrah</a> <a href="Railroad%20tie">sleepers</a> and over 1000 nails. In early 1867 Moondyne Joe was set to work breaking stone, but rather than permit him to leave the prison, the acting comptroller-general ordered that the stone be brought in and dumped in a corner of the prison yard, where Moondyne Joe worked under the constant supervision of a warder.

Governor <a href="John%20Hampton">John Hampton</a> was so confident of the arrangements, he was heard to say to Moondyne Joe: "If you get out again, I'll forgive you". However, the rock broken by Moondyne Joe was not removed regularly, and eventually a pile grew up until it obscured the guard's view of him below the waist. Partially hidden behind the pile of rocks, he occasionally swung his sledgehammer at the limestone wall of the prison. On 7 March 1867, Moondyne Joe escaped through a hole he had made in the prison wall. A few days before the second anniversary of his escape, Moondyne Joe was recaptured, returned to prison, and sentenced to an additional four years in irons. Eventually, Governor <a href="Frederick%20Weld">Frederick Weld</a> heard of his predecessor Hampton's promise, and decided that further punishment would be unfair. Moondyne Joe was given a ticket of leave in May 1871.

From 1865 to 1867, British authorities rounded up supporters of the <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Brotherhood">Irish Republican Brotherhood</a>, or Fenians, an <a href="Ireland">Irish</a> independence movement, and transported sixty-two of them to Western Australia. In 1869, John Boyle O'Reilly escaped on the American whaling ship "Gazelle" and settled in Boston. Later that year, pardons were issued to many of the imprisoned Fenians, after which only eight militant Fenians remained in Western Australia's penal system.

The Fenians in America bought the whaling ship "Catalpa", which on 29 April 1875 sailed from <a href="New%20Bedford%2C%20Massachusetts">New Bedford, Massachusetts</a> on a secret rescue mission. Coordinating with local Fenian agents, the escape was arranged for 17 April 1876, when most of the Convict Establishment garrison would be watching the Royal Perth Yacht Club <a href="regatta">regatta</a>. "Catalpa" dropped anchor in <a href="international%20waters">international waters</a> off <a href="Rockingham%2C%20Western%20Australia">Rockingham</a> and dispatched a <a href="whaleboat">whaleboat</a> to the shore. At 8.30 am, six Fenians who were working in work parties outside the prison walls absconded, and were met by carriages that raced south to where the boat was waiting.

The whaleboat managed to rendezvous with "Catalpa" the following day, which then headed out to sea. They were chased by the steamship "<a href="SS%20Georgette">SS Georgette</a>", which had been commandeered by the colonial governor. Though "Georgette" caught up with the whaler on 19 April, "Catalpa" master claimed they were in international waters, and that an attack on "Catalpa" would be considered an <a href="Casus%20belli">act of war</a> against the United States. Not wanting to cause a diplomatic incident, "Georgette" allowed "Catalpa" to flee.

Brenden Abbott, "the Postcard Bandit", escaped from Fremantle Prison in 1989. He had been sentenced to twelve years in prison for "Australia's first 'drop in'-style bank robbery" at the <a href="Belmont%2C%20Western%20Australia">Belmont</a> branch of the <a href="Commonwealth%20Bank">Commonwealth Bank</a>. While working in the prison's tailor shop, he was able to stitch together overalls resembling those worn by the guards. Abbott and two accomplices took the opportunity to escape, wearing the overalls, when left unsupervised in the workshop. They cut through a bar and got onto the roof. One accomplice fell and broke his leg, but Abbott and the other managed to jump over to the wall, and thus escape.

Abbott avoided capture until 1995, committing various robberies as he moved across Australia. He also escaped from a Queensland prison after two years and returned to Western Australia, allegedly robbing the Commonwealth Bank's <a href="Mirrabooka%2C%20Western%20Australia">Mirrabooka</a> branch. Abbott was recaptured in Darwin, six months after his escape, and was sent to a Queensland maximum-security prison with a twenty year sentence to serve.

There have been various prisoner riots and other disturbances at Fremantle Prison over the years that it was operational. One of the earliest was in 1854, while major riots which occurred in 1968 and 1988 resulted in damage to the prison.

A riot occurred on 4 June 1968, precipitated by the serving of allegedly contaminated food to prisoners the previous evening. Other factors that contributed were the rudimentary and deplorable state of sanitation and personal cleanliness facilities, tougher sentencing introduced with the Parole Act of 1964, and the overcrowding. When the work bell was rung at 1 pm, prisoners rebelled; refusing to go back to work, they assembled themselves in the exercise yards. The prison superintendent Mr Thorpe negotiated with two deputations of prisoners. As well as better food, they demanded single cells and the dismissal of specific wardens.

After approximately three hours, the negotiations broke down, and that night's evening meal was withheld. That caused the prisoners to riot, breaking fittings; during the commotion, three prison officers, three prisoners, and a detective sustained injuries. Additional police and wardens arrived at 5 pm, but took seven hours to subdue the prisoners, with the last of them locked in their cells just after midnight. The extent of the damage was in the order of $200 to $300. To relieve the overcrowding and reduce prisoner agitation, around 60 men who had not taken part in the riot were transferred to prisons at Albany, Geraldton, <a href="Karnet%20Prison%20Farm">Karnet</a>, and Barton's Mill. However, other improvements could not be undertaken without funding from the <a href="Brand%E2%80%93Nalder%20Ministry">state government</a>, which did not consider prison reform a priority.

On 4 January 1988, despite the heat, officers decided prisoners should remain outside in the exercise yards in the afternoon. As division 3 prisoners were let inside at around 4 pm, a voice exclaimed "Let's take 'em", and simultaneously, guards were splashed with boiling water, usually used for making tea. A horde of prisoners stormed the cellblock, attacking the guards with whatever makeshift weapons they could find. This resulted in pandemonium; prisoners rushed along landings, overpowering officers and taking them hostage, while at the same time, other prisoners darted between cells, starting fires. The prisoners withdrew to the exercise yard, taking six hostages, as flames quickly overran the building, spread into the rafters, and caused the roof to collapse.

Police negotiators communicated with the ring leaders, and by nightfall only five hostages remained.
Meanwhile, the fire brigade had trouble bringing the inferno in the main cell block under control, as the prison's gate was too narrow for their trucks, and prisoners impeded their endeavours by throwing debris at them.
The prisoners' leaders made three demands: a meeting with Attorney General <a href="Joe%20Berinson">Joe Berinson</a>, access to the media, and a guarantee of no retribution afterwards. The next morning, after 19 hours, the hostages were released, even though only the third demand had been met. Prisoners did, however, have an opportunity to communicate with the press during the siege, as the riot was a live media event with television helicopters filming from overhead.

Although there were no deaths, the fire caused $1.8 million of damage, and officers were injured. In the aftermath of the riot, there was extensive media attention on Fremantle Prison, and investigative journalists uncovered prior warnings to the prison authorities of the risk of such an event. The government hastily initiated an enquiry into the incident, and a report was completed within six weeks.
A trial involving thirty-three prisoners charged over the riot was also held, the largest in the state's history, which resulted in lengthened sentences for the prisoners.

Fremantle Prison was listed in the Western Australian Register of Historic Places as an interim entry on 10 January 1992 and included as a permanent entry on 30 June 1995. Described as the best preserved convict-built prison in the country, it became the first building in Western Australia to be listed on the <a href="Australian%20National%20Heritage%20List">Australian National Heritage List</a>, in 2005. The Australian Federal Heritage Minister, Senator <a href="Ian%20Campbell%20%28Australian%20politician%29">Ian Campbell</a>, stated that it would be included in a nomination of eleven convict areas to become <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s. Five years later, these locations were inscribed on the UNESCO <a href="World%20Heritage%20List">World Heritage List</a> in 2010 as the <a href="Australian%20Convict%20Sites">Australian Convict Sites</a>.

The process of obtaining World Heritage listing focused historical interpretation and conservation efforts on the prison's convict era. This came at the expense of its more recent history, included use as an internment centre during World War II, and the imprisonment of Aboriginal prisoners. The prioritisation, evident from the first <a href="Conservation%20Plan">conservation plans</a> from before the prison closed, is reflected in the branding of the tourist experience as "Fremantle Prison – the Convict Establishment", and through restorations that, while necessary to prevent damage and deterioration, strip away the site's recent history.

Various parts of Fremantle Prison have had restoration works undertaken since the 1990s; a total of $800,000 was spent between 1996/97 and 1998/99 on works which included restoring the facade of the Anglican chapel.
In 2005, work was undertaken on the restoration of the prison gatehouse area. Non-original rendering was removed and the original stonework was revealed.
Work was also completed on the tunnels during 2005/06, and the main cell block was restored with an eighteen month, $1.9 million project in 2006 and 2007. The gallows room was restored in 2013 to conditions at the time of the last execution, in 1964.

Fremantle Prison receives international and domestic tourists, as well as ex-prisoners, former prison officers, and their descendants. Tourist numbers increased each year from 2001/02 to 2009/10, up from almost 105,000 to nearly 180,000 over that period. , the prison has won, been a finalist in, or received other commendation at tourism or heritage awards each year since 2006. While the tourist experience is based on authenticity and heritage values, some details are concealed or de-emphasised, such as prison tattooing, riots, and graffiti portraying revenge, sexuality, or brutality.

Attractions include guided tours, a visitors' centre with searchable convict database, art gallery, café, gift shop, and tourist accommodation. Educational activities are regularly held for school children, as are exhibitions and re-enactments of historical events. Functions such as theme parties and dinners are held in the prison, with re-enactments serving as entertainment. Tours of the prison show aspects of prison life and recount successful and attempted escapes. Sections of the tunnels are accessible, and night tours focus on the prison's reputation for being haunted.
The Fremantle Prison Collection contains around 15,000 items associated with the prison's site, history, or the experiences of its workers and prisoners. It is also involved in preserving <a href="oral%20history">oral histories</a>, with interview transcripts stored at Fremantle Prison and recordings archived in the <a href="Battye%20Library">Battye Library</a> Oral History Collection. Recollections have been recorded since 1989, and include the experiences of authorities, staff, volunteer visitors, and prisoners. The Fremantle Prison records and collections, including archaeological, provide a substantial resource for researchers.

The Prison Gallery showcases and offers for sale the artworks of current and ex-prisoners of Western Australia. It also hosts other exhibits related to the history of the prison, including historical artefacts. Many cells and areas of the prison depict prisoners' artwork, including that of the 19th-century forger <a href="James%20Walsh%20%28convict%29">James Walsh</a>, whose artwork was hidden beneath layers of white-wash for decades. Painting or drawing on walls was originally forbidden, though graffiti, which could be viewed as art or vandalism, occurred throughout the prison's operational years. This rule was relaxed in special cases – including, from 1976, long-term prisoners within their own cells – but only for work considered art and not graffiti. Art, or <a href="art%20therapy">art therapy</a>, was not officially permitted until the 1980s; graffiti was never formally permitted, but in the prison's last six months, with closure imminent, the rule was not enforced.

A more contemporary prison artist was Dennis (NOZ) Nozworthy, who stated that he found art on death row, in 1982. Some of his work currently is held in the collections of <a href="Curtin%20University">Curtin University</a>, <a href="Perth%20Central%20TAFE">Perth Central TAFE</a>, and the WA Government, Department of Justice.
Other cells contain <a href="Indigenous%20Australians%23Art">Aboriginal</a> artwork, many by unknown artists. The <a href="Walmajarri%20language">Walmajarri</a> artist <a href="Jimmy%20Pike">Jimmy Pike</a> started painting in Fremantle prison, having received tuition from Steve Culley and David Wroth.

Harry Cobby

<a href="Air%20Commodore">Air Commodore</a> Arthur Henry "Harry" Cobby, (26 August 1894 – 11 November 1955) was an Australian <a href="air%20force">military aviator</a>. He was the leading <a href="flying%20ace">fighter ace</a> of the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a> during World War I, with 29 victories, in spite of the fact that he saw active service for less than a year.

Born and educated in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Cobby was a bank clerk when war broke out, and was prevented by his employer from enlisting in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> until 1916. After completing flight training in England, he served on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> with <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron AFC</a>, operating <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>s. His achievements as a fighter pilot were recognised with the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>, the <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> and <a href="Medal%20bar">two bars</a>, and a <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">mention in despatches</a>.

Acclaimed a national hero, Cobby transferred to the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in 1921 and rose to the rank of <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a>. He left the Permanent Air Force (PAF) in 1936 to join the <a href="Airservices%20Australia">Civil Aviation Board</a>, but remained in the RAAF reserve. Re-joining the PAF at the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Cobby held senior posts including Director of Recruiting and <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Area</a>. In 1943, he was awarded the <a href="George%20Medal">George Medal</a> for rescuing fellow survivors of an aircraft crash. He was appointed Air Officer Commanding No. 10 Operational Group (later <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a>) the following year, but was relieved of his post in the wake of the "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>" of April 1945. Retiring from the Air Force in 1946, Cobby served with the <a href="Airservices%20Australia">Department of Civil Aviation</a> until his death on <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a> in 1955.

Arthur Henry Cobby was born in the <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> suburb of <a href="Prahran%2C%20Victoria">Prahran</a> to Arthur Edward Stanley Cobby, a <a href="tram">tram</a> conductor, and his wife Alice. Known as Harry, the young Cobby completed his senior-level education at University College, <a href="Armadale%2C%20Victoria">Armadale</a>, before being commissioned into the 46th Infantry (Brighton Rifles), a <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">militia</a> unit, in 1912. He later transferred to the 47th Infantry.

When World War I broke out, Cobby attempted to enlist in the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> but his employer, the <a href="Commonwealth%20Bank">Commonwealth Bank</a>, refused to release him as his position of <a href="clerk%20%28position%29">clerk</a> was considered an essential occupation. He eventually managed to join the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) on 23 December 1916, despite a professed lack of interest in flying. He became a founding member of <a href="No.%204%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 4 Squadron AFC</a>, and embarked for England aboard <a href="SS%20Omrah">RMS "Omrah"</a> on 17 January 1917.

No. 4 Squadron arrived in England in March 1917 to undergo training in preparation for service on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>. Equipped with <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a>s, the unit was sent to France in December. Cobby later admitted to being so nervous about the prospect of going into battle that "if anything could have been done by me to delay that hour, I would have left nothing undone to bring it about". When he did see combat against the German "<a href="Luftstreitkr%C3%A4fte">Luftstreitkräfte</a>" for the first time, he had only twelve hours solo flying experience.

Cobby claimed an early victory, over a <a href="DFW%20C.V">DFW</a> <a href="reconnaissance">reconnaissance</a> plane, in February 1918, but this was credited only as "driven down" and not confirmed. Based in the <a href="Pas-de-Calais">Pas-de-Calais</a> area, No. 4 Squadron supported Allied forces during the German <a href="Spring%20Offensive">Spring Offensive</a> that commenced the following month. Cobby's aerial opponents included members of <a href="Manfred%20von%20Richthofen">Baron von Richthofen's</a> "<a href="Jagdgeschwader%201%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Flying Circus</a>". On 21 March he shot down two of the formation's <a href="Albatros%20D.V">Albatros D.V</a>s, which were confirmed as his first official victories.
Having proved himself a talented and aggressive pilot, Cobby's leadership abilities were recognised with his appointment as a flight commander on 14 May 1918, and promotion to <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a> on 25 May. Described as "an imp of mischief", he personalised his Sopwith Camel by fitting it with aluminium cutouts of comic actor <a href="Charlie%20Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>. Cobby again scored two kills in one day on 30 May near <a href="Estaires">Estaires</a>, when he destroyed an Albatros and an <a href="observation%20balloon">observation balloon</a>, and repeated this feat the next day in the same area. He had been responsible for downing No. 4 Squadron's first balloon at <a href="Merville%2C%20Nord">Merville</a> earlier in May; although vulnerable to attack with <a href="Incendiary%20device">incendiary bullets</a>, these large observation platforms, nicknamed "Drachen" (Dragons), were generally well protected by enemy fighters and <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft defences</a>, and were thus considered a dangerous but valuable target. Cobby was recommended for the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> on 3 June 1918 in recognition of his combat success and for being a "bold and skilful Patrol Leader, who is setting a fine example to his Squadron". The award was changed to a <a href="Distinguished%20Flying%20Cross%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Distinguished Flying Cross</a> (DFC), appearing in the "<a href="London%20Gazette">London Gazette</a>" on 2 July.
Cobby shot down three German aircraft on 28 June and was recommended for a <a href="Medal%20bar">bar</a> to his DFC, highlighting his then-current tally of 15 victories. On 15 July 1918, he and another pilot dived on five <a href="Pfalz%20Flugzeugwerke">Pfalz</a> scouts near <a href="Armenti%C3%A8res">Armentières</a>, Cobby accounting for two of the enemy aircraft and his companion for one. The Australians were then pursued by four <a href="Fokker%20Dr.I">Fokker Triplanes</a> but managed to evade their attackers. This action earned Cobby a recommendation for a second bar to his DFC, the citation noting that he had scored 21 kills to date and had "succeeded in destroying so many machines by hard work and by using his brains, as well as by courage and brilliant flying". The two bars to his DFC were <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on the same day, 21 September. On 16 August, Cobby led a bombing raid against the German airfield at <a href="Haubourdin">Haubourdin</a>, near <a href="Lille">Lille</a>, the largest aerial assault by Allied forces up until then, resulting in 37 enemy aircraft being destroyed. The following day he led a similar attack on <a href="Lomme">Lomme</a> airfield and was recommended for the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> as a result. Gazetted on 2 November, the citation for the award declared that "The success of these two raids was largely due to the determined and skilful leadership of this officer".

By the end of his active service, Cobby was in charge of Allied formations numbering up to 80 aircraft. Fellow No. 4 Squadron ace, <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a> (later <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>), described him as the unit's "natural leader in the air and in all off-duty activities"; his exploits made him a national hero. No. 4 Squadron was recognised as the most successful fighter squadron in France, accounting for as many as 220 victories. In September 1918, Cobby was transferred to a training unit in England, where he found the strain of instructing pupils "much worse than flying in France". He continued applying for a return to the front until the war ended in November, and was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> by Field Marshal <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Sir Douglas Haig</a> the same month (gazetted 27 December). Though Cobby's final tally for the war is often given as 29 aircraft and 13 observation balloons destroyed, claim-by-claim analyses of his victories credit him with 24 aircraft and five balloons, for a grand total of 29, making him the highest-scoring member of the AFC, as well as the service's only <a href="Balloon%20buster">"balloon-busting" ace</a>. His proudest boast, however, was that as a flight commander he never lost a pilot over enemy territory.

Still instructing in England following the end of the war, Cobby was chosen to lead the AFC's <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> flypast over London before the <a href="Edward%20VIII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prince of Wales</a> on 25 April 1919, in concert with a parade by Australian soldiers. By 2:30 in the afternoon, he was taking his 50-strong aerial formation through a series of wild stunts over the alarmed Prince's head, and later told the story that he flew so close to the marching soldiers that their bayonets almost pierced his undercarriage. Cobby later said that this was: "probably the most foolish thing I have ever done". He returned to Australia in May 1919, and married Hilda Maude Urban in <a href="Caulfield%2C%20Victoria">Caulfield</a>, Victoria, on 24 April 1920; the couple had a son and a daughter. Following the disbandment of the AFC, Cobby joined the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> in 1921. Ranked <a href="flying%20officer">flying officer</a> (honorary <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>), he was one of the original 21 officers on the air force's strength at its formation that March. His first posting, along with most of his colleagues, was to a mixed squadron equipped primarily with <a href="Royal%20Aircraft%20Factory%20S.E.5">S.E.5s</a> and <a href="Airco%20DH.9">DH.9s</a> at <a href="No.%201%20Flying%20Training%20School%20RAAF">No. 1 Flying Training School</a>, based at <a href="RAAF%20Williams%23RAAF%20Williams%20Point%20Cook%20Base">RAAF Point Cook</a>. Flight Lieutenant Cobby became <a href="Commanding%20Officer">Commanding Officer</a> (CO) of <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a> when it was reformed at Point Cook on 1 July 1925, serving in the position until August 1926.

By 1927, Cobby had been promoted to <a href="squadron%20leader">squadron leader</a>, and the following year went to England to attend <a href="RAF%20Staff%20College%2C%20Andover">RAF Staff College, Andover</a>. Returning to Australia, he took over as CO of <a href="No.%203%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 3 Squadron</a> at <a href="RAAF%20Base%20Richmond">RAAF Station Richmond</a>, New South Wales, from Squadron Leader <a href="Frank%20Lukis">Frank Lukis</a> on 13 January 1930. At this time, the position of No. 3 Squadron commander doubled as CO of the base. Though popular with his staff, Cobby was not known for his attention to detail. In December 1930, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Commodore <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Richard Williams</a>, arrived for an inspection and found the base to be in such a state of untidiness that he ordered every man on parade and gave them what was described as "an almighty dressing down", threatening that Christmas leave would be cancelled unless the place was cleaned up. Having handed over to Squadron Leader <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a> on 22 November 1931, Cobby was promoted to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">wing commander</a> on 1 May 1933 and subsequently served as RAAF Director of Intelligence. In this position he headed an interdepartmental committee that was formed in August 1933 to examine the possibilities of air survey and aerial photography to further national development. The committee's findings, presented in April 1934, favoured employing government agencies for such work and ultimately led to the formation of the North Australian Survey Flight from staff and aircraft of No. 1 Squadron in April 1935. The resulting surveys of <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> and the <a href="Northern%20Territory">Northern Territory</a> provided valuable input for the establishment of military airfields and other installations following the outbreak of World War II. Restless in the inter-war years, Cobby retired from the Air Force to join the Civil Aviation Board as Controller of Operations in 1936; he also contributed to aviation magazines such as "Australian Airmen" and "Popular Flying". His civil aviation duties included aircraft inspection, the issuing of licences and airworthiness certificates, maintenance of radio and meteorological services, and RAAF liaison.

Cobby was a member of the Citizen Air Force (RAAF reserve) during his time with the Civil Aviation Board, and rejoined the Permanent Air Force following the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Promoted to <a href="group%20captain">group captain</a>, he officially returned to active service on 25 July 1940 as Director of Recruiting, a role that traded on his public image. On 25 August 1942, he took over from Air Commodore Frank Lukis as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> (AOC) <a href="North-Eastern%20Area%20Command%20%28RAAF%29">North-Eastern Area</a> in <a href="Townsville%2C%20Queensland">Townsville</a>, Queensland. 1942 also saw the publication of "High Adventure", Cobby's account of his experiences in World War I; the foreword was written by Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, newly appointed Chief of the Air Staff and fellow No. 4 Squadron veteran. Cobby was promoted to temporary <a href="air%20commodore">air commodore</a> in July 1943. On 7 September, he was travelling as a passenger on a <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">Catalina flying boat</a> when it crashed at Townsville. Although himself injured, Cobby helped rescue two other survivors, and was recommended for the <a href="George%20Medal">George Medal</a> for his "outstanding bravery".
The award was gazetted on 10 March 1944. Cobby handed over command of North-Eastern Area in November 1943, and the following month was posted to <a href="Mount%20Martha%2C%20Victoria">Mount Martha</a>, Victoria, as the Commandant of the RAAF Staff School (later RAAF Staff College), remaining in the post until he was fully recovered from his injuries. On 16 June 1944, he was appointed a <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) for his conduct of air operations over New Guinea as AOC North-Eastern Area, the citation noting his "good leadership, personal example, keen understanding and continued encouragement".
In August 1944, Cobby became AOC of No. 10 Operational Group (No. 10 OG), soon to be renamed the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a> (1st TAF). In this role he commanded 20,000 personnel in the RAAF's major mobile strike force in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific</a>, consisting of <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a>, <a href="close%20air%20support">close support</a>, and airfield construction units. Cobby expressed misgivings concerning the command arrangements that saw RAAF Headquarters in Melbourne responsible for No. 10 OG's administration, while its operational tasking was to be passed down through <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, the United States <a href="Thirteenth%20Air%20Force">Thirteenth Air Force</a> and Headquarters South West Pacific Area. He believed this required him to "try and serve two masters", a situation he found "unworkable". In the period 22–25 December 1944, 1st TAF flew 513 <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">Kittyhawk</a> and <a href="Beaufighter">Beaufighter</a> sorties against targets in <a href="Halmahera">Halmahera</a>. The following month, it undertook a further 661 sorties against targets in Halmahera, <a href="Sulawesi">Celebes</a>, Morotai and the <a href="Bird%27s%20Head%20Peninsula">Vogelkop</a>. By early 1945, Japanese air power in the South West Pacific had been virtually destroyed, and 1st TAF was increasingly assigned to garrison duties and harassing enemy bases on islands bypassed by US forces in their <a href="Philippines%20Campaign%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29">advance on the Philippines</a>. During March and April, 1st TAF prepared for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tarakan%20%281945%29">invasion of Tarakan</a>, an operation based around a mistaken judgement made by officers at Cobby's headquarters that the island's airstrip could be rapidly repaired and used to support the <a href="Borneo%20Campaign%20%281945%29">Borneo Campaign</a>.
The relegation of fighter units to what appeared to be strategically unimportant ground attack missions led to a crisis in morale that precipitated the so-called "<a href="Morotai%20Mutiny">Morotai Mutiny</a>" in April 1945, when eight of Cobby's senior pilots, including Australia's leading ace in the war, Group Captain <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a>, tendered their resignations in protest. Although one of the "mutineers", Group Captain <a href="Wilfred%20Arthur">Wilf Arthur</a>, had earlier voiced his concerns to Cobby and his headquarters staff regarding the efficacy of 1st TAF's tasking, the AOC was taken aback by the resignations. He spoke to the officers individually and as a group, asking them, "Is this something against me, or having a go against me in this, because if so, if you feel that I have fallen down in my job, I will straight away ask to be recalled," to which they replied, "It has nothing to do with you." Cobby reported the incident to his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal Bill Bostock, who informed the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Vice Marshal Jones, and the Allied Air Forces Commander, Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>. All made their way to Morotai and interviewed the pilots involved, and all concluded that Cobby should be relieved of his command.

Bostock held Cobby responsible for the "dangerously low level" of morale in 1st TAF, but also noted "it is clear that he has been badly served by his senior staff". In the event, Jones transferred not only Cobby but also his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms, and Air Commodore <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a> took over command on 10 May. Cobby's departure was greeted with relief by <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> commanders, who were frustrated by the poor working relationship between 1st TAF and the Army units at Tarakan. Cobby defended his leadership of 1st TAF at the subsequent inquiry before Judge <a href="John%20Vincent%20Barry">John Vincent Barry</a>. During his testimony he declared that while his officers "wished to do more in the war than they were doing ... it was not within the power of 1st T.A.F. to give them that more important or more interesting work". He believed that his forces had played a significant part in making safe General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">MacArthur</a>'s flank during the Philippines Campaign. Barry nevertheless found that Cobby had "failed to maintain proper control over his command", and that his removal as 1st TAF commander was justified. Air Force historian Alan Stephens later described it as "a personal and institutional tragedy that a genuinely great figure in RAAF history had to end his career in such circumstances". Similarly, "The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History" contends that Cobby's "gallant service flying career ... became another victim of the weaknesses and feuding within the RAAF's senior leadership during the Pacific War". Stephens summed up Cobby's military career by saying "No Australian airman's experience better illustrates the tensions between 'command', 'leadership' and 'heroism'", concluding that "the qualities that make a hero do not easily translate into those needed by a commander, although they are likely to engender leadership".

Cobby was officially discharged from the Air Force on 19 August 1946. He was awarded the American <a href="Medal%20of%20Freedom%20%281945%29">Medal of Freedom</a> on 15 April 1948, in recognition of his war service. The citation noted that from September 1944 to January 1945, he displayed "exceptionally sound judgement and far sighted planning ... and materially assisted in support of the operations in the Philippine Liberation Campaign". Cobby had rejoined the Civil Aviation Board (by then the <a href="Airservices%20Australia">Department of Civil Aviation</a>) after leaving the RAAF and served as Regional Director, New South Wales, from 1947 to 1954. He was appointed Director of Flying Operations early the following year.

On <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>, 11 November 1955, Cobby collapsed in his Melbourne office and died later that day of hypertensive <a href="cerebrovascular%20disease">cerebrovascular disease</a> at <a href="Austin%20Hospital%2C%20Melbourne">Heidelberg Repatriation General Hospital</a>. His wife and children survived him. On 15 November, he was given a military funeral at St Mary's Church of England, <a href="Caulfield%2C%20Victoria">Caulfield</a>, and <a href="cremation">cremated</a> at <a href="Springvale%2C%20Victoria">Springvale</a> Crematorium.

Harry Cobby's tally of victories in World War I was the highest by a member of the Australian Flying Corps (the top-scoring Australian aces of the war, <a href="Robert%20A.%20Little">Robert A. Little</a> and <a href="Roderic%20Dallas">Roderic (Stan) Dallas</a>, flew with the British <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Air%20Service">Royal Naval Air Service</a> and <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>). His record as an ace wearing the Australian uniform has remained unbeaten. <a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a> Sir Richard Williams, Director General of Civil Aviation from 1946 to 1955 and widely regarded as the "Father of the RAAF", described Cobby as "a man whose personal story is threaded through the entire history of Australian service and civil aviation". One of the aluminium cutouts of Charlie Chaplin that Cobby attached to his Sopwith Camel in World War I later went on show at <a href="RAAF%20Museum">RAAF Museum</a>, Point Cook, and the tail skid of one of his victims was displayed at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a>, Canberra. Cobby Street, in the Canberra suburb of <a href="Campbell%2C%20Australian%20Capital%20Territory">Campbell</a>, is named in his honour.
