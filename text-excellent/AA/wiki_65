Waterfall Gully, South Australia

Waterfall Gully is an eastern <a href="List%20of%20Adelaide%20suburbs">suburb</a> of the <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>n capital city of <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. It is located in the <a href="Adelaide%20Hills">foothills</a> of the <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> around east-south-east of the <a href="Adelaide%20city%20centre">Adelaide city centre</a>. For the most part, the suburb encompasses one long <a href="gully">gully</a> with First Creek at its centre and Waterfall Gully Road running adjacent to the creek. At the southern end of the gully is First Falls, the <a href="waterfall">waterfall</a> for which the suburb was named. Part of the <a href="City%20of%20Burnside">City of Burnside</a>, Waterfall Gully is bounded to the north by the suburb of <a href="Burnside%2C%20South%20Australia">Burnside</a>, from the north-east to south-east by <a href="Cleland%20Conservation%20Park">Cleland Conservation Park</a> (part of the suburb of <a href="Cleland%2C%20South%20Australia">Cleland</a>), to the south by <a href="Crafers%20West%2C%20South%20Australia">Crafers West</a>, and to the west by <a href="Leawood%20Gardens%2C%20South%20Australia">Leawood Gardens</a> and <a href="Mount%20Osmond%2C%20South%20Australia">Mount Osmond</a>.

Historically, Waterfall Gully was first explored by European settlers in the early-to-mid-19th century, and quickly became a popular location for tourists and picnickers. The government chose to retain control over portions of Waterfall Gully until 1884, when they agreed to place the land under the auspices of the City of Burnside. 28 years later the government took back the management of the southern part of Waterfall Gully, designating it as South Australia's first National Pleasure Resort. Today this area remains under <a href="Government%20of%20South%20Australia">State Government</a> control, and in 1972 the Waterfall Gully Reserve, as it was then known, became part of the larger Cleland Conservation Park.

Over the years Waterfall Gully has been extensively logged, and early agricultural interests saw the cultivation of a variety of introduced species as crops, along with the development of local <a href="Market%20gardening">market garden</a>s and <a href="Nursery%20%28horticulture%29">nurseries</a>. Attempts to <a href="Mining">mine</a> the area were largely unsuccessful, but the region housed one of the state's earliest <a href="Watermill">water-powered mill</a>s, and a <a href="weir">weir</a> erected in the early 1880s provided for part of the City of Burnside's water supply. Today the suburb consists primarily of private residences and parks.

The <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a>, which encompass Waterfall Gully, was first sighted by <a href="Matthew%20Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a> in 1802. The gully itself was discovered soon after the <a href="History%20of%20Adelaide%23European%20settlement">establishment of Adelaide</a>, and <a href="William%20Light">Colonel William Light</a>, the first <a href="Surveyor%20General%20of%20South%20Australia">Surveyor General of South Australia</a>, was said to have "decided on the site for Adelaide when viewing the plains from the hills near Waterfall Gully". Nevertheless, the gully had seen human visitors long before the arrival of the Europeans, as the native population had lived in the area for up to 40,000 years prior to Flinders' appearance off the South Australian coast.

In Australian <a href="Dreamtime%20%28mythology%29">Aboriginal mythology</a>, Waterfall Gully and the surrounding Mount Lofty Ranges are part of the story of the ancestor-creator "Nganno". Travelling across the land of the native <a href="Kaurna%20people">Kaurna</a> people, Nganno was wounded in a battle and laid down to die, forming the Mount Lofty Ranges. The ears of Nganno formed the peaks of <a href="Mount%20Lofty">Mount Lofty</a> and <a href="Mount%20Bonython">Mount Bonython</a>, and the region was referred to as "Yur-e-billa", or "the place of the ears". The name of the Greater Mount Lofty Parklands, Yurrebilla, was derived from this term, while the nearby town of <a href="Uraidla%2C%20South%20Australia">Uraidla</a> employs a more corrupted form.

Although Hardy states that the Kaurna people did not live in the ranges themselves, they did live on the lower slopes. An early settler of the neighbouring suburb of <a href="Beaumont%2C%20South%20Australia">Beaumont</a>, James Milne Young, described the local Kaurnas: "At every creek and gully you would see their <a href="Humpy">wurlies</a> [simple Aboriginal homes made out of twigs and grass] and their fires at night ... often as many as 500 to 600 would be camped in various places ... some behind the Botanic Gardens on the banks of the river; some toward the Ranges; some on the Waterfall Gully." Their main presence, demarcated by the use of fire against purchasers of land, was on the <a href="River%20Torrens">River Torrens</a> and the creeks that flowed into it, including Waterfall Gully's First Creek.

The land around Waterfall Gully provided the original inhabitants with a number of resources. The bark from the local <a href="stringybark">stringybark</a> trees ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20obliqua">Eucalyptus obliqua</a>") was used in the construction of winter huts, and stones and native timbers were used to form tools. Food was also present, and <a href="Witchetty%20grub">cossid moth larvae</a> along with other species of plants and animals were collected. Nevertheless, there were only a few resources that could only be found on the slopes, and "both hunting and food gathering would in general have been easier on the rich plains".

One of the earliest accounts of Waterfall Gully comes from a "Mr Kent" who, along with <a href="Collet%20Barker">Captain Collet Barker</a> and Barker's servant, Miles, climbed Mount Lofty in 1831. In making their ascent the party skirted a ravine—described by Mr Kent as possessing "smooth and grassy sides"—which is believed by Anne Hardy to have been Waterfall Gully. Subsequent to Barker's ascent, the first settlers who were recorded as having climbed Mount Lofty were <a href="Young%20Bingham%20Hutchinson">Bingham Hutchinson</a> and his servant, William Burt. The pair made three attempts to scale the mount before succeeding, and for their first attempt they attempted to traverse Waterfall Gully. The attempt was unsuccessful, but in July 1837, Hutchinson wrote about the gully through which they had travelled. Waterfall Gully he wrote, had proven difficult, as the plants were so thickly grown as to provide a significant barrier to their progress. Near the point of surrender, Hutchinson described how they were "agreeably surprised by seeing a wall of rock about fifty or sixty feet [fifteen to eighteen metres] high, which stretched across the ravine, and from the top of it leapt the brook which had so long been [their] companion". The brook was First Creek, and the waterfall they sighted is today known as First Falls.

Nevertheless, Hutchinson was not the first to see First Falls. The first known recorded sighting of the waterfall by a colonial was that of John William Adams, an emigrant of in early January 1837, who named it "Adams' Waterfall". He was traveling with his wife, Susanna and a party consisting of Nicholson's and Breaker's who had the use of a <a href="Wagon">dray</a> to go into the hills. Adams states "we were opposite the spot where the Eagle on the Hill now is, and the question was put, who would volunteer to go down the hillside to try for water".

The area soon became a tourist attraction for the early South Australian colonists, and was a popular destination for picnickers. In 1851 Francis Clark wrote that "Waterfall Gully is the most picturesque place for a picnic that I have ever visited", and by the 1860s the area had become known throughout Adelaide. The use of Waterfall Gully as picnic spot was facilitated by the decision of the government of the day not to subdivide the area containing the waterfalls. Section 920, as it was designated, did not enter into private hands, and thus members of the public were able to access the area from the nearby suburb of <a href="Eagle%20on%20the%20Hill%2C%20South%20Australia">Eagle on the Hill</a> on Mount Barker road. The position of the Eagle on the Hill hotel proved advantageous for this, as it permitted visitors to stop by for lunch before walking down the hill in the afternoon.
Other parts of the Waterfall Gully area were subdivided, though, and much of the area was owned by <a href="Samuel%20Davenport">Samuel Davenport</a>. Davenport used the land for timber, grazing, and the cultivation of various crops, including olives and grapes for <a href="Winemaking">wine production</a>. Other local residents ran market gardens and <a href="Nursery%20%28horticulture%29">nurseries</a>. For example, local residents Wilhelm Mügge and his wife Auguste Schmidt operated "one of the best nurseries and market gardens near Adelaide", and gained a reputation for the cheeses produced from their local dairy farm. Along with farming, the hills and creek were prized areas for the <a href="Lumberjack">sawyer</a>s and splitters, and a number of mines were established in the region from the mid-to-late 19th century. In 1844 the first <a href="Silver%20mining">silver-lead</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a> and <a href="iron">iron</a> mines were established in the area, while the 1890s saw a minor gold rush—although "only small quantities were extracted". Of greater success was stone quarrying in Chambers' Gully, which began in 1863 and increased in scale in 1912.

Waterfall Gully was also the site of Burnside's "first secondary industry". In the late 1830s, Thomas Cain built a <a href="watermill">watermill</a> on First Creek for John Cannan, which was then employed to power a sawmill on Cannan's property. Cannan operated the mill as the "Traversbrook Mill" for approximately two years before selling the venture to a Mr. Finniss. Finniss opted to run the mill as a flour mill instead, and the mill was rebuilt and renamed "Finnissbrook Mill". The mill continued to operate under a variety of owners until the late 1850s, but it was dismantled during the 1880s, and today only traces of the earthworks remain.
During this period the population of the nearby village of <a href="Burnside%2C%20South%20Australia">Burnside</a> was expanding and required a new water supply. First Creek—which runs down Waterfall Gully and enters the River Torrens near today's <a href="Adelaide%20Botanic%20Gardens">Botanic Gardens</a>—was seen as the perfect solution to the water shortage. A <a href="weir">weir</a> was built during 1881 and 1882, and was made to hold approximately two megalitres (530,000 US gallons) of water. A pipeline was constructed to the reservoir at Burnside South, and from there the water was used throughout the surrounding area. As a side effect, the weir also reduced the volume of water available to the local market gardeners, and over many years that aspect of the region disappeared.

While the route to the falls from Eagle on the Hill was on public land, the alternative route along the gully was through private properties. Nevertheless, many visitors chose this route, and a combination of public demand and a desire from some of the landowners for improved access to and from their properties—especially from the Mügge family—led to pressure to build a road through the gully. Although there was opposition from some of the locals, the Waterfall Gully road was built in the late 1880s.

The completion of the road led to an increase in visitor numbers. Rather than a bumpy horse ride, visitors could now catch the <a href="Horsecar">horse tram</a> to the start of the gully, and walk, cycle or ride to the falls. To provide for tourists, the area gained a number of road-side kiosks and produce stalls, and the Mügge family erected the two story Waterfall Hotel along the path. Furthermore, in 1912 the government opened a kiosk at the base of First Falls, designed in the "style of a Swiss chalet". The hotel is a private residence today, but the kiosk continues to operate.

Although some parts of Waterfall Gully were transferred from the District Council of East Torrens (now the <a href="Adelaide%20Hills%20Council">Adelaide Hills Council</a>) to the City of Burnside in 1856 when the suburb's current boundaries were established, the government of the day chose to retain control of a significant portion of Waterfall Gully. Thus it was not until 1884 that the remaining land was transferred to the control of the Burnside Council, eventuating largely through the efforts of Samuel Davenport and G. F. Cleland.

The land remained under the Burnside Council's control until 1915, when the Waterfall Gully Reserve was reclaimed by the government as the first National Pleasure Resort in the state. Initially the reserve was placed under the jurisdiction of the National Parks Advisory Board, but later it was moved to the Tourist Bureau, before finally becoming part of the National Park Commission's portfolio.

In 1945, much of the area that is today's <a href="Cleland%20Conservation%20Park">Cleland Conservation Park</a> was purchased by the <a href="Government%20of%20South%20Australia">State Government</a>, largely thanks to the efforts of <a href="John%20Burton%20Cleland">Professor Sir John Cleland</a>. Most of this land was combined in 1963 to create the park that extends eastwards up the gully to the summit of <a href="Mount%20Lofty">Mount Lofty</a> and northwards to Greenhill Road. Waterfall Gully Reserve was added to the park in 1972.

Over the years since European settlement Waterfall Gully has suffered from both bushfires and flooding. The gully was severely hit by a number of <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>s in 1939 that threatened the area, and further bushfires in the early 1940s caused considerable damage because of the <a href="World%20War%20II">war effort</a> diverting supplies and personnel from the <a href="Country%20Fire%20Service">Emergency Fire Service</a>. Significant floods occurred in 1889 and 1931, and, on the night of 7 November 2005, Waterfall Gully was one of several areas in Adelaide to experience severe flooding. Waterfall Gully was one of the hardest hit suburbs: Bob Stevenson, Duty Officer of the <a href="State%20Emergency%20Service">State Emergency Service</a> (SES), commented that "There's an area called Waterfall Gully Road, in the foothills, where one of the creeks comes down, and there's quite a few houses affected there ... there was 40 or so houses affected on that one road alone." Properties were flooded, two bridges nearly collapsed, and of road was washed away. Burnside council workers, the <a href="Country%20Fire%20Service">Country Fire Service</a> (CFS) and the SES repaired the initial damage on the night while reconstruction of infrastructure commenced in late November. Much of the road had been inaccessible, and the suburb was closed except to residents and emergency workers for the remainder of the month.

Waterfall Gully is situated at an average elevation of above sea level, in an area of . Its most notable geographical features are its gully and waterfall. <a href="Langman%20Reserve">Langman Reserve</a>, a large local park, is from the start of Waterfall Gully Road while much of the north-eastern side of the gully is part of Cleland Conservation Park. Adjoining Waterfall Gully, away, is <a href="Chambers%20Gully">Chambers Gully</a>, which used to function as a <a href="landfill">land-fill</a>, but has in the past decade been reclaimed as a park through volunteer work. It contains a number of old ruins, walking trails, and springs and is home to a significant number of native species.

Since European Settlement the native plant life has been considerably affected, with the native <a href="manna%20gum">manna gum</a> and <a href="Eucalyptus%20leucoxylon">blue gum</a> woodlands being largely cleared for agricultural uses. The large amount of non-native vegetation in the gully is predominantly the result of the early agriculture, although some species were introduced by accident. Introduced species include olive trees, <a href="common%20hawthorn">hawthorn</a>, <a href="fennel">fennel</a> and blackberry. With the reduction of native flora, exotic fauna have flourished around the Waterfall Gully region. These include rabbits, <a href="common%20blackbird">blackbird</a>s and <a href="starling">starling</a>s. However, not all of the native wildlife has been lost—bats (in particular, <a href="Gould%27s%20wattled%20bat">Gould's wattled bat</a>), can be found in the area, as can <a href="superb%20fairy-wren">superb fairy-wren</a>s and <a href="Adelaide%20rosella">Adelaide rosella</a>s, and a large number of unique <a href="Fauna%20of%20Australia">Australian animals</a> such as kangaroos, koalas and <a href="Common%20brushtail%20possum">possums</a> can be spotted on some of the walking trails.

Waterfall Gully is connected to the major Adelaide thoroughfare <a href="Greenhill%20Road">Greenhill Road</a> by Waterfall Terrace and Glynburn Road, and cars are the preferred mode of transport in the suburb. According to the <a href="Australian%20Bureau%20of%20Statistics">Australian Bureau of Statistics</a> 71.9% of residents in the census area employed private vehicles for their commute to work. Only a small proportion (1.3%) walked to work and but 1.2% cycled, while only 3.6% of Waterfall Gully residents travel to work by bus. The closest bus route for Waterfall Gully is the 142 bus, provided by the multi-service <a href="Adelaide%20Metro">Adelaide Metro</a>.

Waterfall Gully Road is meandering and in some parts quite narrow. This has led to concerns regarding safety, as the road is frequented by both pedestrians and cyclists. After the death of a cyclist in 2007, calls for the repair and resurfacing of the road intensified, with two petitions being tabled in parliament. The accident also led to a safety audit being conducted by TransportSA, and although the results were not released to the public at the time, it called for an investigation of the entire length of the road. As of mid-2008, there has been no clear plan released for the future of the road, with the road missing out on funding in the 2008 state budget.

In the , the population of the Waterfall Gully census area (which includes the suburbs of <a href="Glen%20Osmond%2C%20South%20Australia">Glen Osmond</a>, <a href="Leawood%20Gardens%2C%20South%20Australia">Leawood Gardens</a> and <a href="Mount%20Osmond%2C%20South%20Australia">Mount Osmond</a>) was 2,497 people, in an area of 6.08 square kilometers. Females outnumbered males 54.2% to 45.8%, and some 21.4% of the population was born overseas (see chart for a breakdown). There was only a slight change in the 2006 census, with the population increasing by 25 to 2,522.

The eight strongest religious affiliations in the area (based on the 2006 census figures) were (in descending order): <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a>, <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Catholic</a>, <a href="Uniting%20Church%20in%20Australia">Uniting</a>, <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox Christian</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a>, <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a>, <a href="Church%20of%20Christ">Church of Christ</a> and <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> (a combination of other Christian faiths came in somewhere between Presbyterians and the Church of Christ, with 31 adherents). Also of note is the high occurrence of religious affiliation (67.3%) in the region in comparison to the Adelaide (and national) average. Christian belief (64.4%) is most prominent, with little growth in other religions.

Residents in these four suburbs are more affluent than the Adelaide average, with a high occurrence of incomes over <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>1000 per week, which is also above the average for the City of Burnside. A majority of workers are employed in professional or white collar fields.

The census area that incorporates Waterfall Gully has a larger proportion of those in both the younger (0–17) and older (60+) age ranges than in the City of Burnside as a whole, and there have been no "numerically significant" changes in the age distribution between the 2001 and 2006 censuses. Similarly, family numbers are also stable, with almost no change between 2001 and 2006.

The <a href="2016%20Australian%20census">2016 Australian census</a> which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Waterfall Gully had a population of 145 people.

The main attraction of Waterfall Gully is the waterfall, First Falls. It is at the south-eastern end of the road, in land owned by Cleland Conservation Park. The weir at the bottom of the Waterfall was constructed in the late 19th century and was part of Adelaide's early water supply. Development in the area has continued since the construction of a restaurant in 1912. Developments over recent decades have included improving access to the site, upgrading the bridges, and the addition of new signage.

The <a href="Waterfall%20Gully%20Restaurant">Waterfall Gully Restaurant</a> was constructed between 1911 and 1912 by South Australian architects Albert Selmar Conrad and his brother Frank, and was formally opened by <a href="Day%20Bosanquet">Sir Day Bosanquet</a> on 9 November 1912. Built in the style of a Swiss chalet, the building has been heritage listed since 1987, and is reputedly haunted by the ghost of a firefighter who died from burns suffered in 1926.

Other fire tracks and walking trails wind around the hills that surround Waterfall Gully, branching off from Chambers Gully, Woolshed Gully or the area around First Creek. Destinations include <a href="Crafers%2C%20South%20Australia">Crafers</a>, <a href="Eagle%20On%20The%20Hill%2C%20South%20Australia">Eagle On The Hill</a>, Mount Lofty, Mount Osmond and the <a href="Cleland%20Wildlife%20Park">Cleland Wildlife Park</a>, located in the Cleland Conservation Park. The tracks have been rebuilt and resurfaced in the past ten years, and older and more perilous routes sealed because of the difficult terrain. Many offer views of the city of Adelaide as well as the Gully itself. One of these connects to the <a href="Heysen%20Trail">Heysen Trail</a>.

Waterfall Gully is part of the state <a href="Electoral%20district%20of%20Bragg%20%28South%20Australia%29">electoral district of Bragg</a>, which has been held since 2002 by Liberal MP <a href="Vickie%20Chapman">Vickie Chapman</a>. In federal politics, the suburb is part of the <a href="division%20of%20Sturt">division of Sturt</a>, and has been represented by <a href="Christopher%20Pyne">Christopher Pyne</a> since 1993. The results shown are from the closest polling station to Waterfall Gully—which is located outside of the suburb—at St David's Church Hall on nearby Glynburn Road (<a href="Burnside%2C%20South%20Australia">Burnside</a>). Both electorates have traditionally gone to the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party</a>, and Bragg in particular is regarded as a very safe Liberal seat. However, in the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%202007">2007 federal election</a>, a strong swing towards the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor Party</a> and their candidate, <a href="Mia%20Handshin">Mia Handshin</a>, resulted in the electorate transforming from a "safe [federal] Liberal seat into a marginal one".

In <a href="local%20government">local government</a>, Waterfall Gully is part of the <a href="Ward%20%28country%20subdivision%29">ward</a> of Beaumont within the City of Burnside, and the current Mayor for the district is David Parkin. Beaumont is currently represented by councilors Mark Osterstock and Anne Monceaux.

Telopea speciosissima

Telopea speciosissima, commonly known as the New South Wales waratah or simply waratah, is a large shrub in the plant family <a href="Proteaceae">Proteaceae</a>. It is <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> and is the <a href="floral%20emblem">floral emblem</a> of that state. No <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised, but the closely related "<a href="Telopea%20aspera">Telopea aspera</a>" was only recently classified as a separate species.

"T. speciosissima" is a shrub to high and wide, with dark green leaves. Its several stems arise from a pronounced woody base known as a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>. The species is well renowned for its striking large red springtime <a href="inflorescence">inflorescences (flowerheads)</a>, each including hundreds of individual <a href="flower">flower</a>s. These are visited by the <a href="eastern%20pygmy%20possum">eastern pygmy possum ("Cercartetus nanus")</a>, birds such as <a href="honeyeater">honeyeaters (Meliphagidae)</a>, and various insects.

The floral emblem for its home state of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, "Telopea speciosissima" has featured prominently in art, architecture, and advertising, particularly since <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Australian federation</a>. Commercially grown in several countries as a cut flower, it is also cultivated in home gardens, requiring good drainage yet adequate moisture, but is vulnerable to various <a href="fungus">fungal disease</a>s and pests. A number of <a href="cultivar">cultivar</a>s with various shades of red, pink and even white flowers are available. <a href="Horticulture">Horticulturists</a> have also developed <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> with "<a href="Telopea%20oreades">T. oreades</a>" and "<a href="Telopea%20mongaensis">T. mongaensis</a>" which are more tolerant of cold, shade, and heavier soils.

"Telopea speciosissima", the New South Wales waratah, is a large, erect shrub up to in height with one or more stems. Arising vertically or near vertically from a large woody base, or <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, the stems are little branched. In late spring, there is a spurt of new growth after flowering, with new shoots often arising from old flowerheads. The dark green leaves are <a href="Phyllotaxis">alternate</a> and usually coarsely-toothed, ranging from in length. Enveloped in leafy <a href="bract">bract</a>s, the flowerheads develop over the winter and begin to swell in early spring, before opening to reveal the striking <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a>s. The exact timing varies across New South Wales, but flowering can begin as early as August in the northern parts of its range, and finish in November in the southern, more elevated areas. Spot flowering may also occur around March in autumn. Containing up to 250 individual flowers, the domed flowerheads are crimson in colour and measure in diameter. They are cupped in a <a href="Phyllotaxis">whorl</a> of leafy bracts which are long and also red. Variations are not uncommon; some flowerheads may be more globular or cone-shaped than dome-shaped, and the bracts may be whitish or dark red. The tips of the <a href="Stigma%20%28botany%29">stigmas</a> of some inflorescences may be whitish, contrasting with the red colour of the rest of the flowerhead.

An individual flowerhead reaches full size about two weeks after first emerging from the bracts, and lasts another two weeks before the flowers fade and fall. In the first phase, the individual small flowers, known as <a href="Internal%20structure%20of%20a%20flower">florets</a>, remain unopened—and the flowerhead retains a compact shape—before they mature and split open, revealing the <a href="stigma%20%28botany%29">stigma</a>, <a href="Gynoecium%23Carpel%20morphology">style</a>, and <a href="Stamen">anther</a>. The anther is <a href="Sessility%20%28botany%29">sessile</a>, lacking a filament, and lies next to the stigma at the end of the style. The outermost florets open first, with <a href="anthesis">anthesis</a> progressing towards the centre of the flowerhead, which becomes darker and more open in appearance, and begins attracting birds and insects. The <a href="Ovary%20%28plants%29">ovary</a> lies at the base of the style and atop a stalk known as the <a href="gynophore">gynophore</a>, and it is from here that the seed pods then develop. Meanwhile, a crescent-shaped <a href="Nectar%23Floral%20nectaries">nectary</a> lies at the base of the gynophore.

The seed pods grow to long. As the pods mature, they range from green, to yellow and finally turn russet red-brown. The pods become leathery before splitting open during early winter. The pods contain winged seeds inside. In the wild, only two or three seed pods develop per flowerhead, but there may be anywhere from 5 to 50 in cultivated plants.

"Telopea speciosissima", the New South Wales Waratah, was first described by botanist <a href="James%20Edward%20Smith">James Edward Smith</a> in his 1793 book "<a href="A%20Specimen%20of%20the%20Botany%20of%20New%20Holland">A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland</a>", from "very fine dried specimens sent by <a href="John%20White%20%28surgeon%29">Mr. White</a>". He gave the species its original binomial name of "Embothrium speciosissimum". The <a href="Specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> is derived from the <a href="superlative">superlative</a> of the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "speciosus" "beautiful" or "handsome", hence "very-" or "most beautiful". "Embothrium" had been a <a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxon</a> at the time, and <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28Scottish%20botanist%20from%20Montrose%29">Robert Brown</a> suggested the genus "<a href="Waratah">Telopea</a>" for it in 1809, which was published in 1810. <a href="Richard%20Anthony%20Salisbury">Richard Salisbury</a> had published the name "Hylogyne speciosa" in 1809, but Brown's name was <a href="conserved%20name">nomenclaturally conserved</a>.

"Telopea speciosissima" is one of five species from southeastern Australia which make up the genus "Telopea". Its closest relative is the very similar Gibraltar Range waratah ("<a href="Telopea%20aspera">T. aspera</a>") from northern New South Wales, which was only recognised as a separate species in 1995, having previously been considered an unusual northern population of "T. speciosissima".

The genus is classified in the subtribe <a href="Grevilleoideae">Embothriinae</a> of the Proteaceae, along with the <a href="Alloxylon">tree waratahs ("Alloxylon")</a> from eastern Australia and New Caledonia, and "<a href="Oreocallis">Oreocallis</a>" and the <a href="Embothrium%20coccineum">Chilean firetree ("Embothrium coccineum")</a> from South America. Almost all these species have red terminal flowers, and hence the subtribe's origin and floral appearance must predate the splitting of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a> into Australia, Antarctica, and South America over 60 million years ago.

Although no subspecies are recognised within "Telopea speciosissima" itself, geographical variations within its range have been noted. Forms toward the northern limits of its range have more prominently lobed leaves. A population from <a href="Waterfall%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Waterfall</a> has darker red, wider inflorescences, and a population at West Head in <a href="Ku-ring-gai%20Chase%20National%20Park">Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park</a> has paler inflorescences. Leaf shape varies widely.

The <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "waratah" was first applied to this species before being generalised to other members of the genus "Telopea" and, to a lesser extent, "Alloxylon". "Waratah" is derived from the <a href="Eora">Eora</a> <a href="Australian%20Aborigines">Aboriginal</a> people, the original inhabitants of the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> area. The <a href="Tharawal%20people">Dharawal</a> people of the Illawarra region knew it as "mooloone", and "mewah" is another aboriginal name. A former common name from around 1900 is "native tulip", possibly derived from "Telopea".

The species is found in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> (Australia) from the <a href="Watagan%20Mountains">Watagan Mountains</a> southward to <a href="Ulladulla">Ulladulla</a>, with a relatively widespread distribution in the <a href="Central%20Coast%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Central Coast</a> region. It usually occurs as an <a href="understory">understory</a> shrub in open forest on sandy soils in areas with moderately high rainfall, receiving on average around a year. Dappled shade from <a href="Eucalyptus">eucalyptus ("Eucalyptus")</a> trees reduces sunlight by around 30%. Much of its range occurs in the <a href="Sydney%20Basin">Sydney Basin</a>, an area with one of the highest human populations and most intense development in Australia. The impact of <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">habitat fragmentation</a> and decreased fire interval (time between <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a>s) on the gene pool of "Telopea speciosissima", which relies on <a href="outcrossing">outcrossing</a>, is unclear. Although largely protected within National Parks and conservation reserves in the Sydney area, most populations are small, numbering under 200 plants, and are often located near urban developments.

"Telopea speciosissima" is a <a href="pyrogenic%20flowering">pyrogenic-flowering</a> species, relying on post-fire flowering followed by production and dispersal of non-dormant seeds to take advantage of favourable growing conditions in the altered environment following a fire. Of the woody <a href="resprouter">resprouter</a> species of southeastern Australia, it is one of the slowest to produce seedlings after bushfires, taking at least two years. The species resprouts from a <a href="lignotuber">lignotuber</a>, a swollen woody base largely under the soil, that stores energy and nutrients as a resource for rapid growth of new shoots after a bushfire. Waratahs dominate the understorey around two years after a fire, but are later overtaken by the slower-growing <a href="Banksia">banksias ("Banksia")</a> and <a href="Acacia">wattles ("Acacia")</a>. Fire also serves to strip away diseases and pests. Flowering may be prolific at this time.
The prominent position and striking colour of "Telopea speciosissima" and many of its relatives within the subtribe <a href="Embothriinae">Embothriinae</a> both in Australia and South America strongly suggest it is adapted to pollination by birds, and has been for over 60 million years. Honeyeaters, in particular the <a href="New%20Holland%20honeyeater">New Holland honeyeater ("Phylidonyris novaehollandiae")</a> and the <a href="Crescent%20honeyeater">crescent honeyeater ("P. pyrrhopterus")</a>, are frequent visitors. However, a field study conducted at Barren Grounds showed New Holland honeyeaters to carry relatively little pollen. The <a href="eastern%20pygmy%20possum">eastern pygmy possum ("Cercartetus nanus")</a> also forages among the flowerheads.

The New South Wales waratah had been considered to be <a href="Dichogamy">protandrous</a> (that is, with male parts concluding sexual activity before female parts become receptive on the same plant), but analysis of the timing of pollen viability and stigma receptivity has shown significant overlaps. The species has been shown to be self-incompatible, requiring <a href="Allogamy">cross-pollination</a> with plants of other <a href="genotype">genotype</a>s to reproduce successfully.

The New South Wales waratah was a popular garden plant at the beginning of the 20th century. It had been introduced early (1789) into the United Kingdom, and was reported flowering for the first time in 1809 at Springwell, the villa of one E. J. A. Woodford Esq. The <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a> awarded it an <a href="Award%20of%20Garden%20Merit">Award of Merit</a> in 1914, and a First Class Certificate in 1922.

Initially, waratahs were picked from the bushland for market, but by the early 20th century, a few <a href="plantsman">plantsmen</a> grew concerned at the development of urban areas at the expense of bush, particularly areas noted for wildflowers. Percy Parry of Floralands in <a href="Kariong%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Kariong</a> developed the idea of "Preservation by Cultivation" and investigated the commercial cultivation of waratahs and other native plants. Meanwhile, the New South Wales Government was looking to curb flower and plant collecting from the wild, and considered prohibition in 1944, but after witnessing the ability of Parry to manage and develop cultivation, introduced compulsory licences for wildflower collecting the following year. With his wife Olive, Percy promoted and developed knowledge over fifty years and received the <a href="Order%20of%20Australia">Order of Australia</a> medal in 1981. Following on from the Parrys were Howard Gay and Arch Dennis, who pioneered growing waratahs at Monbulk in the <a href="Dandenong%20Ranges">Dandenong Ranges</a> in the 1940s, Sid Cadwell and Frank Stone, who did likewise in <a href="Dural%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Dural</a> and the Blue Mountains respectively. The growing movement for cultivating and preserving native plants led to the establishment of the <a href="Australian%20Native%20Plants%20Society%20%28Australia%29">Society for Growing Australian Plants</a> in 1957, and the waratah was featured heavily in the first edition of its journal "Australian Plants".

Today, New South Wales waratahs are grown commercially in Australia north of Sydney and in the <a href="Dandenong%20Ranges">Dandenong Ranges</a> near <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. They are also grown commercially in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, and also in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, where they have been grown since 1961. One major challenge in commercial production is that in any one location the flowering season is generally short (five weeks total, with only small numbers in the earliest and latest weeks). The season for cut flowers may be extended, however, by growing plants at different latitudes. The <a href="vase%20life">vase life</a> of a cut waratah is 10 to 14 days, and cut flower waratahs can be revived somewhat by water.

Although they grow naturally on deep sandy soils, the species has proved adaptable to other deep, well-drained soils, especially where natural slopes assist drainage. Despite their natural occurrence in woodland, waratahs flower best in full sun, although they tolerate the dappled shade of eucalypts. Heavy pruning after flowering reinvigorates the plants and promotes more profuse flowering in the next season. Waratah blooms are highly susceptible to damage from wind, and benefit from some protection from <a href="prevailing%20winds">prevailing winds</a>. Waratah blooms attract birds to the garden. The species is readily <a href="plant%20propagation">propagated</a> from fresh <a href="seed">seed</a>, but cultivars must be reproduced from cuttings to remain true-to-type.

Several species of fungi infect the roots of waratahs, causing significant plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, blackening and dieback or part or all of the plant, or lack of <a href="cluster%20roots">proteoid roots</a>. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne <a href="oomycete">water mold</a> "<a href="Phytophthora%20cinnamomi">Phytophthora cinnamomi</a>", which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Sydney">Royal Botanic Gardens</a> in Sydney and at <a href="Mount%20Annan">Mount Annan</a> planted before the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a> were devastated by the disease. "<a href="Rhizoctonia%20solani">Rhizoctonia solani</a>" can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. "<a href="Cylindrocarpon%20scoparium">Cylindrocarpon scoparium</a>" and "C. destructans" (now "<a href="Nectria%20radicicola">Nectria radicicola</a>") are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi are less likely to be the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.

The larvae of the <a href="Acrocercops%20chionosema">Macadamia leafminer ("Acrocercops chionosema")</a>, a <a href="moth">moth</a>, burrow along and disfigure the waratah's leaves, and are mainly a problem in lowering the value of cut flower crops. More problematic is the larger caterpillar of another moth, the Macadamia twig girdler <a href="Xylorycta%20luteotactella">Macadamia twig girdler ("Xylorycta luteotactella")</a> which can burrow into and disfigure the developing flowerhead.

A number of natural variants of "Telopea speciosissima" have been selected for cultivation as follows:


In addition, a number of interspecific "Telopea" hybrids have also been produced. These have been bred or used as more frost- or shade-tolerant plants in cooler climates such as Canberra, Melbourne or elsewhere.



The New South Wales waratah featured prominently in the folklore of the <a href="Darug%20people">Darug</a> and <a href="Tharawal%20people">Tharawal people</a> in the Sydney basin and <a href="Gandangara%20people">Gandangara people</a> to the southwest. A <a href="dreamtime">dreamtime</a> legend from the Eora tells of a female <a href="wonga%20pigeon">wonga pigeon</a> searching for her husband who has been lost while out hunting. A hawk attacks and wounds her, and she hides in a waratah bush. Her husband calls and as she struggles in the bush her blood turns the white waratah blooms red. A tale from the <a href="Burragorang%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Burragorang Valley</a> tells of a beautiful maiden named Krubi, who wore a red cloak of rock wallaby adorned with the feathers of the <a href="gang-gang%20cockatoo">gang-gang cockatoo</a>. She fell in love with a young warrior who did not return from battle. Grief-stricken, she died, and up from the ground grew the first waratah. The Dharawal people regarded it as a totem, using it in ceremonies and timing ceremonies to its flowering.

The striking form of the New South Wales waratah became a popular <a href="motif%20%28visual%20arts%29">motif</a> in <a href="Visual%20arts%20of%20Australia">Australian art</a> in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and was incorporated in <a href="art%20nouveau">art nouveau</a> designs of the time. Matchboxes, paperweights and especially tins have been decorated with the flower. <a href="Arnott%27s%20Biscuits%20Holdings">Arnott's</a> often used the waratah as an alternative to their parrot logo on biscuit and cake tins from the early 1900s. Shelleys soft drinks, established in 1893 in <a href="Broken%20Hill%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Broken Hill</a>, also displayed it on their label. The French artist <a href="Lucien%20Henry">Lucien Henry</a>, who had settled in Sydney in 1879, was a strong proponent of a definitive Australian art style incorporating local flora, particularly the waratah. His most famous surviving work is a <a href="triptych">triptych</a> <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> window of Oceania flanked by numerous waratahs overlooking the Centennial Hall in <a href="Sydney%20Town%20Hall">Sydney Town Hall</a>.

In 1925, artist <a href="Margaret%20Preston">Margaret Preston</a> produced a hand-coloured <a href="woodcut">woodcut</a> depicting waratahs. The species also appeared on an Australian 3 <a href="Shilling%20%28Australian%29">shilling</a> stamp in 1959 designed by botanical illustrator Margaret Jones and a 30c stamp in 1968.

The <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> suburb of <a href="Telopea%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Telopea</a> takes its name from the Waratah, as does the <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a> suburb of <a href="Waratah">Waratah</a> and the <a href="Super%20Rugby">Super Rugby</a> team, the Sydney-based <a href="NSW%20Waratahs">NSW Waratahs</a>.

After Australian federation in 1901, the upsurge in nationalism led to the search for an official national floral emblem. The New South Wales waratah was considered alongside the wattle "<a href="Acacia%20pycnantha">Acacia pycnantha</a>", and debate raged between proponents of the two flowers. The economist and botanist <a href="Richard%20Thomas%20Baker">R. T. Baker</a> proposed that the waratah's endemism to the Australian continent made it a better choice than the wattle, as well as the prominence of its flowers. He was nicknamed the "Commander in Chief of the Waratah Armed Forces". The South Australian "Evening News" also supported the bid, but to no avail.

Decades later, in 1962, "Telopea speciosissima" was proclaimed as the official floral emblem of New South Wales by the then-governor Sir <a href="Eric%20Woodward">Eric Woodward</a>, after being used informally for many years. The species has also been adopted by others, including the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs">New South Wales Waratahs</a> rugby union team since the 1880s, and the former department store <a href="Grace%20Brothers">Grace Bros</a> in a stylised form for their logo
in the 1980s. Contemporary clothing designers <a href="Jenny%20Kee">Jenny Kee</a> and <a href="Linda%20Jackson%20%28designer%29">Linda Jackson</a> produced waratah-inspired fabric designs in the 1970s and 1980s during a resurgence of Australian motifs.

From 1956 the annual Waratah Festival was held in Sydney, run by the Sydney Committee. It took place from late October to early November, coinciding with the blooming of the waratahs. It was an important cultural event which included a parade, a popular art competition, beauty contests, exhibitions and performances. A highlight was the Lord Mayor's reception at the Sydney Town Hall for which the floral displays were made of hundreds of waratahs culled by Park Rangers from the national parks.

In 2009, the Premier of New South Wales, <a href="Nathan%20Rees">Nathan Rees</a>, commissioned a state logo based on the floral emblem. The resultant logo design has been criticised as resembling a lotus rather than the New South Wales Waratah.

Blackburn Olympic F.C.

Blackburn Olympic Football Club was an English <a href="association%20football">football</a> club based in <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a>, Lancashire in the late 19th century. Although the club was only in existence for just over a decade, it is significant in the history of <a href="football%20in%20England">football in England</a> as the first club from the north of the country and the first from a working-class background to win the country's leading competition, the <a href="FA%20Cup">Football Association Challenge Cup</a> (FA Cup). The cup had previously been won only by teams of wealthy amateurs from the <a href="Home%20counties">Home counties</a>, and Olympic's victory marked a turning point in the sport's transition from a pastime for upper-class gentlemen to a professional sport.

The club was formed in 1878 and initially took part only in minor local competitions. In 1880, the club entered the FA Cup for the first time, and three years later defeated <a href="Old%20Etonians%20F.C.">Old Etonians</a> at <a href="The%20Oval">Kennington Oval</a> to win the trophy. Olympic, however, proved unable to compete with wealthier and better-supported clubs in the new professional era, and folded in 1889.

Most of Olympic's home matches took place at the Hole-i'-th-Wall stadium, named after an adjacent <a href="public%20house">public house</a>. From 1880 onwards, the club's first-choice colours consisted of light blue shirts and white shorts. One Olympic player, <a href="James%20Ward%20%28footballer%29">James Ward</a>, was selected for the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England team</a> and six other former or future England internationals played for the club, including <a href="Jack%20Hunter%20%28footballer%29">Jack Hunter</a>, who was the club's coach at the time of Olympic's FA Cup win.

Association football was first codified in the 1860s in the south of England and played by teams of upper-class former <a href="Public%20school%20%28UK%29">public school</a> pupils and <a href="Oxbridge">Oxbridge</a> graduates. However, the game spread to the industrial towns of the north by the following decade. The town of <a href="Blackburn">Blackburn</a> in Lancashire had more than a dozen active football clubs by 1877, with <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a>, founded in 1875, generally viewed as the leading team. Blackburn Olympic F.C. was founded in February 1878 when two of these clubs, Black Star and James Street, opted to merge. The name was chosen by James Edmondson, the club's first treasurer, and is believed to have been inspired by the recent excavation of <a href="Olympia%2C%20Greece">Olympia</a>, site of the ancient <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a>. The new club's first match was a <a href="Exhibition%20game">friendly</a> played on 9 February 1878 which resulted in a 2–0 win over local team St. John's. In April, the club entered its first competition, the Livesey United Cup. Olympic beat St. Mark's in the final to win the tournament, and, as the competition was not held again, the club retained the trophy in perpetuity. Over the next two seasons the club continued to play friendly matches and also entered the Blackburn Association Challenge Cup, a <a href="Single-elimination%20tournament">knock-out tournament</a> open to all local clubs set up by the organisation which governed football within the town. Olympic won the cup in both 1879 and 1880, after which the competition was discontinued when the Blackburn Association was absorbed into the larger <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Football%20Association">Lancashire County Football Association</a>. As with the Livesey United Cup, the trophy remained in Olympic's possession for the remainder of the club's existence.

In 1880 the club's committee decided that Olympic should compete for greater prizes, and opted to enter two further competitions, the <a href="Lancashire%20Senior%20Cup">Lancashire Senior Cup</a> and the <a href="FA%20Cup">Football Association Challenge Cup</a> (FA Cup), the country's premier football competition. In the club's first FA Cup match, the "Light Blues" were defeated 5–4 by <a href="Sheffield%20F.C.">Sheffield</a>, and the following season the team again lost in the first round, away to <a href="Darwen%20F.C.">Darwen</a>. The club's reputation within its home area was growing, however, and matches were now being arranged with teams from further afield, such as <a href="Sheffield%20Wednesday%20F.C.">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, <a href="Nottingham%20Forest%20F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a>, and even Scottish clubs such as <a href="Cowlairs%20F.C.">Cowlairs</a> and <a href="Hibernian%20F.C.">Hibernian</a>. The club's increasing expenses were met with the help of Sydney Yates, a local iron foundry owner, who invested a large amount of money and continued to bankroll the club for most of its existence. At the end of the <a href="1881%E2%80%9382%20in%20English%20football">1881–82 season</a>, Olympic defeated Blackburn Rovers to win the East Lancashire Charity Cup.

In the <a href="1882%E2%80%9383%20FA%20Cup">1882–83 FA Cup</a>, Olympic defeated four other Lancashire clubs, <a href="Accrington%20F.C.">Accrington</a>, Lower Darwen, Darwen Ramblers, and Church, to reach the fifth round. At this stage the "Light Blues" were drawn to play Welsh team <a href="Druids%20F.C.">Druids</a>. Olympic defeated the <a href="Ruabon">Ruabon</a>-based team 4–1 to progress to the semi-final stage, where for the first time they faced opponents from the south of England — <a href="Old%20Carthusians%20F.C.">Old Carthusians</a>. The Carthusians, the team for former pupils of <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse School</a>, had won the cup <a href="1881%20FA%20Cup%20Final">two years earlier</a> and even the local newspapers in Blackburn considered them strong favourites to reach the final again. Olympic, however, won 4–0 in a match played at a neutral venue in <a href="Whalley%20Range%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Whalley Range</a>, Manchester, to set up a match with another of the great amateur teams, <a href="Old%20Etonians%20F.C.">Old Etonians</a>, in the final at <a href="The%20Oval">Kennington Oval</a>. The Etonians had defeated Olympic's close rivals Blackburn Rovers in the final <a href="1882%20FA%20Cup%20Final">a year earlier</a>, the first time a northern team had reached the final.

Before the final, former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> player <a href="Jack%20Hunter%20%28footballer%29">Jack Hunter</a>, who had joined the club in 1882 in the twin roles of player and coach, arranged to take the team to <a href="Blackpool">Blackpool</a> for several days' special training. Such an undertaking had never before been made by a club, and it was considered an extremely novel idea.

The Etonians took the lead in the final when <a href="Harry%20Goodhart">Harry Goodhart</a> scored during the first half, however Arthur Matthews equalised for Olympic in the second half. Soon afterwards, <a href="Arthur%20Dunn">Arthur Dunn</a> was injured and forced to leave the field, reducing the Etonians to ten men for the rest of the match. The scores remained level at the end of the regulation ninety minutes. Under the regulations of the FA Cup, thirty minutes of <a href="extra%20time">extra time</a> could be played in the event of a draw, at the referee's discretion, and in response to the fervent mood of the crowd the captains asked to play on to try to secure a result. During the extra period, Olympic's superior stamina began to show. Around twenty minutes into extra time, Jimmy Costley received a pass from <a href="John%20Yates%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201861%29">John Yates</a> and kicked the ball past Etonian goalkeeper <a href="John%20Frederick%20Peel%20Rawlinson">John Rawlinson</a> to score the winning goal. Upon the team's return to Blackburn, the players took part in a celebratory parade and received a civic reception at which team captain <a href="Albert%20Warburton">Albert Warburton</a> reportedly proclaimed "The Cup is very welcome to Lancashire. It'll have a good home and it'll never go back to London."

In the south, however, Olympic's victory over one of the great amateur teams provoked consternation. At the time, <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> (the FA), the sport's governing body, prohibited clubs from paying their players. Despite this, working-class clubs, especially those based in Lancashire, had been widely suspected of making illicit payments to players since at least 1876. In the wake of Olympic's high-profile victory, journalists and officials affiliated with southern amateur clubs intensified their calls for the FA to investigate the finances of northern clubs. They focussed in particular on Olympic's training excursion to Blackpool, suggesting that the players would not have been able to take so much time off work unless the club was paying them some form of wage. Questions were also asked about players who had relocated from one town to another seemingly for the sole purpose of playing for a new football team. In Olympic's case Jack Hunter had moved from <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a> to join the club. Ultimately no action was taken against Olympic, although punishments were imposed on other clubs, including <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>, who were expelled from the FA Cup. This in turn prompted the northern clubs to make plans to break away from the FA and form a rival governing body which would not impose the so-called "amateur ideal" on clubs.

The following season, Olympic again reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, as did Blackburn Rovers. When the draw for the semi-finals was made, the club was paired with <a href="Queen%27s%20Park%20F.C.">Queen's Park</a> in one match and Rovers with <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a> in the other, setting up the possibility of the two teams meeting in the final. The Olympic team, however, were outclassed and defeated 4–0 by their Scottish opponents. The club lodged an appeal with the FA based on the encroachment onto the <a href="Association%20football%20pitch">pitch</a> of some of the 16,000 spectators, but to no avail. Rovers went on to defeat Queen's Park in the final.

The club was never again able to achieve this level of success. In the <a href="1884%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1884–85 season</a>, Olympic lost in the second round of the FA Cup to rivals Rovers, who went on to cement their position as the town's leading team by winning the competition for the second consecutive season. The threat of a schism within the sport was averted in 1885 when the FA agreed to legalise professionalism. In a town the size of Blackburn, however, Olympic found it hard to compete for spectators and sponsors with the longer-established and more successful Rovers, and as a result could not pay wages on a par with those offered by that club or by other professional clubs in Lancashire. In 1886 the club's committee was forced to reduce the players' wages to a quarter of what was being offered by <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>. Many of the team's key players walked out in response and were quickly signed by wealthier clubs.

<a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a>, the world's first association football <a href="Sports%20league">league</a>, was formed in 1888 by the leading clubs of the Midlands and North. <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a> chairman <a href="William%20McGregor%20%28football%29">William McGregor</a>, the driving force behind the new competition, put in place a rule stating that only one club from each town or city could join, and chose Rovers, rather than Olympic, to be Blackburn's entrant. Some of the clubs not invited to join the League, including Olympic, formed <a href="The%20Combination">The Combination</a>, but this was a poorly organised competition which attracted only small crowds and collapsed before the end of the <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1888–89 season</a>. Beset by heavy debts, the club's committee announced in early 1889 that all professional players were being released from their contracts with immediate effect and that henceforth the club would employ only amateur players. This desperate measure came too late to save the club, which closed down in September 1889. Blackburn Olympic's last match was a defeat away to <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>.

Olympic's first match took place on a pitch owned by the Blackburn Cricket Club, situated in open countryside at Higher Oozebooth. For the first eighteen months of the club's existence, Olympic played home matches at various sites in Blackburn, including Roe Lee and Cob Wall. In 1879 the club's committee secured the lease on a pitch adjacent to the Hole-i'-th'-Wall <a href="public%20house">public house</a>, at the top of the Shear Brow hill. The site had previously been used by another club, Queen's Own, but had been left vacant when that club folded after most of its players defected to Blackburn Rovers.

The playing surface sloped downwards and was initially known for being exceptionally muddy, but in 1880 the club's committee spent £100 improving the drainage. Facilities were minimal and most spectators simply stood around the perimeter of the pitch, as was the case at most football grounds at the time. A <a href="grandstand">grandstand</a> was erected behind one goal in 1881, but it was severely damaged in a storm in 1884 and was replaced by a more elaborate structure along one of the long sides of the playing area. At the same time several other shelters were erected to give spectators in other areas cover from the elements. The largest crowd registered at Hole-i'-th'-Wall was approximately 10,000 for a match against Preston North End in November 1884, but crowds of between 1,000 and 2,000 spectators were the norm at Olympic matches. After the club's demise the pitch was taken over by the Blackburn Railway Clerks Club. It is now the site of <a href="St.%20Mary%27s%20College%2C%20Blackburn">St. Mary's College</a>.

At the start of the club's existence, the players usually wore magenta shirts, although the rules regarding <a href="Kit%20%28association%20football%29">kits</a> were less rigid at the time, and half-back Tommy Gibson insisted on wearing a supposedly lucky amber and black hooped shirt, a practice later copied by teammate Alf Astley. When the club entered the FA Cup for the first time in 1880, competition regulations meant that all the players in the team had to wear matching colours, and a new combination of light blue shirts and white shorts was chosen. When there was a clash of colours with the opposition and Olympic were the team obliged to change, the players wore dark blue shirts and white shorts. There is no record of the club having a badge or crest, although photographs of the FA Cup-winning team show several players with the crest of the Lancashire FA sewn onto their shirts, indicating that they had represented Lancashire in inter-county matches.

The club's FA Cup winning team of 1883 comprised eleven players born in England, the first time an all-English XI had won the competition. The team lined up as follows:

James Ward was the only player to be selected for the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England team</a> while on the books of the club. He won one <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29">cap</a>, against <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Wales</a> in 1885. Tommy Dewhurst was originally chosen for an international match in 1884, but was deselected after he was involved in a fight with an opposition player during a match between Olympic and <a href="Northwich%20Victoria%20F.C.">Northwich Victoria</a>. Six other Olympic players represented England either before or after their time with the club: <a href="Joe%20Beverley">Joe Beverley</a>, <a href="Edgar%20Chadwick">Edgar Chadwick</a>, Jack Hunter, <a href="Jack%20Southworth">Jack Southworth</a>, <a href="William%20Townley">William Townley</a> and John Yates.

The concept of a football <a href="Head%20coach">manager</a> did not exist in the 19th century, although some modern sources identify Jack Hunter as having been the team's manager. Hunter's main responsibility was for the coaching of the players, although in the club's later years he also took charge of seeking out and signing promising amateur players. The club's benefactor, Sydney Yates, held the post of president and his brother Fred served as chairman of the club's committee. The majority of the administration of the club was handled by the secretary, a post held for most of the club's existence by Bill Bramham.

The club won the following trophies:




The only competition the club entered but never won, other than the unfinished Combination, was the <a href="Lancashire%20Senior%20Cup">Lancashire Senior Cup</a>.

Blackburn Olympic's chief rivalry was with Blackburn Rovers. The first match between the two clubs was a game in February 1879, which resulted in a 3–1 win for Olympic. The clubs played each other forty times, but Olympic won only six of these matches. The rivalry became especially fierce in September 1884, when, amid accusations that the clubs were using underhand tactics in attempts to "poach" each other's star players, the Rovers' secretary sent a telegram to his opposite number stating that his club would play no matches against Olympic in the <a href="1884%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1884–85</a> season. In December, however, the clubs were drawn against each other in the FA Cup, and matches between the rivals resumed later that season. Their final meeting was a benefit match for Olympic in February 1889, which Rovers won 6–1. Rovers agreed to allow the financially embarrassed Olympic to keep all available gate money, instead of sharing it.

J. C. W. Beckham

John Crepps Wickliffe Beckham (August 5, 1869 – January 9, 1940) was the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">35th</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor of Kentucky</a> and a <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senator</a> from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He was the state's first popularly-elected senator after the passage of the <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment</a>.

Descended from a prominent political family, Beckham was chosen as <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="William%20Goebel">William Goebel</a>'s running mate in the <a href="Kentucky%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201899">gubernatorial election of 1899</a> despite the fact that he had turned 30, the minimum age for governor, during the campaign. Goebel lost the election to <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="William%20S.%20Taylor">William S. Taylor</a>, but the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> disputed the election results. During the political wrangling that followed, an unknown assassin shot Goebel. A day later the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give the election to Goebel, who was sworn into office on his deathbed. Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly, and a legal fight occurred between him and Beckham over the governorship. Beckham ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state. Beckham later won a special election to fill the remainder of Goebel's term, since less than half the term had expired, and an election in his own right in 1903.

During his second term as governor, in 1906, Beckham made a bid to become a US senator. His stance in favor of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition</a> cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party, and the General Assembly gave the seat to Republican <a href="William%20O.%20Bradley">William O. Bradley</a>, who had been governor from 1895 to 99. Six years later, Beckham secured the seat by popular election, but he lost his re-election bid in 1920, largely because of his pro-temperance views and his opposition to <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>.

Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades, he never returned to elected office, failing both in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 (with suspected <a href="electoral%20fraud">electoral fraud</a>) and his senatorial campaign in 1936. He died in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> on January 9, 1940.

<a href="Beckham%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Beckham County, Oklahoma</a>, is named for him.

He was born at <a href="Wickland%20%28Bardstown%2C%20Kentucky%29">Wickland</a>, near <a href="Bardstown%2C%20Kentucky">Bardstown</a> in <a href="Nelson%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Nelson County, Kentucky</a>, son of William Netherton and Julia Tevis (Wickliffe) Beckham. His maternal grandfather, <a href="Charles%20A.%20Wickliffe">Charles A. Wickliffe</a>, was governor of Kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and served as <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">postmaster general</a> in the administration of <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a>. His uncle, <a href="Robert%20C.%20Wickliffe">Robert C. Wickliffe</a>, served as <a href="governor%20of%20Louisiana">governor of Louisiana</a>.

Beckham obtained his early education at Roseland Academy in Bardstown. In 1881, he served as a <a href="page%20%28occupation%29%23Legislative%20pages">page</a> in the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> at 12. Later, he enrolled at Central University (now <a href="Eastern%20Kentucky%20University">Eastern Kentucky University</a>) in <a href="Richmond%2C%20Kentucky">Richmond, Kentucky</a> but was forced to quit school at 17 to support his widowed mother. Two years later, he became <a href="principal%20%28school%29">principal</a> of Bardstown public schools, from 1888 to 1893.

Concurrently, he studied law at the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>, where he earned his law degree in 1889. He was admitted to the <a href="bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> and commenced practice in Bardstown in 1893. He also served as president of the Young Democrats' Club of Nelson County.

Beckham's political career began in 1894, when he was elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives. He served four consecutive terms and was its <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker</a> in 1898, his final year in the House. He also served as a delegate to every <a href="Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic National Convention</a> from 1900 to 1920.

<a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> <a href="William%20Goebel">William Goebel</a> chose Beckham as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899. Goebel was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election, and Beckham's native Nelson County was already committed to a rival candidate. However, friends of Goebel assured him that Beckham would be loyal to Goebel's reform agenda, but the two other men Goebel was considering as running mates would "stack the Senate committees against him." Beckham was not yet 30, the minimum age to serve as governor, at the time of his selection.

Goebel lost a close election to <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="William%20S.%20Taylor">William S. Taylor</a>. When the General Assembly's session opened on January 2, 1900, the election results were immediately challenged. With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly, the results seemed sure to be reversed. The Assembly was still deliberating on January 30, 1900, when Goebel was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the <a href="Old%20State%20Capitol%20%28Kentucky%29">state capitol building</a>. The following day, as Goebel was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel, the General Assembly invalidated enough votes to give him the election. Beckham was sworn into office from his bed the same day. Three days later, Goebel died, never having risen from the bed.

Legislative chaos ensued, as Taylor refused to acknowledge the Assembly's decision and vacate the governorship. The Republicans in the legislature obeyed Taylor's orders, but the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership. Finally, on February 21, 1900, Taylor and Beckham agreed to let the courts settle the matter. The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court, which found in favor of Beckham. Republicans appealed to the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a>, then the <a href="court%20of%20last%20resort">court of last resort</a> in the state. On April 6, 1900, the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court. Taylor appealed to the <a href="US%20Supreme%20Court">US Supreme Court</a>, which declined to hear the case on May 21, 1900. Taylor's only supporter on the court was <a href="John%20Marshall%20Harlan">John Marshall Harlan</a>, from Kentucky.

After the Supreme Court ruling, Taylor fled to <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, fearing he would be implicated in Goebel's assassination. Beckham became acting governor, but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election, a special election was held on November 6, 1900 to determine who would complete Goebel's unexpired term. Beckham, now of age, won the election over Republican John W. Yerkes by fewer than 4,000 votes. Shortly afterward, Beckham married Jean Raphael Fuqua, of <a href="Owensboro%2C%20Kentucky">Owensboro</a>. The couple had two sons.

As governor, Beckham sought to unite his party and the state by supporting changes to the blatantly-partisan Goebel Election Law, which had been authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the General Assembly. He stressed non-controversial issues, such as improvements to roads and the state's educational system. He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices, a reform that both he and Goebel had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign. However, his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda. The only major pieces of legislation passed during Beckham's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under fourteen to work without their parents' consent.

Although the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution</a> prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms, Beckham announced that he would seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and so was eligible to run. His record of reconciliation and of supporting non-controversial reforms prevented significant opposition when he won the party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, <a href="Morris%20B.%20Belknap">Morris B. Belknap</a>, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.
In his message to the legislature in 1904, Beckham again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law, which had not passed during his first term. The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session. Also during the session, funds were approved for building a new <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Capitol">capitol building</a> and a memorial to the late Governor Goebel.

In March 1904, Beckham signed the Day Law, mandating <a href="racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial segregation</a> of all schools in Kentucky. <a href="Berea%20College">Berea College</a>, a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s, immediately filed suit to challenge the law. Its substance was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals. Berea appealed to the Supreme Court, which, in 1908, which decided, in "<a href="Berea%20College%20v.%20Kentucky">Berea College v. Kentucky</a>", against the college. Again, only Harlan dissented.

Near the close of the 1904 session, legislators approved the creation of <a href="Beckham%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Beckham County</a> from parts of <a href="Carter%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Carter</a>, <a href="Elliott%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Elliott</a>, and <a href="Lewis%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Lewis</a> Counties. <a href="Olive%20Hill%2C%20Kentucky">Olive Hill</a> was made the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a>. Soon, the county's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties from which it was carved to less than . Carter County joined the lawsuit, claiming the border of Beckham County passed too close to <a href="Grayson%2C%20Kentucky">Grayson</a>, the seat of Carter County, and to <a href="Vanceburg%2C%20Kentucky">Vanceburg</a>, the seat of Lewis County. The state constitution forbade county borders from passi g within of a county seat. On April 29, 1904, the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the plaintiffs and dissolved Beckham County.

During the 1906 legislative session, Beckham urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies by following the lead of New York attorney <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a>. In particular, he recommended reducing the practice of deferred <a href="dividend">dividend</a>s, which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on hand for illegal purposes. He further advocated for insurance companies doing business in the state to be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky to bolstering the state's economy and to provide policyholders some protection against fraud.

Beckham refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing <a href="Black%20Patch%20Tobacco%20Wars">Black Patch Tobacco Wars</a>. He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal, but more probably, his reasons were political. The Democrats were dominant in the region, and he wanted to avoid challenging his own party.

By collecting some old <a href="US%20Civil%20War">US Civil War</a> debts from the federal government, Beckham also virtually eliminated the state's debt. Encouraged by the state's improved finances, the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state's <a href="normal%20school">normal school</a>s: Western State Teachers College in <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green</a> (later <a href="Western%20Kentucky%20University">Western Kentucky University</a>) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond (later part of Eastern Kentucky University).

With a successful legislative session behind him, Beckham made a bold political move in June 1906. He orchestrated an effort to set the Democratic gubernatorial and senatorial primaries in November, a full year before the gubernatorial election and two years before the senatorial election. Beckham wanted the Senate seat, and if the primary was moved up two years, he could secure his party's nomination while he was still governor. He could also use his influence as governor to sway the party's choice of his potential successor as governor. State Auditor <a href="Samuel%20Wilbur%20Hager">Samuel Wilbur Hager</a> was Beckham's choice for governor and easily won the early primary over challenger N.B. Hays. Former Governor <a href="James%20B.%20McCreary">James B. McCreary</a> challenged Beckham for the senatorial nomination, but Beckham won by more than 11,000 votes.

Beckham's term as governor ended on December 10, 1907. In January 1908, he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the Us Senate by virtue of the primary that had been held two years earlier. The Republicans nominated former Governor <a href="William%20O.%20Bradley">William O. Bradley</a>. On the first ballot, Beckham secured 66 of the needed 69 votes; Bradley received 64 votes. Seven Democrats had not voted for Beckham. Over the next six weeks, 25 more votes were taken, with neither man securing a majority, even though <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, the Democratic nominee for president, campaigned for Beckham. Some Democrats pressured Beckham to withdraw and to allow a more palatable Democrat to run, but he refused. On the 29th ballot, taken near the end of February 1908, Bradley finally secured a majority, after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him.

Beckham's ardent support of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> likely cost him the election. That put him at odds with <a href="Henry%20Watterson">Henry Watterson</a>, editor of the powerful "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a>". As governor Beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machine in <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>. When the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> invalidated the results of Louisville's municipal elections for interference by the city's "whiskey ring" in May 1907, Beckham appointed <a href="Robert%20Worth%20Bingham">Robert Worth Bingham</a>, a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist, as the interim mayor until elections could be held in November. Bingham eliminated grafting in the police department, closed gambling houses, and enforced <a href="blue%20law">blue law</a>s that closed saloons on Sunday. The whiskey ring, therefore, announced that Beckham had forfeited the support of Louisville's legislators. In the senatorial election in 1908, three of the four Democrats who voted against Beckham were from Louisville. Following his defeat, Beckham returned to his law practice.

Six years later, Beckham again attempted to win back hia Senate seat. The passage of the <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment</a> meant that the Senate would no longer be elected by the legislature but instead by popular vote.

In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated <a href="Augustus%20O.%20Stanley">Augustus O. Stanley</a>, a 12-year veteran of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. The Republican nominee was former Governor <a href="Augustus%20E.%20Willson">Augustus E. Willson</a>. Bolstered by his support of President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes.

Beckham served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the <a href="US%20Department%20of%20Labor">US Department of Labor</a> from 1915 to 1917 and on the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Military%20Affairs">Senate Committee on Military Affairs</a>. In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: <a href="Camp%20Zachary%20Taylor">Camp Zachary Taylor</a> and <a href="Fort%20Knox">Fort Knox</a>. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the <a href="US%20Bullion%20Depository">US Bullion Depository</a>.

After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>.

True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the <a href="Eighteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eighteenth Amendment</a>, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was <a href="ratification">ratified</a> and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the <a href="Nineteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Nineteenth Amendment</a>, which granted <a href="women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage</a>. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times.

The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican <a href="Richard%20P.%20Ernst">Richard P. Ernst</a>. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee <a href="James%20M.%20Cox">James M. Cox</a>. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%.

During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>: <a href="Ollie%20M.%20James">Ollie M. James</a>, <a href="George%20B.%20Martin">George B. Martin</a>, and <a href="Augustus%20O.%20Stanley">Augustus O. Stanley</a>.

After his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time, he had the support of the "Louisville Courier-Journal", which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow <a href="parimutuel%20betting">parimutuel betting</a> at the state's <a href="horse%20racing">horse racetracks</a>.

The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections. In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated the Club's relatively-obscure candidate, Robert T. Crowe. <a href="Flem%20D.%20Sampson">Flem D. Sampson</a>, the Club's nominee in the Republican primary, won his party's nomination. In the general election, Beckham could not secure the support of Democratic Governor <a href="William%20J.%20Fields">William J. Fields</a>, who had been elected with the help of the Jockey Club. Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot, including the race for lieutenant governor, Beckham lost to Sampson by more than 32,000 votes, with <a href="voting%20fraud">voting fraud</a> suspected but never proved. It was estimated that the Club spent over $500,000 to defeat him.

Beckham was expected to be the Democrats' nominee for governor in 1935, but the death of his son in late 1934 had left him distraught, and his wife was opposed to another campaign. The Democrats turned to <a href="Happy%20Chandler">A. B. "Happy" Chandler</a>, of <a href="Henderson%2C%20Kentucky">Henderson</a>, who won the election. Beckham supported Chandler's bid, and in return, Chandler appointed him to the <a href="Kentucky%20Public%20Service%20Commission">Kentucky Public Service Commission</a> in 1936. Beckham also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government Reorganization Commission.
Beckham attempted to return to the Senate in 1936. The head of the Jockey Club, James B. Brown, had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930.

In 1933, Beckham's ally, Bingham, had been appointed ambassador to the <a href="Court%20of%20St.%20James%27s">Court of St. James's</a>, in <a href="London">London</a>, increasing his prominence and his influence. Beckham also enjoyed the support of the <a href="United%20Mine%20Workers">United Mine Workers</a> and Louisville Mayor <a href="Neville%20Miller">Neville Miller</a>. The race was complicated, however, by the entry of John Y. Brown, a U.S. Democratic Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He had agreed to support Chandler's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler's support in his run for the Senate. However, Chandler threw his support to Beckham, and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of Bingham and Chandler, he won 85,000 votes, most of them at Beckham's expense. Democratic incumbent <a href="M.%20M.%20Logan">M. M. Logan</a> retained the seat by 2,385 votes.

Beckham died in Louisville on January 9, 1940, and was buried in <a href="Frankfort%20Cemetery">Frankfort Cemetery</a> in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort, Kentucky</a>. <a href="Beckham%20County%2C%20Oklahoma">Beckham County, Oklahoma</a>, was named in his honor at the suggestion of a Kentuckian who was serving as a delegate to Oklahoma's constitutional convention in 1907. Wickland, his birthplace, was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on February 16, 1973.

Gianni Schicchi () is a comic <a href="opera">opera</a> in one act by <a href="Giacomo%20Puccini">Giacomo Puccini</a> to an Italian <a href="libretto">libretto</a> by <a href="Giovacchino%20Forzano">Giovacchino Forzano</a>, composed in 1917–18. The libretto is based on an incident mentioned in <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a>'s "<a href="Divine%20Comedy">Divine Comedy</a>". The work is the third and final part of Puccini's "<a href="Il%20trittico">Il trittico</a>" (The Triptych)—three one-act operas with contrasting themes, originally written to be presented together. Although it continues to be performed with one or both of the other "trittico" operas, "Gianni Schicchi" is now more frequently staged either alone or with short operas by other composers. The aria "<a href="O%20mio%20babbino%20caro">O mio babbino caro</a>" is one of Puccini's best known, and one of the most popular arias in opera.

Puccini had long considered writing a set of one-act operas which would be performed together in a single evening, but faced with a lack of suitable subjects and opposition from his publisher, he repeatedly put the project aside. However, by 1916 Puccini had completed the one-act tragedy "<a href="Il%20tabarro">Il tabarro</a>" and, after considering various ideas, he began work the following year on the solemn, religious, all-female opera "<a href="Suor%20Angelica">Suor Angelica</a>". "Gianni Schicchi", a comedy, completes the triptych with a further contrast of mood. The score combines elements of Puccini's modern style of harmonic dissonance with lyrical passages reminiscent of <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Rossini</a>, and it has been praised for its inventiveness and imagination.

When "Il trittico" premiered at New York's <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> in December 1918, "Gianni Schicchi" became an immediate hit, whereas the other two operas were received with less enthusiasm. This pattern was broadly repeated at the Rome and London premieres and led to commercial pressures to abandon the less successful elements. Although on artistic grounds Puccini opposed performing the three operas except as the original triptych, by 1920 he had given his reluctant consent to separate performances. "Gianni Schicchi" has subsequently become the most-performed part of "Il trittico" and has been widely recorded.

<a href="Gianni%20Schicchi%20de%27%20Cavalcanti">Gianni Schicchi de' Cavalcanti</a> was a 13th-century Italian knight, a Florentine historical figure mentioned by <a href="Dante%20Alighieri">Dante</a> in the "<a href="Divine%20Comedy%23Inferno">Inferno</a>," Canto XXX. In that canto, Dante visits the Circle of Impersonators and sees a man savagely attacking another: he is told that the attacker is Schicchi, condemned to Hell for impersonating Buoso Donati and making his will highly favorable to Schicchi.

The plot used in the opera derives from an 1866 edition of "The Divine Comedy" by <a href="philologist">philologist</a> <a href="Pietro%20Fanfani">Pietro Fanfani</a>, which contained an appendix with commentary attributed to an anonymous Florentine of the 14th century. In this version, Buoso wishes to make a <a href="will%20%28law%29">will</a>, but is put off doing so by his son, Simone. Once it is too late, Simone fears that Buoso, before his illness, may have made a will unfavourable to him. Simone calls on Schicchi for advice, and Schicchi has the idea of impersonating Buoso and making a new will. Simone promises Schicchi he will be well rewarded, but Schicchi takes no chances, "leaving" a considerable sum and Buoso's mule to himself (though most goes to Simone), and makes the bequests conditional on Simone's distributing the estate within fifteen days, otherwise everything will go to charity.

Both Schicchi and Buoso Donati were historical characters. Dante's verses, and the opera, are based on an actual incident that took place in 13th century Florence. Dante had several reasons for his harsh treatment of Schicchi: Dante's wife, Gemma, was of the Donati family; the poet himself was of pure Florentine descent. He despised members of the peasant class such as Schicchi. Dante's class prejudice displays itself in several episodes in the "Inferno": in one, three noble Florentines, who have died and gone to Hell, ask Dante for news of their home city. A disgusted Dante tells them that the city is now dominated by the "<a href="nouveau%20riche">nouveau riche</a>".

According to Burton Fisher, Puccini and Forzano borrowed heavily from the "<a href="commedia%20dell%27arte">commedia dell'arte</a>" tradition in "Gianni Schicchi". Schicchi himself recalls the roguish <a href="Harlequin">Harlequin</a>, while his daughter Lauretta, whose romance is nearly foiled by Buoso's relatives, resembles <a href="Columbina">Columbina</a>. Simone is drawn from <a href="Harlequinade%23Pantaloon">Pantaloon</a>, while the poverty-stricken Betto recalls the buffoonish valet <a href="Zanni">Zanni</a>. Doctor Spinelloccio recalls the classic doctor from the "commedia dell'arte", <a href="Balanzone">Balanzone</a>, even to his Bolognese origin. The Moor whose death momentarily scares the relatives, and <a href="Il%20Capitano">his captain</a>, are stock characters from "commedia dell'arte".

As Buoso Donati lies dead in his curtained four-poster bed, his relatives gather round to mourn his passing, but are really more interested in learning the contents of his will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.

As they read, the relatives' worst fears are soon realised; Buoso has indeed bequeathed his fortune to the monastery. They break out in woe and indignation and turn to Simone, the oldest present and a former mayor of Fucecchio, but he can offer no help. Rinuccio suggests that only Gianni Schicchi can advise them what to do, but this is scorned by Zita and the rest, who sneer at Schicchi's humble origins and now say that marriage to the daughter of such a peasant is out of the question. Rinuccio defends Schicchi in an aria "Avete torto" (You're mistaken), after which Schicchi and Lauretta arrive. Schicchi quickly grasps the situation, and Rinuccio begs him for help, but Schicchi is rudely told by Zita to "be off" and take his daughter with him. Rinuccio and Lauretta listen in despair as Schicchi announces that he will have nothing to do with such people. Lauretta makes a final plea to him with "<a href="O%20mio%20babbino%20caro">O mio babbino caro</a>" (Oh, my dear papa), and he agrees to look at the will. After twice scrutinizing it and concluding that nothing can be done, an idea occurs to him. He sends his daughter outside so that she will be innocent of what is to follow.

First, Schicchi establishes that no one other than those present knows that Buoso is dead. He then orders the body removed to another room. A knock announces the arrival of the doctor, Spinelloccio. Schicchi conceals himself behind the bed curtains, mimics Buoso's voice and declares that he's feeling better; he asks the doctor to return that evening. Boasting that he has never lost a patient, Spinelloccio departs. Schicchi then unveils his plan in the aria "Si corre dal notaio" (Run to the notary); having established in the doctor's mind that Buoso is still alive, Schicchi will disguise himself as Buoso and dictate a new will. All are delighted with the scheme, and importune Schicchi with personal requests for Buoso's various possessions, the most treasured of which are "the mule, the house and the mills at Signa". A funeral bell rings, and everyone fears that the news of Buoso's death has emerged, but it turns out that the bell is tolling for the death of a neighbour's <a href="Moors">Moorish</a> servant. The relatives agree to leave the disposition of the mule, the house and the mills to Schicchi, though each in turn offers him a bribe. The women help him to change into Buoso's clothes as they sing the lyrical trio "Spogliati, bambolino" (Undress, little boy). Before taking his place in the bed, Schicchi warns the company of the grave punishment for those found to have falsified a will: exile from Florence together with the loss of a hand.

The notary arrives, and Schicchi starts to dictate the new will, declaring any prior will null and void. To general satisfaction he allocates the minor bequests, but when it comes to the mule, the house and the mills, he orders that these be left to "my devoted friend Gianni Schicchi". Incredulous, the family can do nothing while the lawyer is present, especially when Schicchi slyly reminds them of the penalties that discovery of the ruse will bring. Their outrage when the notary leaves is accompanied by a frenzy of looting as Schicchi chases them out of what is now his house.

Meanwhile Lauretta and Rinuccio are rapt in a love duet, "Lauretta mia" - there is no bar to their marriage since Schicchi can provide a respectable dowry. Schicchi, returning, stands moved at the sight of the two lovers. He turns to the audience and asks them to agree that no better use could be found for Buoso's wealth: although the poet Dante has condemned him to hell for this trick, Schicchi asks the audience to forgive him in light of "extenuating circumstances."

The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher <a href="Edoardo%20Sonzogno">Edoardo Sonzogno</a> for the best such work, which was won by the young <a href="Pietro%20Mascagni">Pietro Mascagni</a>'s "<a href="Cavalleria%20rusticana">Cavalleria rusticana</a>". With "<a href="Tosca">Tosca</a>" essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with "<a href="Madama%20Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a>", were three works by French dramatist <a href="Alphonse%20Daudet">Alphonse Daudet</a> that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.

After "Butterfly" premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, <a href="Giulio%20Ricordi">Giulio Ricordi</a>, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, <a href="Giuseppe%20Giacosa">Giuseppe Giacosa</a>, on an opera about <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, "Will we go back to it? <nowiki>[</nowiki>"Maria Antonietta"<nowiki>]</nowiki> If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off "M.A."" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.

In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist <a href="Maxim%20Gorky">Maxim Gorky</a>. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became "<a href="La%20fanciulla%20del%20West">La fanciulla del West</a>", although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the "tragic" element, which became "<a href="Il%20tabarro">Il tabarro</a>", but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging "Il tabarro" in combination with his own early work "<a href="Le%20Villi">Le Villi</a>", or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's entertainment. Finally, librettist <a href="Giovacchino%20Forzano">Giovacchino Forzano</a> presented the composer with two works of his own, which became "<a href="Suor%20Angelica">Suor Angelica</a>" and "Gianni Schicchi". The latter would be Puccini's first setting of a comic text; although his earlier operas, for example "<a href="La%20boh%C3%A8me">La bohème</a>", contain comic episodes, these are merely ancillary to the drama to provide contrast.

Forzano wrote to Tito Ricordi, Giulio's son, on 3 March 1917:

I sent the libretto of "Suor Angelica" to Maestro Puccini some days ago. He has declared himself – kind as he is – very satisfied ... I have also finished a brief outline of a plot based on "Gianni Schicchi". You know the Maestro's opinion of this subject, which is rich in possibilities and whose comic nature is quite out of the ordinary.

In fact, Puccini was at first less than enthusiastic about the idea for this comic opera – Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public would have little interest in the subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing "Suor Angelica". The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to "Gianni Schicchi", although the <a href="World%20War%20I">war</a> news and the <a href="1918%20flu%20pandemic">1918 influenza pandemic</a>, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.

With the trilogy complete, Puccini had to decide on a place for the premiere. In 1918, travel was risky and uncertain. Puccini received an offer from Buenos Aires which he refused, unwilling to have so complex a work first performed overseas in his absence. He finally agreed that the premiere could take place at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> in New York, without his being there, on the basis of performing instructions which he supplied to the conductor. "Gianni Schicchi" proved to be the last opera completed by Puccini.

"Gianni Schicchi" was first performed at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> on 14 December 1918, with Roberto Moranzoni conducting, as the final part of "<a href="Il%20trittico">Il trittico</a>". While the sold-out house showed polite enthusiasm for "Il tabarro" and "Suor Angelica", "Gianni Schicchi" was, in the words of the "<a href="New-York%20Tribune">New-York Tribune</a>"s critic, "received with uproarious delight". In the "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">Evening Sun</a>", W.J. Henderson called it "one of the most delightful bits ever put upon the Met stage". The undoubted "pearl of the evening", he said, was Lauretta's aria "O mio babbino caro" which, despite a public notice forbidding encores, was repeated through popular insistence. The only singer to appear in all three works was American soprano <a href="Marie%20Tiffany">Marie Tiffany</a>, who played one of the lovers in "Il tabarro", a lay sister in "Suor Angelica", and Nella in "Gianni Schicchi". "Il trittico" was performed at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera%20House%20%28Philadelphia%29">Met's Philadelphia opera house</a> on 17 December with the same cast, before returning to New York for five more performances during the 1918/19 season.

At the time of the New York premiere, "Il trittico" was in rehearsal in Rome in preparation for an Italian premiere at the <a href="Teatro%20Costanzi">Teatro Costanzi</a>. Puccini wrote Tito Ricordi that the rehearsals were going slowly, but that the orchestra sounded fine, at least in "Gianni Schicchi". The Italian premiere, more important to Puccini than the New York world premiere, took place on 11 January 1919. "Gianni Schicchi" was again warmly received, more so than the first two operas of "Il trittico". Among those dissatisfied by the triptych was Puccini's friend, the conductor <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>, who was in the audience for the Rome premiere. Toscanini was disgusted by the "<a href="verismo">verismo</a>" of "Il tabarro", and left the performance after the first curtain. This caused a rift in his relationship with Puccini, who stated that he would not allow "this god" to conduct the London premiere, though the two were later reconciled. At the Rome premiere, the part of Rinuccio was sung by the Canadian tenor <a href="Edward%20Johnson%20%28tenor%29">Edward Johnson</a>, a future general manager of the Met. Johnson later recalled that, at the composer's request, he had dragged a mock-reluctant Puccini from the wings to acknowledge the house's applause.

In 1919, Puccini visited London to discuss plans for the following year's Covent Garden premiere of "Il trittico". This took place on 18 June 1920; <a href="George%20V">King George V</a> and <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> were present, and called Puccini to their box to give him their congratulations. With Toscanini not considered, Puccini hoped that Sir <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Thomas Beecham</a> would conduct the premiere, but he declined and <a href="Gaetano%20Bavagnoli">Gaetano Bavagnoli</a> conducted. Once again, only "Gianni Schicchi" was received with real warmth.

Other early performances included the October 1920 production of "Il trittico" in German, at the <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Vienna State Opera</a>. In the years following the premiere, Puccini made modifications to the three operas, but "Gianni Schicchi" required few. The principal change was to Rinuccio's arioso, "Avete torto", which was set in a higher pitch to take better advantage of the tenor voice.

By 1920 Puccini was facing increasing pressure, not only from impresarios but also from his publishing firm, <a href="Casa%20Ricordi">Casa Ricordi</a>, to allow "Il trittico" to be broken up and presented separately. Opera houses first wanted to omit "Suor Angelica", which had proven the least popular of the three, but some wished to omit "Il tabarro" as well. Puccini had left London confident that "Il trittico" would gain a place in the Covent Garden repertoire, but soon learned that the opera house's director, Henry V. Higgins, had removed "Suor Angelica", feeling that the audience disliked it. In fact, Higgins would never stage it again. Puccini vociferously objected, as did his longtime London friend, Sybil Seligman, to no avail. Higgins then decided to remove "Il tabarro", and stage "Gianni Schicchi" together with a Russian ballet presentation. Puccini retorted, "This is a real betrayal", but in the end gave in and permitted the performance. Puccini, however, was still convinced that the three works should be performed together, and that his original conception was being "brutally torn to pieces". The Metropolitan Opera joined in the dismemberment: after 1920, it would not again present the three operas together until 1975.

"Gianni Schicchi" returned to the Met in 1926, after Puccini's death, shorn of the other two parts of its operatic triptych, but instead mated to <a href="Ruggero%20Leoncavallo">Ruggero Leoncavallo</a>'s two-act opera "<a href="Pagliacci">Pagliacci</a>". The 1926 production, by Wilhelm von Wymetal, featured sets by Joseph Novak. In the following years at the Met, "Gianni Schicchi" would form part of a bill with such diverse works as <a href="Engelbert%20Humperdinck%20%28composer%29">Engelbert Humperdinck</a>'s "<a href="Hansel%20and%20Gretel">Hänsel und Gretel</a>", <a href="Italo%20Montemezzi">Italo Montemezzi</a>'s "<a href="L%27amore%20dei%20tre%20re">L'amore dei tre re</a>", and even be incestuously mated with Puccini's own "<a href="La%20boh%C3%A8me">La bohème</a>". In 1952, Novak's sets were revised by Wilhelm von Wymetal in a production which remained in service until 1958.

Among the leading singers associated with the opera, <a href="Tito%20Gobbi">Tito Gobbi</a> was particularly prominent in the 1950s and 1960s. He first sang the role of Schicchi in the Rome production in 1951; in subsequent years he appeared in further Rome seasons, in Bologna, and at <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a>, Milan, where <a href="Renata%20Scotto">Renata Scotto</a> sang Lauretta in Carlo Maestrini's production. Gobbi directed and sang in the 1969 production at the <a href="Teatro%20Comunale%20di%20Firenze">Teatro Comunale di Firenze</a>, and later that year performed in and directed the same version at the August 1969 <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival">Edinburgh Festival</a>.

In 1974, the Met gave "Gianni Schicchi" its first new production since 1926. The production, by Fabrizio Melano, was paired with the Met debut of <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a>'s "<a href="Bluebeard%27s%20Castle">Bluebeard's Castle</a>". The following year, the Met revived "Il trittico" in the original form, combining the Melano production with new productions for the other two operas by the same director. The 1975 "Schicchi" featured <a href="Renata%20Scotto">Renata Scotto</a> as Lauretta. Scotto also played the two other "Il trittico" heroines, a feat she repeated later that season, on tour, and when the three operas were again presented by the Met in 1981. When the production was revived again by the Met in 1989, <a href="Teresa%20Stratas">Teresa Stratas</a> sang the ""trittico" <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>". <a href="Lili%20Chookasian">Lili Chookasian</a> sang the <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> leads in all three operas (Zita in "Gianni Schicchi") and <a href="Cornell%20MacNeil">Cornell MacNeil</a> played Schicchi.

<a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival Opera</a> put on a 2004 double bill of "Gianni Schicchi" and <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Rachmaninoff</a>'s "<a href="The%20Miserly%20Knight">The Miserly Knight</a>", in which the sets for the two operas (designed by Vicki Mortimer) are back-to-back on a turntable.

In 2007 <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Opera">Los Angeles Opera</a> announced that it would be staging "Il trittico" in the 2008/2009 season, with <a href="Woody%20Allen">Woody Allen</a> making his operatic directing debut in "Gianni Schicchi". The production starred baritone Sir <a href="Thomas%20Allen%20%28baritone%29">Thomas Allen</a>, soprano <a href="Laura%20T%C4%83tulescu">Laura Tătulescu</a>, and tenor <a href="Saimir%20Pirgu">Saimir Pirgu</a>. A 2015 performance, then directed by <a href="Matthew%20Diamond">Matthew Diamond</a> and starring <a href="Pl%C3%A1cido%20Domingo">Plácido Domingo</a> in the title role, was filmed for television in association with various international broadcasters, such as <a href="Westdeutscher%20Rundfunk">Westdeutscher Rundfunk</a>, <a href="Arte">ARTE</a>, and <a href="NHK">NHK</a>.

The 2007 Royal Opera House production by <a href="Richard%20Jones%20%28director%29">Richard Jones</a> updated the action to a shabby 1940s Italy of "unemptied chamber pots, garish floral wallpaper and damp ceilings", with <a href="Bryn%20Terfel">Bryn Terfel</a> in the title role "a masterpiece of monstrous vulgarity". In the 2009 revival of this production, Schicchi was sung by Thomas Allen, while <a href="Gwynne%20Howell">Gwynne Howell</a>, as Simone, celebrated 40 years with the Royal Opera.

In reviewing the New York premiere, the critics greeted "Gianni Schicchi" warmly; most reviewers found it to be the best of the three operas. "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>" critic <a href="Henry%20Krehbiel">Henry Krehbiel</a> described it as "so uproariously funny ... so full of life, humor, and ingenious devices". "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reviewer <a href="James%20Huneker">James Huneker</a> considered the opera to be "a rollicking, madcap scherzo, overflowing with merry deviltries ... And the last shall be first." Huneker praised De Luca as "a most engaging rascal, fit for a minor niche in Moliere's gallery". The "Times" critic was also amused by Marto Malatesta as "The 'Kid' Gherardino, who is spanked by the irate family".

Rome's critics gave "Il trittico" as a whole a warmer reception, but still saw "Gianni Schicchi" as the best of the three. Alberto Gasco in "La tribuna" noted, "In terms of harmonic technique, "Il tabarro" and "Schicchi" advance quite startling elements of novelty. Nothing that contemporary art has produced escapes the studious and astute Giacomo Puccini." Gasco also stated that while many critics were waiting for the first two operas with their fists drawn, "Gianni Schicchi" disarmed these "hired assassins" with a "single glance". An anonymous reviewer in "L'idea nazionale" felt that the three works comprised a unified whole, but feared that Puccini was becoming less inventive. "L'idea nazionale" was a nationalist newspaper, and praised Puccini for returning to an Italian subject "after so many useless Japanese, American, Parisian digressions".

Modern productions, including those in an updated context, have been generally well received. Describing the 2004 Glyndebourne pairing with "The Miserly Knight" as "flip sides of the same coin", reviewer Edward Seckerson in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" found the "Schicchi" performance "a triumph of ensemble directing and playing, ... wickedly observed, sharp, focussed and funny". "The New York Times" gave a positive review to the Woody Allen 2008 production, which is set in a crowded tenement in which the boy Gherardino is practising knife thrusts. However, the critic questioned Allen's altered ending, in which Schicchi is stabbed by Zita as he addresses the audience. "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" critic Mark Swed deemed Allen's production one of the top ten moments in classical music for 2008, and applauded it for "hilarious wit and engaging musicality". Allen Rich of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" praised the piece, though he disliked Allen's idea of beginning the opera with a montage of old film clips, with credits featuring mock-Italian names.

<a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a> said of Puccini, early in the latter's career, that "the symphonic element dominates in him", and "Gianni Schicchi" has been compared by later analysts to that of the final "presto" movement of a three-movement symphony. With the fast-moving pace of the work, the set pieces are given a simpler melodic structure than those in the other two parts of the triptych. On stage, with the "commedia dell'arte" references, a humorous atmosphere is established from the very beginning. However, the music itself is of the 20th century; <a href="Edward%20Greenfield">Edward Greenfield</a> refers to its "dissonant modernity", with simultaneous clashing chords suggesting that "Puccini was beginning to think in bi-tonal terms". Alongside these dissonant passages are others which opera scholar <a href="Julian%20Budden">Julian Budden</a> calls "bland, schoolroom <a href="diatonic%20scale">diatonism</a>".

Puccini's score is built around a series of motifs which recur through the opera, generally representing characters, situations and moods though sometimes without specific associations. The opening motif is a rapid burst of rhythmic music, described by Greenfield as of "almost Stravinskian sharpness", which quickly transforms into a mock-solemn dirge depicting the hypocritical grief of the Donati relatives. This juxtaposition of the humorous and the solemn pervades the opera; critic <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a> suggests that it "keeps us perpetually suspended between the comic and the tragic". Other principal motifs include the theme associated with the lovers Rinuccio and Lauretta, introduced in Rinuccio's first solo "Salvati! Salvati!", and a short, formal woodwind statement which represents Donati's will. Rinuccio sings the name "Gianni Schicchi" to a jaunty four-note phrase which becomes Schicchi's personal motif, and it is heard again as Schicchi knocks on the door before his first appearance. The best-known theme in the opera, that associated with Lauretta, is introduced in the second part of Rinuccio's aria "Avete torto". The theme is briefly played on clarinet and violin as Lauretta enters with Schicchi, before its full expression in "O mio babbino caro".

Budden dismisses the view that Lauretta's aria, at the midpoint of the opera, was a concession to popular taste; rather, "its position at the turning point of the action is precisely calculated to provide a welcome moment of lyrical repose". Andrew Davis, in his book on Puccini's late style, notes that Lauretta's aria, and the two interruptions by the young lovers ("Addio, speranza bella") as Schicchi mulls over the will, constitute interruptions in the Romantic style, delivered during a lengthy sequence of non-Romantic music. Another interruption, both dramatically and musically, is that provided by the appearance of Doctor Spinelloccio. The doctor's dissonant harmonies contrast sharply with the "scena" music for Schicchi and symbolise Spinelloccio's place as an outsider to the dramatic action of the opera.

The music historian <a href="Donald%20Jay%20Grout">Donald Jay Grout</a> has written that in this opera Puccini's comic skill is "seen at its most spontaneous, incorporating smoothly all the characteristic harmonic devices of his later period." Greenfield remarks on the score's inventiveness, imagination and flawless timing. Several critics have likened "Gianni Schicchi" to Verdi's "<a href="Falstaff%20%28opera%29">Falstaff</a>", as both are masterpieces of operatic comedy from composers more usually associated with tragedy. Both composers took the conventions of comic opera into consideration, choosing a baritone for the principal role, setting the tenor-soprano love story against family opposition to the marriage, and constructing a hoax which permits the happy ending. <a href="Charles%20Osborne%20%28music%20writer%29">Charles Osborne</a> cites in particular the trio for three female voices, "Spogliati, bambolino", as equal to anything in "Falstaff", "its exquisite harmonies almost turning the unprepossessing women into Wagnerian Rhine maidens", and its lilting melody reminiscent of <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Rossini</a>.

Although the score is through-composed, within the general structure of the opera there are several identifiable numbers: four solos given to the three main characters, a trio and a brief love duet. Only Lauretta's "O mio babbino caro", the best-known of the solos, is separable from its context and can be sung as a concert piece.

Despite its popularity as a stage work, "Gianni Schicchi" was not available as a recording until after the Second World War, a neglect described by a "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" reviewer as "extraordinary". One of the earliest recordings, a Turin Radio 1950 broadcast performance conducted by <a href="Alfredo%20Simonetto">Alfredo Simonetto</a>, was praised for its lively presentation but was considered by the critic <a href="Philip%20Hope-Wallace">Philip Hope-Wallace</a> to be "too rough a piece of recording to be warmly recommended". By contrast, the 1958 recording under <a href="Gabriele%20Santini">Gabriele Santini</a>, with a cast including <a href="Tito%20Gobbi">Tito Gobbi</a> and <a href="Victoria%20de%20los%20%C3%81ngeles">Victoria de los Ángeles</a>, was still being discussed nearly 50 years later as the classic performance, with Gobbi's singing at a standard rarely equalled. Among more recent recordings, that of the complete "Trittico" with the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a> under <a href="Antonio%20Pappano">Antonio Pappano</a> (1998) has been generally recommended. There are numerous video recordings now available.

American composer <a href="Michael%20Ching">Michael Ching</a> wrote a one-act English-language sequel, "Buoso's Ghost", which had its first full staging with the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Opera">Pittsburgh Opera</a> in 1996, and its official premiere at <a href="Opera%20Memphis">Opera Memphis</a> in 1997. Starting where "Gianni Schicchi" ends, the new opera, with a libretto by the composer, opens with "Schicchi"s final chords and carries the plot forward by following the sinister dealings of Buoso Donati's family, who apparently had poisoned Buoso, and the continued machinations of Schicchi, who tries to exploit this growing suspicion on his part. "<a href="Opera%20News">Opera News</a>" noted that Ching uses "a more modern musical mode, yet avoiding excessive atonality. The score subtly introduces brief tongue-in-cheek quotations from other works, ranging from Mozart to Sondheim, plus one unmistakable interjection of Shostakovich." It has been performed throughout the U.S., paired with "Gianni Schicchi".

Blue iguana

The blue iguana ("Cyclura lewisi"), also known as the Grand Cayman ground iguana, Grand Cayman blue iguana or Cayman Island rock iguana, is an <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> of <a href="lizard">lizard</a> <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to the island of <a href="Grand%20Cayman">Grand Cayman</a>. Previously listed as a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the <a href="Cyclura%20nubila">Cuban iguana</a> ("Cyclura nubila"), it was reclassified as a separate <a href="species">species</a> in 2004 because of genetic differences discovered four years earlier. The blue iguana is one of the longest-living species of lizard (possibly up to 69 years). 

The preferred habitat for the blue iguana is rocky, sunlit, open areas in <a href="dry%20forest">dry forest</a>s or near the shore, as the females must dig holes in the sand to lay eggs in June and July. A possible second clutch is laid in September. The blue iguana's <a href="herbivory">herbivorous</a> diet includes plants, fruits, and flowers. Its coloration is tan to gray with a bluish cast that is more pronounced during the breeding season and more so in males. It is large and heavy-bodied with a dorsal crest of short spines running from the base of the neck to the end of the tail.

The fossil record indicates that the blue iguana was abundant before <a href="European%20colonization">European colonization</a>; but fewer than 15 animals remained in the wild by 2003, and this wild population was predicted to become <a href="extinction">extinct</a> within the first decade of the 21st century. The species' decline is mainly being driven by <a href="predation">predation</a> by feral pets (cats and dogs) and indirectly by the destruction of their natural <a href="habitat%20%28ecology%29">habitat</a> as fruit farms are converted to pasture for cattle grazing. Since 2004, hundreds of captive-bred animals have been released into a preserve on Grand Cayman run by a partnership headed by the <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Trust">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, in an attempt to save the species. At least five non-profit organizations are working with the government of the Cayman Islands to ensure the survival of the blue iguana. According to the November 9, 2013 episode of "<a href="Ocean%20Mysteries%20with%20Jeff%20Corwin">Ocean Mysteries with Jeff Corwin</a>", the conservancy program has released over 700 captive bred Grand Cayman blue iguanas since the 2004 nadir of only 12 remaining animals.

The blue iguana ("Cyclura lewisi" ) is endemic to the island of Grand Cayman. The <a href="Cyclura%20nubila%20caymanensis">Lesser Caymans iguana</a> has been introduced to Grand Cayman, where it has interbred with that island's native blue iguana.

Its <a href="genus">generic</a> name ("<a href="Cyclura">Cyclura</a>") is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "cyclos" (κύκλος) meaning "circular" and "ourá" (οὐρά) meaning "tail", after the thick-ringed tail characteristic of all "Cyclura". Its <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> ("lewisi") is a <a href="Latinisation%20%28literature%29">Latinized</a> form of the name of the scientist who collected the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of this species, Charles Bernard Lewis.

Its closest relatives are the <a href="Cuban%20iguana">Cuban iguana</a> ("Cyclura nubila") and the <a href="Northern%20Bahamian%20rock%20iguana">Northern Bahamian rock iguana</a> ("Cyclura cychlura"), the three species having diverged from a common ancestor some three million years ago. The species has a low <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a> but does not seem to suffer the same lack of vitality that afflicts other such species of rock iguana. One theory is that the species evolved from a single female Cuban iguana ("C. nubila nubila") with eggs inside her who <a href="Oceanic%20dispersal">drifted</a> across the sea, perhaps during a storm. It is distinct from the subspecies found on <a href="Little%20Cayman">Little Cayman</a> and <a href="Cayman%20Brac">Cayman Brac</a> known as "<a href="Cyclura%20nubila%20caymanensis">C. nubila caymanensis</a>", although it can breed with this subspecies and produce fertile offspring.

In 1938, C. Bernard Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica joined an <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> biological expedition to the Cayman Islands. Lewis was able to obtain two blue iguanas, a male and a female, which were later lodged with the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> of Natural History. <a href="Chapman%20Grant">Chapman Grant</a>, in a monograph published in 1940, formally described the blue iguana for the first time as "Cyclura macleayi lewisi". Schwartz and Carey established the <a href="trinomial%20nomenclature">trinomial</a> ("Cyclura nubila lewisi" ) in 1977. They held that the blue iguana was a strongly distinct subspecies of the Cuban iguana ("C. nubila"), the species which it evolved from and can breed with. They emphasized its overall bright blue coloration, and noted that further study could reveal it to be a distinct species. Frederick Burton reclassified the blue iguana as a distinct species in 2004, after years of research comparing scale counts on the heads of Caribbean iguanas, including those found on Little Cayman, Cayman Brac, Cuba, and the Bahamas, as well as <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> analysis performed by Dr. Catherine Malone, to re-examine the <a href="phylogeography">phylogeography</a> of the different species.

The blue iguana is the largest native land animal on Grand Cayman with a total nose-to-tail length of and weighing as much as . It may be the heaviest species of iguana and most massive <a href="lizard">lizard</a> in the <a href="Western%20Hemisphere">Western Hemisphere</a>. Its body length is 20–30 inches (51–76 cm) with a tail equal in length. The blue iguana's toes are articulated to be efficient in digging and climbing trees. Although not known to be arboreal, the blue iguana has been observed climbing trees and higher. The male is larger than the female by one third of his body size. The mature male's skin color ranges from dark grey to turquoise blue, whereas the female is more olive green to pale blue. Young animals tend to be uniformly dark brown or green with faint darker banding. When they first emerge from the nest the neonates have an intricate pattern of eight dark <a href="dorsum%20%28biology%29">dorsal</a> chevrons from the crest of their necks to their pelvic area. These markings fade by the time the animal is one year old, changing to mottled gray and cream and eventually giving way to blue as adults. The adult blue iguana is typically dark gray matching the <a href="karst">karst</a> rock of its landscape. The animal changes its color to blue when it is in the presence of other iguanas to signal and establish territory. The blue color is more pronounced in males of the species. Their distinctive black feet stand in contrast to their lighter overall body color. 

Blue iguanas are <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>; males are larger and have more prominent <a href="Dorsum%20%28biology%29">dorsal</a> crests as well as larger <a href="femoral%20pore">femoral pore</a>s on their thighs, which are used to release <a href="pheromones">pheromones</a>.

The blue iguana's eyes have a golden <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> and red <a href="sclera">sclera</a>. They have excellent vision, which allows them to detect shapes and motions at long distances. As blue iguanas have only a few <a href="rod%20cell">rod cell</a>s, they have poor vision in low-light conditions. At the same time, they have <a href="cone%20cell">cells</a> called "<a href="Double%20cone%20%28biology%29">double cones</a>" which give them sharp color vision and enable them to see <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> wavelengths. This ability is useful when basking so the animal can ensure that it absorbs enough sunlight in the forms of UVA and UVB to produce <a href="vitamin%20D">vitamin D</a>.

Blue iguanas have evolved a white photosensory organ on the top of their heads called the <a href="parietal%20eye">parietal eye</a> (also known as the third eye, pineal eye or pineal gland). This "eye" does not work the same way as a normal eye as it has only a rudimentary retina and lens and thus, cannot form images. It is however sensitive to changes in light and dark and can detect movement.

Like all "Cyclura" species, the blue iguana is primarily <a href="herbivory">herbivorous</a>, consuming leaves, flowers, and fruits from over 45 species of plant. This diet is very rarely supplemented with insect larvae, crabs, slugs, dead birds, and fungi. The iguanas are presented with a special problem for <a href="osmoregulation">osmoregulation</a>: plant matter contains more <a href="potassium">potassium</a> and as it has less nutritional content per gram, more must be eaten to meet the lizard's metabolic needs. As they are not capable of creating urine more concentrated than their bodily fluids, they excrete nitrogenous wastes as <a href="urate">uric acid</a> salts through a <a href="salt%20gland">salt gland</a> in the same manner as <a href="bird">bird</a>s. As a result, they have developed this lateral nasal gland to supplement renal salt secretion by expelling excess potassium and sodium chloride.

Longevity in the wild is unknown but is presumed to be many decades. A blue iguana named "Godzilla" captured on Grand Cayman in 1950 by naturalist Ira Thompson was imported to the United States in 1985 by Ramon Noegel and sold to reptile importer and breeder, Tom Crutchfield in 1990. Crutchfield donated Godzilla to the <a href="Gladys%20Porter%20Zoo">Gladys Porter Zoo</a> in <a href="Brownsville%2C%20Texas">Brownsville</a>, <a href="Texas">Texas</a> in 1997 and the lizard remained there until its death in 2004. Thompson estimated Godzilla to be 15 years of age at the time of his capture. At an estimated 69 years of age (54 of which were spent in captivity), Godzilla may be the world's longest-living lizard for which there is reliable record. A closely related Lesser Caymans iguana ("<a href="Cyclura%20nubila%20caymanensis">C. nubila caymanensis</a>") has been documented as living 33 years in captivity.

Mating occurs from May through June. <a href="Copulation">Copulation</a> is preceded by numerous head-bobs on the part of the male, who then circles around behind the female and grasps the nape of her neck. He then attempts to restrain the female in order to maneuver his tail under hers to position himself for intromission. Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. A clutch of anywhere from 1 to 21 eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. Several exploratory nests are begun before one is completed. These burrows can range from to over in length, with an enlarged chamber at its terminal portion to allow the female to turn around. The temperature within nests that have been monitored by researchers remained a constant throughout the incubation period which ranges from 65–90 days. The blue iguana's eggs are among the largest laid by any lizard.

Individuals are aggressively territorial from the age of about three months onward. Females occupy overlapping areas of the order of seemingly regardless of age, while males occupy progressively larger and more extensively overlapping territories as they age and grow.

The blue iguana is listed as endangered on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. The population is restricted to the eastern interior of Grand Cayman, where it had been reduced to a critically low level, only three animals having been observed before the survey in 1988. The range of the blue iguana has contracted significantly over the past 25 years, with many sites once populated now showing no signs of iguanas. Surveys in 2003 indicated a total population in the range of 5–15 individuals. By 2005 the unmanaged wild population was considered to be functionally extinct. The species is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A further blow to the dwindling population came in May 2008 when six individuals were found butchered in a nature preserve.

As the blue iguana consumes a variety of plant material, favoring fruits and flowers over leaves and stems when available, it is valuable on Grand Cayman as a seed disperser throughout its range. A study in 2000 by Dr Allison Alberts revealed that seeds passing through the digestive tracts of "Cycluras" germinate more rapidly than those that do not. These seeds in the fruits consumed by the blue iguana have an adaptive advantage by sprouting before the end of very short rainy seasons. The blue iguana is an important means of distributing seeds to new areas and, as the largest native herbivore of Grand Cayman's ecosystems, it is essential for maintaining the delicate balance between climate and vegetation necessary to survive under harsh conditions.

Restored free-roaming subpopulations in the <a href="Botanic%20Park%20and%20Salina%20Reserve%20Important%20Bird%20Area">Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park and the Salina Reserve</a> numbered approximately 125 individuals in total after an initial release in December 2005. The restored subpopulation in the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park has been breeding since 2001, and the subpopulation in the Salina Reserve was deemed to be breeding in 2006 after a nest of three hatched eggs was discovered in the wild. As of April 2007, after another large-scale release, there were 299 blue iguanas living in the wild, with hundreds more being raised in captivity on Grand Cayman. In late 2012, the blue iguana Recovery Program estimated that the wild population had risen to approximately 750 individuals, and the IUCN subsequently downlisted the species from critically endangered to endangered.

Habitat destruction is the main factor threatening imminent extinction for this iguana. Land clearance within remnant habitat is occurring for agriculture, road construction, and real estate development and speculation. The conversion of traditional crop lands to cattle pasture is eliminating secondary blue iguana habitat.

Predation and injury to hatchlings by <a href="rat">rat</a>s, to hatchlings and sub-adults by <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a>s, and killing of adults by <a href="pariah%20dog">roaming dogs</a> are all placing severe pressure on the remaining wild population. Automobiles and motorscooters are an increasing cause of mortality as the iguanas rarely survive the collisions. Trapping and shooting is a comparatively minor concern, but occasional trapping continues despite legal protection and sustained efforts to increase public awareness.

The common <a href="Green%20Iguana">Green Iguana</a>, ("Iguana iguana"), has been introduced from <a href="Honduras">Honduras</a> and is well-established on Grand Cayman as an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>. It far outnumbers the endemic blue iguana. No direct negative consequences of this introduction on the blue iguana are known, but the mere presence of the Green Iguana confuses public attitudes and understanding. For example, the people of the island are told that blue iguanas are endangered and rare, and when they subsequently see large numbers of the introduced Green Iguana, they do not understand the difference.

Blue iguanas used to regularly be sold to tourists as pets, as their rarity made them appealing to exotic-animal collectors, despite this being illegal under the <a href="CITES">CITES</a> treaty. In 1999 a <a href="World%20Wildlife%20Fund">World Wildlife Fund</a> international conservation officer, Stuart Chapman, said, "The British government has turned a blind eye for over 20 years to these overseas territories which are home to many rare and endangered species. Many of these face extinction if Britain fails to honour its treaty obligations. The British Caribbean islands are extremely rich in biodiversity with many critically <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> that are unique to the islands—yet there is virtually zero enforcement or implementation of CITES".

In May 2008, six blue iguanas were found dead in the preserve within Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park on Grand Cayman. The iguanas were apparently killed by human vandals armed with knives and two of the slaughtered animals were gravid females about to lay eggs.

The wild population of blue iguanas had been reduced from a near island-wide distribution to a non-viable, fragmented remnant. By 2001, no young hatched in the unmanaged wild population were surviving to breeding age, meaning the population was functionally extinct, with only five animals remaining in the wild.

In 1990, the <a href="American%20Zoo%20and%20Aquarium%20Association">American Zoo and Aquarium Association</a> (AZA) designated the genus "Cyclura" as their highest priority for conservation. Their first project was an "<a href="in%20situ">in situ</a>" captive breeding program for the blue iguana, which at the time was the most critically endangered of all the species of "Cyclura".

One of the early difficulties encountered was that the captive stock of the early 1990s was found not to be pure. It was discovered through DNA analysis that the captive population contained a number of animals that were <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> with "C. nubila caymanensis". The program contains only pure specimens, as these hybrids were sterilized by means of hemipenectomies and hence excluded. This program was created to determine the exact genealogies of the limited gene pool of the remaining animals and DNA analysis revealed that the entire North American captive population was descended from a single pair of animals. After five years of research two captive breeding populations were established and are managed as a single unit, with cross-breeding between the populations to promote genetic diversity.

As a hedge against disaster striking the blue iguana population on Grand Cayman, an <a href="ex%20situ">off-island</a> captive population was established in 25 zoos in the USA. A minimum of 20 founder lines represented by at least 225 individuals is being maintained by captive breeding and recorded in a <a href="studbook">studbook</a> for the species by Tandora Grant of the <a href="San%20Diego%20Zoo">San Diego Zoo</a>'s Center for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species (CRES). The <a href="Indianapolis%20Zoo">Indianapolis Zoo</a> has had success with breeding the blue iguana in captivity twice since the year 2000.

In October 2006, hatchlings were released into the wild for the first time to boost the species and help bring them back from the brink of extinction. Each released blue iguana wears a string of colored beads through its <a href="neck">nuchal</a> crest for visual identification at a distance, backed up by an implanted <a href="microchip%20implant%20%28animal%29">microchip</a> and a high-resolution photograph of its head scales. (Head scale patterns are as unique among blue iguanas as fingerprints are among humans.)

The blue iguana is established in captivity, both in public and private collections. As there are very few pure-bred animals in private collections, private individuals have established these animals in captive breeding programs as hybrids with the Lesser Caymans Iguana ("C.nubila caymanensis") and occasional hybrids with the Cuban Iguana ("C.n.nubila") minimizing the demand for wild-caught specimens for the pet trade.

The Blue Iguana Recovery Programme grew from a small project started in 1990 within the National Trust for the Cayman Islands. It is now a partnership, linking the Trust with the Cayman Islands Department of Environment, National Trust Cayman Islands, Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park, <a href="Durrell%20Wildlife%20Conservation%20Trust">Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust</a>, International Reptile Conservation Foundation, IRCF, and the <a href="European%20Commission">European Commission</a>. This program operates under a special exemption from provisions in the Animals Law of the Cayman Islands, which normally would make it illegal for anyone to kill, capture, or keep iguanas. BIRP's <a href="Wildlife%20conservation">conservation</a> strategy involves generating large numbers of genetically diverse hatchlings, head-starting them for two years so that their chance of survival in the wild is high, and using these animals to rebuild a series of wild sub-populations in protected, managed natural areas. This is accompanied by field research, nest site protection, and monitoring of the released animals. A rapid numerical increase from a maximum possible number of founding stock is sought to minimize loss of genetic diversity caused by the "<a href="population%20bottleneck">population bottleneck</a>".

Restored sub-populations are already present in two non-contiguous areas—the Salina Reserve and the Queen Elizabeth II Botanic Park. Habitat protection is still vital, as the Salina Reserve has only of dry shrubland, which is not enough to sustain the 1,000 blue iguanas that must be restored to the wild to remove this species from the Critically Endangered List. Additional separate sub-populations will be restored in one or more other areas. The overall captive population is likely to remain genetically fragmented in the long term. Individuals will be translocated between sub-populations to maintain gene flow so that the entire population remains a single genetic management unit. When the wild sub-populations have reached the carrying capacity of their respective protected areas, release of head-started animals will be phased out, and they will be left to reproduce naturally. In addition, guided by research and monitoring, control or eradication of non-native predators will be implemented to the degree necessary to allow young blue iguanas to survive to maturity in sufficient numbers to maintain these sub-populations.

Maintenance of blue iguanas in the wild requires active management into the indefinite future. To sustain this activity, a range of commercial activities generates the funding required, while an ongoing education and awareness effort ensures continued involvement and support by the local community.

Neferefre

Neferefre Isi (also known as Raneferef, Ranefer and in <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> as Cherês, "Χέρης") was an <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ian <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>, likely the fourth but also possibly the fifth ruler of the <a href="Fifth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty</a> during the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> period. He was very probably the eldest son of pharaoh <a href="Neferirkare%20Kakai">Neferirkare Kakai</a> and queen <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>, known as prince Ranefer before he ascended the throne.

Neferefre started <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Neferefre">a pyramid for himself</a> in the royal necropolis of <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a> called "Netjeribau Raneferef", which means "The <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23Ba%20.28personality.29">bas</a> of Neferefre are divine". The pyramid was never finished, with a mason's inscription showing works on the stone structure were abandoned during or shortly after the king's second year of reign. Together with the sparsity of attestations contemporaneous with his reign, this is taken by Egyptologists as evidence that Neferefre died unexpectedly after two to three years on the throne. Neferefre was nonetheless buried in his pyramid, hastily completed in the form of a <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a> by his second successor and presumably younger brother, pharaoh <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a>. Fragments of his mummy were uncovered there, showing that he died in his early twenties.

Little is known of Neferefre's activities beyond laying the foundations of his pyramid and attempting to finish that of his father. A single text shows that Neferefre had planned or just started to build a sun temple called "Hotep-Re", meaning "Ra is content" or "Ra's offering table", which possibly never functioned as such given the brevity of the king's reign. After his death, Neferefre might have been succeeded by an ephemeral and little-known pharaoh, <a href="Shepseskare">Shepseskare</a>, whose relation with Neferefre remains highly uncertain and debated.

Like other Fifth Dynasty kings, Neferefre benefited from a <a href="funerary%20cult">funerary cult</a>. Cult rituals took place in a temple built by Nyuserre next to the former's pyramid. The cult seems to have been abandoned by the late Old Kingdom period and Neferefre fell into obscurity. The unfinished aspect of his pyramid and mortuary complex may have attracted less attention from grave and stone robbers than nearby pyramids. As a consequence more statues of Neferefre have been uncovered in his complex than in any other Fifth Dynasty mortuary temple.

There are very few archaeological sources contemporaneous with Neferefre, a fact which is now seen by Egyptologists, including <a href="Miroslav%20Verner">Miroslav Verner</a>, to imply a very short reign. In particular, as of 2017, only one inscription dated to his rule is known. It was left by the builders of his pyramid on a corner block at the end of the corridor leading to the pyramid substructures. The inscription was written on the fourth day of the <a href="Akhet%20%28hieroglyph%20and%20season%29">Akhet season</a> in the year of first occurrence of the <a href="cattle%20count">cattle count</a>, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom although recent reappraisals have led Egyptologists to posit a less regular and somewhat more frequent count. Therefore, the inscription must refer to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne, and his third year at the very latest. Finally, a few artefacts dated to Neferefre's rule or shortly after have been uncovered in his mortuary complex and elsewhere in <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a>, such as clay seals bearing his <a href="Horus%20name">Horus name</a>.

Some of the <a href="Abusir%20Papyri">Abusir Papyri</a> discovered in Khentkhaus II's temple and dating to the mid- to late Fifth Dynasty mention the mortuary temple and <a href="funerary%20cult">funerary cult</a> of Neferefre. They constitute a written source near-contemporaneous with his reign, which not only confirmed the existence of Neferefre's pyramid complex at a time when it had not yet been identified, but also gives details regarding the administrative organisation and importance of the funerary cult of the king in Ancient Egyptian society.

Neferefre is present on several Ancient Egyptian king lists, all dating to the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom period</a>. The earliest such list mentioning Neferefre is the <a href="Abydos%20King%20List">Abydos King List</a>, written during the reign of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a> (<a href="Floruit">fl.</a> 1290–1279 BC), and where his <a href="Prenomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">prenomen</a> occupies the 29th entry, between those of Neferirkare Kakai and Nyuserre Ini. During the subsequent reign of <a href="Ramses%20II">Ramses II</a> (fl. 1279–1213 BC), Neferefre appears on the <a href="Saqqara%20Tablet">Saqqara Tablet</a>, this time after Shepseskare, that is as a second successor to Neferirkare Kakai. Owing to a scribal error, Neferefre's name on this list is given as "Khanefere" or "Neferkhare".
Neferefre's prenomen was in all probability also given on the <a href="Turin%20King%20List">Turin canon</a> (third column, 21st row), which dates to the same period as the Saqqara tablet, but it has since been lost in a large <a href="lacuna%20%28manuscripts%29">lacuna</a> affecting the document. Nonetheless, the part of the reign length attributed to Neferefre by the canon is still legible, with a single stroke sign indicating one year of reign to which a decade could in principle be added, as the corresponding sign would be effectively lost in the lacuna of the document.

Neferefre was also likely mentioned in the "<a href="Aegyptiaca">Aegyptiaca</a>", a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>. No copies of the "Aegyptiaca" have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by <a href="Sextus%20Julius%20Africanus">Sextus Julius Africanus</a> and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>. Africanus relates that the "Aegyptiaca" mentioned the succession "Nefercherês → Sisirês → Cherês" for the mid-Fifth Dynasty. Nefercherês, Sisirês and Cherês are believed to be the <a href="Hellenization">hellenized</a> forms for Neferirkare, Shepseskare and Neferkhare (that is Neferefre), respectively. Thus, Manetho's reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty is in good agreement with the Saqqara tablet. In Africanus' <a href="epitome">epitome</a> of the "Aegyptiaca", Cherês is reported to have reigned for 20 years.

Neferefre was, in all likelihood, the eldest son of his predecessor pharaoh <a href="Neferirkare%20Kakai">Neferirkare Kakai</a> with queen <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>. 
This is shown by a relief on a limestone slab discovered in a house in the village near Abusir and depicting Neferirkare and his wife Khentkaus with "the king's eldest son Ranefer", a name identical with some variants of Neferefre's own. This indicates that Ranefer was Neferefre's name when he was still only a <a href="crown%20prince">crown prince</a>, that is, before his accession to the throne.

Neferirkare and Khentkaus had at least another son, the future king <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a>. In addition, since the relation between Shepseskare and Neferefre remains uncertain, it is possible that the two were brothers too, as suggested by the Egyptologist Silke Roth, although other hypotheses on the matter have been proposed: Verner sees Shepseskare as a son of Sahure and hence Neferefre's uncle, while Jaromír Krejčí believes Shepseskare was Neferefre's son.
Finally, yet another brother, possibly younger than both Neferefre and Nyuserre has also been proposed: Iryenre, a prince "<a href="iry-pat">iry-pat</a>" whose <a href="filiation">filiation</a> is suggested by the fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.

Until 2014, no consort of Neferefre was known. Late in that year, the <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a> of <a href="Khentkaus%20III">Khentkaus III</a> was discovered by archaeologists from the <a href="Faculty%20of%20Arts%2C%20Charles%20University%20in%20Prague%23Historical%20sciences">Czech Institute of Egyptology</a> working in Abusir, south east of Neferefre's pyramid. The location and date of the tomb as well as inscriptions found in it strongly suggest that Khentkaus III was Neferefre's queen. Indeed, not only was Khentkaus III presumably buried during the few decades following Neferefre's reign, but her mastaba is also in close proximity to his pyramid, and she bore the title of "king's wife", proving that she was a queen.

In addition, Khentkaus III was also called "king's mother" by inscriptions in her tomb, indicating that her son had become pharaoh. Since Neferefre's second successor Nyuserre Ini is known to have been his brother rather than his son, and since Khentkaus III might have been buried during Nyuserre's reign, as indicated by mud seals, this only leaves either Neferefre's ephemeral successor <a href="Shepseskare">Shepseskare</a> or Nyuserre's successor <a href="Menkauhor%20Kaiu">Menkauhor Kaiu</a> as possibilities. There is an ongoing debate in Egyptology concerning these two alternatives. Verner posits that Shepseskare was an uncle of Neferefre and therefore that Menkauhor Kaiu was Neferefre's son. Meanwhile, Krejčí views the opposite hypothesis, that Shepseskare was Neferefre's son with Khentkaus III, as more probable.

Two further sons of Neferefre and Khentkaus III have been proposed by Verner: the "king's son" Nakhtsare, whose filiation is supported by the general date and location of his tomb, and Kakaibaef, a member of the elite buried in Abusir. Krejčí notes the lack of the titular "king's son" in relation to Kakaibaef, thereby emphasizing the conjectural nature of Verner's assertion.

Two competing hypotheses exist in Egyptology to describe the succession of events running from the death of Neferirkare Kakai, third king of the Fifth Dynasty, to the coronation of Nyuserre Ini, sixth ruler of the dynasty. Relying on historical sources, most notably the Saqqara king list and Manetho's "Aegyptiaca", where Neferefre is said to have succeeded Shepseskare, many Egyptologists such as <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20von%20Beckerath">Jürgen von Beckerath</a> and <a href="Hartwig%20Altenm%C3%BCller">Hartwig Altenmüller</a> have traditionally believed that the following royal succession took place: Neferirkare Kakai → Shepseskare → Neferefre Isi → Nyuserre Ini. In this scenario, Neferefre would be the father of Nyuserre, who would have become pharaoh after the former's unexpected death.

This view was challenged at the turn of the millennium, most notably by Verner, who has been responsible for the archaeological excavations of the Fifth Dynasty royal necropolis of Abusir since 1976. Firstly, there is the relief, mentioned earlier, showing that Neferefre was in all likelihood Neferirkare's eldest son.

Secondly, excavations of Neferefre's pyramid have yielded his mummy, which showed that he was 18 to 20 years of age at the death of Neferirkare. Consequently, as the previous king's eldest son, in his late teens to early twenties, Neferefre was in optimal position to ascend the throne. Positing that Shepseskare reigned between Neferefre and his father would thus require an explanation as to why and how Shepseskare's claim to the throne could have been stronger than Neferefre's.
Thirdly, archaeological evidences indicate that Shepseskare most likely reigned for only a few weeks to a few months at the most rather than seven years as credited to him in the "Aegyptiaca", a hypothesis already supported by Nicolas Grimal as early as 1988.
Indeed, Shepseskare is the least known Fifth Dynasty king, with only two seals and a few seal impressions bearing his name known as of 2017, a paucity of attestations suggesting a very short reign. This is also supported by the state of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid, which "was interrupted [and] corresponds to the work of several weeks, perhaps no more than one or two months".

Fourthly, archaeological evidence also favors dating Shepseskare's reign to after Neferefre's. Some of the few seal impressions bearing Shepseskare's name have been discovered in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple, which was not built until Neferefre's death. This seems to indicate that Shepseskare made offerings for the funerary cult of Neferefre, who must therefore have reigned before him. Another argument concerns the alignment of pyramids of <a href="pyramid%20of%20Sahure">Sahure</a>, <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Neferirkare">Neferirkare Kakai</a> and <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Neferefre">Neferefre</a>: they form a line pointing to <a href="Heliopolis%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">Heliopolis</a>, just as the three <a href="pyramids%20of%20Giza">pyramids of Giza</a> do. In contrast, Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid does not fall on the line to Heliopolis, which strongly suggests that Neferefre's pyramid had already been in place when Shepseskare started to build his. Lastly, while Shepseskare is noted as the immediate predecessor of Neferefre in the Saqqara king list, Verner notes that "this slight discrepancy can be attributed to the [political] disorders of the time and its dynastic disputes." Verner's arguments have convinced a number of Egyptologists, including Darrell Baker, <a href="Erik%20Hornung">Erik Hornung</a> and <a href="I.%20E.%20S.%20Edwards">Iorwerth Edwards</a>.

While Neferefre is given a reign of some 20 years in epitomes of Manetho's "Aegyptiaca", the current academic view is that this number is an overestimation of his true reign length, which must have been significantly shorter. Before the results of the extensive excavations in Abusir were fully published, Egyptologists following the traditional succession hypothesis credited Neferefre with around a decade of rule, based on the paucity of attestations contemporaneous with his reign. For example, von Beckerath and Winfried Barta gave him 11 and 10 years on the throne, respectively. This view now has few supporters.

Indeed, since then, Verner has set forth the hypothesis of a reign of no more than two years. His conclusion is based on archaeological evidence: the unfinished state of his intended pyramid, and the general paucity of documents datable to his rule. Verner writes that:
The shape of the tomb of Neferefra...as well as a number of other archaeological finds clearly indicate that the construction of the king's funerary monument was interrupted, owing to the unexpected early death of the king. The plan of the unfinished building had to be basically changed and a decision was taken to hastily convert the unfinished pyramid, (of which only the incomplete lowest step of the core was built), into a "square-shaped mastaba" or, more precisely, a stylized primeval hill. At the moment of the king's death neither the burial apartment was built, nor was the foundation of the mortuary temple laid.

Furthermore, two historical sources conform with the hypothesis of a short reign: the mason's inscription in Neferefre's pyramid was discovered "at about two thirds of the height of the extant core of the monument" and probably refers to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne; and the Turin canon which credits Neferefre with less than two full years of reign. The combination of archaeological and historical evidence led to the consensus that Neferefre's reign lasted "not longer than about two years".

Neferefre started the construction of a pyramid for himself in the royal necropolis of Abusir, where his father and grandfather had built their own pyramids. It was known to the Ancient Egyptians as "Netjeribau Raneferef" meaning "The <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20concept%20of%20the%20soul%23Ba%20.28personality.29">bas</a> of Neferefre are divine".

Planned with a square base of , the pyramid of Neferefre was to be larger than those of Userkaf and Sahure, but smaller than that of his father Neferirkare. Upon the unexpected death of Neferefre, only its lower courses had been completed, reaching a height of c. . Subsequently, Nyuserre hastily completed the monument by filling its central part with poor quality limestone, mortar and sand. The external walls of the building were given a smooth and nearly vertical covering of gray limestone at an angle of 78° with the ground so as to give it the form of a mastaba, albeit with a square plan rather than with the usual rectangular shape. Finally, the roof terrace was covered with clay into which local desert gravels were pressed, giving it the appearance of a mound in the surrounding desert, and indeed it was by the name "the Mound" that the monument was subsequently called by the Ancient Egyptians. Verner has proposed that the monument was completed this way so as to give it the form of the <a href="Benben">primeval mound</a>, the mound that arose from the <a href="primordial%20water">primordial water</a>s <a href="Naunet">Nu</a> in the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20creation%20myths">creation myth</a> of the <a href="Heliopolis%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">Heliopolitan</a> form of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Ancient Egyptian religion</a>.

The monument was used as a stone quarry from the New Kingdom period onwards, but was later preserved from further damages as its appearance of a rough unfinished and abandoned pyramid did not attract the attention of tomb robbers.

Works on the mortuary temple in which the funerary cult of the deceased king was to take place had not even started when Neferefe died. In the short 70-day period allowed between a king's death and his burial, Neferefre's successor—possibly the ephemeral Shepseskare—built a small limestone chapel. It was located on the pyramid base platform, in the gap left between the masonry and the platform edge, where the pyramid casing would have been put in the original plans. This small chapel was completed during Nyuserre's reign. This pharaoh also built a larger mortuary temple for his brother Neferefre, extending over the whole length of the pyramid side but built of cheaper <a href="mudbrick">mudbrick</a>.
The temple entrance comprised a courtyard adorned with two stone and 24 wooden columns. Behind was the earliest <a href="Hypostyle">hypostyle hall</a> of Ancient Egypt the remains of which can still be detected, its roof supported by wooden columns in the shape of lotus-clusters resting on limestone bases. This hall was possibly inspired by the royal palaces of the time. The structure housed a large wooden statue of the king as well as statues of prisoners of war. Storage rooms for the offerings were located to the north of the hall. In these rooms several statues of Neferefre were discovered, including six heads of the kings, making Neferefre the Fifth Dynasty king with the most surviving statues. East of the main hall was the "<a href="Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Knife">Sanctuary of the Knife</a>" which served as a slaughterhouse for the rituals. Two narrow rooms on either sides of the central altar in front of the <a href="false%20door">false door</a> in the main hall may have housed long <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20solar%20ships">solar boats</a> similar to <a href="Khufu%20ship">Khufu's</a>.

A significant cache of administrative papyri, comparable in size to the Abusir Papyri found in the temples of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was discovered in a storeroom of the mortuary temple of Neferere during a 1982 <a href="Charles%20University%20in%20Prague">University of Prague</a> Egyptological Institute excavation. The presence of this cache is due to the peculiar historical circumstances of the mid-Fifth Dynasty. As both Neferirkare and Neferefre died before their pyramid complexes could be finished, Nyuserre altered their planned layout, diverting the causeway leading to Neferirkare's pyramid to his own. This meant that Neferefre's and Neferirkare's mortuary complexes became somewhat isolated on the Abusir plateau. Their priests therefore had to live next to the temple premises in makeshift dwellings, and they stored the administrative records onsite. In contrast, the records of other temples were kept in the pyramid town close to Sahure's or Nyuserre's pyramid, where the current level of ground water means any papyrus has long since disappeared.

Fragments of <a href="mummy">mummy</a> wrappings and <a href="cartonnage">cartonnage</a>, as well as scattered pieces of human remains, were discovered on the east side of the burial chamber of the pyramid. The remains amounted to a left hand, a left <a href="clavicle">clavicle</a> still covered with skin, fragments of skin probably from the forehead, upper eyelid and the left foot and a few bones.
These remains were in the same <a href="Stratigraphy%20%28archaeology%29">archaeological layer</a> as broken pieces from a red granite <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> as well as what remained of the funerary equipment of the king, hinting that they could indeed belong to Neferefre. This was further corroborated by subsequent studies of the embalming techniques used on the mummy, found to be compatible with an Old Kingdom date.

The body of the king was probably dried by means of <a href="natron">natron</a> and then covered with a thin layer of resin, before being given a white <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> coating. There is no evidence of brain removal as expected from post-Old Kingdom mummification techniques. A final confirmation of the identity of the mummy is provided by <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a>, which yielded a 2628–2393 BC interval for the human remains in close correspondence with estimated dates for the Fifth Dynasty. Thus, Neferefre is, with <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a>, one of the very few Old Kingdom pharaohs whose mummy has been identified.
A <a href="Bioarchaeology">bioarchaeological</a> analysis of Neferefre's remains revealed that the king did not partake in strenuous work, died in his early twenties at between 20 and 23 years old and that he may have stood to in height.
The remains of a second individual were discovered in the burial chamber, but those proved to belong to an individual from the <a href="Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>, who likely lived during the 14th century AD. He had simply been laid on rags and covered with sand for his burial.

Following a tradition established by <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a>, founder of the Fifth Dynasty, Neferefre planned or built a temple to the sun god Ra. Called "Hotep-Re" by the Ancient Egyptians, meaning "Ra is content" or "Ra's offering table", the temple has not yet been located but is presumably in the vicinity of Neferefre's pyramid in Abusir. It is known solely from inscriptions discovered in the mastaba of Ti in North Saqqara, where it is mentioned four times. Ti served as an administration official in the pyramid and sun temples of Sahure, Neferirkare and Nyuserre.

Given Neferefre's very short reign, the lack of attestations of the "Hotep-Re" beyond the mastaba of Ti, as well as the lack of priests having served in the temple, Verner proposes that the temple might never have been completed and therefore never functioned as such. Rather it might have been integrated to or its materials reused for the "Shesepibre", the sun temple built by Neferefre's probable younger brother, Nyuserre. Incidentally, an earlier discovery by the German archaeological expedition of 1905 under the direction of <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20von%20Bissing">Friedrich Wilhelm von Bissing</a> may vindicate Verner's theory. This expedition uncovered the ruins of large buildings of mudbricks beneath the sun temple of Nyuserre in <a href="Abu%20Gorab">Abu Gorab</a>. It is possible that these represent the remains of the sun temple of Neferefre, although in the absence of inscriptions confirming this identification, it remains conjectural.

When he ascended the throne, Neferefre faced the task of completing the pyramid of his father which, with a square base side of and a height of , is the largest built during the Fifth Dynasty. Although well underway at the death of Neferirkare, the pyramid was lacking its external limestone cladding and the accompanying mortuary temple still had to be built. Neferefre thus started to cover the pyramid surface with limestone and build the foundation of a stone temple on the pyramid's eastern side. His plans were cut short by his death and the duty of finishing the monument fell on Nyuserre's shoulders, who abandoned the task of covering the pyramid face and instead concentrated on building the mortuary temple in bricks and wood.

Like other pharaohs of the Old Kingdom period, Neferefre benefited from a funerary cult established at his death. Some details of this cult as it occurred during the Fifth Dynasty have survived in the Abusir Papyri. A 10-day yearly festival was held in honor of the deceased ruler during which, on at least one occasion, no less than 130 bulls were sacrificed in the slaughter house of his mortuary temple. The act of mass animal sacrifice testifies to the importance that royal funerary cults had in Ancient Egyptian society, and also shows that vast agricultural resources were devoted to an activity judged unproductive by Verner, something they propose possibly contributed to the decline of the Old Kingdom. The main benefactors of these sacrifices were the cult's priests, who consumed the offerings after the required ceremonies.

The funerary cult of Neferefre seems to have ceased at the end of the Old Kingdom or during the <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a>. Traces of a possible revival of the cult during the later <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a> are scant and ambiguous. During the <a href="Twelfth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twelfth Dynasty</a>, a certain Khuyankh was buried in the funerary temple of Neferefre. It remains unclear if this was to associate himself closely with the deceased ruler or because other cultic activities in the area constrained the choice of location for Khuyankh's tomb.

New Orleans Mint

The New Orleans Mint () operated in <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>, as a branch <a href="mint%20%28facility%29">mint</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> from 1838 to 1861 and from 1879 to 1909. During its years of operation, it produced over 427 million <a href="gold">gold</a> and <a href="silver">silver</a> coins of nearly every <a href="United%20States%20coinage">American denomination</a>, with a total face value of over <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a> 307 million. It was closed during most of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> and <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a>.

After it was decommissioned as a mint, the building has served a variety of purposes, including as an <a href="assay%20office">assay office</a>, a <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> storage facility, and a <a href="fallout%20shelter">fallout shelter</a>.

Since 1981 it has served as a branch of the <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Museum">Louisiana State Museum</a>. Damaged by <a href="Hurricane%20Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a> in 2005, after over two years of repairs and renovations, the museum reopened in October 2007.

Exhibits include instruments used by some of New Orleans' notable <a href="jazz">jazz</a> musicians, photographs, and posters, now part of the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Jazz%20Museum">New Orleans Jazz Museum</a>. The site is also a performance venue for jazz concerts, in partnership with the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Jazz%20National%20Historical%20Park">New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park</a> and the private Music at the Mint organization.

The Louisiana Historical Center is located on the third floor of the building. The center includes collections of colonial-era manuscripts and maps, and primary and secondary source materials in a wide range of media. It is open to anyone with an interest in Louisiana history and culture.

The New Orleans Mint has been designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, and it is the oldest extant structure to have served as a U.S. Mint. Along with the <a href="Charlotte%20Mint">Charlotte Mint</a>, it is one of two former mint facilities in the U.S. to house an <a href="art%20gallery">art gallery</a>.

The rapidly growing United States in the early 1830s experienced a shortage of coins. It is estimated that in 1830 there was one small silver coin (quarter, dime or half dime) per person. Also, production of silver dollars was suspended in 1804 because they were being exchanged for underweight Spanish coins in the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>. That left the half-dollar as the largest denomination of circulating coin being minted in the U. S. Foreign coins were being circulated in the U. S. to alleviate the shortage. The <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> had been the only U. S. mint until 1838, when operations began at the first branch mints. 
In 1832 <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> had <a href="veto">veto</a>ed a rechartering of the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second Bank of the United States</a>, an institution which he felt extended <a href="credit%20%28finance%29">credit</a> to <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">northeastern</a> commercial <a href="business%20magnate">tycoons</a> at the expense of the ordinary frontiersmen of the <a href="South%20Central%20United%20States">Old Southwest</a>, a region with which Jackson, a <a href="Tennessee">Tennessean</a>, strongly identified. In 1836 Jackson had issued an <a href="executive%20order%20%28United%20States%29">executive order</a> called the <a href="Specie%20Circular">Specie Circular</a> which demanded that all land transactions in the United States be conducted in cash. Both of these actions, combined with the economic depression following the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a> (caused partly by Jackson's fiscal policies) increased the domestic need for minted money.

As a result, in 1835 the <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Federal Government</a> established three branch mints: the <a href="Charlotte%20Mint">Charlotte Mint</a> in North Carolina, the <a href="Dahlonega%20Mint">Dahlonega Mint</a> in Georgia and the New Orleans Mint. Dahlonega and Charlotte were in gold mining regions and these mints produced only gold coins. New Orleans was selected because of the city's strategic location along the Mississippi River which made it a vitally important center for commercial activity, including the export of cotton from the area's plantations. Large quantities of gold from <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> also passed through <a href="Port%20of%20New%20Orleans">its port</a> annually.

In the early 19th century, New Orleans, which was the fifth-largest city in the United States until the Civil War, conducted more foreign trade than any other city in the nation. It was also located relatively near to gold deposits recently discovered in <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>. While the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> produced a substantial quantity of coinage, in the early 19th century it could not disperse the money swiftly to the far regions of the new nation, particularly the South and <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">West</a>. In contrast to the other two Southern branch mints, which only minted gold coinage, the New Orleans Mint produced both gold and silver coins, and in much greater quantities and total value, which marked it as the most important branch mint in the country until the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco Mint</a> began minting a large monetary value of gold coins in the mid 1850s.

The Mint's location occupies a prominent place in civic history. It sits at one of the two <a href="Mississippi%20River">River</a> corners of the <a href="French%20Quarter">French Quarter</a>, which had been the entire city, or "Vieux Carré", of New Orleans. Under <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20France%29">French</a> and <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20Spain%29">Spanish</a> rule this location was home to one of the city's defensive <a href="fortification">fortification</a>s. In 1792 the Spanish governor, <a href="Francisco%20Luis%20H%C3%A9ctor%20de%20Carondelet">Francisco Luis Héctor de Carondelet</a>, erected Fort San Carlos (later <a href="Fort%20St.%20Charles">Fort St. Charles</a>) here. The fort was demolished in 1821; and the nearby area was later named <a href="Jackson%20Square%20%28New%20Orleans%29">Jackson Square</a> in honor of Andrew Jackson. As a general in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, Jackson's leadership had saved the city from invading <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">British</a> forces during December 1814 and through January 8, 1815, the date of the famous <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Orleans">Battle of New Orleans</a>, the last significant battle of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

The Mint building, which was constructed in red brick, was designed by architect <a href="William%20Strickland%20%28architect%29">William Strickland</a> in the <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Greek Revival</a> style, like most 19th-century public buildings in the United States. Strickland was a student of the architect <a href="Benjamin%20Latrobe">Benjamin Latrobe</a>, a disciple of <a href="Neoclassical%20architecture">Neoclassicism</a> who had helped design the <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">United States Capitol</a> building in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> Strickland himself, based in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, had already designed the Philadelphia Mint building and the Second Bank of the United States, and would design the <a href="Charlotte%20Mint">Charlotte</a> and <a href="Dahlonega%20Mint">Dahlonega</a> facilities, making him the architect of the first four U.S. mint buildings. <a href="Martin%20Gordon%20%28Louisiana%29">Martin Gordon</a> supervised the building's construction, which was undertaken by <a href="Benjamin%20F.%20Fox">Benjamin F. Fox</a>, the master carpenter and joiner, and <a href="John%20Mitchell%20%28mason%29">John Mitchell</a>, the master <a href="stonemasonry">stonemason</a> and builder.

On the north <a href="facade">façade</a> the mint building features a central projecting <a href="Ionic%20order">Ionic</a> <a href="portico">portico</a>, supported by four monumental columns that are flanked at the ends by square <a href="column">pillars</a>. The top of the portico contains a simple <a href="entablature">entablature</a>, crowned by a flat roof in front of a simple, unadorned <a href="pediment">pediment</a>. This entrance, which sits on top of a basement story, fronts the rectangular central core of the facility and is flanked by two large wings of multiple <a href="bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a> of rectangular windows. These wings wrap around the central rectangular core to form a "W"-shaped structure with two square <a href="courtyard">courtyard</a>s at the rear. <a href="Balcony">Balconies</a> framed by <a href="wrought%20iron">iron railings</a> and posts adorn the sections of the building's south façade that adjoin the courtyards. Architectural historian <a href="Talbot%20Hamlin">Talbot Hamlin</a> described it thus: "it has those graceful, original proportions so characteristic of Strickland's work. Even today [1944], condemned to a use so different from that for which it was designed, it remains one of the most distinguished of the earlier buildings of New Orleans."

On the interior, Strickland placed the grand staircase that connects the three levels immediately behind the portico in the central core of the structure. The floor system is composed of fired-clay jack arches supported on steel I-beams, a common feature of warehouses and other long-span structures. On the second floor, many of the larger rooms, which were used for coining and melting, contain ceilings with beautiful high arches supported by the walls and freestanding <a href="pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a>. The smaller rectangular rooms on the second level (and the basement), such as the former <a href="Management">superintendent's</a> office, also contain these arched ceilings with a single <a href="groin%20vault">groin vault</a>. The basement formerly contained the <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s inside a brick cage, but now contain museum exhibits devoted to the minting processes as well as the Coin Vault at the Mint, a coin shop.

Strickland did not take into account the swampy lowland and high <a href="water%20table">water table</a> that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint building has encountered numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its <a href="foundation%20%28architecture%29">foundation</a>. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a> engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) <a href="P.%20G.%20T.%20Beauregard">Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard</a> to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling and install <a href="masonry">masonry</a> flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain <a href="Johnson%20K.%20Duncan">Johnson K. Duncan</a> by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to <a href="steam%20engine">steam power</a> so a <a href="flue%20gas%20stack">smokestack</a> (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.

Less than two years later, Beauregard would rise to national fame as the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> <a href="Ranks%20and%20insignia%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">general</a> who ordered the April 1861 assault on <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a> harbor, <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>, thus beginning the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. It was during the war that Beauregard would secure his place in American history as one of the Confederacy's most capable generals.

Like any other mint the New Orleans Mint was a factory to make coins. Operations at the New Orleans Mint began on March 8, 1838, with the <a href="deposit%20account">deposit</a> of the first Mexican gold <a href="precious%20metal">bullion</a>. The first coins, 30 <a href="dime%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">dimes</a>, were struck on May 7. Until it was taken over by the Confederacy in 1861 it produced many different denominations, all of which were either silver or gold: silver <a href="three-cent%20piece%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">three-cent pieces</a> (1851 only), <a href="half%20dime">half dime</a>s, dimes, <a href="quarter%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">quarters</a>, <a href="half%20dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">half dollars</a>, <a href="dollar%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">silver dollars</a>, <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a>s, $2.50 <a href="Quarter%20Eagle">quarter eagles</a>, <a href="three-dollar%20piece">three-dollar piece</a>s, $5 <a href="half-eagle">half-eagle</a>s, $10 <a href="eagle%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">eagles</a>, and $20 <a href="Double%20Eagle">double eagles</a>.

Many interesting characters served at the Mint during the early years of operation. One was <a href="John%20Leonard%20Riddell">John Leonard Riddell</a>, who served as melter and <a href="refining">refiner</a> at the Mint from 1839 to 1848, and, outside of his job, pursued interests in botany, medicine, chemistry, geology, and physics. He invented the binocular <a href="optical%20microscope">microscope</a>. He also wrote on <a href="numismatics">numismatics</a>, publishing in 1845 a book entitled "Monograph of the Silver Dollar, Good and Bad, Illustrated With Facsimile Figures", and two years later an article by him appeared in "<a href="DeBow%27s%20Review">DeBow's Review</a>" called "The Mint at New Orleans—Processes Pursued of Working the Precious Metals—Statistics of Coinage, etc." Riddell was not held in high esteem by everyone, however: his conflicts with other Mint employees were well-documented, and at one point he was accused of being unable to properly conduct a gold melt.

Throughout the 19th century the New Orleans Mint was frequently featured in magazines, newspapers and other print publications. Articles discussing and images picturing the Mint, in addition to the one by Riddell noted above, were featured in "<a href="Ballou%27s%20Pictorial%20Drawing-Room%20Companion">Ballou's Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion</a>", published in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, and the widely circulated "<a href="Harper%27s%20Weekly">Harper's Weekly</a>".

The New Orleans Mint operated continuously from 1838 until January 26, 1861, when Louisiana <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">seceded</a> from the United States. On January 29, the Secession Convention reconvened at New Orleans (it had earlier met in <a href="Baton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana">Baton Rouge</a>) and passed an ordinance that allowed Federal employees to remain in their posts, but as employees of the state of Louisiana. On February 5, 1861, during the proceedings of the Convention of the State of Louisiana in New Orleans, the committee appointed by the Convention to take an inventory on February 1, 1861, of public property in the hands of the officers of 'the late' Federal government reported that the Sub-Treasurer's vault at the mint contained $483,983 in gold and silver coins. The National Archives records in Rockville, Maryland, indicate the $483,983 consisted of $308,771 in gold coins and $175,212.08 in silver coins. The only gold coin produced in January, 1861 was the $20 gold double-eagle. This means 15,438 $20 gold coins were minted by the New Orleans Mint during January, 1861. Mint coinage records for the $20 1861-O gold double-eagle indicate only 5,000 $20 gold pieces were minted by the Federal Government in January, 1861. This discrepancy is explained in a Numismatist Journal article.

In March 1861, Louisiana accepted the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Constitution">Confederate States Constitution</a> and the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> government retained all the mint officers. They used it briefly as their own coinage facility. The Confederates struck 962,633 of the 2,532,633 New Orleans half-dollar coins dated 1861. Research suggests that 1861-O half dollars bearing a bisected date die crack ("WB-103") and 1861-O half-dollars with a "speared olive bud" anomaly ("WB-104") on the reverse had been minted under authority of the Confederacy. Confederate officials designed alternate reverse <a href="die%20%28manufacturing%29">dies</a> which they used to strike <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America%20dollar%23Coinage">their own half-dollars</a> in New Orleans (see image). The exact number of the half-dollar coins struck by the Confederate mint with the alternate reverse is unknown; but only four are known to exist today. One of them, which was sold at auction for a large sum, had once been owned by <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>, the only <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">President of the C.S.A.</a>

Confederate minting operations continued from April 1 until the <a href="Gold%20bullion">bullion</a> ran out later that month. The staff remained on duty until May 31, 1861. After that the mint was used for quartering <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate troops</a>, until it was <a href="Capture%20of%20New%20Orleans">recaptured</a> along with the rest of the city the following year, largely by <a href="Union%20Navy">Union naval forces</a> under the command of Admiral <a href="David%20Farragut">David Farragut</a>.

For many Southern sympathizers, the Mint soon became a symbol of their hatred for the Union occupation. After <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marines</a> under Farragut had raised the U.S. flag on the roof of the Mint in April 1862, a professional steamboat gambler named <a href="William%20Bruce%20Mumford">William Bruce Mumford</a> ascended the roof and tore the flag down. He ripped the banner into shreds, and defiantly stuffed pieces of it into his shirt to wear as souvenirs. Union General <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin Franklin Butler</a>, the military governor of New Orleans (who was soon to be derisively nicknamed "Spoons" for allegedly pocketing the silverware of New Orleans citizens arrested for treason against the United States), ordered Mumford executed in retaliation. And so, Mumford was hanged from a flagstaff projecting horizontally from the building on June 7, 1862. Mumford's hanging made national headlines. Jefferson Davis demanded that Butler immediately be executed if captured. The event stuck in the minds of many New Orleanians: eleven years later, in 1873, a visitor to the city named Edward King mentioned it in his description of the structure.

The mint reopened as an <a href="assay%20office">assay office</a> in 1876. Its machinery was evidently damaged during the war, but because of its importance, unlike the mints at Charlotte and Dahlonega, in 1877 U.S. Mint agent James R. Snowden asked the superintendent of the office, Dr. M. F. Bonzano, to report on the condition of the facility for minting. Upon receipt of Bonzano's report, new minting equipment was shipped to New Orleans. The building was refurbished and put back into active minting service in 1879, producing mainly silver coinage, including the famed <a href="Morgan%20Dollar">Morgan silver dollar</a> from 1879 to 1904.

The refurbishment and recommissioning of the New Orleans Mint was due partly to the fact that in 1878 the Federal government in Washington, D.C. had passed the <a href="Bland%E2%80%93Allison%20Act">Bland–Allison Act</a>, which mandated the purchase and coining of a large quantity of silver yearly. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury Department</a> needed additional facilities to do so. It reopened the New Orleans facility primarily to coin large quantities of silver dollars, most of which were simply stored in the building instead of circulated. President <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> appointed former <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senator</a> and governor <a href="Henry%20S.%20Foote">Henry S. Foote</a> the new superintendent of the mint.

During this second period of operation, the Mint also struck dimes, quarters, half dollars, $5 half eagles, $10 eagles and, in 1879 only, 2,325 double eagles. It should also be noted that the New Orleans Mint was used by the Federal authorities in 1907 to coin over five and a half million silver <a href="Mexican%20peso%23History">twenty-centavo</a> pieces for the Mexican government as part of the American government's program of producing foreign coinage. The New Orleans Mint, whose coins can be identified by the "O" <a href="mint%20mark">mint mark</a> found on the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> of its coinage, earned a reputation for producing coins of a mediocre quality; their luster is usually not as brilliant as those of other mints, and center areas tend to be flattened and not sharply struck. Thus, well-struck New Orleanian coinage is prized in the numismatic world today.

 Men made up the majority of the workers at the mint. They worked such jobs as coiners, melters, pressers, cutters, and rollers. The mint was overseen by a superintendent, who was always male. He was a political appointee whose term usually did not last much longer than the <a href="List%20of%20political%20parties%20in%20the%20United%20States">party</a> which held the presidency remained in power.

But it was also during the mint's second tour of duty that women began to find work at the New Orleans Mint. Several women workers were sent from the Philadelphia Mint to teach those in New Orleans how to adjust money. About this time, the mint employed forty-four women. Thirty-nine worked as adjusters – employees who weighed the unstamped coin <a href="planchet">planchet</a>s to make sure they were the proper weight before coining. These women would sit at long narrow tables, filing the planchets down to the proper weight, wearing special aprons with pouches attached to the sleeves and the waist to catch the excess dust. Five women served as counters and packers before the coins were shipped to Washington, D.C. Some women were eventually employed at the coining presses.

The women worked from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working conditions were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost attention to the <a href="weighing%20scale">scales'</a> balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief from the heat and avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers in the late nineteenth century.

By the early twentieth century, the U.S. Treasury had mints operating in New Orleans, <a href="Denver%20Mint">Denver</a>, <a href="San%20Francisco%20Mint">San Francisco</a>, and the main center in Philadelphia, which more than met the demand for minted money. In 1904, the government ceased the minting of the silver dollar, which accounted for the bulk of the coinage the New Orleans branch had been producing since 1879. In 1909 Treasury officials declined to appropriate funds for the mint's operation, effectively halting subsequent minting activity in New Orleans. In 1911, the New Orleans Mint was formally decommissioned and the machinery was transferred to the main U. S. Mint facility in Philadelphia.

Twenty years later, in <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201930">1930</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Louisiana">Governor</a> <a href="Huey%20Long">Huey Long</a> would rail against this loss when he ran for the office of U.S. Senator against incumbent <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Ransdell">Joseph E. Ransdell</a>. In a circular distributed by his campaign to the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy service record in the Senate. Long went on to win the election, although he did not take office until his term as governor expired in 1932. At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.

After the mint closed, it performed a variety of functions for the Federal government. It was first downgraded to an assay office for the U.S. Treasury as it had been from 1876 to 1879. Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Prisons">Federal prison</a>, in which capacity it served until 1943. The <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Guard">Coast Guard</a> then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, when many believed there to be a high risk of nuclear war, the old Mint was considered to be the best <a href="fallout%20shelter">fallout shelter</a> in the city.

The state agreed to save the structure from demolition on the condition that it be renovated and converted to some new purpose within fifteen years. Between 1978 and 1980 this goal was met. Since 1981, the Mint building has functioned as a museum of its coin production history. Additional exhibitions housed in the facility have been devoted to <a href="New%20Orleans%20Mardi%20Gras">New Orleans Mardi Gras</a> (since moved to <a href="the%20Presbytere">the Presbytere</a> building on <a href="Jackson%20Square%20%28New%20Orleans%29">Jackson Square</a>), <a href="jazz">jazz</a> music (a large exhibit and research materials previously in the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Jazz%20Museum">New Orleans Jazz Museum</a> – donated by the N.O. Jazz Club), and <a href="Newcomb%20Pottery">Newcomb Pottery</a>. All three phenomena have contributed to New Orleans' fame.

On the third floor, the Mint houses an archive of maps and documents, including French and Spanish colonial records. Along with <a href="the%20Cabildo">the Cabildo</a>, the Presbytere, the <a href="1850%20House">1850 House</a>, and <a href="Madame%20John%27s%20Legacy">Madame John's Legacy</a>, this facility is one of five branches of the <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Museum">Louisiana State Museum</a> in the <a href="French%20Quarter">French Quarter</a>.
The Mint building is located at 400 <a href="Esplanade%20Avenue%2C%20New%20Orleans">Esplanade Avenue</a>, not far from the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>.

The mint building suffered significant roof damage from the hurricane. Water entered the building and came into contact with approximately 3% of the New Orleans Jazz collection, portions of which were removed and cared for at <a href="Louisiana%20State%20University">Louisiana State University</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Louisiana%20at%20Lafayette">University of Louisiana at Lafayette</a>, and the <a href="Louisiana%20State%20Archive%20and%20Research%20Library">Louisiana State Archives</a>.

Nyuserre Ini

Nyuserre Ini (also Niuserre Ini or Neuserre Ini; in <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> known as Rathurês, "´Ραθούρης") was an <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ian <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>, the sixth ruler of the <a href="Fifth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty</a> during the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> period. He is credited with a reign of 24 to 35 years depending on the scholar, and likely lived in the second half of the 25th century BCE. Nyuserre was the younger son of <a href="Neferirkare%20Kakai">Neferirkare Kakai</a> and queen <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>, and the brother of the short-lived king <a href="Neferefre">Neferefre</a>. He may have succeeded his brother directly, as indicated by much later historical sources. Alternatively, <a href="Shepseskare">Shepseskare</a> may have reigned between the two as advocated by <a href="Miroslav%20Verner">Miroslav Verner</a>, albeit only for a few weeks or months at the most. The relation of Shepseskare with Neferefre and Nyuserre remains highly uncertain. Nyuserre was in turn succeeded by <a href="Menkauhor%20Kaiu">Menkauhor Kaiu</a>, who could have been his nephew and a son of Neferefre.

Nyuserre was the most prolific builder of his dynasty, having built three pyramids <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Nyuserre">for himself</a> and his queens and a further three for his father, mother and brother, all in the necropolis of <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a>. He built the largest surviving <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">temple</a> to the sun god <a href="Ra">Ra</a> constructed during the Old Kingdom, named "Shesepibre" or "Joy of the heart of Ra". He also completed the "Nekhenre", the <a href="Sun%20temple%20of%20Userkaf">Sun temple of Userkaf</a> in <a href="Abu%20Gorab">Abu Gorab</a>, and the valley temple of <a href="Menkaure">Menkaure</a> in Giza. In doing so, he was the first king since <a href="Shepseskaf">Shepseskaf</a>, last ruler of the <a href="Fourth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fourth Dynasty</a>, to pay attention to the <a href="Giza%20pyramid%20complex">Giza necropolis</a>, a move which may have been an attempt to legitimise his rule following the troubled times surrounding the unexpected death of his brother Neferefre.

There is little evidence for military action during Nyuserre's reign; the Egyptian state continued to maintain trade relations with <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> on the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>ine coast and to send mining and quarrying expeditions to <a href="Sinai">Sinai</a> and <a href="Lower%20Nubia">Lower Nubia</a>. Nyuserre's reign saw the growth of the administration, and the effective birth of the <a href="nomarch">nomarch</a>s, provincial governors who, for the first time, were sent to live in the provinces they administered rather than at the pharaoh's court.

As with other Old Kingdom pharaohs, Nyuserre benefited from a funerary cult established at his death. In Nyuserre's case, this official state-sponsored cult existed for centuries, surviving the chaotic <a href="First%20Intermediate%20Period">First Intermediate Period</a> and lasting until the <a href="Twelfth%20Dynasty">Twelfth Dynasty</a> of the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>. In parallel, a spontaneous popular cult appeared, with people venerating Nyuserre under his birth name "Iny". In this cult, Nyuserre played a role similar to that of a saint, being invoked as an intercessor between the believer and the gods. It left little archaeological evidence and seems to have continued until the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a>, nearly 1000 years after his death.

Nyuserre Ini is well attested in sources contemporaneous with his reign, for example in the tombs of some of his contemporaries including Nyuserre's manicurists <a href="Khnumhotep%20and%20Niankhkhnum">Khnumhotep and Niankhkhnum</a>, the high officials <a href="Khufukhaf%20II">Khufukhaf II</a>, Ty, <a href="Rashepses">Rashepses</a>, Neferefre-ankh and Khabawptah, and the priests of his funerary cult Nimaatsed and Kaemnefert.

Nyuserre is attested in three ancient Egyptian king lists, all dating to the <a href="New%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">New Kingdom</a>. The earliest of these is the <a href="Karnak%20king%20list">Karnak king list</a>, which was commissioned by <a href="Thutmose%20III">Thutmose III</a> (fl. 1479–1425 BCE) to honour some of his forebears and which mentions Nyuserre in the fourth entry, which shows his birth name "Iny" in a <a href="cartouche">cartouche</a>. Nyuserre's <a href="Prenomen%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">prenomen</a> occupies the 30th entry of the <a href="Abydos%20King%20List">Abydos King List</a>, written nearly 200 years later during the reign of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a> (fl. 1290–1279 BCE). Nyuserre's prenomen was most likely also given on the <a href="Turin%20King%20List">Turin canon</a> (third column, 22nd row), dating to the reign of <a href="Ramses%20II">Ramses II</a> (fl. 1279–1213 BCE), but it has since been lost in a large lacuna affecting the document. Fragments of his reign length are still visible on the papyrus, indicating a reign of somewhere between 11 and 34 years. Nyuserre is the only Fifth Dynasty king absent from the <a href="Saqqara%20Tablet">Saqqara Tablet</a>.

Nyuserre was also mentioned in the "<a href="Aegyptiaca">Aegyptiaca</a>", a history of Egypt probably written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> (fl. 283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>. Even though no copies of the text survive, it is known through later <a href="Epitome">writings</a> by <a href="Sextus%20Julius%20Africanus">Sextus Julius Africanus</a> and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>. In particular, Africanus relates that the "Aegyptiaca" mentioned a pharaoh "´Ραθούρης", that is "Rathurês", reigning for forty-four years as the sixth king of the Fifth Dynasty. "Rathurês" is believed to be the <a href="Hellenised">Hellenised</a> form of "Nyuserre".

Two competing hypotheses exist in Egyptology to describe the succession of events running from the death of Neferirkare Kakai, the third king of the Fifth Dynasty, to the coronation of Nyuserre Ini, the sixth ruler of the dynasty. Relying on historical sources, where Nyuserre is said to have directly succeeded Neferefre, many Egyptologists such as <a href="J%C3%BCrgen%20von%20Beckerath">Jürgen von Beckerath</a> and <a href="Hartwig%20Altenm%C3%BCller">Hartwig Altenmüller</a> have traditionally believed that the following succession took place: Neferirkare Kakai → Shepseskare → Neferefre → Nyuserre Ini. In this scenario, Neferefre is the father of Nyuserre, who would have become pharaoh after Neferefre's unexpected death. Neferefre would be the successor of <a href="Shepseskare">Shepseskare</a>, credited with seven years of reign, as indicated in Manetho's "Aegyptiaca".

This view was challenged, most notably by <a href="Miroslav%20Verner">Miroslav Verner</a> in 2000 and 2001, following excavations of the Abusir necropolis, which indicated that Neferefre's purported predecessor Shepseskare most likely reigned for only a few months between Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini. Verner proposes that the royal succession was Neferirkare Kakai → Neferefre → Shepseskare → Nyuserre Ini. In support of this hypothesis is Verner's observation that Neferefre and Nyuserre were very likely full brothers, both sons of Neferirkare Kakai, There is also evidence that Neferefre was Neferirkare's eldest son and in his early twenties at the death of his father, and thus would have been likely to inherit the throne. These observations, in addition to further archaeological evidence such as the lack of a pyramid of Shepseskare and the position of Neferefre's own, convinced Verner that Neferefre directly succeeded his father, dying after a very short reign of about two years.

Nyuserre was then still a child and, in this hypothesis, his claim to the throne faced a serious challenge in the person of his possible uncle Shepseskare who might have been a son of Sahure. Alternatively, Shepseskare may have been a short-lived son of Neferefre or, less likely, an usurper from outside the royal family. In any case, Shepseskare apparently succeeded in holding the crown for a short time. Nyuserre ultimately prevailed however, either because of Shepseskare's own premature death or because he was backed by powerful high officials and members of the royal family, foremost among whom were his mother <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a> and <a href="Ptahshepses">Ptahshepses</a>. This latter hypothesis is motivated by the exalted positions that both individuals seem to have enjoyed. The mortuary temple of Khentkaus II was designed to imitate that of a king, for example by incorporating its own satellite pyramid and having an alignment on an east-west axis. These features, together with Khentkaus II peculiar title of "Mwt Nisw bity Nisw bity", originally translated by "Mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt [exercising office as] the king of Upper and Lower Egypt" led some scholars, including Verner, to propose that she might even have reigned in her own right. This hypothesis is now deemed unlikely, and her title is rather translated as "Mother of two kings of Upper and Lower Egypt". Ptahshepses became vizier under Nyuserre, whose daughter he married; received the honorary title of "King's son"; and was buried in one of the largest private tombs in Egypt. According to Verner and Nigel Strudwick, the architectural elements of this tomb such as its lotus-bud columns similar to those used in Nyuserre's own temple, boat pits and layout of the burial chamber, demonstrate "the favor shown by that king to his son-in-law".

Manetho's "Aegyptiaca" related that Nyuserre reigned for 44 years, a figure which is rejected by Egyptologists, who rather credit him with about three decades of reign owing to the paucity of secure dates for his rule. 
The entry of the Turin canon pertaining to Nyuserre is damaged and the duration of his rule is difficult to read with certainty. Following <a href="Alan%20Gardiner">Alan Gardiner</a>'s 1959 study of the canon, scholars such as Nigel Strudwick credited Nyuserre with 11 years of reign. Gardiner's reading of the canon was then reevaluated from <a href="facsimile">facsimile</a>s, yielding a 24 to 25 years figure for Nyuserre's reign. This duration is accepted by some scholars including <a href="Nicolas%20Grimal">Nicolas Grimal</a>. More recent analyses of the original papyrus conducted by <a href="Kim%20Ryholt">Kim Ryholt</a> have shown that Nyuserre's reign length as reported on the document could equally be 11–14, 21–24, or 31–34 years. The later figure is now favoured by Egyptologists including Strudwick and Verner.

The view that Nyuserre reigned in excess of twenty years is furthermore supported by archaeological evidence, which points to a fairly long reign for him. Verner, who has been excavating the Abusir <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a> on behalf of the <a href="Charles%20University%20in%20Prague">University of Prague</a> since 1976, points in particular to Nyuserre's numerous constructions, amounting to no less than three new pyramids, the completion of a further three, the construction of the largest sun temple built during the Old Kingdom and further smaller works such as the refurbishment of <a href="Menkaure">Menkaure</a>'s mortuary complex.

The hypothesis of a reign more than three decades long for Nyuserre Ini is supported, albeit indirectly, by reliefs discovered in his solar temple showing him participating in a <a href="Sed%20festival">Sed festival</a>. This festival was meant to rejuvenate the king and was normally first celebrated after 30 years of rule. Representations of the festival were part of the typical decorations of temples associated to the king during the Old Kingdom and mere depictions of it do not necessarily imply a long reign. For example, a relief showing <a href="Sahure">Sahure</a> in the tunic of the Sed festival has been found in his mortuary temple, although both historical sources and archeological evidence agree that he ruled Egypt for less than 14 full years. 
Yet, in Nyuserre's case, these reliefs taken together with the archaeological evidence have convinced most Egyptologists that Nyuserre enjoyed over 30 years of reign and that "the sed-festival scenes from Abu Gurab [most probably reflect] the 30th jubilee of the king's accession to the throne".

The reliefs of Nyuserre's "Sed" festival offer a rare glimpse into the ritual acts carried out during this ceremony. In particular, the festival seems to have involved a procession in a barque over a body of water, a detail either not represented or lost in all subsequent representations of the festival until the reign of <a href="Amenhotep%20III">Amenhotep III</a> (fl. c. 1390–1350 BCE), over 1000 years after Nyuserre's lifetime.

The reign of Nyuserre Ini witnessed the unabated growth of the priesthood and state bureaucracy, a phenomenon which had started in the early Fifth Dynasty in particular under Neferirkare Kakai. Changes in the Egyptian administration during this period are manifested by a multiplication in the number of titles, reflecting the creation of new administrative offices. These in turn, reflect a movement to better organise the administration of the state with the new titles corresponding to charges attached to very specific duties.

The king's power slowly weakened as the bureaucracy expanded, although he remained a living god in the eyes of his subjects.This situation went unchecked until the reign of Nyuserre's second successor Djedkare Isesi, who implemented the first comprehensive reforms of the system of ranking titles and thus of the administration.

There are two pieces of direct evidence of administrative activities during Nyuserre's reign. The first is that the Old Kingdom royal annals, of which only <a href="Palermo%20stone">fragments survive</a>, are believed to have been composed during his reign. The annals, which give details on the reigns of kings from the <a href="First%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">First Dynasty</a> onwards on a year-by-year basis, are damaged and break off following the reign of Neferirkare Kakai. The second piece of evidence for administrative activity relates to the provincial administration. During the Old Kingdom, the Egyptian state was divided administratively into provinces, called <a href="Nome%20%28Egypt%29">nomes</a>. These provinces were recognised as such since the time of <a href="Djoser">Djoser</a>, founder of the <a href="Third%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Third Dynasty</a>, and probably harked back to the predynastic kingdoms of the Nile valley. The earliest topographical lists of the nomes of Upper and Lower Egypt date back to the reign of Nyuserre, a procession of personified nomes being depicted on reliefs from Nyuserre's sun temple. It is also around this time that the <a href="nomarch">nomarch</a>s started to reside in their province rather than at the royal residence.

To the north of Egypt, trade contacts with <a href="Byblos">Byblos</a> on the <a href="Levant">Levant</a>ine coast, which existed during much of the Fifth Dynasty, were seemingly active during Nyuserre's reign, as suggested by a fragment of cylindrical alabaster vase bearing his name uncovered in the city.

East of Egypt, Nyuserre commissioned at least one expedition to the <a href="Wadi%20Maghareh">Wadi Maghareh</a> in <a href="Sinai">Sinai</a>, where mines of <a href="copper">copper</a> and <a href="turquoise">turquoise</a> were exploited during much of the Old Kingdom. This expedition left a large rock relief, now in the <a href="Egyptian%20Museum">Egyptian Museum</a> in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>. The relief shows Nyuserre "smiting the Bedouins of all foreign lands, the great god, lord of the two lands". 
At the right of Nyuserre is a dedication to "<a href="Thoth">Thoth</a>, lord of the foreign lands, who has made pure libations". This expedition departed Egypt from the port of <a href="Ain%20Sukhna">Ain Sukhna</a>, on the western shore of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Suez">Gulf of Suez</a>, as revealed by seal impressions bearing Nyuserre's name found on the site. The port comprised large galleries carved into the sandstone serving as living quarters and storage places. The wall of one such gallery was inscribed with a text in ink mentioning the expedition to Sinai and dating it to the year of the second <a href="cattle%20count">cattle count</a>–possibly Nyuserre's fourth year on the throne.

To the south of Egypt, in Lower <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a>, Nyuserre exploited the <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a> quarries of Gebel el-Asr near <a href="Aswan">Aswan</a>, which provided material for buildings and statues, as shown by a fragmentary stone stela inscribed with Nyuserre's Horus name that was discovered in a settlement adjacent to the quarries.

There is little evidence for military action during Nyuserre's reign. William C. Hayes proposed that a few fragmentary limestone statues of kneeling and bound prisoners of war discovered in his mortuary temple possibly attest to punitive raids in Libya to the west or the Sinai and Palestine to the east during his reign. The art historian William Stevenson Smith has pointed out, that such statues were customary elements of the decoration of royal temples and mastabas, suggesting that they may not be immediately related to actual military campaigns. Similar statues and small wooden figures of kneeling captives were discovered in the mortuary complexes of Neferefre, Djedkare Isesi, <a href="Unas">Unas</a>, <a href="Teti">Teti</a>, <a href="Pepi%20I">Pepi I</a> and <a href="Pepi%20II">Pepi II</a> as well as in the tomb of vizier <a href="Senedjemib%20Mehi">Senedjemib Mehi</a>.

Assuming Verner's reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty royal family, Nyuserre Ini faced an enormous task when he ascended the throne: his father, mother and brother had all left their pyramids unfinished, his father's and brother's sun temples were unfinished too and he had to construct his own pyramid as well as those of his queens. 
Nyuserre met this challenge by placing his pyramid in the immediate vicinity of the unfinished ones, on the north-eastern corner of that of Neferirkare Kakai and next to <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Sahure">that of Sahure</a>, thereby concentrating all pyramid building activities in South Abusir, in an area of .
This meant that his pyramid was out of the alignment formed by the preceding ones, limited its size and constrained the layout of his mortuary complex. This would explain why, despite having enjoyed one of the longest reigns of the Fifth Dynasty, Nyuserre's pyramid was smaller than that of his father and closer in size to that of his grandfather Sahure.

Nyuserre built a <a href="pyramid">pyramid</a> for himself at <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a> named "Mensut Nyuserre", meaning "Established are the places of Nyuserre" or "The places of Nyuserre endure".

The completed pyramid was entirely covered in fine limestone. It was about tall, with a base of along each side, a slope of 52 degrees and a total volume of stone of about . The burial chamber and antechamber were both lined with fine limestone as well and roofed with three tiers of gigantic limestone beams long weighing 90 tons each.

The pyramid complex is unusual as the outer sections of the mortuary temple are offset to the south of the eastern side of the complex. This allowed Nyuserre to intercept and complete his father's causeway, which led from the valley temple close to the Nile to the pyramid itself on the desert edge. The valley temple of Nyuserre was thus built on the foundations laid by his father for his own unfinished valley temple. Once completed, it consisted of a portico with eight papyriform columns, its floor was of black <a href="basalt">basalt</a> and its walls were made of limestone with painted reliefs above a <a href="Dado%20%28architecture%29">dado</a> of red granite. The back of the portico led to the causeway, the base of which was entirely covered in basalt, while its upper portions where decorated with numerous reliefs, some showing the king as a sphinx trampling over his enemies. The causeway was roofed by limestone blocks painted in blue with golden stars.
Arriving near the pyramid, the causeway led into a columned courtyard preceded by storage rooms and succeeded by the mortuary temple itself, which housed statues of the king and depictions of the royal family and Nyuserre in the presence of the gods. The wider pyramid complex was enclosed by a wall, with two large rectangular structures on its north-east and south-east corners. Both Lehner and Verner see these as the precursor of the <a href="Pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylon</a>, characteristic of later <a href="Egyptian%20temple">Egyptian temple</a>s. Beyond the main pyramid was a smaller one for the <a href="Ka%20%28Egyptian%20soul%29">Ka</a> of the king.

South of the pyramid of his mother Khentkaus II, Nyuserre built a pyramid for a queen, either a consort of himself or of his brother Neferefre. The pyramid is known today as Lepsius XXIV, after its number in <a href="Karl%20Richard%20Lepsius">Karl Richard Lepsius</a>' pioneering <a href="Lepsius%20list%20of%20pyramids">list of pyramids</a>. It originally reached about high with a base of , its core made of limestone and clay mortar organised in horizontal and accretion layers.

Today the pyramid is heavily ruined, its outer casing of fine white limestone long gone, and it stands only tall. While graffiti left by the builders indicate that the construction of this pyramid dates to the later part of Nyuserre's reign and took place under the direction of vizier Ptahshepses, the name of the queen for whom the pyramid was intended is lost. <a href="Reptynub">Reptynub</a> has been cited as a likely candidate. In the burial chamber, which is reached via a straight north-south passageway, the broken up mummy of a young woman was discovered. She stood around tall and died between 21 and 23 years of age. It is unclear whether the mummy is that of the original owner of the pyramid or dates to a later period as the mummification method employed could suggest. Excavations of the burial chamber yielded fragments of a pink granite sarcophagus as well as pieces of large calcite canopic jars and smaller funerary equipment.

On the eastern side of the pyramid, the ruins of a small satellite pyramid as well as of a mortuary temple have been discovered. Both have been heavily affected by stone robbing, which started as early as the New Kingdom and reached a climax during the <a href="Twenty-sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Saite</a> (664–525 BCE) and <a href="Twenty-seventh%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Persian</a> (525–402 BCE) periods, making a modern reconstruction of the temple layout impossible.

The ruins known today as Lepsius XXV constitute not one but two large adjacent tombs built as a single monument on the south-eastern edge of the Abusir necropolis. The peculiar construction, which Verner has called a "double pyramid", was known to ancient Egyptians as "The Two are Vigilant". The pyramids, both truncated, had rectangular bases of for the eastern one and for the western one, their walls reaching an inclination of about 78 degrees. This means that the construction resembled a pair of mastabas more than a couple of pyramids, in fact so much so that Dušan Magdolen proposed that Lepsius XXV is a mastaba.

A further peculiarity of the structure is the lack of associated mortuary temple. Instead, the eastern tomb boasts a small offering chapel built of undecorated white limestone and situated within the tomb superstructure. Its ceiling reached high. Excavations revealed small pieces of papyrus inscribed with a list of offerings as well as fragments of an alabaster statue of a woman clothed in a simple robe. The burial chamber revealed scant remains of the female owner and a few pieces of funerary equipment.

The western tomb was built subsequently to the eastern one and seems to have served to bury another woman. Builders graffiti uncovered during the Czech excavations demonstrate in all likelihood that the monument was built under Nyuserre, its owners possibly amongst the last members of the broader royal family to be buried in Abusir, the necropolis being abandoned by Nyuserre's successor Menkauhor.

Nyuserre was the penultimate Egyptian pharaoh to build a <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">sun temple</a>. In doing so, he was following a tradition established by Userkaf that reflects the paramount importance of the cult of <a href="Ra">Ra</a> during the Fifth Dynasty. Sun temples built during this period were meant to play for Ra the same role that the pyramid played for the king: they were funerary
temples for the sun god, where his renewal and rejuvenation necessary to maintain the order of the world could take place. Cults performed in the temple were thus primarily concerned with Ra's creator function as well as his role as father of the king. During his lifetime, the king would appoint his closest officials to the running of the temple, allowing them to benefit from the temple's income and thus ensuring their loyalty. After the pharaoh's death, the sun temple's income would be associated with the pyramid complex, supporting Nyuserre's funerary cult.

Located in <a href="Abu%20Gorab">Abu Ghurob</a>, north of Abusir, Nyuserre's sun temple is the largest and best preserved of its kind, leading some Egyptologists such as von Beckerath to see Nyuserre's reign as the peak of the solar cult, an assertion which, according to Grimal, is exaggerated. 
The temple was known as the "Shesepibre" by the Ancient Egyptians, which has been variously translated as "Joy of the heart of <a href="Ra">Re</a>", "Re's Favorite Place", "Delight of Ra", or "Place agreeable to Ra". Curiously, Nyuserre's sun temple was first built in mudbrick, only later to be reconstructed entirely in stone. It is the only such structure to receive this treatment, thanks to which much of the architectural elements and reliefs have survived to this day. While the reason for this renewal remains unclear, Lehner has proposed that it may be related to Nyuserre's "Sed" festival, or to some evolution in the ideology surrounding sun temples.
The temple was entered from the eastern side following a long causeway which departed from a valley temple located closer to the Nile. This temple mostly served as a gateway to the upper temple and housed a pillared portico of mudbrick encased in yellow limestone. The upper temple comprised a large rectangular courtyard entered via five granite doorways located on its eastern side. An altar was located in the center of the courtyard, which can still be seen today. It was constructed from five large blocks of <a href="alabaster">alabaster</a>, one shaped like the <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">hieroglyph</a> for Ra and the others shaped like the glyph for "<a href="hotep">hotep</a>". They were arranged so as to read "Ra Hotep", that is "May Ra be satisfied", from the four cardinal points. The sign for "Hotep" also means "offering" or "offering table" in Ancient Egyptian, so that the altar was literally an offering table to Ra.

At the western end of the rectangular court was a giant <a href="obelisk">obelisk</a>, a symbol of the sun god Ra. It was built on a pedestal with sloping sides and a square top, like a truncated pyramid, which was high and was constructed of limestone and red granite around the base. The obelisk topping it was another high, built entirely of limestone.

The temple was adorned with numerous fine reliefs depicting Nyuserre's "Sed" festival as well as a "chapel of seasons" attached to the obelisk pedestal, decorated with representations of human activities throughout the seasons.

The pyramid of Neferirkare was planned to be significantly larger than that of Neferirkare's Fifth Dynasty predecessors, with a square base side of and a height of . Although well underway at the death of the pharaoh, the pyramid was lacking its external limestone cladding and the accompanying mortuary temple still had to be built. Neferefre had begun covering the pyramid surface with limestone and had built the foundation of a stone temple on the pyramid eastern side; Nyuserre completed their father's pyramid complex, though he did so more parsimoniously than his brother. He abandoned the task of covering the pyramid altogether and finished the mortuary temple with cheaper materials than were normally used for such buildings. Its walls were made of mud-bricks rather than limestone and its floor was of beaten clay. The outer part of the temple was built to comprise a column portico and a pillared court, all columns being made of wood rather than the usual granite.
The temple and pyramid were also surrounded by a brick wall. Likely for reasons of economy, the causeway leading to the mortuary temple at the foot of the pyramid was never built, no satellite pyramid was added to the mortuary complex, and the valley temple was left unfinished. Consequently, the priest of the mortuary cult of Neferirkare lived on the temple premises, in dwellings of mud-bricks and rushes, rather than in the pyramid town closer to the Nile valley.

Construction works on the pyramid of Neferefre had just begun when Neferefre died unexpectedly in his early twenties. At the time of Nyuserre's ascension to the throne, only one step of the core of Neferefre's pyramid had been completed. The substructures, built in a large open pit at the center of the pyramid were possibly unfinished as well. Nyuserre hastily completed the pyramid by transforming it into a stylised primeval mound resembling a mastaba: the walls of the core layer already in place were covered with limestone and the top was filled with clay and stones drawn from the local desert.

The accompanying mortuary temple, which then only comprised a small stone chapel possibly built by the ephemeral Shepseskare, was finished by Nyuserre. Extending over the whole length of the pyramid side, the temple was built of mudbrick and comprised the earliest <a href="Hypostyle">hypostyle hall</a> of Ancient Egypt, its roof supported by wooden columns. The hall housed a large wooden statue of the deceased king. Nyuserre also built storage rooms to the north of the hall and, east of it, the "<a href="Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Knife">Sanctuary of the Knife</a>" where animals were ritually slaughtered. A column courtyard completed the temple entrance, adorned with two stone columns and 24 wooden ones.

Work on the pyramid and mortuary temple of Nyuserre's mother, Khentkaus II, had begun during her husband's rule but was stopped in the tenth year of his reign, at which point only the pyramid core was still uncased. After a delay of 12 years, Nyuserre Ini restarted the building work, and expended much effort in completing the majority of the construction. The motivation for this might have been to legitimise his rule following the premature death of Neferefre and the possible challenge by Shepseskare.
The pyramid is located in Abusir, next to that of Neferikare Kakai, who was Khentkaus' husband and under whose reign the construction of Khentkaus's complex had started. 
Once completed, the pyramid stood high, with a side of at the base and a slope of 52 degrees. Its sepulchral chamber likely housed a sarcophagus of red <a href="granite">granite</a>. Today, the pyramid is a high mound of rubble.

The mortuary temple of the queen, at the eastern foot of the pyramid, was the object of successive completion works during Nyuserre's reign, the earliest one used stone while the latest used only mudbrick. Completely ruined today, the temple seems to have been designed in imitation of the mortuary temples of kings incorporating, for example, a satellite pyramid, and being aligned on an east-west axis. The temple was administratively at least partially independent from the temple of Neferirkare Kakai with which it nonetheless shared some religious services, and it continued to function until the end of the Sixth Dynasty, some 300 years after Khentkaus' lifetime.

Archaeological excavations in 2012–2015 revealed that Nyuserre Ini undertook building works on the valley temple of Menkaure, as witness by numerous seal impressions bearing his <a href="serekh">serekh</a> discovered on the site. These works ended a long period from the reign of <a href="Shepseskaf">Shepseskaf</a> until his reign during which the <a href="Giza%20pyramid%20complex">Giza necropolis</a> was not the object of royal attention. Beyond Menkaure's valley temple, Nyuserre apparently also took a wider interest in the administration of the pyramid town of <a href="Khafra">Khafra</a> and revived the cult of both Menkaure and queen <a href="Khentkaus%20I">Khentkaus I</a>. According to Mark Lehner, this queen, who bore the same name as Nyuserre's mother and like his mother bore two pharaohs, provided Nyuserre with a genealogical link relating him to his Fourth Dynasty forebears. John Nolan believes that the mirroring position and names of both Khentkaus queens was emphasised so that Nyuserre could legimitise his rule after the troubled times surrounding Neferefre's death.

In the valley temple of Menkaure, Nyuserre extended the eastern annex, where he added two sets of alabaster columns, rebuilt the main entrance and refurbished the limestone causeway leading from the valley temple to the high temple. There, Mark Lehner suggested that Nyuserre expanded the inner part of the high temple, notably adding to it a square antechamber with a single central pillar.

Userkaf, founder of the Fifth Dynasty, was also the first pharaoh to built a temple to Ra in Abu Gurob. The temple was called "Nekhenre" by the Ancient Egyptian, which means "The Fortress of Ra", and built in four phases by three pharaohs. Userkaf first constructed a rectangular enclosure with a mound in its center. Sahure or Neferirkare Kakai then transformed this mound into a granite obelisk on a pedestal, adding two statue shrines near its base. The last two phases of construction were undertaken during Nyuserre's reign. Nyuserre first added an inner enclosure of limestone in the pre-existing court, extended the outside enclosure and either completed or built entirely the valley temple. In the last construction phase, Nyuserre encased the inner enclosure in mudbrick, added an altar and five stone benches to the central court, and built an annex to the temple.

A temple dedicated to the goddess <a href="Satet">Satet</a>, personification of the Nile floods, had stood on the island of <a href="Elephantine">Elephantine</a> to the south of Egypt since at least the late <a href="Predynastic%20Period">Predynastic Period</a> around 3200 BC. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the <a href="Early%20Dynastic%20Period%20%28Egypt%29">Early Dynastic Period</a> onwards and was again rebuilt in the course of the Fifth Dynasty, possibly during Nyuserre's reign. A <a href="faience">faience</a> plaque bearing Nyuserre's name was discovered in a deposit of votive offerings located under the floor of the sanctuary. Unfortunately, this deposit does not represent the original context of the plaque, which could have once adorned the walls of the temple or could equally have been deposed in a foundational offering made in anticipation of the temple reconstruction.

The identity of the mother of Nyuserre is known with certainty: it was queen <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>, in whose mortuary temple a fragmentary relief showing her facing her son Nyuserre and his family has been uncovered. On this relief both Khentkaus and Nyuserre appear on the same scale.

As a corollary, Nyuserre was almost certainly a son of Neferirkare Kakai as Khentkaus II was Neferirkare's queen. This relationship is also indicated by the location of Nyuserre's pyramid in Abusir next to that of Neferirkare, as well as his reuse for his own valley temple of materials from Neferikare's unfinished constructions.

At least one sibling of Nyuserre is known with near-certainty: Neferefre, who was a son of Neferirkare and Khentkaus II, was Nyuserre's elder brother. Since the relation between Shepseskare and Nyuserre remains uncertain, it is possible that the two were brothers too, as suggested by Roth, although the dominant hypothesis is that Shepseskare was a son of Sahure and hence Nyuserre's uncle.
Finally, yet another brother, possibly younger than Nyuserre has also been proposed: Iryenre, a prince "<a href="Iry-pat">Iry-pat</a>" whose relationship is suggested by the fact that his funerary cult was associated with that of his mother, both having taken place in the temple of Khentkaus II.

Nyuserre Ini seems to have had at least two wives, as witnessed by two small pyramids located at the southern end of the pyramid field of Abusir. Known today under the names of <a href="Lepsius%20XXIV">Lepsius XXIV</a> and <a href="Double%20Pyramid">Lepsius XXV</a> given to them by Lepsius in his list of pyramids, both monuments are heavily ruined and the names of their owners cannot be ascertained.
One of these two queens might have been <a href="Reptynub">Reptynub</a>, the only known consort of Nyuserre. Her existence and relation to Nyuserre are attested by a fragmentary alabaster statuette of her discovered in the valley temple of Nyuserre's pyramid complex. Pieces of relief from the tomb of vizier <a href="Ptahshepses">Ptahshepses</a> give the titles of a queen and while her name is lost, these titles are the same as those that Reptynub bore, leading Egyptologists to propose that these refer to her.

Nyuserre and Reptynub likely had a daughter in the person of <a href="princess%20Khamerernebty">princess Khamerernebty</a>, as suggested by her title of "King's daughter" as well as her marriage to the powerful vizier Ptahshepses. This remains conjectural until direct evidence of this relationship can be discovered. In particular, the only known connection between Reptynub and Khamerernebty are the reliefs from Ptahshepses's tomb, the presence of which would seem natural if Reptynub was Khamerernebty's mother. <a href="Hartwig%20Altenm%C3%BCller">Hartwig Altenmüller</a> goes further and hypothesises that Nyuserre had two more daughters, who he believes were buried close to Nyuserre's pyramid. In 2017, the tomb of Sheretnebty, an hitherto unknown daughter of Nyuserre, was excavated in Abusir south by a team under the direction of Miroslav Bárta. She was married to an important Egyptian official, whose name is lost. According to Bárta, this type of marriage reflects the growing <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a> in the Egyptian elite and the progressive dilution of the king's power.

Nyuserre Ini is known to have had at least one son: his first born, whose name is lost, is represented on several relief fragments from the high temple of his pyramid complex. Beyond the title of "Iry-pat" and "eldest king's son", he likely held two priestly titles: "lector priest" and "priest of <a href="Min%20%28god%29">Min</a>". Although the name of Nyuserre's eldest son is lost, <a href="Michel%20Baud">Michel Baud</a> observes that one relief fragment comprises a "r[e]", possibly part of the prince's name. If so then he would be distinct from <a href="Menkauhor%20Kaiu">Menkauhor Kaiu</a>, Nyuserre's successor.

The precise relationship between Nyuserre and Menkauhor remains uncertain but indirect evidence from the mastaba of <a href="Khentkaus%20III">Khentkaus III</a>, discovered in 2015, favors the hypothesis that Menkauhor was a son of Neferefre and thus a nephew of Nyuserre rather than his own son. Khentkaus is called "king's wife" and "king's mother" in inscriptions left by the tomb builders. Given the location of the mastaba, close to the pyramid of Neferefre, her husband was likely this pharaoh. Since she was also the mother of a king and since Nyuserre was a brother to Neferefre, the son in question is most probably the future Menkauhor Kaiu, who would thus have succeeded his uncle.

In any case, the succession of Nyuserre seems to have gone smoothly. A seal bearing both Nyuserre's and Menkauhor's names has been uncovered in the mortuary complex of Nyuserre's mother Khentkaus II. A further seal is believed to have both Nyuserre's and Djedkare's names on it, <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a> being Nyuserre's second successor. Taken together these seals reveal that, at the very least, Menkauhor and Djedkare did not perceive Nyuserre as an antagonist.

As pharaoh, Nyuserre Ini benefited from a funerary cult established at his death. Under the umbrella of the term "funerary cult" are grouped various cultic activities of two different types. First, there was an official cult taking place in the king's mortuary complex and which was provided for by agricultural domains established during Nyuserre's reign. This cult was most active until the end of the Old Kingdom but lasted at least until the <a href="Twelfth%20Dynasty">Twelfth Dynasty</a> during the Middle Kingdom, at which point is the latest known mention of a priest serving in Nyuserre's funerary complex. In later times, the official cult of Nyuserre was essentially reduced to a cult of the royal ancestor figure, a "limited version of the cult of the divine" as Jaromir Malek writes, manifested by the dedication of statues and the compilation of lists of kings to be honoured.

In parallel to that official cult were the more private cults of pious individuals venerating Nyuserre as a kind of "saint", an intercessor between the believers and the gods. This popular cult, which developed spontaneously, perhaps because of the proximity of Nyuserre's pyramid to Memphis, referred to Nyuserre using his birth name Iny, and likely consisted of invocations and offerings to statues of the king or in his mortuary temple. Therefore, archaeological traces of this cult are difficult to discern, yet Nyuserre's special status is manifest in some <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20offering%20formula">religious formulae</a>, where his name is invoked, as well as in the <a href="onomastics">onomastics</a> of individuals, notably during the Middle Kingdom, whose names included "Iny", such as Inhotep, Inemsaf, Inankhu and many more. Although the veneration of Nyuserre was originally a local phenomenon from Abusir, Saqqara and their surroundings, it may have ultimately reached even outside of Egypt proper, in Sinai, Byblos and Nubia, where fragments of statues, vessels and stelae bearing Nyuserre's name have been discovered in cultic contexts.

During the Old Kingdom, provisions for the official funerary cult of Nyuserre Ini were produced in agricultural estates set up during his reign. The names of some of these estates have been found inscribed on the walls of tombs in Saqqara or in Nyuserre's mortuary temple, such as "The track of Ini" and "The offerings of Ini". Several "Ḥwt" domains of the king, which comprise the land holdings of the mortuary temple of Nyuserre, are known: "<a href="Hathor">Hathor</a> wishes that Nyuserre lives", "<a href="Horus">Horus</a> wishes that Nyuserre lives", "<a href="Bastet">Bastet</a> wishes that Nyuserre lives", and "<a href="Ptah">Ptah</a> desires Nyuserre to live". Several priests serving in the pyramid complex and sun temple of Nyuserre are known from their tombs until the end of the Sixth Dynasty, showing that the official mortuary cult endured throughout the late Old Kingdom.

Nyuserre furthermore received special attention from at least two of his successors during this period: Djedkare Isesi either restored or completed his funerary temple, and <a href="Pepi%20II%20Neferkare">Pepi II Neferkare</a> erected a door jamb bearing an inscription mentioning both his first "Sed" festival and Nyuserre in the latter's valley temple, a close association meant to "evidence the pretended association of the king with his forefather".

Nyuserre is one of the very few Old Kingdom kings for whom there is evidence that the funerary cult continued uninterrupted during the First Intermediate Period, when the central authority of the pharaohs had broken down and the Egyptian state was in turmoil. The tombs of two priests Heryshefhotep I and II, who lived during this period, mention their roles and duties in the funerary establishment of Nyuserre, witnessing to the continuing existence of the official mortuary cult.

Nyuserre's effective deification and popular veneration flourished in parallel to the official cult throughout the period, as revealed for example by inscriptions in the tomb of an individual named Ipi, who desires to be "honoured before Iny", a terminology in which Nyuserre plays a role normally reserved to the gods. Similar qualifications denoting Nyuserre's status are found in tombs dating to the subsequent early Middle Kingdom, such as the mummy chest of an individual named Inhotep, on which he says that he is to be "honoured before <a href="Osiris">Osiris</a>, lord of life, and Iny, lord of reverence".

The Middle Kingdom saw the decline of the official cult of Nyuserre. Evidence from this period come from works undertaken in the Karnak temple by <a href="Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a>, who dedicated a number of statues of Old Kingdom kings including at least one of Nyuserre, to a cult of <a href="Amun">Amun</a> and of the royal ancestors. At the same time, the 12th Dynasty saw the widespread dismantling of many Old Kingdom funerary temples for their materials, which were notably reused in the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Amenemhet%20I">pyramid complexes</a> of <a href="Amenemhat%20I">Amenemhat I</a> and <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Senusret%20I">Senusret I</a>. These events are contemporaneous with the life of the last priest serving the official cult of Nyuserre, a certain Inhotep. Both of these facts hint at a lapse of royal interest in the state-sponsored funerary cults of Old Kingdom rulers.

The popular veneration of Nyuserre during earlier times continued to influence the cults performed during the New Kingdom. This is best exemplified by the Karnak king list, composed during the reign of <a href="Thutmosis%20III">Thutmosis III</a>, with the purpose of honouring a selection of royal ancestors and which includes the cartouche showing "Iny" for Nyuserre. This choice is unusual, as cartouches normally include the king's praenomen rather than a birth name, "Iny" being likely chosen here because it was under this name that Nyuserre was venerated and had become deified.

Later, during the <a href="Nineteenth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Ramesside period</a>, statues of Old Kingdom pharaohs including one of Nyuserre Ini were placed in a cachette (a hiding place) in the temple of Ptah in Memphis, suggesting their continued use for cultic purposes until that point. Concurrently with these activities, extensive restoration works in Abusir and Saqqara were undertaken during the reign of Ramses II under the direction of prince <a href="Khaemweset">Khaemweset</a>. The sun temple of Nyuserre was among the monuments benefiting from these works.

During the late <a href="Third%20Intermediate%20Period">Third Intermediate Period</a>, Old Kingdom mortuary temples enjoyed a revival of interest due primarily to the archaizing style favoured by the kings of the <a href="Twenty-fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt</a> (c. 760–656 BCE). In particular, <a href="Taharqa">Taharqa</a> (fl. c. 690–664 BCE) had reliefs from the temples of Sahure, Nyuserre and Pepi II reproduced in the temple of Amun of Gem-Aten in <a href="Karnak">Karnak</a> during his restoration works there.

Shepseskare

Shepseskare or Shepseskara (<a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20language">Egyptian</a> for "Noble is the Soul of <a href="Ra">Ra</a>") was an <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>ian <a href="pharaoh">pharaoh</a>, the fourth or fifth ruler of the <a href="Fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fifth Dynasty</a> (2494–2345 BC) during the <a href="Old%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Old Kingdom</a> period. Shepseskare lived in the mid-<a href="25th%20century%20BC">25th century BC</a> and was probably the owner of an unfinished pyramid in <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a>, which was abandoned after a few weeks of work in the earliest stages of its construction.

Following historical sources, Shepseskare was traditionally believed to have reigned for seven years, succeeding <a href="Neferirkare%20Kakai">Neferirkare Kakai</a> and preceding <a href="Neferefre">Neferefre</a> on the throne, making him the fourth ruler of the dynasty. He is the most obscure ruler of this dynasty and the <a href="Egyptologist">Egyptologist</a> <a href="Miroslav%20Verner">Miroslav Verner</a> has strongly argued that Shepseskare's reign lasted only a few months at the most, after that of Neferefre. This conclusion is based upon the state and location of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid in Abusir as well as the very small number of artefacts attributable to this king. Verner's arguments have now convinced several Egyptologists such as Darrell Baker and <a href="Erik%20Hornung">Erik Hornung</a>.

Shepseskare's relations to his predecessor and successor are not known for certain. Verner has proposed that he was a son of <a href="Sahure">Sahure</a> and a brother to Neferirkare Kakai, who briefly seized the throne following the premature death of his predecessor and probable nephew, Neferefre. Shepseskare may himself have died unexpectedly or he may have lost the throne to another of his nephews, the future pharaoh <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a>. The possibility that Shepseskare was a short-lived usurper from outside the royal family cannot be totally excluded.

Shepseskare was a king of <a href="Ancient%20Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>, the fourth or fifth ruler of the Fifth Dynasty. Egypt was unified at the time, with its capital located at <a href="Memphis%2C%20Egypt">Memphis</a>. Shepseskare is the least-known king of the Fifth Dynasty as very few artefacts dating to his reign have survived to this day. Only two <a href="cylinder%20seal">cylinder seal</a>s of Shepseskare are known: one, made of bronze, bears Shepseskare's <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20royal%20titulary%23Horus%20name">Horus name</a> and was uncovered in the ruins of Memphis in the early 20th century. The second seal, of unknown provenance, is made of black <a href="serpentine%20subgroup">serpentine</a> and reads "Shepseskare beloved of the gods, Shepseskare beloved of <a href="Hathor">Hathor</a>". Beyond these two seals the only surviving artefacts attributable to Shepseskare are five fragments of seal impressions on clay from <a href="Abusir">Abusir</a> and six further fragments discovered in the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Neferefre%23Mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a> and <a href="Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Knife">Sanctuary of the Knife</a> of the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Neferefre">Pyramid of Neferefre</a>, also in Abusir. These fragments probably come from three different seals and were most likely placed on the doors of magazine rooms in the temple.
Finally, there is a single scarab seal reading "Shepeskare" that the Egyptologist <a href="Flinders%20Petrie">Flinders Petrie</a> attributed to Shepseskare at the end of the 19th century. Modern scholars doubt this attribution and rather believe the scarab to be a work of the much later <a href="Twenty-sixth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Saite period</a> (685–525 BC) executed in archaic style. Equally, the scarab could belong to <a href="Gemenefkhonsbak">Gemenefkhonsbak Shepeskare</a>, an obscure kinglet of <a href="Tanis">Tanis</a> during the <a href="Twenty-fifth%20Dynasty%20of%20Egypt">25th Dynasty</a> (760–656 BC).

The only ancient Egyptian king list mentioning Shepseskare is the <a href="Saqqara%20Tablet">Saqqara Tablet</a> (on the 28th entry). The tablet was inscribed during the reign of <a href="Ramesses%20II">Ramesses II</a> (1279–1213 BC), around 1200 years after Shepseskare's lifetime, and records the dynastic succession Neferikare → Shepseskare → Neferkhare (a variant name of <a href="Neferefre">Neferefre</a>).
Shepseskare is completely absent from another king list dating to the same period: the <a href="Abydos%20King%20List">Abydos king list</a>, written during the reign of <a href="Seti%20I">Seti I</a> (1294–1279 BC). He is also absent from the <a href="Turin%20King%20List">Turin canon</a> (reign of Ramses II), although in this case a <a href="Lacuna%20%28manuscripts%29">lacuna</a> affects the papyrus on which the list is written at the place where Shepseskare and Neferefre's names should have been. Of the two entries concerning Shepseskare and Neferefre on the king list, only one reign length is still legible and it has been variously read as one year, eleven years or one to four months. The damaged state of the papyrus also makes it impossible to decide safely whose reign length this is.

Shepseskare was also likely mentioned in the "<a href="Aegyptiaca">Aegyptiaca</a>", a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of <a href="Ptolemy%20II">Ptolemy II</a> (283–246 BC) by the Egyptian priest <a href="Manetho">Manetho</a>. No copies of the Aegyptiaca have survived to this day and it is now known only through later writings by <a href="Sextus%20Julius%20Africanus">Sextus Julius Africanus</a> and <a href="Eusebius">Eusebius</a>. Africanus relates that the "Aegyptiaca" mentioned the succession "Nefercheres → Sisires → Cheres" for the mid Fifth Dynasty. Nefercheres and Cheres are believed to be the <a href="Hellenization">hellenized</a> forms for Neferirkare and Neferkhare (that is Neferefre), respectively. Thus, "Sisires" is traditionally believed to be the Greek name of Shepseskare, making Manetho's reconstruction of the Fifth Dynasty in good agreement with the Saqqara tablet. Furthermore, according to Africanus, Manetho credits Sisires with seven years of reign while other sources report Manetho's figure as nine years.

Both the relative chronological position and absolute dates of Shepseskare's reign are uncertain.
The Saqqara Tablet records Shepseskare as the successor of <a href="Neferirkare%20Kakai">Neferirkare Kakai</a> and the predecessor of Neferefre, which became the traditional opinion among Egyptologists. Following discoveries in the early 1980s, the Czech Egyptologist <a href="Miroslav%20Verner">Miroslav Verner</a> advocates the hypothesis that Shepseskare succeeded, rather than preceded, Neferefre.

In support of this hypothesis, Verner first emphasizes the presence of several clay seal impressions bearing Shepseskare's Horus name "Sekhemkaw" (meaning "He whose apparitions are powerful") in the oldest part of Neferere's mortuary temple, which was not built "until Neferefre's death". This appears to suggest that Shepseskare ruled after—rather than before—Neferefre.
Verner's second argument concerns the alignment of pyramids of Sahure, Neferirkare Kakai and Neferefre: they form a line pointing to <a href="Heliopolis%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">Heliopolis</a>, just as the three <a href="pyramids%20of%20Giza">pyramids of Giza</a> do. In contrast, Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid does not fall on the line to Heliopolis, which strongly suggests that Neferefre's pyramid had already been in place when Shepseskare started his. Finally, Verner observes that Neferefre is known to have been Neferirkare's eldest son and around 20 years old when his father died so that he was in optimal position to inherit the throne. Shespeskare thus most likely took the throne after Neferefre. As Verner notes, while Shepseskare is noted as the immediate predecessor of Neferefre in the Saqqara tablet, "this slight discrepancy can ... be attributed to the [political] disorders of the time and its dynastic disputes."

In two articles published in 2000 and 2001 Verner argues that, contrary to what Manetho indicates, Shepseskare must have reigned for a couple of months at the most, a hypothesis already proposed by the French Egyptologist <a href="Nicolas%20Grimal">Nicolas Grimal</a> in 1988.
Verner's conclusion is based on the archeological record, in particular Shepseskare's intended pyramid at Abusir. Verner emphasizes that the progress of the pyramid, which is unfinished,
was interrupted [and] corresponds to the work of several weeks, perhaps no more than one or two months. In fact, the place was merely leveled and the excavation of the pit for the construction of the underground funerary apartment had only commenced. Moreover, the owner of the building obviously wanted to demonstrate by his choice of place (half-way between Sahure's pyramid and the sun temple of Userkaf) his relationship to either Sahure or <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a>. Theoretically, only two kings of the Fifth Dynasty whose pyramids had not yet been identified can be taken into consideration – Shepseskara or Menkauhor. However, according to a number of contemporaneous documents, <a href="Menkauhor">Menkauhor</a> ... probably completed [his] pyramid elsewhere, in North Saqqara or Dahshur. Shepseskara, therefore, seems to be the likelier owner of the unfinished platform for a pyramid in North Abusir. Anyway, the builder of the platform [viz., Shepseskare] must have reigned for a very short time.
The rediscovery in 2008 of the <a href="Headless%20Pyramid">Headless Pyramid</a> in <a href="Saqqara">Saqqara</a> and its subsequent attribution to Menkauhor Kaiu by the excavators under the direction of <a href="Zahi%20Hawass">Zahi Hawass</a> confirms Verner's attribution of the unfinished pyramid of Abusir to Shepseskare.

Unlike the other kings of the Fifth Dynasty, Shepseskare's name appears neither in the personal names of people of the time nor in the names of funerary estates. He is also absent from the titles and biographies of state officials. For example, the stela of the Fifth Dynasty official Khau-Ptah lists an uninterrupted sequence of kings whom he served under, namely Sahure, Neferirkare, Neferefre and Nyuserre. The omission of Shepseskare, be it between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre, indicates that his reign must have been very short. Since Manetho's "Aegyptiaca" dates to the 3rd century BC, Khau-Ptah's contemporary account can be regarded as a more accurate indication of the political situation during the Fifth Dynasty.

Verner's arguments together with the scarcity of artefacts attributable to Shepseskare have now convinced many Egyptologists, such as Darrell Baker and <a href="Erik%20Hornung">Erik Hornung</a>, that Shepseskare's reign was indeed ephemeral.

In view of the scarcity of sources concerning Shepseskare, nothing is known for certain about his relation to his predecessors. He was most likely a member of the royal family, although the possibility that he was a usurper unrelated to his predecessors cannot be totally excluded.

Silke Roth has proposed that Shepseskare was a son of Neferirkare Kakai and a brother of both Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini. Instead, Verner has proposed that Shepseskare was a son of <a href="Sahure">Sahure</a> who managed to briefly seize power after the premature death of Neferefre. This would explain the proximity of Shepseskare's unfinished pyramid to <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Sahure">that of Sahure</a>. Lending credence to this theory is the discovery by Verner and Tarek El Awady in 2005 of reliefs from the causeway of Sahure's pyramid complex showing him, his wife <a href="Meretnebty">Meretnebty</a> and their two sons Ranefer and Netjerirenre. The relief gives both sons the title of "king's eldest son", indicating that they were possibly twins. The relief further indicates that Ranefer took the throne as "Neferirkare king of Upper and Lower Egypt". Verner and Awady thus speculate that while Ranefer and his son Neferefre became kings, Netjerirenre could have attempted to seize the throne at the death of the latter. In this hypothesis Shepseskare would be the throne name of Netjerirenre. Verner had however himself written in 1997 that Shepseskare could equally be a son of <a href="Shepseskaf">Shepseskaf</a>, last pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty, or of Userkaf or Neferirkare Kakai as Roth suggested: so few are the actual evidences pertaining to the problem that all possibilities are just speculations. In yet another hypothesis, Jaromír Krejčí believes that Shepseskare was Neferefre's son.

Shepseskare's reign may have been cut short by his unexpected death or his claim to the throne could have been thwarted by <a href="Nyuserre%20Ini">Nyuserre Ini</a>, Neferefre's younger brother and the younger son of King Neferirkare and Queen <a href="Khentkaus%20II">Khentkaus II</a>. Khentkaus II's pivotal role in Nyuserre's eventual accession to the throne might explain her high esteem in Egyptian folklore and "the additional enlargement and upgrading of her mortuary temple" by Nyuserre. Nyuserre also seemed to have been favored by powerful courtiers and officials, foremost among whom was <a href="Ptahshepses">Ptahshepses</a>, who would become Nyuserre's son-in-law and <a href="Vizier%20%28Ancient%20Egypt%29">vizier</a>.

An unfinished pyramid located in north Abusir, between the sun temple of Userkaf and the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Sahure">Pyramid of Sahure</a>, is believed to belong to Shepseskare. The structure was discovered in 1980 by a <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>n archaeological team led by Miroslav Verner and seems to have been abandoned after no more than a few weeks or months of work. A square area of roughly was leveled and the digging of a T-shaped ditch was just started in its center. This ditch was to be left open during the pyramid construction to allow for simultaneous works on the pyramid filling and its substructures. This construction technique is common to all pyramids of the Fifth Dynasty and can directly be seen in the case of the Pyramid of Neferefre, which was also left unfinished. This technique as well as the location of the unfinished pyramid in the royal <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a> of the Fifth Dynasty indicates that it belonged in all likeliness to Shepseskare, the pyramids of the other kings of the dynasty being already known. If finished according to the established pattern, the pyramid would have reached high, similar to the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Neferirkare">Pyramid of Neferirkare</a>.

Analyzing the fragments of clay seals bearing Shepeseskare's name, the Swiss Egyptologist <a href="Peter%20Kaplony">Peter Kaplony</a> has proposed that the ancient name of Shepseskare's pyramid could be reconstructed as "Rsj-Špss-k3-Rˁ", reading "Resj-Shespeskare" and meaning "The awakening of Shepseskare". Verner rejects this hypothesis, and he contests the reading of certain signs and their interpretation as the name of a pyramid.

Kaplony has proposed that Shepseskare started to build a <a href="Egyptian%20sun%20temple">sun temple</a> named "Ḥtp-jb-Rˁ", reading "Hotepibre" and meaning "Satisfied is the heart of <a href="Ra">Ra</a>". Although all the kings of the early to mid-Fifth Dynasty, from <a href="Userkaf">Userkaf</a> to <a href="Menkauhor%20Kaiu">Menkauhor Kaiu</a>, did build sun temples, Verner regards Kaplony's hypothesis as "sheer speculation" since it is based on the tentative reconstruction of a single clay seal. Verner first argues that this seal is not inscribed with Shepseskare's name but rather bears traces of a Horus name which could equally well be that of <a href="Djedkare%20Isesi">Djedkare Isesi</a>. Second, Verner notes that the name of a sun temple is rarely found with that of the king who built it: more often it is found with the name of another king during whose reign the seal was made. Finally, he doubts that the sign reading "Ḥtp", "Hotep", is really part of the name of a sun temple. Instead, he believes it is more probable that the seal either refers to the sun temple of Neferirkare, named "St-jb-Rˁ.w", that is "Setibraw"; or to that of Nyuserre, which was called "Šsp-jb-Rˁ", "Shesepibraw".

It is possible that Shepseskare continued the construction of the funerary complex of his predecessor. As Neferefre had died after a short reign, his pyramid complex was far from finished and neither the burial chamber nor the mortuary temple had been built. The planned pyramid was thus hastily changed into a square mastaba representing a stylized primeval hill and the accompanying mortuary temple was completed during the reign of Nyuserre.
The presence of seals of Shepseskare in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple could indicate that the former also undertook construction works there. The evidence for such works is uncertain: these seals could have been placed on boxes which were later moved into the magazine rooms of the temple. For example, seals of Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai were also found in the temple, while these three pharaohs died before Neferefre's reign.

Red-tailed black cockatoo

The red-tailed black cockatoo ("Calyptorhynchus banksii") also known as Banksian- or Banks' black cockatoo, is a large black <a href="cockatoo">cockatoo</a> native to <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. Adult males have a characteristic pair of bright red panels on the tail that gives the species its name. It is more common in the drier parts of the continent. Five <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised, differing most significantly in beak size. Although the more northerly subspecies are widespread, the two southern subspecies, the forest red-tailed black cockatoo and the south-eastern red-tailed black cockatoo are under threat.

The species is usually found in <a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> woodlands, or along water courses. In the more northerly parts of the country, these cockatoos are commonly seen in large flocks. They are seed eaters and cavity nesters, and as such depend on trees with fairly large diameters, generally "Eucalyptus". Populations in southeastern Australia are threatened by <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> and other habitat alterations. Of the black cockatoos, the red-tailed is the most adaptable to <a href="aviculture">aviculture</a>, although black cockatoos are much rarer and much more expensive in aviculture outside Australia.

The species complex was first described by the <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a> <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1790 as "Psittacus banksii", commemorating <a href="England">English</a> <a href="botanist">botanist</a> Sir <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a>. The red-tailed black cockatoo also has the distinction of being the first bird from Eastern Australia illustrated by a European, as a female, presumably collected at <a href="Endeavour%20River">Endeavour River</a> in north <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, was sketched by Banks' draughtsman <a href="Sydney%20Parkinson">Sydney Parkinson</a> in 1770. Narrowly predating Latham, English naturalist <a href="George%20Shaw">George Shaw</a> described "Psittacus magnificus" from a specimen collected somewhere in the <a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a> (now <a href="Sydney%20Australia">Sydney</a>) region. For many years, the species was referred to as "Calyptorhynchus magnificus", proposed by <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> in 1927 as Shaw's name had predated Latham's 1790 description. For several decades, Mathews' proposal was accepted by many authorities, although it was unclear whether the original Port Jackson reference had actually referred to the red-tailed black or, more likely, the <a href="glossy%20black%20cockatoo">glossy black cockatoo</a>. In 1994, an application to <a href="conserved%20name">conserve</a> "Calyptorhynchus banksii" as the scientific name was accepted by the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">ICZN</a>. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Calyptorhynchus">Calyptorhynchus</a>", the name of which is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "calypto-"/καλυπτο- "hidden" and "rhynchus"/ρυγχος "beak". The change was first made by <a href="Anselme%20Ga%C3%ABtan%20Desmarest">Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest</a> in 1826.

In 1827, Jennings proposed the name "Psittacus niger" for the bird. The <a href="Binomial%20nomenclature">binomial combination</a> had already been used by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> for the <a href="lesser%20vasa%20parrot">lesser vasa parrot</a> in 1758, and by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> for the <a href="palm%20cockatoo">palm cockatoo</a> in 1788; it was thus invalid even though both other species were already known by different names at the time. Alternate common names include "Banks' black cockatoo", "Banksian black cockatoo", or simply "black cockatoo". Indigenous people of the central <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> have several names for the bird: "(minha) pachang" in Pakanh; "(inh -) inhulg" in <a href="Uw%20Oykangand%20language">Uw Oykangand</a>; and "(inh -) anhulg" in Uw Olkola. (The bracketed prefix ("inh-" or "minha") is a <a href="Grammatical%20modifier">qualifier</a> meaning 'meat' or 'animal'.) "Ngarnarrh" or "KarnamarrTo" are terms used by the <a href="Gunwinggu">Gunwinggu</a> of <a href="Arnhem%20Land">Arnhem Land</a>. In <a href="Central%20Australia">Central Australia</a>, southwest of <a href="Alice%20Springs">Alice Springs</a>, the <a href="Pitjantjatjara%20language">Pitjantjatjara</a> term for the subspecies "C. b. samueli" is "iranti". "Karrak" is a <a href="Noongar">Noongar</a> term derived from the call for the southwestern race "C. b. naso". In the language of the <a href="Bungandidj%20people">Bungandidj</a> of south-eastern South Australia and western Victoria this bird was called "treen".

The red-tailed black cockatoo's closest relative is the <a href="glossy%20black%20cockatoo">glossy black cockatoo</a>; the two species form the subgenus "Calyptorhynchus" within the genus of the same name. They are distinguished from the other <a href="black%20cockatoo">black cockatoo</a>s of the subgenus "<a href="Calyptorhynchus">Zanda</a>" by their significant <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> and calls of the juveniles; one a squeaking <a href="Begging%20behavior%20in%20animals">begging call</a>, the other a vocalization when swallowing food.

A 1999 mtDNA <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> study of cockatoos utilizing among others, the red-tailed black cockatoo supported the hypotheses that cockatoos originated in Australia before the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> and <a href="Neogene">Neogene</a> periods (66 mya, marking the end of the Mesozoic, to 2.6 mya) and that the genus "Cacatua" diversified in two separate radiations to the islands of Indonesia, New Guinea, and the South Pacific. It concluded that the first extant cockatoo to diverge from the ancestral cockatoos was the <a href="palm%20cockatoo">palm cockatoo</a>, followed by a subclade containing the black cockatoos.

A 2008 <a href="mitochondrial">mitochondrial</a> and nuclear DNA phylogenetic study of the parrots, cockatoos and related <a href="taxa">taxa</a> by utilizing among others the <a href="yellow-tailed%20black%20cockatoo">yellow-tailed black cockatoo</a>, provides confirmatory evidence for a <a href="Gondwanaland">Gondwanaland</a> origin of the ancestral parrots in the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period, and an <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a> divergence of the ancestral cockatoos from the parrots in either late Cretaceous (66 mya) or Paleogene (45 mya) periods depending on baseline assumptions.

Five subspecies are recognised; they differ mainly in the size and shape of the beak, the overall bird size and female colouration:


Red-tailed black cockatoos are around 60 centimetres (24 in) in length and <a href="sexually%20dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a>. The male's plumage is all black with a prominent black crest made up of elongated feathers from the forehead and crown. The bill is dark grey. The tail is also black with two lateral bright red panels. Females are black with yellow-orange stripes in the tail and chest, and yellow grading to red spots on the cheeks and wings. The bill is pale and horn-coloured. The underparts are barred with fine yellow over a black base. Male birds weigh between 670 and 920 grams (1.5–2 <a href="Pound%20%28mass%29">lb</a>), while females weigh slightly less at 615–870 grams (1.25–1.75 lb). In common with other cockatoos and parrots, red-tailed black cockatoos have <a href="zygodactyl">zygodactyl</a> feet, two toes facing forward and two backward, that allow them to grasp objects with one foot while standing on the other, for feeding and manipulation. Black cockatoos are almost exclusively left-footed (along with nearly all other cockatoos and most parrots).

Juvenile red-tailed black cockatoos resemble females until puberty, which occurs around four years of age, but have paler yellow barred underparts. As the birds reach maturity, males gradually replace their yellow tail feathers with red ones; the complete process takes around four years.

As with other cockatoos, the red-tailed black cockatoo can be very <a href="longevity">long-lived</a> in captivity; in 1938, ornithologist <a href="Neville%20William%20Cayley">Neville Cayley</a> reported one over fifty years old at <a href="Taronga%20Zoo">Taronga Zoo</a>. Another bird residing at London and Rotterdam Zoos was 45 years and 5 months of age when it died in 1979.

Several calls of red-tailed black cockatoos have been recorded. The bird's contact call is a rolling metallic "krur-rr" or "kree", which may carry long distances and is always given while flying; its alarm call is sharp. Displaying males vocalize a sequence of soft growling followed by a repetitive "kred-kred-kred-kred".

The red-tailed black cockatoo principally occurs across the drier parts of Australia. It is widespread and abundant in a broad band across the northern half of the country, where it has been considered an agricultural pest, with more isolated distribution in the south. It is found in a wide variety of habitats, from shrublands and grasslands through <a href="eucalypt">eucalypt</a>, <a href="sheoak">sheoak</a> and "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>" woodlands, to dense tropical <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s. The bird is dependent on large, old eucalypts for nesting hollows, although the specific gums used vary in different parts of the country.

Cockatoos are not wholly migratory, but they do exhibit regular seasonal movements in different parts of Australia. In the northern parts of the Northern Territory, they largely leave areas of high humidity in the summer <a href="wet%20season">wet season</a>. In other parts of the country cockatoo seasonal movements tend to follow food sources, a pattern recorded in Northern Queensland, and New South Wales. In southwest Western Australia, both extant subspecies appear to have a north-south pattern; northwards after breeding in the case of subspecies "naso", while movements by subspecies "samueli" in the wheatbelt can be irregular and unrelated to the seasons.

Red-tailed black cockatoos are <a href="Diurnality">diurnal</a>, raucous and noisy, and are often seen flying high overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks of up to 500 birds are generally only seen in the north or when the birds are concentrated at some food source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, "graptogyne" and "naso", are almost exclusively <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a>. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.

The male red-tailed black cockatoo courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers, and hiding the beak; it then sings and struts, ending in a jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him. Breeding generally takes place from May to September except in the case of the South-eastern subspecies, which nests during summer (December to February). Pairs of the subspecies "samueli" in the <a href="Wheatbelt%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Wheatbelt</a> region of Western Australia may produce two broods, while those of South-eastern subspecies only produce one. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. Hollows can be 1 to 2 metres (3–7 ft) deep and 0.25–0.5 metres (10–20 in) wide, with a base of woodchips. A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.
Although red-tailed black cockatoos feed on a wide variety of native and introduced grains, the mainstay of their diet is <a href="eucalyptus">eucalyptus</a> seeds. There is a specific relationship between the species and larger-fruited species of gums. These vary across Australia but include the marri in Southwest Western Australia, Darwin woolybutt "<a href="Eucalyptus%20miniata">E. miniata</a>" across the north of the country, "<a href="Eucalyptus%20baxteri">E. baxteri</a>" in Victoria and the bloodwood species "<a href="Corymbia%20polycarpa">Corymbia polycarpa</a>" and "<a href="Corymbia%20intermedia">C. intermedia</a>" in Queensland. Cockatoos bite off branchlets with clusters of seed capsules, then hold them with their feet while chewing and harvesting seeds before littering the ground with debris. Among other seeds and nuts consumed are those of "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>", "<a href="Allocasuarina">Allocasuarina</a>", "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>", "<a href="Grevillea">Grevillea</a>" and "<a href="Hakea">Hakea</a>", as well as berries, fruits and various insects. Cockatoos have adapted to eating some introduced plants such as the doublegee ("<a href="Emex%20australis">Emex australis</a>"). There is some evidence of consumption of <a href="wild%20radish">wild radish</a> ("Raphanus raphanistrum"), wild turnip ("<a href="Brassica%20tournefortii">Brassica tournefortii</a>") and melon ("<a href="Citrullus">Citrullus</a>" or "<a href="Cucumis">Cucumis</a>"). Red-tailed black cockatoos have been implicated as agricultural pests of <a href="peanut">peanut</a> and other crops at <a href="Lakeland%2C%20Queensland">Lakeland Downs</a> in <a href="Far%20North%20Queensland">Far North Queensland</a>. Here the cockatoos, in flocks of up to several hundred birds, have learned to sever the peanut plants above ground level before pulling the peanuts out of the ground by their stems and shelling them. They also damage <a href="electrical%20cables">electrical cables</a> on <a href="Center%20pivot%20irrigation">pivot irrigators</a>.

The red-tailed black cockatoo is protected under the Australian "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Wildlife Protection) Act 2001".
These birds are listed internationally under Appendix II of <a href="CITES">CITES</a>, which allows international trade in live wild-caught and captive-bred specimens, if such exports are not detrimental to wild populations. However, the current Australian restrictions on commercial exports from Australia are not imposed by CITES. "C. b. graptogyne" is also specifically listed as endangered on the Australian <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a>.

Status of the red-tailed black cockatoo as a species, and as a subspecies, also varies from state to state within Australia. For example:


Like many Australian cockatoos and parrots, the red-tailed black cockatoo is threatened by the thriving illegal <a href="Wildlife%20trade">trade</a> in bird smuggling. High demand and high transit mortality mean that many more birds are taken from the wild than actually sold.

In 1997, the <a href="Northern%20Territory%20Legislative%20Assembly">Northern Territory Government's</a> Department of Natural Resources, Environment and The Arts (now defunct) proposed a plan for management of the trade in eggs and nestlings of "C. b. macrorhynchus". To date the plan has not been implemented.
The <a href="Australian%20Senate">Australian Senate</a> inquiry into the Commercial Utilisation of Australian Native Wildlife concluded in early 1998 that routine capture and commercial use of adult wild birds should be prohibited.

The bird is part of an annual census, the <a href="Great%20Cocky%20count">Great Cocky count</a>, that has been held every year since 2009 to track the population change of Red-tailed and other black cockatoos.

In the late 1990s, red-tailed black cockatoos fetched prices of $1750 in Australia and $8900 (~US$6000) overseas. Hand-raised birds can be bought for anywhere between $15,000 to $40,000 in the United States, where they are seldom seen in aviculture. Hand-reared birds are able to learn a few words and can be quite affectionate, although males may become <a href="Imprinting%20%28psychology%29">imprinted</a> and unlikely to breed. The red-tailed black cockatoo is the most commonly seen of the black cockatoos in captivity, and can be hardy and long-lived if given plenty of space. Until now, most birds in captivity have been of subspecies "C. b. banksii" and "C. b. samueli". Birds were often previously bred without much attention to subspecies of origin. However, with an increase in interest in conservation, more aviculturists are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the separate subspecies in cultivation, and so avoid <a href="crossbreeding">crossbreeding</a>.

The birds breed easily in captivity and can lay eggs every 3 weeks between February and November. Once the female has one egg in her nest, she will not lay another. An egg takes about 30 days to hatch. The eyes of the young open around 3 weeks and the yellow down will show black pin feathers at about 6 weeks. The best time for hand raising is at about 10 weeks when their black feathers are in place but the tail feathers are still short. Young birds fledge after about 4 months and both sexes have the colouring of their mother. Mature male birds will become aggressive to young male birds at puberty (4 years); they must be separated if caged.

The large and powerful bills of these birds can quickly and easily open a <a href="Brazil%20nut">Brazil nut</a> (normally requiring crushing in a vise or pounding with a hammer), shearing it as neatly as a laser. They can also demolish a whole coconut with husk in 3 days.

Captive breeding guidelines may be found in "Husbandry Guidelines for the Red-tailed Black Cockatoo" (Bennett, 2008).

E. Urner Goodman

Edward Urner Goodman (May 15, 1891 – March 13, 1980) was an 
influential leader in the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a> (BSA) movement for much of the twentieth century. Goodman was the national program director from 1931 until 1951, during the organization's formative years of significant growth when the <a href="Cub%20Scouting%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Cub Scout</a>ing and <a href="Exploring%20%28Learning%20for%20Life%29">Exploring</a> programs were established. He developed the BSA's national training center in the early 1930s and was responsible for publication of the widely read "<a href="Boy%20Scout%20Handbook">Boy Scout Handbook</a>" and other Scouting books, writing the "Leaders Handbook" used by Scout leaders in the United States during the 1930s and 1940s. In the 1950s, Goodman was Executive Director of Men's Work for the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Churches">National Council of Churches</a> in New York City and active in church work.

Goodman is best remembered today for having created the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Arrow">Order of the Arrow</a> (OA), a popular and highly successful program of the BSA that continues to honor Scouts for their cheerful service. Since its founding in 1915, the Order of the Arrow has grown to become a nationwide program having thousands of members, which recognizes those Scouts who best exemplify the virtues of cheerful service, camping, and leadership by membership in BSA's honor society. As of 2007, the Order of the Arrow has more than 183,000 members.

Goodman was born and raised in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Pennsylvania, where his father, George, was a printer and real estate agent. His mother, Ella, died of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> in early 1895 when Goodman was just three years old. He attended <a href="Central%20High%20School%20%28Philadelphia%29">Central High School</a>, graduating in 1909. He enjoyed writing and began keeping a detailed journal of daily activities during his senior year of high school, expressing his aspirations for the future along with occasional doubts. With several classmates, he began a literary club and published a newsletter, "The Inkstand". He also showed interest in music, playing the piano and violin, and composed a song for his high school senior class. When it was not selected by the class officers, he wrote in his journal of his disappointment.

Goodman also took an early interest in church activities as a youth, participating in a boys' brotherhood group and Sunday school and becoming a member of Tioga Presbyterian Church at age 14, an event he described as "the most important step I ever took or ever will take in my life." Just barely out of his teens, Goodman became a popular and highly respected Sunday school teacher and led the Philadelphia chapter of a young men's group called the <a href="Brotherhood%20of%20Andrew%20and%20Philip">Brotherhood of Andrew and Philip</a>.

Aspiring to a career in education, Goodman enrolled in the <a href="Central%20High%20School%20%28Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania%29%23Philadelphia%20School%20of%20Pedagogy">Philadelphia School of Pedagogy</a> in 1911. He was selected to be the commencement speaker at his graduation in 1913 and his address was entitled, "The Call to Teach". Goodman then did graduate work in education at <a href="Temple%20University">Temple University</a>, while teaching at the <a href="Public%20Schools%20of%20Philadelphia%23Elementary%20and%20middle%20schools">Potter School</a> in Philadelphia.

On June 18, 1920, Goodman married Louise Wynkoop Waygood, the daughter of a <a href="Presbyterianism">Presbyterian</a> minister and a 1918 honors graduate of <a href="Swarthmore%20College">Swarthmore College</a>. They had three children: Theodore (born 1921), George (born 1923), and Lydia Ann (born 1927). He was a member of <a href="Kiwanis">Kiwanis</a>, <a href="Rotary%20International">Rotary International</a>, and a <a href="Freemasonry">Freemason</a>, joining Robert A. Lamberton Lodge No. 487, Free and Accepted Masons of Philadelphia on March 5, 1918.

While studying for his degree in Education, Goodman first became involved in Boy Scouting in 1911 when only 20 years old, as a volunteer Scoutmaster of Troop 1, the first Scout troop in Philadelphia. As far as can be established, this would make him the second-youngest Scoutmaster in the history of the BSA. In his four years as Scoutmaster, the troop grew to more than 100 Scouts. A contemporary of Goodman described him in 1912 as "well beloved by the boys, enjoys their confidence and is heart and soul in this phase of the work." In later years, he would recall with nostalgia his troop, noting that renowned composer <a href="Albert%20Hay%20Malotte">Albert Hay Malotte</a> was "one of his boys" in Troop 1. In April 1915, he entered full-time professional service in Boy Scouting as a field executive, serving that summer as director of the <a href="Cradle%20of%20Liberty%20Council">Philadelphia Scout Council's</a> <a href="summer%20camp">summer camp</a>. He was promoted in December 1917 to Scout executive of the Philadelphia Council.

Goodman's professional Scouting career was interrupted during World War I, when he was drafted into the U.S. Army shortly after his promotion to Scout executive. He served in the <a href="infantry">infantry</a> as a first lieutenant, but his unit was never sent overseas. In December 1918, he was discharged from the Army and resumed his professional career as Scout executive in Philadelphia. He served as Scout executive there until May 1927, when he was promoted to the larger <a href="Chicago%20Area%20Council">Chicago Area Council</a> as Scout executive (1927–1931). During his four-year tenure in the "Windy City", he reversed a decline in finances and increased Scout membership from 11,806 to 16,920.

On April 1, 1931, Goodman was promoted by <a href="Chief%20Scout%20Executive">Chief Scout Executive</a> <a href="James%20E.%20West%20%28Scouting%29">James E. West</a> to become national program director of the BSA, as part of an organizational restructuring. Goodman was one of four division directors reporting to West (the other divisions were operations, personnel, and business). As national program director, he was responsible for professional and volunteer training, relations with sponsoring organizations, public relations, and program development. The <a href="Cub%20Scouting%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Cub Scout</a>ing and <a href="Exploring%20%28Learning%20for%20Life%29">Exploring</a> programs were established under his leadership. He greatly expanded BSA training programs for adult leaders, establishing the BSA's highly regarded national training center at <a href="Mortimer%20L.%20Schiff%20Scout%20Reservation">Schiff Scout Reservation</a> in New Jersey in 1932 and, later, the training program at <a href="Philmont%20Scout%20Ranch">Philmont Scout Ranch</a>, beginning in 1938. He also oversaw the publication of the "Boy Scout Handbook", edited by his good friend and colleague <a href="William%20Hillcourt">William "Green Bar Bill" Hillcourt</a>, as well as the "Handbook for Scoutmasters" and the first edition of the widely read "Scout Field Book". Goodman also wrote the "Leader's Handbook", a key instructional guide for Scout leaders.

In early July 1937, the BSA held its first <a href="National%20Scout%20jamboree%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">national Scout jamboree</a> in Washington, D. C., attended by 25,000 Scouts and Scouters. In addition to overseeing the innovative event itself, Goodman's public relations service did yeoman work to ensure extensive news media coverage. A jamboree press tent accommodated 626 news media reporters, photographers, and broadcasters. Sixty-four news releases were issued and the public relations service assisted in the making of 11 newsreels and 53 magazine articles. The three major U.S. radio networks of the time, <a href="NBC">NBC</a>, <a href="CBS">CBS</a> and <a href="Mutual%20Broadcasting%20System">Mutual</a>, all set up complete broadcasting studios near the jamboree headquarters to produce almost 19 hours of live, on-site jamboree coverage broadcast coast-to-coast. Celebrities also visited the jamboree, including well-known broadcaster <a href="Lowell%20Thomas">Lowell Thomas</a> and U.S. President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>. While at the jamboree, Scouts also attended a three-game baseball series between the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> and the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> at <a href="Griffith%20Stadium">Griffith Stadium</a>, with Goodman arranging for <a href="Eagle%20Scout%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Eagle Scouts</a> to have a place of honor with President Roosevelt in the stands (pictured).

In his comprehensive biography of E. Urner Goodman, Nelson Block writes that the mutual respect between Goodman and West grew over their 12 years of working together at the national BSA office: "West, the hardworking, detail-oriented executive, came to rely on Goodman and his style of accomplishing big things through diligent organization and planning, executed by carefully recruited staff...".

When the venerable youth leader and longtime National Scout Commissioner <a href="Daniel%20Carter%20Beard">Daniel Carter Beard</a> died shortly before his 91st birthday in June 1941, Goodman was selected to be in charge of the beloved pioneer's funeral in <a href="Suffern%2C%20New%20York">Suffern, New York</a>. An estimated 2,000 people lined the funeral route to the cemetery in <a href="Monsey%2C%20New%20York">Monsey, New York</a>, where formed an honor guard and assisted with traffic control.

As war clouds cast an ominous shadow over Europe in the late 1930s amidst the rise of fascism, West, Goodman, and other BSA leaders considered how Scouting might better train youth in democratic principles of government. Referring to the Nazi "<a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>" rampage against Jews in 1938, Goodman wrote shortly afterwards: "...the program of persecution has stirred up our hearts and minds as nothing else that has happened before has done. It has furnished the impetus of a wave of resentment against the evil; but more than that, for a surge of satisfaction and thanksgiving concerning our own happier state under a democracy." During World War II, various BSA programs were developed under his leadership in support of the nation's war effort, such as the collection of scrap aluminum, tires, and waste paper for recycling into war material, distribution of <a href="war%20bond">war bond</a> and <a href="Strategic%20bombing">air raid</a> posters, assisting <a href="Civil%20defense">Civil Defense</a> officials, and planting of fruit and vegetable "<a href="victory%20garden">victory garden</a>s".

On September 16, 1951, Goodman retired as national program director, ending a professional Scouting career spanning 36 years. He was given the title of National Field Scout Commissioner, to continue his service to Scouting on the national level as a layman.

As the <a href="Cradle%20of%20Liberty%20Council">Philadelphia Council's</a> newly hired field executive in 1915, one of Goodman's assignments was to serve as director of the council's summer camp at <a href="Treasure%20Island%20Scout%20Reservation">Treasure Island Scout Reservation</a> on the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a>. He believed that the summer camp experience should do more than just teach proficiency in <a href="Scoutcraft">Scoutcraft</a> skills; rather, the principles embodied in the <a href="Scout%20Oath">Scout Oath</a> and <a href="Scout%20Law">Scout Law</a> should become realities in the lives of Scouts. Along with his assistant camp director, <a href="Carroll%20A.%20Edson">Carroll A. Edson</a>, he started an experimental program to recognize those Scouts best exemplifying those traits as an example to their peers.

Goodman and Edson were strongly influenced by the use of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indian</a> culture by <a href="Ernest%20Thompson%20Seton">Ernest Thompson Seton</a> in his <a href="Woodcraft%20Indians">Woodcraft Indians</a> program. They decided to create an honor society of their own at camp that summer, in a manner befitting a boy's interest and understanding. Goodman utilized the appeal of Indian lore and recognition by a Scout's peers as motivational tools. He devised a program where troops chose, at the camp's conclusion, those boys from among their number who best exemplified the ideals of Scouting. Those elected were acknowledged as having displayed, in the eyes of their fellow Scouts, a spirit of unselfish service and brotherhood. Edson helped Goodman research the traditions and language of the <a href="Lenape">Lenni Lenape</a>—also known as the Delaware—who had once inhabited Treasure Island.
The brotherhood of Scout honor campers with its American Indian overtones was a success and was repeated again the following summer at Treasure Island. Those Scouts honored at Treasure Island in 1915 and 1916 would eventually become members of the Order of the Arrow's <a href="Unami%20Lodge">Unami Lodge</a>.

By 1921, Goodman had spoken to Scout leaders in surrounding states about the OA, and lodges were established in a score of Scout councils in the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">northeast</a>. In October 1921, he convened the first national meeting of what was then called the National Lodge of the Order of the Arrow in Philadelphia, and Goodman was elected Grand Chieftain. Committees were organized to formulate a constitution, refine ceremonial rituals, devise insignia, and plan future development. Reflecting Goodman's ongoing interest in music, he composed the words to the Order of the Arrow's song, "Firm Bound in Brotherhood", set to the stirring melody of a hymn found in the Presbyterian hymnal of the 1920s, "God the Omnipotent" in 11.10.11.9 <a href="Hymn%23Hymn%20meters">meter</a>, which was adapted from the Russian national anthem, "<a href="God%20Save%20the%20Tsar%21">God Save the Tsar!</a>", composed by <a href="Alexei%20Lvov">Alexei Lvov</a> in 1833.

In the early 1920s, many Scout executives were skeptical of what they called "secret camp fraternities". By September 1922, opposition to the Order of the Arrow was such that a formal resolution opposing "camp fraternities" was proposed at a national meeting of Scout executives. Goodman argued against the motion: "Using the Scout ideals as our great objective", he said, a camp activity that will "further the advancement of those ideals" should not be suppressed. The motion was narrowly defeated, and the fledgling Order continued as an experimental program throughout the 1920s and 1930s.

Goodman maintained his active support of the OA's National Lodge, as it was then called, during his years as Scout executive in Chicago and then BSA national program director. In observance of the 15th anniversary of the brotherhood's founding, the National Lodge presented Goodman with a medal in 1930 formally recognizing him as founder. In 1940, the National Lodge presented him with the first <a href="Honors%20and%20awards%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Arrow%23Distinguished%20Service%20Award">Distinguished Service Award</a> on the OA's 25th anniversary. The citation said, in part, "As the founder of the Order of the Arrow, through his ability, wisdom, and foresight, his vision of service to others was transformed into a national honor brotherhood which has been a positive influence in the lives of thousands of boys...". When he was first appointed as director in 1931, there were OA lodges in seven percent of BSA councils nationwide. By 1948, about two-thirds of the BSA councils had established OA lodges. In that year, three years before Goodman's retirement from the BSA, his "honor society of Scout camping" innovation was fully integrated as an official part of the Scouting program. Kenneth Davis, in his book "The Brotherhood of Cheerful Service: A History of the Order of the Arrow", concludes that the National Council's approval in 1948 "...was due largely to his [Goodman's] personal efforts and recommendation...".

Over the decades since the Order of the Arrow's founding, more than one million Scouts and Scouters have worn the OA sash on their uniforms, denoting membership in the Brotherhood of Cheerful Service. There are presently 183,000 members of the Order of the Arrow in all but two of BSA councils nationwide. Summarizing what he felt the order signified, E. Urner Goodman wrote in the foreword to the "Order of the Arrow Handbook" from the perspective of more than a half century after the brotherhood's inception:

Following his retirement from professional Scouting, Goodman served the <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Churches">National Council of Churches</a> (NCC) during 1951–1954 as the NCC's first general director of the "United Church Men", a laymen's program he formed to strengthen men's ties to local churches and their communities. Goodman publicly inaugurated the laymen's group on October 7, 1951 in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio. By the end of 1952, United Church Men departments were formed in more than 24 states, providing financial support to NCC-affiliated colleges and <a href="Missionary">missionary work</a>. His new post entailed working closely with <a href="Eugene%20Carson%20Blake">Eugene Carson Blake</a>, NCC president (1954–1957), and meeting frequently with officials of the participating denominations in the NCC. Speaking with various men's church groups in the U.S. and abroad was, he believed, a means of promoting brotherhood. Reflecting on his NCC service with these notable church leaders, Goodman said more than a decade later, "Great faith and devoted service, I am very sure, are for ordinary folk as well as for the clergy. ... I have been privileged to know some great clergymen in my day ... but I have also known and loved some truly great laymen, men whose lives and works matched their faith". Goodman retired from his NCC post on September 1, 1954 because of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>.

Maintaining his lifelong interest in music, Goodman was active in the Hymn Society of America (now the <a href="Hymn%20Society%20in%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Canada">Hymn Society in the United States and Canada</a>) in the 1960s and 1970s, and three hymns he composed were published: "Christ Calls Men", "As Within the Pillared Temple", and "O God of Love, Who Gavest Life".

In 1965, Goodman wrote "The Building of a Life", a collection of <a href="wikt%3Areminiscence%23English">reminiscences</a> recounting some of his Scouting experiences and giving advice to young men. Summing up his years in Scouting and church work, he wrote, "In the last analysis, it is the things of the spirit rather than material possessions that count." Later that year, the Goodmans moved to the Penney Retirement Community at <a href="Penney%20Farms%2C%20Florida">Penney Farms, Florida</a>. Goodman then served as Director of Christian Education at Flagler Presbyterian Church in <a href="St.%20Augustine%2C%20Florida">St. Augustine, Florida</a>.

In retirement, the Goodmans enjoyed a rich family life, visiting often with son Theodore ("Ted") and his wife Carol, and daughter Lydia Ann ("Ann") and son-in-law Bob. To his unabashed delight, Urner and Louise Goodman had nine grandchildren. Their son George was <a href="killed%20in%20action">killed in action</a> in France during World War II, however. Upon hearing the news in December 1944, Goodman was deeply grieved, and Louise, his wife of 60 years, said it was the only time she ever saw him cry.

Although retired, Goodman remained active in Order of the Arrow affairs during the 1960s and 1970s. Acclaimed as an eloquent orator, his keynote addresses at the OA's biennial National Order of the Arrow Conferences reportedly made an unforgettable impression upon his youthful audiences. Nelson Block writes in "A Thing of the Spirit", that even in the 1970s the octogenarian founder "crisscrossed the country to attend lodge and section events... surrounded by young Arrowmen...witty and charming, keeping everyone enthralled with his stories." Displaying his self-deprecating humor, Goodman himself was more prosaic about all of the adulation he received at OA gatherings, writing that, "to many of the young men I was a museum piece. In fact I have been informed that there was considerable surprise because I didn't hobble in on a cane and mumble in my dentures." But, he added, "I looked upon them with deep emotion, for there was a spiritual bond".

Reflecting on his career, Goodman said late in life:

He continued speaking with OA members until shortly before his death at age 88, when he succumbed to <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> on March 13, 1980, at <a href="Lenox%20Hill%20Hospital">Lenox Hill Hospital</a> in New York City. He was buried at Penney Farms, Florida, on March 29, 1980. At his funeral, held at the Penney Memorial Church in Penney Farms, Goodman was eulogized by Executive Secretary of the Order of the Arrow William F. Downs: "The shake of [his] hand, sincerity of greeting, twinkle in the eye, smile and dignity immediately relayed...the feeling of confidence from the leader, so necessary to build teamwork. Urner made you feel important".

Upon his retirement from full-time professional Scouting in 1951, Goodman was awarded an honorary Doctorate in Humanics from <a href="Missouri%20Valley%20College">Missouri Valley College</a>, the first such degree awarded by the college. He was also honored in 1947 when he was made an honorary chief of the <a href="Blackfoot">Blackfoot Tribe of American Indians</a> and given the name "Chief Eagle".

In his memory, the BSA confers the <a href="Honors%20and%20awards%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Arrow%23E.%20Urner%20Goodman%20Camping%20Award">E. Urner Goodman Camping Award</a>, recognizing lodges that have excelled in the promotion of camping within their host council. The <a href="Honors%20and%20awards%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Arrow%23Founder%27s%20Award">Founder's Award</a> is given by Order of the Arrow lodges in honor of OA co-founders Goodman and Edson. Up until 2004, the BSA administered the E. Urner Goodman Scholarship Fund program, providing financial grants towards the college education of Arrowmen aspiring to professional Scouting careers.

Siward, Earl of Northumbria

Siward ( or more recently ) or Sigurd (, ) was an important <a href="earl">earl</a> of 11th-century <a href="northern%20England">northern England</a>. The <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> nickname "Digri" and its Latin translation "Grossus" ("the stout") are given to him by <a href="near-contemporary%20texts">near-contemporary texts</a>. Siward was probably of <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n origin, perhaps a relative of <a href="Earl%20Ulf">Earl Ulf</a>, and emerged as a powerful regional strongman in England during the reign of <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut</a> ("Canute the Great", 1016–1035). Cnut was a Scandinavian ruler who conquered England in the 1010s, and Siward was one of the many Scandinavians who came to England in the aftermath of that conquest. Siward subsequently rose to become sub-ruler of most of northern England. From 1033 at the latest Siward was in control of southern <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, that is, present-day <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, governing as earl on Cnut's behalf.

He entrenched his position in northern England by marrying Ælfflæd, the daughter of <a href="Ealdred%20II%20of%20Bamburgh">Ealdred</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Bamburgh">Earl of Bamburgh</a>. After killing Ealdred's successor <a href="Eadwulf%20III%20of%20Bamburgh">Eadulf</a> in 1041, Siward gained control of all Northumbria. He exerted his power in support of Cnut's successors, kings <a href="Harthacnut">Harthacnut</a> and <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward</a>, assisting them with vital military aid and counsel. He probably gained control of the middle <a href="shire">shire</a>s of <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a> and <a href="Huntingdon">Huntingdon</a> by the 1050s, and there is some evidence that he spread Northumbrian control into <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>. In the early 1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish king <a href="Mac%20Bethad%20mac%20Findla%C3%ADch">Mac Bethad mac Findlaích</a> ("Macbeth"). Despite the death of his son <a href="Osbjorn%20Bulax">Osbjorn</a>, Siward defeated Mac Bethad in battle in 1054. More than half a millennium later the adventure in Scotland earned him a place in <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Macbeth">Macbeth</a>". Siward died in 1055, leaving one son, <a href="Waltheof%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Waltheof</a>, who would eventually succeed to Northumbria. <a href="St%20Olave%27s%20Church%2C%20York">St Olave's church</a> in <a href="York">York</a> and nearby <a href="Heslington%20Hill">Heslington Hill</a> are associated with Siward.

Source material on Siward's life and career is scarce, and only a small and potentially unrepresentative amount of information exists. No contemporary or near-contemporary biography has survived, and narratives from around the time of his life such as the "<a href="Encomium%20Emmae">Encomium Emmae</a>" and the "<a href="Vita%20%C3%86dwardi%20Regis">Vita Ædwardi Regis</a>" scarcely mention him; historians are therefore dependent on a few entries in the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" and comparable Irish sources. Later <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> histories may or may not be reliable depending on their source material, but useful ones include the "Chronicle" of <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a> (compiled between 1124 and 1140), <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> (writing between c. 1125 and 1142), <a href="Henry%20of%20Huntingdon">Henry of Huntingdon</a> (writing between c. 1133 and 1154), and <a href="Orderic%20Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a> (writing between c. 1114 and 1141). Other sources include the material attributed to <a href="Symeon%20of%20Durham">Symeon of Durham</a> (compiled and written as extant between the late 11th century and the first half of the 12th century). Legendary material, such as that in <a href="hagiography">hagiography</a> or later medieval sources such as <a href="John%20of%20Fordun">John of Fordun</a> or <a href="Andrew%20of%20Wyntoun">Andrew of Wyntoun</a>, is not generally regarded as useful beyond its limited potential for cleanly preserving earlier source material.

Siward's career in northern England spanned the reigns of four different monarchs. It began during the reign of <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut</a>, and lasted through those of <a href="Harold%20Harefoot">Harold Harefoot</a> and <a href="Harthacnut">Harthacnut</a> into the early years of <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>. Most important was the reign of Cnut, in which so many new political figures rose to power that some historians think it comparable to the <a href="Norman%20conquest">Norman conquest</a> five decades later. These "new men" were military figures, usually with weak hereditary links to the West Saxon royal house that Cnut had deposed. As Cnut ruled several <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n kingdoms in addition to England, power at the highest level was delegated to such strongmen. In England, it fell to a handful of newly promoted "ealdormen" or "earls", who ruled a <a href="shire">shire</a> or group of shires on behalf of the king. Siward was, in the words of historian <a href="Robin%20Fleming">Robin Fleming</a>, "the third man in Cnut's new triumvirate of earls", the other two being <a href="Godwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Godwine</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Wessex">Earl of Wessex</a> and <a href="Leofwine%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Leofwine</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Mercia">Earl of Mercia</a>.

Northern England in the 11th-century was a region quite distinct from the rest of the country. The former kingdom of Northumbria stretched from the <a href="Humber">Humber</a> and <a href="River%20Mersey">Mersey</a> estuaries, northward to the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>, where, passing the western <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Kingdom of Strathclyde</a>, it met the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Alba">Kingdom of Alba</a> (Scotland). Northumbria had been united with the West Saxon English kingdom only in the 950s, by King <a href="Eadred%20of%20England">Eadred</a>, and subsequent control was exerted through the agency of at least two ealdormen, one to the north and one to the south of the <a href="River%20Tees">River Tees</a>. The former is associated with the stronghold of <a href="Bamburgh">Bamburgh</a>, while the latter is associated with the great Roman city of <a href="York">York</a>. It was a politically fragmented region. The western part, from <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> to <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, was heavily settled by Norse-Gaels, while in the rest of Northumbria English and Anglo-Scandinavian regional magnates—<a href="thegn">thegn</a>s, <a href="Hold%20%28title%29">holds</a> and <a href="high-reeve">high-reeve</a>s—exercised a considerable degree of independence from the ealdormen. One such example was the magnate <a href="Thurbrand%20the%20Hold">Thurbrand</a>, a hold in Yorkshire, probably based in <a href="Holderness">Holderness</a>, whose family were frequently at odds with the ruling earls at Bamburgh.

Historians generally claim Siward to be of Scandinavian origin, a conclusion supported by the "Vita Ædwardi Regis", which states that Siward was "[called] "Digri" in the Danish tongue" ("Danica lingua Digara"). Legendary material incorporated in the "Vita et passio Waldevi comitis" (or simply "Vita Waldevi"), the hagiographic biography of Siward's son <a href="Waltheof%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Waltheof</a>, states that Siward was the son of a Scandinavian earl named Bjorn and provides a genealogy claiming that he was the descendant of a <a href="polar%20bear">polar bear</a>, a commonplace piece of Germanic folklore.

Historian Timothy Bolton has recently argued that the similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling. Bolton hypothesized that Siward's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure, a brother of <a href="Thorgil%20Sprakling">Thorgil Sprakling</a>. Siward would then have been first cousin to <a href="Earl%20Ulf">Earl Ulf</a>, the earl of Denmark who married Cnut's sister <a href="Estrid%20Svendsdatter">Estrith</a> and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut's. Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia, and so Siward's career in England was another indication of that family's success in Scandinavian politics.

The "Vita Waldevi" provides further legendary detail of Siward's journey from Scandinavia to England. According to the "Vita", Siward passed through <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a>, killing a <a href="dragon">dragon</a> there before moving on to <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>. There he encountered another dragon, before meeting an <a href="O%C3%B0inn">Oðinn</a>-like old man on a hill, who handed him a <a href="raven%20banner">raven banner</a> and instructed him to proceed to London to receive the patronage of the king of England.

The exact date and context of Siward's arrival in England are unknown, though the "Vita Waldevi" offers a legendary account. Charters dating to 1019, 1024, 1032, 1033 and 1035 mention a "Si[ge]ward Minister", "the <a href="thegn">thegn</a> Siward", but it is impossible to securely identify any of these names with the man who became <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Earl of Northumbria</a>. The earliest certain contemporary record of Siward occurs in a charter of King Cnut to <a href="%C3%86lfric%20Puttoc">Ælfric Puttoc</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, in 1033. This charter attestation can be identified as Siward the earl because he is styled "dux" ("earl").

Although it is clear that Siward was earl by 1033, he may have attained the position somewhat earlier. His predecessor <a href="Erik%20of%20Hlathir">Erik of Hlathir</a> last appeared in the historical sources in 1023, leaving a ten-year gap during which Siward could have taken the position. Although William of Malmesbury asserted that Erik was driven back to Scandinavia, Scandinavian tradition firmly maintained he died in England. Historian <a href="William%20Kapelle">William Kapelle</a> believed that Erik ceased to be earl in or soon after 1023, and that Carl son of Thurbrand was appointed hold or high-reeve ("heahgerefa") for the king in Yorkshire. Carl retained this position, it was argued, even after Siward was installed as earl a few years later, but from then on he acted as a deputy to the earl rather than to the king. <a href="Richard%20A.%20Fletcher">Richard Fletcher</a> remained agnostic on the point, although he did argue that Erik must have been dead by 1028. Timothy Bolton, although rejecting Kapelle's argument concerning Carl son of Thurbrand, believed Erik died c. 1023 and that the earldom may have remained vacant for a period. Bolton argued that Cnut left the earldom of Northumbria empty and appears to have paid it little attention until the last years of his reign, and another northerner <a href="Ealdred%20II%20of%20Bamburgh">Ealdred son of Uhtred</a> rose to power in the political vacuum.

When Cnut died in 1035, there were a number of rival claimants for his throne. These included his son <a href="Harthacnut">Harthacnut</a>, and the nobleman <a href="Harold%20Harefoot">Harold Harefoot</a>, as well as <a href="Alfred%20%C3%86theling">Alfred Ætheling</a> and Edward (later, King <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a>), the exiled sons of <a href="%C3%86thelred%20the%20Unready">Æthelred the Unready</a>. Isolated in Scandinavia, Harthacnut was unable to prevent Harold Harefoot seizing the crown for himself. Ruling England from 1035, Harold died in 1040 just as Harthacnut was preparing an invasion. Arriving soon after Harold's death, Harthacnut reigned in England only two years before his own death in 1042, a death that led to the peaceful succession of Edward. Frank Barlow speculated on Siward's political stance, guessing that during these upheavals Siward assumed "a position of benevolent or prudent neutrality".

Siward is found in 1038, as "Sywardus Comes" ("Earl Siward"), witnessing a charter of King Harthacnut to the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Bury%20St%20Edmunds">Abbey of Bury St Edmunds</a>. He witnessed a confirmation granted by Harthacnut to <a href="F%C3%A9camp%20Abbey">Fécamp Abbey</a>, between 1040 and 1042, of an earlier grant made by Cnut. In 1042, he witnessed grants by Harthacnut to <a href="Abingdon%20Abbey">Abingdon Abbey</a> and to <a href="%C3%86lfwine%20of%20Winchester">Ælfwine</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>.

Siward was, at some stage, married to Ælfflæd, daughter of <a href="Ealdred%20II%20of%20Bamburgh">Ealdred II of Bamburgh</a>, and granddaughter of <a href="Uhtred%20the%20Bold">Uhtred the Bold</a>. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" asserts that, in 1041 <a href="Eadulf%20III%20of%20Bernicia">Eadulf</a>, Earl of Bamburgh, was "betrayed" by King Harthacnut. The "betrayal" seems to have been carried out by Siward; since when the "<a href="Libellus%20de%20Exordio">Libellus de Exordio</a>" and other sources write about the same event, they say that Siward attacked and killed Eadulf. It was thus that Siward became earl of all Northumbria, perhaps the first person to do so since Uhtred the Bold. It is possible that Siward used Ælfflæd's lineage to claim the earldom of Bamburgh for himself, although it is unclear whether the marriage took place before or after Siward killed Eadulf. Kapelle has pointed out that no ruler of Bamburgh after Uhtred is attested at the English royal court, which he argued "must mean they were in revolt" against the monarchy, and that Siward's attack may therefore have been encouraged by a monarch wishing to crush a rebellious or disloyal vassal. Siward however probably had his own interests too. Killing Eadulf eliminated his main rival in the north, and the marriage associated him with the family of Uhtred the Bold, and with Uhtred's surviving son <a href="Gospatric%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Gospatric</a>.

There may nonetheless be a connection between the murder of Eadulf and events further south. For the same year the "Chronicle" of John of Worcester related that, because of an attack on two of Harthacnut's tax-collectors there, Siward took part in a reprisal on the city and monastery of <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>. Harthacnut reigned only another year, dying on 8 June 1042. He was succeeded by the exiled English <a href="%C3%A6theling">ætheling</a> Edward. As an ætheling, a royal prince with a present or likely future claim on the throne, Edward appears to have been invited back by Harthacnut in 1041, fortuitously smoothing over the coming change in ruler. Edward was crowned king on <a href="Easter%20Day">Easter Day</a>, 3 April 1043.

Relations between Siward and King Edward appear to have been good. Neither Siward nor any associates of Siward were punished by Edward in later years. In fact, Siward appears to have been one of Edward's most powerful supporters. On 16 November 1043, Siward, along with Earls Godwine of Wessex and <a href="Leofric%20of%20Mercia">Leofric of Mercia</a>, marched with King Edward against his mother, <a href="Emma%20of%20Normandy">Queen Emma</a>, helping the king to deprive the queen of her huge treasury. Edward then accused Emma of treason and deposed <a href="Stigand">Stigand</a>, <a href="List%20of%20the%20bishops%20of%20the%20Diocese%20of%20Norwich%2C%20England%20and%20its%20precursor%20offices">Bishop of Elmham</a>, from his position "because he was closest to his mother's counsel".

The Norman propagandist and historian, <a href="William%20of%20Poitiers">William of Poitiers</a>, claimed that Siward was among those who had sworn an oath to uphold Edward the Confessor's alleged declaration that <a href="William%2C%20Duke%20of%20Normandy">William, Duke of Normandy</a> (later King William I), was to be his heir. Others said to have made that oath were Earls Godwine of Wessex and Leofric of Mercia, along with Stigand, who had been pardoned in 1044, and raised to <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> in 1047. If this did happen, it was probably during or a little before spring 1051, when <a href="Robert%20of%20Jumi%C3%A8ges">Robert</a>, <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, was journeying to Rome for his <a href="pallium">pallium</a>.

In 1051 Siward, along with Earls Leofric and <a href="Ralph%20the%20Timid">Ralph the Timid</a>, mobilised forces in defence of the king against a rebellion by Earl Godwine and <a href="House%20of%20Godwin">his sons</a>. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" relates that although Siward had to call up reinforcements, King Edward was successful and Earl Godwine was temporarily exiled. Earl Godwine remained a threat in exile, and the continued "belligerent support" of Siward and Leofric was thus vital to King Edward's safety. It was apparently, however, the reluctance of these two earls to fight Earl Godwine that contributed to Godwine's re-establishment in England in 1052.

There is evidence to suggest that Siward extended his power southward, bringing the <a href="Northamptonshire">shire of Northampton</a> into his control in the 1040s and the <a href="shire%20of%20Huntingdon">shire of Huntingdon</a> in the 1050s. The evidence comes from royal <a href="writ">writ</a>s addressed to Siward as earl in these shires. Siward's predecessors as earl in these areas were other Scandinavians, Thuri and <a href="Beorn%20Estrithson">Bjorn</a> son of <a href="Ulf%20the%20Earl">Earl Ulf</a>; the former was styled "earl of the Midlanders" ("comes mediterraneorum"), showing that this earldom represented the earlier polity of the <a href="Middle%20Angles">Middle Angles</a> of Mercia. It was this area, rather than Northumbria, to which Siward's descendants were most attached.

Likewise, it has been argued that Siward brought <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, thought by some historians to have been lost to Strathclyde, back under Northumbrian lordship. The evidence comes from a document known to historians as "Gospatric's Writ". This is a written instruction, issued either by the future <a href="Gospatric%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria</a>, or Gospatric, son of Earl Uhtred, that was addressed to all Gospatric's kindred and to the notables dwelling in the "all the lands that were Cumbrian" ("on eallun þam landann þeo Cōmbres"); it ordered that one Thorfinn mac Thore be free in all things ("þ Thorfynn mac Thore beo swa freo in eallan ðynges") in <a href="Allerdale">Allerdale</a>, and that no man is to break the peace which was given by Gospatric and Earl Siward. Historians such as Charles Phythian-Adams believed that such phraseology indicated that Siward conquered the region from its previous rulers, although others, like William Kapelle, believed that the region had come, were it ever lost, back into English power before Siward's time.

A little can be said about Siward's relations with the Northumbrian church, in particular with regard to his relations with <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a>. As a result of Siward's marriage to Ælfflæd, Siward gained possession of a group of estates in <a href="Teesside">Teesside</a> claimed by the bishops of Durham. Acquisition of these estates might have brought opposition from the <a href="List%20of%20Bishops%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, but <a href="%C3%86thelric%20%28Bishop%20of%20Durham%29">Æthelric</a> the incumbent had been expelled by the clergy of Durham in either 1045 or 1046 and, according to the "<a href="Libellus%20de%20Exordio">Libellus de Exordio</a>", only returned by bribing Siward. According to the "Libellus", the clergy were "terrified and overwhelmed by the fearful power of the earl" and "were compelled willy nilly to be reconciled to the bishop, and to admit him into his episcopal see". Despite this, Siward escaped censure in the writings of later Durham monks, something which suggests relations between Siward and Durham were probably good in general.

Siward can be found witnessing numerous charters during Edward's reign, though not as many as the Godwinsons; Siward usually comes third in lists of earls, behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine's sons and the other earls. He witnessed at least seven, possibly nine, extant charters in 1044, six or seven in 1045, two in 1046, one in 1048 and one in 1049. A "Dux" ("earl") named Sihroþ and Sihroð witnessed two charters in 1050, and this may be Siward. There is another attestation in 1050, and his name appears in two dubious witness lists attached to charters dating to 1052 and 1054. Possibly Siward's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made—probably at <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a>—between <a href="Wulfwig">Wulfwig</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Dorchester</a>, and Earl Leofric, dating to between 1053 and 1055.

Siward is perhaps most famous for his expedition in 1054 against <a href="Macbeth%2C%20King%20of%20Scotland">Macbeth, King of Scotland</a>, an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son, <a href="Osbjorn%20Bulax">Osbjorn</a>. The origin of Siward's conflict with the Scots is unclear. According to the "Libellus de Exordio", in 1039 or 1040, the Scottish king <a href="Donnchad%20mac%20Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1in">Donnchad mac Crínáin</a> attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham. Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad. The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though no connection between the two events is clear it is likely that they were linked.

The "Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham", written in the early 12th century, relate under the year 1046 that "Earl Siward with a great army came to Scotland, and expelled king Mac Bethad, and appointed another; but after his departure Mac Bethad recovered his kingdom". Historian William Kapelle thought that this was a genuine event of the 1040s, related to the "Annals of Tigernach" entry for 1045 that reported a "battle between the Scots" which led to the death of <a href="Cr%C3%ADn%C3%A1n%20of%20Dunkeld">Crínán of Dunkeld</a>, Donnchad's father; Kapelle thought that Siward had tried to place Crínán's son and Donnchad's brother Maldred on the Scottish throne. Another historian, <a href="Alex%20Woolf">Alex Woolf</a>, argued that the "Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham" entry was probably referring to the invasion of Siward in 1054, but misplaced under 1046.

During the invasion of 1054, a battle was fought somewhere in Scotland north of the <a href="Firth%20of%20Forth">Firth of Forth</a>, a battle known variously as the "Battle of the Seven Sleepers" or the "Battle of Dunsinane". The tradition that the battle actually took place at <a href="Dunsinane%20Hill">Dunsinane</a> has its origins in later medieval legend. The earliest mention of Dunsinane as the location of the battle is in the early 15th century by <a href="Andrew%20of%20Wyntoun">Andrew of Wyntoun</a>.

The earliest contemporary English account of the battle is found in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", <a href="recension">recension</a> D: 

The battle is mentioned in the Irish annals too, briefly in the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Tigernach">Annals of Tigernach</a>" and more extensively in the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Ulster">Annals of Ulster</a>":

Dolfin is unidentified, but may have been a relation of Mac Bethad's enemy Crínán of Dunkeld, on the basis that some of Crínán's descendants may have borne this name.
The purpose of Siward's invasion is unclear, but it may be related to the identity of the "Máel Coluim" (Malcolm) mentioned in the sources. The early 12th-century chronicle attributed to John of Worcester, probably using an earlier source, wrote that Siward defeated Mac Bethad and made "<a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%2C%20son%20of%20the%20king%20of%20the%20Cumbrians">Máel Coluim, son of the king of the Cumbrians</a>" a king ("Malcolmum, regis Cumbrorum filium, ut rex jusserat, regem constituit"). The identity of Máel Coluim and the reasons for Siward's help are controversial. The traditional historical interpretation was that "Máel Coluim" is <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%20mac%20Donnchada">Máel Coluim mac Donnchada</a>, known sometimes today as Malcolm III or Malcolm Canmore, and that Siward was attempting to oust Mac Bethad in his favour.

The traditional historical interpretation that "Máel Coluim" is Máel Coluim mac Donnchada derives from the "Chronicle" attributed to the 14th-century chronicler of Scotland, John of Fordun, as well as from earlier sources such as William of Malmesbury. The latter reported that Mac Bethad was killed in the battle by Siward, but it is known that Mac Bethad outlived Siward by two years. <a href="A.%20A.%20M.%20Duncan">A. A. M. Duncan</a> argued in 2002 that, using the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" entry as their source, later writers innocently misidentified Máel Coluim "son of the king of the Cumbrians" with the later Scottish king of the same name. Duncan's argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in the era, such as <a href="Richard%20Oram">Richard Oram</a>, <a href="Dauvit%20Broun">Dauvit Broun</a> and Alex Woolf. It has also been suggested that Máel Coluim may have been a son of the Strathclyde British king <a href="Owain%20Foel">Owain Foel</a>, perhaps by a daughter of <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%20II">Máel Coluim II</a>, King of Scotland.

Duncan in fact believes that the Battle of the Seven Sleepers did not lead directly to a change of leadership in the Kingdom of Scotland. It has been suggested that the chief consequence of Siward's expedition was not the overthrow of Mac Bethad, but the transfer of British territory—perhaps previously lying under Scottish suzerainty—to Northumbrian overlordship. Alex Woolf has posited that, in such a context, Máel Coluim might have been a discontented Cumbrian prince who had been forced to "put himself under English protection". Evidence for Northumbrian control of <a href="Strathclyde">Strathclyde</a> in this period includes 11th-century Northumbrian masonry found at the site of Glasgow Cathedral as well as early 12th-century claims from the <a href="archbishopric%20of%20York">archbishopric of York</a> that Archbishop <a href="Cynesige">Cynesige</a> (1051–1060) had consecrated two <a href="Bishops%20of%20Glasgow">Bishops of Glasgow</a>.

The 12th-century historian, Henry of Huntingdon, in his "Historia Anglorum", relates that when Siward was attacked by <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, fearing to die "like a cow" and wishing rather to die like a soldier, he clothed himself in armour and took to hand an axe and shield. Ennobled in such a manner, Siward died. This anecdote is of doubtful historicity, and is thought to be derived from the <a href="saga">saga</a> devoted to Earl Siward, now lost. The "Vita Ædwardi Regis" states that Siward died at York and was buried in "the monastery of St Olaf" at <a href="Galmanho">Galmanho</a>, a claim confirmed by the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", John of Worcester, and the "<a href="Historia%20Regum">Historia Regum</a>".

Material incorporated in two surviving sources is thought by some to attest to the existence of a lost saga or some other kind of literary tradition concerning Siward's life. The first source is the "Vita et Passio Waldevi", a hagiographic history of Siward's cult-inspiring son Waltheof. This text contains an account of Waltheof's <a href="Father">paternal</a> origin, and in the process recounts certain adventures of his father Siward . The second major witness of the tradition is Henry of Huntingdon's "Historia Anglorum", which contains extracts of saga-like material relating to Siward's invasion of Scotland (1054) and his death (1055). The Anglo-Saxonist <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> declared that Siward was "not a statesman, but a Danish warrior of the primitive type". Writers in the half-century after his death remembered Siward as a strong ruler who brought peace and suppressed brigandage.

Siward died more than a decade before the death of Edward the Confessor, but despite this the "<a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>" recorded 4 manors, 3 in Yorkshire and 1 in Derbyshire, owned directly by Earl Siward in 1066, all of them subsequently held by <a href="Hugh%20d%27Avranches%2C%20Earl%20of%20Chester">Hugh d'Avranches, Earl of Chester</a>. This land was stated to have been worth £212, while his son Waltheof was said to have held £136 worth of land across 9 counties. Domesday records give an incomplete picture of Siward's holdings. In total it recorded property worth £348 for Siward and his son, which on its own would compare poorly with the £2493 in value recorded to have been held by the family of the earls of Mercia. Of the latter, however, <a href="Morcar%20of%20Northumbria">Morcar of Mercia</a>, Earl of Northumbria on the day of King Edward's death, possessed land worth £968, while Tostig, exiled earl at the time, had land worth £491; both may have come into possession of some of Siward's land in the course of becoming Earls of Northumbria. Moreover, the counties that would become <a href="County%20Durham">Durham</a>, <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>, <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> and <a href="Westmorland">Westmorland</a> were largely omitted from the survey, while, besides being only very poorly documented, the lands in Yorkshire had been severely devastated and devalued during the <a href="Harrying%20of%20the%20North">Harrying of the North</a>.

Siward is said to have built a church dedicated to St Olaf at Galmanho, York. The record of his burial in this church is the only notice of a non-royal lay burial inside a church in pre-Norman England. <a href="Siward%27s%20Howe">Siward's Howe</a>, "i.e.", Heslington Hill near York, was most likely named after Earl Siward, although probably because Siward held popular courts there rather than because it was his burial place.

One of Siward's sons is known to have survived him, Waltheof, whose mother was Ælfflæd. Waltheof later rose to be an earl in the <a href="East%20Midlands">East Midlands</a> before becoming Earl of Northumbria. When Waltheof rebelled against William the Conqueror, however, the act led to his execution and to his subsequent veneration as a <a href="saint">saint</a> at <a href="Crowland%20Abbey">Crowland Abbey</a>. Waltheof's daughter married <a href="David%20I%2C%20King%20of%20the%20Scots">David I, King of the Scots</a>, and through this connection Siward became one of the many ancestors of the later Scottish and British monarchs.

Besides Ælfflæd, Siward is known to have been married to a woman named Godgifu, who died before Siward. The marriage is known from a grant she made of territory around <a href="Stamford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Stamford, Lincolnshire</a>, to <a href="Peterborough%20Abbey">Peterborough Abbey</a>. Although no surviving children are attested, and no source states the name of Osbjorn's mother, this marriage has nonetheless raised the possibility that Waltheof and Osbjorn were born to different mothers, and William Kapelle suggested that Siward may have originally intended Osbjorn to inherit his southern territories while Waltheof inherited those territories in the north associated with the family of his mother Ælfflæd.

Louise Bryant

Louise Bryant (December 5, 1885 – January 6, 1936) was an American <a href="feminist">feminist</a>, <a href="political%20activist">political activist</a>, and <a href="journalist">journalist</a> best known for her sympathetic coverage of Russia and the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> during the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. Bryant, who married fellow journalist <a href="John%20Reed%20%28journalist%29">John Reed</a> (her second husband) in 1916, wrote about Russian leaders such as <a href="Catherine%20Breshkovsky">Katherine Breshkovsky</a>, <a href="Maria%20Spiridonova">Maria Spiridonova</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a>, <a href="Vladimir%20Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a>, and <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Leon Trotsky</a>. Her news stories, distributed by <a href="Hearst%20Corporation">Hearst</a> during and after her trips to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Petrograd</a> and Moscow, appeared in newspapers across the United States and Canada in the years immediately following <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. A collection of articles from her first trip was published in 1918 as "Six Red Months in Russia". Over the next year, she defended the revolution in testimony before the <a href="Overman%20Committee">Overman Committee</a>, a <a href="U.S.%20Senate">Senate</a> subcommittee established to investigate Bolshevik influence in the United States. Later in 1919, she undertook a nationwide speaking tour to encourage public support of the Bolsheviks and to denounce <a href="Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War">armed U.S. intervention in Russia</a>.

Born Anna Louise Mohan, as a young girl she began using the last name of her stepfather, Sheridan Bryant, in preference to that of her father. She grew up in rural <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> and attended the <a href="University%20of%20Nevada%2C%20Reno">University of Nevada</a> in <a href="Reno%2C%20Nevada">Reno</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a> in <a href="Eugene%2C%20Oregon">Eugene</a>, graduating with a degree in history in 1909. Pursuing a career in journalism, she became society editor of the "Spectator" and <a href="freelancer">freelanced</a> for "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>", newspapers in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. During her years in that city (1909–1915), she became active in the <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage</a> movement. Leaving her first husband in 1915 to follow Reed to <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, she formed friendships with leading feminists of the day, some of whom she met through Reed's associates at publications such as "The Masses"; at meetings of a women's group, <a href="Heterodoxy%20%28group%29">Heterodoxy</a>; and through work with the <a href="Provincetown%20Players">Provincetown Players</a>. During a <a href="National%20Woman%27s%20Party">National Woman's Party</a> suffrage rally in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, in 1919, she was arrested and spent three days in jail. Both she and Reed took lovers outside marriage; during her Greenwich Village years (1916–1920) for her these included the playwright <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a> and the painter <a href="Andrew%20Dasburg">Andrew Dasburg</a>.

After Reed's death from <a href="typhus">typhus</a> in 1920, Bryant continued to write for Hearst about Russia and also about Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Italy, and other countries in Europe and the Middle East. Some articles from this period were collected in 1923 under the title "Mirrors of Moscow". Later that year she married <a href="William%20Christian%20Bullitt%20Jr.">William C. Bullitt, Jr.</a>, with whom she had her only child, <a href="Anne%20Moen%20Bullitt">Anne</a>, the following year. Suffering in her later years from the rare and painful disorder <a href="adiposis%20dolorosa">adiposis dolorosa</a>, Bryant did little writing or publishing in her last decade, and drank heavily. Bullitt, winning sole custody of Anne, divorced Bryant in 1930. Bryant died in Paris in 1936 and was buried in <a href="Versailles%20%28city%29">Versailles</a>. In 1998, a group from Portland restored her grave, which had become neglected.

Anna Louise Mohan was born in 1885 in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, California. Her father, Hugh Mohan, born in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, became a journalist and <a href="Stump%20speech%20%28politics%29">stump speaker</a> involved in labor issues and <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> politics. Moving to San Francisco, he continued to write for newspapers, and in 1880 he married Louisa Flick, who grew up on the ranch of her stepfather, James Say, near <a href="Lake%20Humboldt">Humboldt Lake</a> in <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>. The Mohans had two children, Barbara (1880) and Louis (1882), before the birth of Anna Louise. Later in 1885, the family moved to <a href="Reno%2C%20Nevada">Reno</a>, where Mohan continued his journalistic career but drank heavily. One day he departed and never returned to his wife and children. Louise's mother divorced him in 1889 and married Sheridan Bryant, a freight conductor on the <a href="Southern%20Pacific">Southern Pacific</a> railway. The couple had two children, Floyd (1894) and William (1896). Although the family lived in <a href="Wadsworth%2C%20Nevada">Wadsworth, Nevada</a>, Louise accepted an invitation from James Say to live at his ranch. She remained there for three or four years, returning to Wadsworth at her mother's insistence at the age of 12. Bryant adopted her stepfather's last name, but never changed it legally from Mohan.
Attending high school in Wadsworth and Reno and college at <a href="Nevada%20State%20University">Nevada State University</a> (now known as the University of Nevada, Reno), Bryant developed interests in journalism, debate, illustration, social life, dancing, and basketball. She edited the "Young Ladies Edition" of the "Student Record" in 1905, wrote a short story, "The Way of a Flirt", for a literary magazine, "Chuckwalla", and contributed sketches to it and another publication, "Artemisia". Depressed after the death of her step-grandfather in 1906, Bryant left school for a job in <a href="Jolon%2C%20California">Jolon, California</a>, where for a few months she boarded at a cattle ranch and taught children, mostly young Mexicans. That summer she moved to <a href="Eugene%2C%20Oregon">Eugene, Oregon</a>, where her brother Louis worked for the <a href="Southern%20Pacific%20Transportation%20Company">Southern Pacific</a>.

After learning that she could transfer her college credits from Nevada, she enrolled at the <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a>, in Eugene. Popular at the school, which then had a total student enrollment of less than 500, she helped start a small <a href="sorority">sorority</a>, Zeta Iota Phi (a chapter of <a href="Chi%20Omega">Chi Omega</a>), and served as its first president. During her time in Eugene, she produced poems and pen-and-ink sketches for the "Oregon Monthly". In a small city steeped in "puritan moralism", she was the first to wear <a href="Rouge%20%28cosmetics%29">rouge</a> on campus; she had multiple boyfriends, and she wore clothes that <a href="Miriam%20Van%20Waters">Miriam Van Waters</a>, the editor of the "Oregon Monthly", and <a href="Luella%20Clay%20Carson">Luella Clay Carson</a>, the <a href="dean%20of%20women">dean of women</a>, considered improper. Taking off the spring semester of 1908 to teach in a one-room schoolhouse on <a href="Stuart%20Island%20%28Washington%29">Stuart Island</a>, one of the <a href="San%20Juan%20Islands">San Juan Islands</a> near the U.S. border with Canada, she returned to Eugene to finish her bachelor's degree in history, graduating in early 1909. Her senior thesis was on the <a href="Modoc%20War">Modoc Indian Wars</a>.

In the spring of 1909, Bryant moved to Portland, first sharing a downtown apartment with one of her college friends, Clara Wold, then renting her own apartment in the same building. Among her jobs, she designed a stained-glass window for the <a href="Povey%20Brothers%20Studio">Povey Brothers</a>, worked as a freelance reporter for "<a href="The%20Oregonian">The Oregonian</a>", and became an illustrator and society editor for the "Portland Spectator", a weekly news magazine. Meanwhile, she formed friendships with people—such as Cas Baer, drama editor for "The Oregonian"—who were interested in journalism and the arts. In late 1909, she met and married Paul Trullinger, a dentist who lived on a houseboat on the <a href="Willamette%20River">Willamette River</a>, collected art, and liked drinking parties that sometimes included invitations to his office to inhale <a href="ether">ether</a>.

Bryant, who retained her maiden name and her downtown apartment after her marriage to Trullinger, bridled at doing housework and yearned for professional advancement. Drawn toward politics and the <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage movement</a> by her friend <a href="Sara%20Bard%20Field">Sara Bard Field</a>, she joined the Oregon branch of the <a href="College%20Equal%20Suffrage%20League">College Equal Suffrage League</a> in 1912. She and Field gave pro-suffrage speeches in smaller Oregon cities, and Bryant rode on the suffrage float in Portland's annual <a href="Flag%20Day%20%28United%20States%29">Flag Day</a> parade. Led by <a href="Abigail%20Scott%20Duniway">Abigail Scott Duniway</a>, women achieved suffrage in Oregon later that year.

Bryant became familiar with the <a href="socialist">socialist</a> journal "<a href="The%20Masses">The Masses</a>" through Portland resident and lawyer <a href="Charles%20Erskine%20Scott%20Wood">C. E. S. Wood</a>, who eventually married Field and who often contributed to the magazine. Enthusiastic about its contents, particularly articles by Portland native <a href="John%20Reed%20%28journalist%29">John Reed</a>, Bryant began raising subscriptions for it. <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, a well-known <a href="Anarchism">anarchist</a> whom Wood had defended in court, gave a speech in Reed's honor at the <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">Industrial Workers of the World</a> (IWW) hall in Portland. She and other political activists, such as <a href="Alexander%20Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a>, were among guests entertained by Bryant and her husband. In 1914, Reed, a <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a> graduate and established writer who by then lived in <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, came home for a visit, during which he spoke at the <a href="University%20Club%20%28Portland%2C%20Oregon%29">University Club</a> of Portland against the <a href="Social%20class">class system</a>. Exactly how or when or how often Bryant and Reed met is uncertain, but near Christmas 1915 when Reed again came home to visit his widowed mother, the young couple announced their love at a dinner party. Reed returned to Greenwich Village on December 28, and Bryant, abandoning her marriage, followed him three days later. Trullinger filed for divorce, which was granted in July 1916, on grounds of desertion.

 Reed had rented a room for Bryant near his apartment at 43 Washington Square. Their unmarried co-habitation caused little curiosity among Reed's friends in the Village, many of whom rejected marriage and other middle-class norms. Unified by an "air of intellectual freedom, moral laissez-faire and camaraderie", most were involved in literary, artistic, or political pursuits in a <a href="Bohemianism">Bohemian</a> neighborhood that in some ways resembled the <a href="Rive%20Gauche%20%28Paris%29">Left Bank</a> of Paris. While visiting New York, Field took Bryant to a meeting of <a href="Heterodoxy%20%28group%29">Heterodoxy</a>, a women's group that included <a href="feminist">feminist</a> <a href="Charlotte%20Perkins%20Gilman">Charlotte Perkins Gilman</a>, journalist <a href="Mary%20Heaton%20Vorse">Mary Heaton Vorse</a>, <a href="political%20activist">political activist</a> <a href="Crystal%20Eastman">Crystal Eastman</a>, actress <a href="Ida%20Rauh">Ida Rauh</a>, writers <a href="Zona%20Gale">Zona Gale</a> and <a href="Mary%20Hunter%20Austin">Mary Austin</a>, and many others. Among Bryant's new friends were feminists <a href="Inez%20Milholland">Inez Milholland</a>, <a href="Inez%20Haynes%20Irwin">Inez Gillmore</a>, and <a href="Doris%20Stevens">Doris Stevens</a>. Other notables circulating in the Village included Emma Goldman, playwright <a href="Eugene%20O%27Neill">Eugene O'Neill</a>, and one of Reed's former lovers, arts patron <a href="Mabel%20Dodge%20Luhan">Mabel Dodge</a>.

At Number 43, Bryant and Reed pursued their journalistic endeavors in separate work rooms. Four months after leaving Oregon, Bryant broke into print in New York with an article about two Portland judges, one of whom had dismissed a case brought against Goldman for distributing <a href="Birth%20control%20movement%20in%20the%20United%20States">birth-control information</a>. It was published as "Two Judges" in the April 1916 issue of "The Masses", edited by <a href="Max%20Eastman">Max Eastman</a>, Crystal Eastman's brother. Meanwhile, Reed, who had reported on the <a href="1913%20Paterson%20silk%20strike">1913 Paterson silk strike</a>, <a href="Pancho%20Villa">Pancho Villa</a> in 1913–14, and the ongoing war (World War I) in Europe, went on assignment for "<a href="Collier%27s">Collier's</a>" to interview <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> in Florida.

Later that spring Bryant and Reed heeded Vorse's call to spend the warm season in <a href="Provincetown%2C%20Massachusetts">Provincetown, Massachusetts</a>, at the tip of <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a>, and to take part in the communal theater productions of the <a href="Provincetown%20Players">Provincetown Players</a>. Others from the Village went as well and joined the group, organized in 1915 by <a href="George%20Cram%20Cook">George Cram Cook</a> and his wife, <a href="Susan%20Glaspell">Susan Glaspell</a>, who hoped to produce plays that were both political and artistic. Among the works the group staged in 1916 were Bryant's "The Game", in which characters named Life and Death play dice for the lives of Youth (a poet) and Girl (a dancer). It appeared on the same bill as "Not Smart" by <a href="Wilbur%20Daniel%20Steele">Wilbur Steele</a> and "Bound East for Cardiff" by O'Neill.

During the summer, Reed left Cape Cod to cover the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201912%29">Progressive Party</a> convention in Chicago, and at other times he retreated from the players to work on articles for "Collier's" and "<a href="Metropolitan%20Magazine%20%28New%20York%29">Metropolitan Magazine</a>". During these absences, Bryant and O'Neill became lovers, not surprising in a group that professed and practiced <a href="free%20love">free love</a>. Reed, made aware of this new development, responded by inviting O'Neill to begin taking his meals with them. In a note to Field, Bryant said that her relationship with Reed was "so beautiful and so free! ... We don't "interfere" with each other at all ... we feel like children who will never grow up."

 After spending the month of September 1916 in a cottage they bought in <a href="Truro%2C%20Massachusetts">Truro</a>, Bryant and Reed returned to Greenwich Village, where the Provincetown Players planned to establish an alternative to <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> theater. On weekends, they sojourned at <a href="Croton-on-Hudson%2C%20New%20York">Croton-on-Hudson</a>, upriver from New York City, where Villagers including Eastman, Dodge, and illustrator <a href="Boardman%20Robinson">Boardman Robinson</a> and his wife had cottages. In October, Bryant and Reed bought their own place in Croton-on-Hudson. Meanwhile, Reed, who had suffered from kidney ailments since childhood, was told by his doctors that he would need to have a kidney removed. The surgery, considered "gravely serious", was scheduled for mid-November. Reed wanted to protect Bryant by making her his legal heir, and they married on November 9 at the county clerk's office in <a href="Peekskill%2C%20New%20York">Peekskill</a> before Reed left on November 12 for surgery at <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> in Baltimore.

Compounding their difficulties were Bryant's ongoing relationship with O'Neill and gynecological problems she was treated for while Reed was in the hospital. When he returned from Baltimore in mid-December, Reed and Bryant retreated full-time to Croton-on-Hudson to recuperate and to focus on writing. They made plans to travel to China in 1917 to cover events for American publications, but in January the plans fell through when U.S. entry into <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> against Germany became highly likely. (The U.S. entered the war on April 6.) To boost their finances, they sold the cottage in Truro to <a href="Margaret%20Sanger">Margaret Sanger</a>, and Reed pawned his father's gold watch. At the same time, his strong anti-war positions, enunciated in "The Masses" and elsewhere, alienated most of his employers, further reducing his income. Adding to these stresses was Reed's confession to Bryant that he had had multiple love affairs, and the subsequent unhappiness between Bryant and Reed led to a temporary separation. When she expressed a desire to go to Europe, he helped her convince <a href="John%20Neville%20Wheeler">John N. Wheeler</a>, who had recently formed the <a href="Bell%20Syndicate">Bell Syndicate</a>, to issue her a <a href="press%20pass">press pass</a>. Reed paid for her passage, and Bryant set sail in June to cover the war in France. Regrets quickly followed. According to Bryant biographer Virginia Gardner:

No sooner had they parted on board the ship than both Reed and Bryant were assailed by misgivings. An outpouring of letters from either side of the Atlantic followed. Both were suffering, both were confused, lonely, and miserable ... [The letters were] proof of the basically strong bond that held the two, the poet-reporter and social critic and the erratic, appealing woman he had rescued from the banality of middle-class existence in Portland.

On the voyage across the Atlantic, Bryant interviewed ambulance-service troops and others on board the "Espagne" and wrote news stories about them and about the threat of <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a> attacks. When she arrived in Paris, Bryant tried for several weeks to obtain permission from French authorities to visit the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a>, but could not do so because of her limited journalistic experience and her sex. She ended up collecting information about the war from as many sources as she could meet in Paris, and sent her news stories to Reed, who edited them and forwarded them to Wheeler.

 In mid-August, when Bryant returned from France, Reed met her at the dock and told her to prepare to go to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Petrograd</a> four days later to cover the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. Eastman of "The Masses" had raised funds to pay Reed's travel expenses, and the Bell Syndicate assigned Bryant to report on the war "from a woman's point of view". Leaving New York on August 17, they arrived in Petrograd, which was then the capital of Russia, about six months after the forced abdication of the last Russian <a href="czar">czar</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20II%20of%20Russia">Nicholas II</a>. Headed by <a href="Alexander%20Kerensky">Alexander Kerensky</a>, the provisional government that had succeeded the czar had already survived an attempted <a href="coup%20d%27etat">putsch</a> by Major General <a href="Lavr%20Kornilov">Lavr Kornilov</a>. Bryant and Reed entered the city after the <a href="Kornilov%20Affair">Kornilov Affair</a> and before the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> overthrew the Kerensky government in the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a>.

Reconciled as a couple, and working from their room at the <a href="Angleterre%20Hotel">Angleterre Hotel</a>, Bryant and Reed attended gatherings at the <a href="Smolny%20Institute">Smolny Institute</a> and elsewhere in Petrograd and interviewed many leading political figures, including <a href="Lenin">Lenin</a>, <a href="Trotsky">Trotsky</a>, and Kerensky, and both eventually compiled books—"Six Red Months in Russia" by Bryant and Reed's "Ten Days That Shook the World"—from their articles. Bryant circulated widely, covering <a href="Duma">Duma</a> meetings, dining in public mess halls with soldiers and workers, and interviewing women revolutionaries. Among those were <a href="Catherine%20Breshkovsky">Katherine Breshkovsky</a>, known as the "grandmother of the revolution", <a href="Maria%20Spiridonova">Maria Spiridonova</a>, whom Bryant considered the most powerful woman in Russia, and <a href="Aleksandra%20Kollontai">Aleksandra Kollontai</a>, who became People's Commissar of Social Welfare and the only woman in the Bolshevik cabinet. In the process, Bryant, who had often been overshadowed by her more famous husband, gained confidence in her professional reporting skills. By the time she returned to New York, her work was being read across North America. Gardner says:

[The] springtime of 1918 in the United States was a time of heightened contradictions. Openmindedness about the new Russian experiment in cities and the hinterland coexisted with the intensified patriotism of wartime ... No matter what appeared in their editorial pages, newspaper editors knew that feature stories with first-hand knowledge of the Revolution sold papers. The conservative and Republican Philadelphia <a href="Public%20Ledger%20Syndicate">"Public Ledger" syndicate</a> bought Bryant's thirty-two stories and sold them to Hearst's "New York American" and to more than one hundred newspapers over the United States and Canada.

Leaving Russia before Reed, who wanted to report on the Bolshevik debate about Russian participation in the war with Germany, Bryant returned to New York, arriving on February 18, 1918. She found Greenwich Village much changed by the war: old friends had moved, rents had gone up, and tourists were replacing bohemians. Under government pressure, "The Masses" had shut down. Working out of a room at the Brevoort Hotel, Bryant wrote articles about the October Revolution and speeches or cables urging support of the workers' government in Russia.

Meanwhile, Reed, who was trying to get home, was unable to get State Department clearance for a visa and was detained in <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a> (then called "Christiana"), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not hear from him directly until April. On orders from <a href="Sisson%20Documents">Edgar Sisson</a> of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.

In August, during a long weekend in the arts colony at <a href="Woodstock%2C%20New%20York">Woodstock</a>, Bryant began what was to be a long-term, intermittent love affair with painter <a href="Andrew%20Dasburg">Andrew Dasburg</a>, with whom she had been close for a couple of years. Returning to the Village in September, Bryant and Reed rented a small house at 1 <a href="Patchin%20Place">Patchin Place</a>. Later in the month, Reed was arrested for giving a speech in which he denounced the <a href="Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War">use of Allied troops in Russia</a>; the specific charge against him was that he had used "disloyal, scurrilous and abusive language about the Military and Naval Forces of the United States". He was released on $5,000 <a href="bail">bail</a>. In separate cases that year, Reed stood trial with Eastman, <a href="Floyd%20Dell">Floyd Dell</a>, and others from the former staff of "The Masses" for conspiracy to obstruct <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">the draft</a> of men to fight in World War I and for other alleged offenses related to published articles and cartoons; Reed's alleged crime in the latter case was that he had written a headline, "Knit a Strait-Jacket for Your Soldier Boy", for an article about mental illness among the U.S. troops. Bryant was questioned in "The Masses" cases but not charged. Both trials involving "The Masses" ended in <a href="hung%20jury">hung juries</a>, and the defendants were set free. In October, Bryant's first book, "Six Red Months in Russia", was published to "mostly favorable reviews," and Reed resumed work on "Ten Days That Shook the World" after the government returned his notes. It would not be published until April 1919.
In February 1919, while still based in New York, Bryant went to Washington, D.C., to speak, along with <a href="Albert%20Rhys%20Williams">Albert Rhys Williams</a>, about the situation in Russia. She stayed in Washington long enough to participate in a <a href="National%20Woman%27s%20Party">National Woman's Party</a> suffrage rally, during which she was arrested, <a href="arraigned">arraigned</a>, and sentenced to five days in jail. The specific charges against her and others, who had burned President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> in <a href="effigy">effigy</a> on the <a href="White%20House">White House</a> lawn, were "building fires on government property, standing on the coping around the White House, or attempting to make disorderly speeches." Among a group of women who refused <a href="bail">bail</a>, she spent at least three days in jail, during which she took part in a <a href="hunger%20strike">hunger strike</a>. Upon her release, she insisted on testifying as an unfriendly witness before the <a href="Overman%20Committee">Overman Committee</a>, which had been set up to investigate Bolshevik activity in the United States. Deflecting questions about her religious beliefs, marriages, and other personal matters during her two days of testimony, she tried to convince the subcommittee, led by Senator <a href="Lee%20Slater%20Overman">Lee S. Overman</a>, that Russia had a right to self-determination. Soon thereafter, she began a cross-country speaking tour, "The Truth About Russia", arranged by <a href="Anna%20Louise%20Strong">Anna Louise Strong</a>, during which she addressed large audiences in Detroit, Chicago, Spokane, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and other American cities. According to Gardner, Bryant was the first woman to defend Lenin and Trotsky at political gatherings across the United States. Gardner writes, "Her message was simple, 'Hands off Russia!' 'Bring the boys home!'"

After Bryant returned from her lecture tour in May, she and Reed spent the next few months mainly in Croton-on-Hudson writing, gardening, and in Reed's case, recuperating from <a href="influenza">influenza</a>. In late August, Reed, who had joined the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist Party of America</a>, was chosen by one of its factions, the <a href="Communist%20Labor%20Party%20of%20America">Communist Labor Party of America</a> (CLP), to visit Moscow to seek recognition for the CLP as the sole representative of the <a href="Comintern">Communist International</a> (Comintern) in the United States. Unlike Reed, Bryant avoided party membership. The U.S. government quickly outlawed the CLP and its competitor, the <a href="American%20Communist%20Party">American Communist Party</a>, headed by <a href="Louis%20Fraina">Louis Fraina</a>. In danger of being arrested and unable to get a passport to go to Russia, Reed, disguised as a <a href="Fireman%20%28steam%20engine%29">stoker</a>, left the United States in late September 1919 on a Scandinavian ship headed for Europe. During the <a href="Palmer%20Raids">Palmer Raids</a> and <a href="First%20Red%20Scare">Red Scare</a> days beginning in November 1919, he was charged with conspiring to overthrow the government by force. In March 1920, after visiting Moscow, he was arrested and incarcerated in Finland on his way home. Three months later, he was returned to Moscow in a prisoner exchange between the White (anti-Bolshevik) Finns of the <a href="Finnish%20Civil%20War">Finnish Civil War</a> and the Bolsheviks. From <a href="Tallinn">Reval</a> (Tallinn), Estonia, he cabled Bryant, "Passport home refused. Temporarily returning headquarters. Come if possible." Traveling without passport, Bryant, disguised as the wife of a Swedish businessman, arrived in Petrograd in late August 1920.

When Bryant reached Petrograd, Reed was in <a href="Baku">Baku</a>, attending the "first congress of peoples of the east" (Oriental Congress) with the Comintern executive committee. He had left a letter for her with several possibilities for lodging, one of which was a room he had arranged for her at the Dielovoy Hotel in Moscow. This is where, on September 15, they finally reconnected, spending the next few days together and visiting Lenin, Trotsky, Hungarian revolutionary <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Kun">Béla Kun</a>, and <a href="Enver%20Pasha">Enver Pasha</a>, a former minister of war in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Bryant began filing Moscow news stories with the <a href="International%20News%20Service">International News Service</a>, which had hired her before she left New York.

A week after Reed's return from Baku, he began to experience dizziness and headaches, thought at first to be symptoms of influenza. Five days later, when he became delirious, doctors diagnosed <a href="typhus">typhus</a> and sent him to the hospital. There, with Bryant by his side, he died on October 17, 1920, a few days shy of his 33rd birthday. On the day of Reed's funeral, in keeping with Russian custom, Bryant walked alone behind the hearse, at the head of the funeral procession. Fainting during the burial, she awoke in her hotel room. Among those at her bedside were Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, who had been arrested in the United States and deported to Russia in late 1919.

After Reed's death, Bryant obtained Lenin's approval for a trip to the southern Russian border and neighboring countries. She went by train over the <a href="Kazakh%20Steppe">Kazakh Steppe</a>, through areas hard hit by famine, to <a href="Tashkent">Tashkent</a> and <a href="Bukhara">Bukhara</a> and to the borders of <a href="Iran">Iran</a> and <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, interviewing and taking notes.
She returned to the U.S. in mid-summer 1921, and stayed for about a year, during which she first met <a href="William%20Christian%20Bullitt%2C%20Jr.">William Christian Bullitt, Jr.</a>, then managing editor of film stories at <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount</a>, to try to persuade him to make "Ten Days That Shook the World" into a film. Bullitt, a <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> graduate from a <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> family of great wealth, had worked as a journalist specializing in foreign affairs, then as a diplomat in the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a> before retiring temporarily from politics and taking the Paramount job. He later returned to politics and became the first U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union. Bryant and Bullet had in common their interests in Russia, journalism, and Jack Reed, whom Bullitt greatly admired. Although Paramount did not pursue the "Ten Days" project, Bullitt was charmed by Bryant and began the amorous pursuit of her that two years later ended in marriage. In August, the "New York American", a <a href="Hearst%20Corporation">Hearst</a> newspaper, began publishing a series of 16 of Bryant's articles describing famine in Russia, Lenin's <a href="New%20Economic%20Policy">New Economic Policy</a>, the end of the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>, and related topics. In general, the tone of these articles was "sober and at times unsparing, in contrast to her often rapturous reporting in her 1918 stories."

In October, she was the main speaker at a memorial for Reed in New York City, and she spent some of her time collecting Reed's papers for possible publication. She also arranged with <a href="King%20Features%20Syndicate">King Features Syndicate</a>, another Hearst agency, to return to Russia to write portraits of Russians. The first of these appeared in print in June 1922 and led to her second book, "Mirrors of Moscow", in 1923. Bryant's travels in Europe this time included Moscow, Berlin, London, Paris, and other cities. By late October, she was in Rome, accompanied by Bullitt. Here in late 1922, she wrote about <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, the Fascist leader who had just come to power and with whom she had obtained an interview. Gathering material from a variety of sources, including Madame <a href="Rachele%20Mussolini">Rachele Mussolini</a>, Bryant wrote a feature article, "Mussolini Relies Upon Efficiency to Restore Italy", published in the "New York American" in early 1923. She described the future dictator this way:

Leaving Rome to cover the <a href="Turkish%20War%20of%20Independence">Turkish War of Independence</a> for the International News Service, Bryant lived with Bullitt in a villa in <a href="Constantinople">Constantinople</a> in early 1923. While Bullitt worked on a novel, "It's Not Done", published in 1926 and dedicated to Bryant, she covered events related to the rise of <a href="Mustafa%20Kemal%20Atat%C3%BCrk">Mustafa Kemal Atatürk</a>, the first president of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Turkey">Republic of Turkey</a>. From her base in Turkey, she ventured to <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> to interview the deposed king of Greece, <a href="Constantine%20I%20of%20Greece">Constantine I</a>, and to Athens to interview his son, <a href="George%20II%20of%20Greece">George II</a>. Shortly thereafter, Bryant suspended her journalistic career to focus on family matters.

Later in 1923, Bryant and Bullitt moved to Paris, where they married in December. Two months later, Bryant gave birth to her only child, <a href="Anne%20Moen%20Bullitt">Anne Moen Bullitt</a> (1924–2007). In 1925 she and Bullitt added to their family an 8-year-old boy, Refik Ismaili Bey, whom they had met in Turkey. As the wife of a rich man, Bryant had duties related to the running of an upper-class household: "... the management of servants, the ordering of food and planning of menus, house decoration, flower arrangement, keeping a social calendar." She told one visitor to her home that she considered her new life "useless", and the Bryant–Bullitt marriage began to unravel. In "Louise Bryant Grows Old", historian <a href="Christine%20Stansell">Christine Stansell</a> examines the great changes in Bryant's life after her marriage to Bullitt:

The entrance of William Bullitt into Louise Bryant's life confounds the intertwined stories of the grief-stricken war widow, the radical heroine, and the champion of the oppressed. The marriage is a puzzle, both biographically and historically. Biographically, it proved to be a disaster, in contrast to Bryant's earlier romantic choices, which had been smart and fulfilling.

Although Bryant continued to write, little of her work toward the end of her life was published. Her last piece of journalism, "A Turkish Divorce", about Atatürk's treatment of women, appeared in "The Nation" in August 1925.

By 1926, Bryant, who had generally abstained from alcohol earlier in life, was suffering from painful and incurable <a href="adiposis%20dolorosa">adiposis dolorosa</a> (Dercum's disease) and was drinking heavily. Bullitt, citing his wife's drinking and alleging that she was involved in a lesbian relationship with Gwen Le Gallienne, a stepdaughter of writer <a href="Richard%20Le%20Gallienne">Richard Le Gallienne</a>, divorced Bryant in 1930 and won sole custody of Anne. Bryant remained in Paris, occasionally advising writer <a href="Claude%20McKay">Claude McKay</a>, and briefly assisting researchers from Harvard University in preserving Reed's papers.

Bryant died on January 6, 1936, of a <a href="brain%20hemorrhage">brain hemorrhage</a> in <a href="S%C3%A8vres">Sèvres</a>, in the suburbs of Paris, and is buried in <a href="Cimeti%C3%A8re%20des%20Gonards">Cimetière des Gonards</a> in <a href="Versailles%20%28city%29">Versailles</a>. In 1998, three volunteers from the <a href="Oregon%20Cultural%20Heritage%20Commission">Oregon Cultural Heritage Commission</a> went to Paris to find the grave, which they discovered was crumbling, undated, and scheduled for removal. Through the commission's efforts as well as donations, including some from relatives of Bryant and Bullitt, the grave was restored.

The Bryant–Reed story is told in the 1981 film "<a href="Reds%20%28film%29">Reds</a>", starring <a href="Diane%20Keaton">Diane Keaton</a> as Bryant and <a href="Warren%20Beatty">Warren Beatty</a> as Reed. Supporting actors include <a href="Jack%20Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a> as Eugene O'Neill, <a href="Maureen%20Stapleton">Maureen Stapleton</a> as <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, <a href="Jerzy%20Kosi%C5%84ski">Jerzy Kosiński</a> as <a href="Grigory%20Zinoviev">Grigory Zinoviev</a> (one of the Bolshevik leaders), and <a href="Edward%20Herrmann">Edward Herrmann</a> as Max Eastman.

Bryant's personal papers were transferred to Bullitt, with whom they remained until their daughter, Anne, donated the collection to Yale University in 2004. They exist as separate collections, the Louise Bryant Papers (MS 1840) and the William C. Bullitt Papers (MS 112) in the <a href="Sterling%20Memorial%20Library">Sterling Memorial Library</a> at Yale. The Louise Bryant Papers consists of about 19 linear feet (5.8 m) of letters, texts, photographs, art, and other materials that she created or collected between 1916 and 1936.

Bryant's early journalistic work appeared in college publications and in newspapers—"The Spectator", where Bryant was society editor, and "The Oregonian", for whom she freelanced—in Portland. Later work appeared in independent magazines, including "The Masses", and "The Liberator", Some, written for the "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York American</a>" and other <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">Hearst</a> publications, were <a href="Print%20syndication">syndicated</a> to newspapers across North America. Collections of her articles appeared in book form in 1918 and 1923. Below is a partial list of her published work.

Metallurgical Laboratory

The Metallurgical Laboratory (or Met Lab) was a scientific laboratory at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> that was established in February 1942 to study and use the newly discovered <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>. It researched plutonium's chemistry and metallurgy, designed the world's first <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s to produce it, and developed chemical processes to separate it from other elements. In August 1942 the lab's chemical section was the first to chemically separate a weighable sample of plutonium, and on 2 December 1942, the Met Lab produced the first controlled <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a>, in the reactor <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a>, which was constructed under the stands of the university's old <a href="American%20football">football</a> stadium, <a href="Stagg%20Field">Stagg Field</a>.

The Metallurgical Laboratory was established as part of the Metallurgical Project, also known as the "Pile" or "X-10" Project, headed by <a href="Arthur%20H.%20Compton">Arthur H. Compton</a>, a <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> laureate. In turn, this was part of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> – the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> effort to develop the <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The Metallurgical Laboratory was successively led by Richard L. Doan, <a href="Samuel%20K.%20Allison">Samuel K. Allison</a>, <a href="Joyce%20C.%20Stearns">Joyce C. Stearns</a> and <a href="Farrington%20Daniels">Farrington Daniels</a>. Scientists who worked there included <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a>, <a href="James%20Franck">James Franck</a>, <a href="Eugene%20Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a>. At its peak on 1 July 1944, it had 2,008 staff.

Chicago Pile-1 was soon moved by the lab to a more remote site in the <a href="Red%20Gate%20Woods">Argonne Forest</a>, where its original materials were used to build an improved Chicago Pile-2. Another reactor, <a href="Chicago%20Pile-3">Chicago Pile-3</a>, was built at the Argonne site in early 1944. This was the world's first reactor to use <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>. It went <a href="critical%20mass">critical</a> in May 1944, and was first operated at full power in July 1944. The Metallurgical Laboratory also designed the <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> in <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, and the <a href="B%20Reactor">B Reactor</a> at the <a href="Hanford%20Engineer%20Works">Hanford Engineer Works</a> in the <a href="state%20of%20Washington">state of Washington</a>.

As well as the work on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the chemistry and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> to develop the <a href="bismuth%20phosphate%20process">bismuth phosphate process</a> used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a <a href="bone%20seeker">bone seeker</a>, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy%20national%20laboratories">national laboratories</a>, the <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, on 1 July 1946. The work of the Met Lab also led to the creation of the <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Institute">Enrico Fermi Institute</a> and the <a href="James%20Franck%20Institute">James Franck Institute</a> at the university.

The discovery of <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> in <a href="uranium">uranium</a> by German chemists <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> in December 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a> soon after, opened up the possibility that <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s produced by fission could create a controlled <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a>. At <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> and <a href="Leo%20Szilard">Leo Szilard</a> began exploring how this might be achieved. In August 1939, Szilard drafted a <a href="Einstein%E2%80%93Szilard%20letter">confidential letter</a> to the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, warning of the possibility of a <a href="German%20nuclear%20weapon%20project">German nuclear weapon project</a>, and convinced his old friend and collaborator <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> to co-sign it. This resulted in support for research into nuclear fission by the U.S. government.

In April 1941, the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC), asked <a href="Arthur%20Compton">Arthur Compton</a>, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, to report on the uranium program. <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> and <a href="John%20Archibald%20Wheeler">John Wheeler</a> theorized that heavy isotopes with odd <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a>s, such as <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>, were <a href="fissile">fissile</a>. <a href="Emilio%20Segr%C3%A8">Emilio Segrè</a> and <a href="Glenn%20Seaborg">Glenn Seaborg</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">University of California</a> produced 28 μg of plutonium in the 60-inch <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> there in May 1941, and found that it had 1.7 times the <a href="thermal%20neutron">thermal neutron</a> capture <a href="Neutron%20cross%20section">cross section</a> of uranium-235. While minute quantities of plutonium-239 could be created in cyclotrons, it was not feasible to produce a large quantity that way. Compton conferred with <a href="Eugene%20Wigner">Eugene Wigner</a> from <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> about how plutonium might be produced in a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>, and with <a href="Robert%20Serber">Robert Serber</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20at%20Urbana%E2%80%93Champaign">University of Illinois</a> about how the plutonium produced in a reactor might then be chemically separated from uranium it was bred from.

On 20 December, soon after the <a href="Japanese%20attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor</a> that brought the United States into the war, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. Although a successful reactor had not yet been built, the scientists had already produced several different but promising design concepts. It fell to Compton to decide which of these should be pursued. He proposed an ambitious schedule that aimed to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have a deliverable atomic bomb by January 1945.

Compton felt that having teams at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of California created too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he resolved to concentrate the work in one location. Nobody wanted to move, and everybody argued in favor of their own location. In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, Compton decided to concentrate the work at his own location, the University of Chicago, where he knew he had the unstinting support of university administration, whereas Columbia was engaged in uranium enrichment efforts and was hesitant to add another secret project. Other factors contributing to the decision were Chicago's central location and the availability of scientists, technicians and facilities in the <a href="Midwest">Midwest</a> that had not yet been taken away by war work. Housing was more readily available, and an inland city was less vulnerable to enemy attack.

The new research establishment was formed in February 1942, and named the "Metallurgical Laboratory" or "Met Lab". Some real metallurgy was carried out, but the name was intended as a cover for its activities. The University of Chicago had been considering establishing a research institute into metals, and indeed would do so after the war, so its creation attracted little attention. Compton's plutonium project then became known as the Metallurgical Project. The Metallurgical Laboratory was administered by the University of Chicago under contract to the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD).

Over 5,000 people in 70 research groups participated in Compton's Metallurgical Project, also known as the "Pile" or "X-10" Project, of whom some 2,000 worked in the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Despite the good salaries being offered, recruiting was difficult. There was competition for scientists and engineers from other defense-related projects, and Chicago was expensive compared with university towns.

<a href="Norman%20Hilberry">Norman Hilberry</a> was associate director of the Metallurgical Project, and Richard L. Doan was appointed the Director of the Metallurgical Laboratory. While Doan was an able administrator, he had difficulty being accepted as the head of the laboratory, since he was not an academic. On 5 May 1943, Compton replaced him with <a href="Samuel%20K.%20Allison">Samuel K. Allison</a>, and appointed <a href="Henry%20D.%20Smyth">Henry D. Smyth</a> as associate director. Initially there were three physics groups, headed by Allison, Fermi and <a href="Martin%20D.%20Whitaker">Martin D. Whitaker</a>. <a href="Frank%20Spedding">Frank Spedding</a> was in charge of the Chemistry Division. He was later succeeded by <a href="Herbert%20Newby%20McCoy">Herbert McCoy</a>, and then by <a href="James%20Franck">James Franck</a>. Compton placed <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> in charge of the bomb design effort in June 1942. In November 1942, this became a separate project, known as <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Project Y</a>, which was located in <a href="Los%20Alamos%2C%20New%20Mexico">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>.

After the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">United States Army Corps of Engineers</a> took over the Manhattan Project in August 1942, the <a href="Manhattan%20Project%23Manhattan%20District">Manhattan District</a> coordinated the work. From 17 February 1943, Compton reported to the director of the Manhattan Project, <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20R.%20Groves%2C%20Jr.">Leslie R. Groves, Jr.</a>, instead of the OSRD <a href="S-1%20Section">S-1 Section</a>. The Manhattan District assumed full responsibility for the Metallurgical Laboratory contract on 1 May 1943. <a href="Captain%20%28O-3%29">Captain</a> J. F. Grafton was appointed the Chicago Area Engineer in August 1942. He was succeeded by Captain <a href="Arthur%20V.%20Peterson">Arthur V. Peterson</a> in December 1942. Peterson remained until October 1944. Captain J. F. McKinley became Chicago Area Engineer on 1 July 1945.

At first, most of the Laboratory office space was provided by the University of Chicago. The physicists took over space under the North and West Stands of <a href="Stagg%20Field">Stagg Field</a> and in the Service Building, where there was a cyclotron. The chemists took over the <a href="George%20Herbert%20Jones%20Laboratory">George Herbert Jones Laboratory</a> and the Kent Chemical Laboratory. The health group took space in the Anatomy Building, Drexel House, Billings Hospital and the Killis Laboratory and the administrative offices went into <a href="Eckhart%20Hall">Eckhart Hall</a>. Szilard later wrote that "the morale of the scientists could almost be plotted in a graph by counting the number of lights burning after dinner in the offices at Eckhart Hall." When the project outgrew its space in Eckhart Hall, it moved into the nearby Ryerson Hall. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually occupied of campus space. About $131,000 worth of alterations were made to buildings occupied by the laboratory but the University of Chicago also had to make alterations for users displaced by it.
The University of Chicago made a site occupied by tennis courts available to the Manhattan District on a one dollar lease, for the construction of a new chemistry building with of space. <a href="Stone%20and%20Webster">Stone and Webster</a> commenced work on this in September 1942 and it was completed in December. It was soon found to be too small and an adjacent plot was added to the lease, on which a annex was built and completed in November 1943. Extensive work was then carried out on the ventilation system to allow the laboratory to work with plutonium more safely. A site containing an <a href="Ice%20house%20%28building%29">ice house</a> and stables owned by the University in Chicago was made available in April 1943. Known as Site B, it was remodeled to provide of laboratories and workshops for the health and metallurgy groups. The 124th Field Artillery Armory was leased from the state of Illinois to provide more space in March 1944 and about of space was leased or built, at a cost of $2 million.

For reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities for experiments with nuclear reactors in densely populated Chicago. Compton selected a site in the <a href="Red%20Gate%20Woods">Argonne Forest</a>, part of the <a href="Forest%20Preserve%20District%20of%20Cook%20County">Forest Preserve District of Cook County</a>, about southwest of Chicago, which became known as Site A. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> leased of land there from <a href="Cook%20County">Cook County</a> for the duration of the war plus one year for a dollar. Construction of facilities including laboratories and service buildings and an access road was commenced in September 1942 and completed in early 1943. Compton appointed Fermi as the first director of the Argonne Laboratory.

Between 15 September and 15 November 1942, groups under <a href="Herbert%20L.%20Anderson">Herbert L. Anderson</a> and <a href="Walter%20Zinn">Walter Zinn</a> constructed sixteen experimental reactors (known at the time as "piles") under the Stagg Field stands. Fermi designed a new uranium and <a href="graphite">graphite</a> pile that could be brought to <a href="Criticality%20%28status%29">criticality</a> in a controlled, self-sustaining <a href="nuclear%20reaction">nuclear reaction</a>. Construction at Argonne fell behind schedule due to Stone & Webster's difficulty recruiting enough skilled workers and obtaining the required building materials. This led to an industrial dispute, with union workers taking action over the recruitment of non-union labor. When it became clear that the materials for Fermi's new pile would be on hand before the new structure was completed, Compton approved a proposal from Fermi to build the pile under the stands at Stagg Field.

Construction of the reactor, known as <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a> (CP-1), began on the morning of 16 November 1942. The work was carried out in twelve-hour shifts, with a day shift under Zinn and a night shift under Anderson. When completed, the wooden frame supported an elliptical-shaped structure, high, wide at the ends and across the middle. It contained of uranium metal, of uranium oxide and of graphite, at an estimated cost of $2.7 million. On 2 December 1942, it achieved the first controlled self-sustaining nuclear reaction. On 12 December 1942, CP-1's power output was increased to 200 W, enough to power a light bulb. Lacking shielding of any kind, it was a radiation hazard for everyone in the vicinity. Thereafter, testing was continued at the lower power of 0.5 W.

The operation of Chicago Pile-1 was terminated on 28 February 1943. It was dismantled and moved to Argonne, where the original materials were used to build Chicago Pile-2 (CP-2). Instead of being spherical, the new reactor was built in a cube-like shape, about tall with a base approximately square. It was surrounded by concrete walls thick that acted as a <a href="radiation%20shield">radiation shield</a>, and with overhead protection from of lead and of wood. More uranium was used, so it contained of uranium and of graphite. No cooling system was provided as it only ran at a few kilowatts. CP-2 became operational in March 1943.

A second reactor, known as <a href="Chicago%20Pile-3">Chicago Pile-3</a>, or CP-3, was built at the Argonne site in early 1944. This was the world's first reactor to use <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> as a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>. It had been unavailable when CP-1 was built, but was now becoming available in quantity thanks to the Manhattan Project's <a href="P-9%20Project">P-9 Project</a>. The reactor was a large aluminum tank, in diameter, which was filled with heavy water, which weighed about . The cover was pierced by regularly spaced holes through which 121 uranium rods sheathed in aluminum projected into the heavy water. The tank was surrounded by a graphite <a href="neutron%20reflector">neutron reflector</a>, which in turn was surrounded by a lead shield, and by concrete. Shielding on the top of the reactor consisted of layers of square removable bricks composed of layers of iron and <a href="masonite">masonite</a>. The heavy water was cooled with a water-cooled <a href="heat%20exchanger">heat exchanger</a>. As well as the control rods, there was an emergency mechanism for dumping the heavy water into a tank below. Construction began on 1 January 1944. The reactor went critical in May 1944, and was first operated at full power of 300 kW in July 1944.

During the war Zinn allowed it to be run around the clock, and its design made it easy to conduct experiments. This included tests to investigate the properties of isotopes such as <a href="tritium">tritium</a> and determine the neutron capture cross section of elements and compounds that might be used to construct future reactors, or occur in impurities. They were also used for trials of instrumentation, and in experiments to determine <a href="thermal%20stability">thermal stability</a> of materials, and to train operators.

The design of the reactors for plutonium production involved several problems, not just in nuclear physics but in engineering and construction. Issues such as the long-term effect of radiation on materials received considerable attention from the Metallurgical Laboratory. Two types of reactors were considered: homogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were mixed together, and heterogeneous, in which the moderator and fuel were arranged in a lattice configuration. By late 1941, mathematical analysis had shown that the lattice design had advantages over the homogeneous type, and so it was chosen for CP-1, and for the later production reactors as well. For a neutron moderator, graphite was chosen on the basis of its availability compared with <a href="beryllium">beryllium</a> or heavy water.
The decision of what coolant to use attracted more debate. The Metallurgical laboratory's first choice was <a href="helium">helium</a>, because it could be both a coolant and a neutron moderator. The difficulties of its use were not overlooked. Large quantities would be required, and it would have to be very pure, with no neutron-absorbing impurities. Special blowers would be required to circulate the gas through the reactor, and the problem of leakage of radioactive gases would have to be solved. None of these problems were regarded as insurmountable. The decision to use helium was conveyed to <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a>, the company responsible for building the production reactors, and was initially accepted.

In early 1943, Wigner and his Theoretical Group that included <a href="Alvin%20Weinberg">Alvin Weinberg</a>, <a href="Katharine%20Way">Katharine Way</a>, Leo Ohlinger, Gale Young and <a href="Edward%20Creutz">Edward Creutz</a> produced a design for a production reactor with water cooling. The choice of water as a coolant was controversial, as it was known to absorb neutrons, thereby reducing the efficiency of the reactor, but Wigner was confident that his group's calculations were correct and that with the purer graphite and uranium that was now available, water would work, while the technical difficulties involved in using helium as a coolant would delay the project.

The design used a thin layer of aluminum to protect the uranium from corrosion by the cooling water. Cylindrical uranium slugs with aluminum jackets would be pushed through channels through the reactor and drop out the other side into a cooling pond. Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.

The use of water as a coolant raised the problem of corrosion and oxidation of the aluminum tubing. The Metallurgical Laboratory tested various additives to the water to determine their effect. It was found that corrosion was minimized when the water was slightly acidic, so dilute <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> was added to the water to give it a <a href="pH">pH</a> of 6.5. Other additives such as <a href="sodium%20silicate">sodium silicate</a>, <a href="sodium%20dichromate">sodium dichromate</a> and <a href="oxalic%20acid">oxalic acid</a> were also introduced to the water to prevent a build up of film that could inhibit the circulation of the cooling water. The fuel slugs were given a jacket of aluminum to protect the uranium metal from <a href="corrosion">corrosion</a> that would occur if it came into contact with the water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive <a href="fission%20products">fission products</a> that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen because the cladding had to transmit heat but not absorb too many neutrons. The aluminum canning process was given close attention, as ruptured slugs could jam or damage the channels in the reactor, and the smallest holes could vent radioactive gases. The Metallurgical Laboratory investigated production and testing regimes for the canning process.

An important area of research concerned the <a href="Wigner%20effect">Wigner effect</a>. Under bombardment by neutrons, the carbon atoms in the graphite moderator can be knocked out of the graphite's crystalline structure. Over time, this causes the graphite to heat and swell. Investigation of the problem would take most of 1946 before a fix was found.

Metallurgical work concentrated on uranium and plutonium. Although it had been discovered over a century before, little was known about uranium, as evidenced by the fact that many references gave a figure for its melting point that was off by nearly 500 °F (280 °C). Edward Creutz investigated it and discovered that at the right temperature range, uranium could be hammered and rolled, and drawn into the rods required by the production reactor design. It was found that when uranium was cut, the shavings would burst into flame. Working with <a href="Alcoa">Alcoa</a> and <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a>, the Metallurgical Laboratory devised a method of soldering the aluminum jacket to the uranium slug.

The metallurgy of plutonium was completely unknown, for it had only recently been discovered. In August 1942, Seaborg's team chemically isolated the first weighable amount of plutonium from uranium irradiated in the Jones Laboratory. Until reactors became available, minuscule amounts of plutonium were produced in the cyclotron at <a href="Washington%20University%20in%20St.%20Louis">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. The chemistry division worked with DuPont to develop the <a href="bismuth%20phosphate%20process">bismuth phosphate process</a> used to separate plutonium from uranium.

The dangers of radiation poisoning had become well known due to the experience of the <a href="radium%20dial%20painters">radium dial painters</a>. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a> at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a>. Groves appointed <a href="Stafford%20L.%20Warren">Stafford L. Warren</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Rochester">University of Rochester</a> as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a <a href="bone%20seeker">bone seeker</a>, making it especially hazardous.

The Metallurgical Laboratory's Health Division set standards for radiation exposure. Workers were routinely tested at University of Chicago clinics, but this could be too late. Personal <a href="quartz%20fiber%20dosimeter">quartz fiber dosimeter</a>s were procured, as were <a href="film%20badge%20dosimeter">film badge dosimeter</a>s, which recorded cumulative dosage. Stone's Health Division worked closely with William P. Jesse's Instrumentation Group in the Physics Division to develop detectors, including portable <a href="Geiger%20counter">Geiger counter</a>s. <a href="Herbert%20Parker%20%28scientist%29">Herbert M. Parker</a> created a metric for radiation exposure he called the <a href="roentgen%20equivalent%20man">roentgen equivalent man</a> or rem. After the war, this replaced the <a href="Roentgen%20%28unit%29">roentgen</a> as the standard measure of radiation exposure. Work to assess the toxicity of plutonium got under way when the plutonium <a href="wikt%3Asemi-works">semiworks</a> at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> began producing it in 1943. The project set a limit of 5 <a href="microgram">microgram</a>s (μg) in the body, and work practices and workplaces at Chicago and Clinton were modified to ensure that this standard was met.

During 1943 and 1944, the Metallurgical Laboratory focused on first getting the <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> at the Clinton Engineer Works up and running, and then the <a href="B%20Reactor">B Reactor</a> at the Hanford Site. By the end of 1944, the focus had switched to training operators. Much of the chemistry division moved to Oak Ridge in October 1943, and many personnel were transferred to other Manhattan Project sites in 1944, particularly Hanford and Los Alamos. Fermi became a division head at Los Alamos in September 1944, and Zinn became the director of the Argonne Laboratory. Allison followed in November 1944, taking with him many of the Metallurgical Laboratory's staff, including most of the instrument section. He was replaced by <a href="Joyce%20C.%20Stearns">Joyce C. Stearns</a>. <a href="Farrington%20Daniels">Farrington Daniels</a>, who became associate director on 1 September 1944, succeeded Stearns as director on 1 July 1945.
Where possible, the University of Chicago attempted to re-employ workers who had been transferred from the Metallurgical Laboratory to other projects once their work had ended. Replacing staff was nearly impossible, as Groves had ordered a staffing freeze. The only division to grow between November 1944 and March 1945 was the health division; all the rest lost 20 percent or more of their staff. From a peak of 2,008 staff on 1 July 1944, the number of people working at the Metallurgical Laboratory fell to 1,444 on 1 July 1945.

The end of the war did not end the flow of departures. Seaborg left on 17 May 1946, taking much of what remained of the chemistry division with him. On 11 February 1946, the Army reached an agreement with University President <a href="Robert%20Maynard%20Hutchins">Robert Hutchins</a> for the staff and equipment of the Metallurgical Project to be taken over by a regional laboratory based at Argonne, which the university still manages. On 1 July 1946, the Metallurgical Laboratory became <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a>, the first designated <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy%20national%20laboratories">national laboratory</a>, with Zinn as its first director. The new laboratory had 1,278 staff on 31 December 1946, when the Manhattan Project ended, and responsibility for the national laboratories passed to the <a href="United%20States%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Atomic Energy Commission</a>, which replaced the Manhattan Project on 1 January 1947. The work of the Metallurgical Laboratory also led to the founding of the <a href="Enrico%20Fermi%20Institute">Enrico Fermi Institute</a>, as well as the <a href="James%20Franck%20Institute">James Franck Institute</a>, at the University of Chicago.

Payments made to the University of Chicago under the original 1 May 1943 non-profit contract totaled $27,933,134.83, which included $647,671.80 in construction and remodeling costs. The contract expired on 30 June 1946, and was replaced by a new contract, which ended on 31 December 1946. A further $2,756,730.54 was paid under this contract, of which $161,636.10 was spent on construction and remodeling. An additional $49,509.83 was paid to the University of Chicago for the restoration of its facilities.

In 1974, the United States government began cleaning up the old Manhattan Project sites under the <a href="Formerly%20Utilized%20Sites%20Remedial%20Action%20Program">Formerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program</a> (FUSRAP). This included those used by the Metallurgical Laboratory. Stagg Field had been demolished in 1957, but 23 locations in Kent Laboratory were decontaminated in 1977, and another 99 at the Eckhart, Ryerson, and the Jones Laboratory in 1984. About of solid and three <a href="55-gallon%20drum">55-gallon drum</a>s of liquid waste were collected and shipped to various sites for disposal. The Atomic Energy Commission terminated its lease on the Armory site in 1951, and it was restored to the state of Illinois. Testing in 1977, 1978 and 1987 indicated residual levels of radioactivity that exceeded <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">Department of Energy</a> guidelines, so decontamination was carried out in 1988 and 1989, after which the site was declared suitable for unrestricted use.

Deinocheirus

Deinocheirus ( ) is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of large <a href="ornithomimosaur">ornithomimosaur</a> that lived during the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> around 70 million years ago. In 1965, a pair of large arms, shoulder girdles, and a few other bones of a new dinosaur were first discovered in the <a href="Nemegt%20Formation">Nemegt Formation</a> of <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>. In 1970, this specimen became the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> of the only species within the genus, Deinocheirus mirificus; the genus name is <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> for "horrible hand". No further remains were discovered for almost fifty years, and its nature remained a mystery. Two more complete specimens were described in 2014, which shed light on many aspects of the animal. Parts of these new specimens had been looted from Mongolia some years before, but were repatriated in 2014.

"Deinocheirus" was an unusual ornithomimosaur, the largest of the <a href="clade">clade</a> at long, and weighing . Though it was a bulky animal, it had many hollow bones which saved weight. The arms were among the largest of any bipedal dinosaur at long, with large, blunt claws on its three-fingered hands. The legs were relatively short, and bore blunt claws. Its vertebrae had tall neural spines that formed a "<a href="Neural%20spine%20sail">sail</a>" along its back. The tail ended in <a href="pygostyle">pygostyle</a>-like vertebrae, which indicate the presence of a fan of feathers. The skull was long, with a wide bill and a deep lower jaw, similar to those of <a href="hadrosaurs">hadrosaurs</a>.

The classification of "Deinocheirus" was long uncertain, and it was initially placed in the <a href="theropod">theropod</a> group <a href="Carnosauria">Carnosauria</a>, but similarities with ornithomimosaurians were soon noted. After more complete remains were found, "Deinocheirus" was shown to be a primitive ornithomimosaurian, most closely related to the smaller genera "<a href="Garudimimus">Garudimimus</a>" and "<a href="Beishanlong">Beishanlong</a>", together forming the family <a href="Deinocheiridae">Deinocheiridae</a>. Members of this group were not adapted for speed, unlike other ornithomimosaurs. "Deinocheirus" is thought to have been <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a>; its skull shape indicates a diet of plants, fish scales were found in association with one specimen and <a href="gastroliths">gastroliths</a> were also present in the stomach region of the specimen. The large claws may have been used for digging and gathering plants. Bite marks on "Deinocheirus" bones have been attributed to the <a href="tyrannosauridae">tyrannosaurid</a> "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>".

"Deinocheirus" is the largest <a href="ornithomimosauria">ornithomimosauria</a>n (ostrich dinosaur) discovered; the largest known specimen measured up to long, with an estimated weight of . The two other known specimens are smaller, the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> being 94% as big while the smallest, a subadult, only 74% as big. When only the incomplete holotype arms were known, various sizes were extrapolated from them by different methods. A 2010 study estimated the hip height of "Deinocheirus" to be . The weight had previously been estimated between to . Enormous sizes were also suggested by comparing the arms with those of <a href="tyrannosaur">tyrannosaur</a>s, even though members of that group did not have large arms in proportion to their body size.

"Deinocheirus" and "<a href="Therizinosaurus">Therizinosaurus</a>" possessed the longest forelimbs known for any bipedal dinosaurs. The holotype forelimbs measure long — the <a href="humerus">humerus</a> (upper arm bone) is , the <a href="ulna">ulna</a> , and the hand is — including the long recurved claws. Each <a href="scapulocoracoid">scapulocoracoid</a> of the shoulder girdle has a length of . Each half of the paired <a href="wikt%3Aceratobranchial">ceratobranchialia</a> measure . The shoulder-blade was long and narrow, and the <a href="deltopectoralis">deltopectoralis</a> crest was pronounced and triangular. The upper arm (humerus) was relatively slender, and only slightly longer than the hand. The ulna and <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radius</a> (lower arm bones) were elongate and not firmly connected to each other in a <a href="syndesmosis">syndesmosis</a>. The <a href="metacarpus">metacarpus</a> was long compared to the fingers. The three fingers were about equal in length, the first being the stoutest and the second the longest. Various rough areas and impressions on the forelimbs indicate the presence of powerful muscles. Most articular surfaces of the arm bones were deeply furrowed, indicating that the animal had thick pads of cartilage between the joints. Though the arms of "Deinocheirus" were large, the ratio between them and the shoulder girdle was less than that of the smaller ornithomimosaur "<a href="Ornithomimus">Ornithomimus</a>". The arm bones of "Deinocheirus" were similar in proportions to those of the small theropod "<a href="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a>". The wishbone (<a href="furcula">furcula</a>), an element not known from any other ornithomimosaurs, was U-shaped. The hindlimbs were relatively short, and the <a href="thigh%20bone">thigh bone</a> (femur) was longer than the <a href="shin%20bone">shin bone</a> (tibia), as is common for large animals. The <a href="metatarsus">metatarsus</a> was short and not <a href="arctometatarsalian">arctometatarsalian</a>, as in most other theropods. The <a href="claw%20bone">claw bone</a>s of the feet were blunt and broad-tipped instead of tapered, unlike other theropods, but resembled the <a href="unguals">unguals</a> of large <a href="ornithischian">ornithischian</a> dinosaurs. The proportions of the toe bones resembled those of tyrannosaurs, due to the large weight they had to bear.

Though "Deinocheirus" was a bulky animal, its dorsal ribs were tall and relatively straight, indicating that the body was narrow. The ten neck <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebrae</a> were low and long, and progressively shorter backwards from the skull. This resulted in a more S-curved neck than seen in other ornithomimosaurs, due to the larger skull. The <a href="neural%20spines">neural spines</a> of the twelve back vertebrae became increasingly longer from front to back, the last one being 8.5 times the height of the <a href="body%20of%20vertebra">centrum</a> part. This is almost the same as the highest ratio in the neural spines of the theropod "<a href="Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a>". The neural spines had a system of interconnecting <a href="ligaments">ligaments</a>, which stiffened the vertebral column allowing it to support the abdomen while transmitting the <a href="Stress%20%28mechanics%29">stress</a> to the hips and hindlimbs. Together, the neural spines formed a tall "<a href="Neural%20spine%20sail">sail</a>" along the lower back, hips, and base of the tail, somewhat similar to that of "Spinosaurus".

All the vertebrae were highly pneumatised by invading <a href="air%20sacs">air sacs</a>, except for the <a href="atlas%20bone">atlas bone</a> and the hindmost tail vertebrae, and were thereby connected to the <a href="respiratory%20system">respiratory system</a>. The back vertebrae were as pneumatised as those of <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> dinosaurs, and had an extensive system of depressions. These adaptations may be correlated with <a href="gigantism">gigantism</a>, as they reduce weight. The six vertebrae of the <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> were also tall and pneumatised, and all but the first one were fused together at the top, their neural spines forming a <a href="neural%20plate">neural plate</a>. The <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a>, the top hip bone, was also partially pneumatised close to the sacral vertebrae. Part of the pelvis was <a href="hypertrophy">hypertrophied</a> (enlarged) compared to other ornithomimosaurs, to support the weight of the animal with strong muscle attachments. The front hip bones tilted upwards in life. The tail of "Deinocheirus" ended in at least two fused vertebrae, which were described as similar to the <a href="pygostyle">pygostyle</a> of <a href="oviraptorosaurian">oviraptorosaurian</a> and <a href="therizinosauroid">therizinosauroid</a> theropods. Ornithomimosaurs are known to have had <a href="feather">pennaceous feathers</a>, so this feature suggests that they might have had a fan of feathers at the tail end.

The only known skull, belonging to the largest specimen, measures from the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a> at the front to the back of the <a href="occipital%20condyle">occipital condyle</a>. The widest part of the skull behind the eyes is only wide in comparison. The skull was similar to those of other ornithomimosaurs in being low and narrow, but differed in that the snout was more elongated. The skull bone walls were rather thin, about . It had a rounded, flattened beak, which would have been covered by <a href="keratin">keratin</a> in life. The nostrils were turned upwards, and the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a> was a narrow strap that extended up above the eye sockets. The outer diameter of the <a href="sclerotic%20rings">sclerotic rings</a> in the eyes was small, , compared to the size of the skull. The <a href="temporal%20fenestra">lower temporal fenestrae</a>, openings behind the eyes, were partially closed off by the <a href="jugal%20bones">jugal bones</a>, similar to "<a href="Gallimimus">Gallimimus</a>". The jaws were toothless and down-turned, and the lower jaw was very massive and deep compared to the slender and low upper jaw. The relative size of the lower jaw was closer to that of tyrannosaurids than to other ornithomimosaurs. The snout was spatulate (flared outwards to the sides) and wide, which is wider than the skull roof. This shape is similar to the snout of duck-billed <a href="hadrosaurids">hadrosaurids</a>.

The first known <a href="fossil">fossil</a> remains of "Deinocheirus" were discovered by Polish palaeontologist <a href="Zofia%20Kielan-Jaworowska">Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska</a> on July 9, 1965, at the "Altan Ula III" site (<a href="coordinates">coordinates</a>: ) in the <a href="Nemegt%20Basin">Nemegt Basin</a> of the <a href="Gobi%20Desert">Gobi Desert</a>. She was part of a Polish group accompanied by Mongolian palaeontologist <a href="Rinchen%20Barsbold">Rinchen Barsbold</a> during the 1963–1965 Polish-Mongolian palaeontological expeditions, which were organised by the <a href="Polish%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Polish Academy of Sciences</a> and the <a href="Mongolian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Mongolian Academy of Sciences</a>. The crew spent July 9–11 excavating the specimen and loading it onto a vehicle. A 1968 report by Kielan-Jaworowska and Naydin Dovchin, which summarised the accomplishments of the expeditions, announced that the remains represented a new family of theropod dinosaur. The specimen was discovered on a small hill in <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, and consists of a partial, disarticulated skeleton, most parts of which had probably eroded away at the time of discovery. The specimen consisted of both forelimbs, excluding the claws of the right hand, the complete shoulder girdle, centra of three dorsal vertebrae, five ribs, <a href="gastralia">gastralia</a> (belly ribs), and two ceratobranchialia. The specimen was made the holotype of "Deinocheirus mirificus", named by <a href="Halszka%20Osm%C3%B3lska">Halszka Osmólska</a> and Ewa Roniewicz in 1970. The <a href="Generic%20name%20%28biology%29">generic name</a> is derived from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "deinos" (δεινός), meaning "horrible", and "cheir" (χείρ), meaning "hand", due to the size and strong claws of the forelimbs. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> comes from <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and means "unusual" or "peculiar", chosen for the unusual structure of the forelimbs. The Polish-Mongolian expeditions were notable for being led by women, among the first to name new dinosaurs. The original specimen number of the holotype was ZPal MgD-I/6, but it has since been re-catalogued as MPC-D 100/18.

The paucity of known "Deinocheirus" remains inhibited a thorough understanding of the animal for almost half a century onwards, and the scientific literature often described it as among the most "enigmatic", "mysterious", and "bizarre" of dinosaurs. The holotype arms went on to become part of a traveling exhibit of Mongolian dinosaur fossils, touring various countries. In 2012, Phil R. Bell, <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Philip J. Currie</a>, and Yuong-Nam Lee announced the discovery of additional elements of the holotype specimen, including fragments of gastralia, found by a Korean-Mongolian team which re-located the original quarry in 2008. Bite marks on two gastralia were identified as belonging to "<a href="Tarbosaurus">Tarbosaurus</a>", and it was proposed that this accounted for the scattered, disassociated state of the holotype specimen.

In 2013, the discovery of two new "Deinocheirus" specimens was announced before the annual <a href="Society%20of%20Vertebrate%20Paleontology">Society of Vertebrate Paleontology</a> (SVP) conference by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, and colleagues. Housed at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences, these two headless individuals were given the specimen numbers MPC-D 100/127 and MPC-D 100/128. MPC-D 100/128, a subadult specimen, was found by scientists in the "Altan Ula IV" locality (coordinates: ) of the Nemegt Formation during the Korea-Mongolia International Dinosaur Expedition in 2006, but had already been damaged by <a href="fossil%20poachers">fossil poachers</a>. The second specimen, MPC-D 100/127, was found by scientists in the "Bugiin Tsav" locality (coordinates: ) in 2009. It is slightly larger than the holotype, and it could be clearly identified as "Deinocheirus" by its left forelimb, and therefore helped identify the earlier collected specimen as "Deinocheirus". The specimen had also been excavated by poachers, who had removed the skull, hands and feet, but left behind a single toe bone. It had probably been looted after 2002, based on money left in the quarry. Skulls, claw bones and teeth are often selectively targeted by poachers on the expense of the rest of the skeletons (which are often vandalized), due to their saleability. Currie stated in an interview that it was a policy of their team to investigate quarries after they had been looted and recover anything of significance, and that finding any new "Deinocheirus" fossils was cause for celebration, even without the poached parts. A virtual model of "Deinocheirus" revealed at the SVP presentation brought applause from the crowd of attending palaeontologists, and Scottish palaeontologist <a href="Stephen%20L.%20Brusatte">Stephen L. Brusatte</a> stated he had never been as surprised by a SVP talk, though new fossils are routinely presented at the conference.

After the new specimens were announced, it was rumoured that a looted skull had found its way to a European museum through the <a href="black%20market">black market</a>. The poached elements were spotted in a private European collection by the French fossil trader François Escuillé, who notified Belgian palaeontologist <a href="Pascal%20Godefroit">Pascal Godefroit</a> about them in 2011. They suspected the remains belonged to "Deinocheirus", and contacted the Korean-Mongolian team. Escuillé subsequently acquired the fossils and donated them to the <a href="Royal%20Belgian%20Institute%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences</a>. The recovered material consisted of a skull, a left hand, and feet, which had been collected in Mongolia, sold to a Japanese buyer, and resold to a German party. The team concluded that these elements belonged to specimen MPC-D 100/127, as the single leftover toe bone fit perfectly into the unprepared matrix of a poached foot, the bone and matrix matched in colour, and because the elements belonged to an individual of the same size, with no overlap in skeletal elements. On May 1, 2014, the fossils were repatriated to Mongolia by a delegation from the Belgian Museum, during a ceremony held at the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. The reunited skeleton was deposited at the Central Museum of Mongolian Dinosaurs in <a href="Ulaanbaatar">Ulaanbaatar</a>, along with a "Tarbosaurus" skeleton which had also been <a href="United%20States%20v.%20One%20Tyrannosaurus%20Bataar%20Skeleton">brought back after being stolen</a>. American palaeontologist <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz">Thomas R. Holtz</a> stated in an interview that the new "Deinocheirus" remains looked like the "product of a secret love affair between a hadrosaur and "Gallimimus"".

Combined with the poached elements, both new specimens represent almost the entire skeleton of "Deinocheirus", as MPC-D 100/127 includes all material apart from the middle dorsal vertebrae, most <a href="Caudal%20%28anatomical%20term%29">caudal</a> vertebrae, and the right forelimb; MPC-D 100/128 fills in most gaps of the other skeleton, with nearly all dorsal and caudal vertebrae, the ilium, a partial <a href="ischium">ischium</a>, and most of the left hindlimb. In 2014, the specimens were described in the <a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">"Nature" journal</a> by Lee, Barsbold, Currie, Yoshitsugu Kobayashi, Hang-Jae Lee Lee, Godefroit, Escuillié, and Tsogtbaatar Chinzorig. A similar series of events was reported earlier in 2014 with "Spinosaurus", another sail-backed theropod which had only been known from few remains since 1912. Poached remains were reunited with specimens obtained by scientists, and "Spinosaurus" was shown to have been quite different from other <a href="spinosaurids">spinosaurids</a>. The two cases showed that the lifestyle and appearance of incompletely known extinct animals cannot always be safely inferred from close relatives. By 2017, the Mongolian government had increased its effort to seize poached fossils from collectors and repatriate them, but proving their <a href="provenance">provenance</a> had become a scientific and political concern. Therefore, a study tested the possibility of identifying poached fossils by <a href="geochemical">geochemical</a> methods, using "Deinocheirus" and other Nemegt dinosaurs as examples.

When "Deinocheirus" was only known from the original forelimbs, its taxonomic relationship was difficult to determine, and several hypotheses were proposed. Osmólska and Roniewicz initially concluded that "Deinocheirus" did not belong in any already named theropod family, so they created a new, <a href="monotypic">monotypic</a> family <a href="Deinocheiridae">Deinocheiridae</a>, placed in the <a href="infraorder">infraorder</a> <a href="Carnosauria">Carnosauria</a>. This was due to the large size and thick-walled limb bones, but they also found some similarities with "Ornithomimus", and, to a lesser extent, "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>". In 1971, <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a> first proposed that "Deinocheirus" belonged with the Ornithomimosauria, while noting that it contained both ornithomimosaurian and non-ornithomimosaurian <a href="Character%20%28biology%29">characters</a>. In 1976, Rhinchen Barsbold named the order <a href="Deinocheirosauria">Deinocheirosauria</a>, which was to include the supposedly related genera "Deinocheirus" and "Therizinosaurus". A relationship between "Deinocheirus" and the long-armed therizinosaurs was supported by some later writers, but they are not considered to be closely related today.

In 2004, Peter Makovicky, Kobayashi and Currie pointed out that "Deinocheirus" was likely a primitive ornithomimosaurian, since it lacked some of the features typical of the <a href="Ornithomimidae">Ornithomimidae</a> family. Primitive traits include its recurved claws, the low humerus-to-scapula ratio, and the lack of a syndesmosis. A 2006 study by Kobayashi and Barsbold found "Deinocheirus" to be possibly the most primitive ornithomimosaur, but was unable to further resolve its affinities, due to the lack of skull and hindlimb elements. A <a href="cladistic">cladistic</a> analysis accompanying the 2014 description of the two much more complete specimens found that "Deinocheirus" formed a clade with "<a href="Garudimimus">Garudimimus</a>" and "<a href="Beishanlong">Beishanlong</a>", which were therefore included in the Deinocheiridae. The resulting <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> follows below:

The 2014 study defined Deinocheiridae as a clade including all taxa with a more recent common ancestor with "Deinocheirus mirificus" than with "Ornithomimus velox". The three members share various anatomical features in the limbs. The 2014 cladogram suggested that ornithomimosaurians diverged into two major lineages in the Early Cretaceous; Deinocheiridae and Ornithomimidae. Unlike other ornithomimosaurians, deinocheirids were not built for running. The anatomical peculiarities of "Deinocheirus" when compared to other, much smaller ornithomimosaurs, can largely be explained by its much larger size and weight. Deinocheirids and the smaller ornithomimids did not have teeth, unlike more primitive ornithomimosaurs.

The blunt and short claws of "Deinocheirus" are similar to those of the therizinosaur "<a href="Alxasaurus">Alxasaurus</a>", which indicates the long arms and claws were used for digging and gathering plants. The blunt claws of the feet could have helped the animal from sinking into substrate when wading. The robust hind limbs and hip region indicates the animal moved slowly. The large size of the animal may have helped it against predators such as "Tarbosaurus", but in turn it lost the running ability of other ornithomimosaurs. The long neural spines and possible tail fan may have been used for <a href="display%20behaviour">display behaviour</a>. "Deinocheirus" was likely <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> (active during the day), since the sclerotic rings of the eyes were relatively small in comparison with its skull length. The hand had good mobility relative to the lower arm, but was capable of only a limited flexing motion, unable to close in grasping.

The brain of "Deinocheirus" was reconstructed through <a href="CT%20scans">CT scans</a> and presented at the 2014 Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology conference. The brain was globular and similar in shape to that of birds and troodontid theropods, the <a href="cerebrum">cerebrum</a> was expanded in a way similar to most theropods, and the <a href="olfactory">olfactory</a> tracts were relatively large. The brain was proportionally small and compact, and its Reptile <a href="Encephalisation%20Quotient">Encephalisation Quotient</a> (brain-body ratio) was estimated at 0.69, which is low for theropods, and similar to sauropods. Other ornithomimosaurs have proportionally large brains, and the small brain of "Deinocheirus" may reflect its social behaviour or diet. Its coordination and balance would not have been as important as for carnivorous theropods. A bone <a href="microstructure">microstructure</a> study presented at the 13th Annual Meeting of the <a href="EAVP">European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists</a> in 2015 showed that "Deinocheirus" probably had a high <a href="metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a>, and grew rapidly before reaching <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a>. In 2015, Akinobu Watanabe and colleagues found that together with "<a href="Archaeornithomimus">Archaeornithomimus</a>" and "Gallimimus", "Deinocheirus" had the most pneumatised skeleton among ornithomimosaurs. Pneumatisation is thought to be advantageous for flight in modern birds, but its function in non-avian dinosaurs is not known with certainty. It has been proposed that pneumatisation was used to reduce the mass of large bones (associated with gigantic size in the case of "Deinocheirus"), that it was related to high <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>, balance during locomotion, or used for <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a>.

The distinct shape of the skull shows that "Deinocheirus" had a more specialised diet than other ornithomimosaurs. The beak was similar to that of <a href="duck">duck</a>s, which indicates it may have likewise foraged in water, or browsed near the ground like some sauropods and hadrosaurs. The attachment sites for the muscles that open and close the jaws were very small in comparison to the size of the skull, which indicates "Deinocheirus" had a weak bite force. The skull was likely adapted for cropping soft understorey or water vegetation. The depth of the lower jaw indicates the presence of a large tongue, which could have assisted the animal in sucking in food material obtained with the broad beak when foraging on the bottom of freshwater bodies.

More than 1,400 <a href="gastroliths">gastroliths</a> (stomach stones, 8 to 87mm in size) were found among the ribs and gastralia of specimen MPC-D100/127. The ratio of gastrolith mass to total weight, 0.0022, supports the theory that these gastroliths helped the toothless animals in grinding their food. Features such as the presence of a beak and a U-shaped, downturned jaw, are indicators of <a href="facultative">facultative</a> (optional) <a href="herbivory">herbivory</a> among <a href="coelurosaurian">coelurosaurian</a> theropods. In spite of these features, fish vertebrae and scales were also found among the gastroliths, which suggests that it was an <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>. Ornithomimosaurs in general are thought to have fed on both plants and small animals.

Various feeding behaviours were proposed before more complete remains of "Deinocheirus" were known, and it was early on envisioned as a predatory, allosaur-like animal with giant arms. In their original description, Osmólska and Roniewicz found that the hands of "Deinocheirus" were unsuited for grasping, but could instead have been used to tear prey apart. In 1970, the Russian paleontologist <a href="Anatoly%20Konstantinovich%20Rozhdestvensky">Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky</a> compared the forelimbs of "Deinocheirus" to <a href="sloth">sloth</a>s, leading him to hypothesise that "Deinocheirus" was a specialised climbing dinosaur, that fed on plants and animals found in trees. In 1988, <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> instead suggested that the claws were too blunt for predatory purposes, but would have been good defensive weapons. While attempting to determine the <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a>s for "Deinocheirus" and "Therizinosaurus" in 2010, Phil Senter and James H. Robins suggested that "Deinocheirus" had the largest vertical feeding range due to its hip height, and specialised in eating high foliage. In 2017, it was suggested that the claws of "Deinocheirus" were adapted for pulling large quantities of herbaceous plants out of water, and to decrease the resistance of water.

Osmólska and Roniewicz reported that the holotype specimen has abnormal pits, grooves and tubercles on the first and second phalanx of the left second finger that may be the result of injuries to the joint between the two bones. The damage may have caused changes to the arrangement of ligaments of muscles. The two coracoids are also differently developed. A rib of specimen MPC-D 100/127 shows a healed trauma which has remodelled the bone. In 2012, bite marks on two gastralia of the holotype specimen were reported. The size and shape of the bite marks match the teeth of "Tarbosaurus", the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent feeding behaviour instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. "Tarbosaurus" bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.

The three known "Deinocheirus" specimens were recovered from the <a href="Nemegt%20Formation">Nemegt Formation</a> in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This <a href="geologic%20formation">geologic formation</a> has never been <a href="radiometric%20dating">dated radiometrically</a>, but the <a href="fauna">fauna</a> present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early <a href="Maastrichtian">Maastrichtian</a> stage, at the end of the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a> about 70 million years ago. The rock <a href="facies">facies</a> of the Nemegt Formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Such large river channels and soil deposits are evidence of a far more humid climate than those found in the older <a href="Barun%20Goyot%20Formation">Barun Goyot</a> and <a href="Djadochta%20Formation">Djadochta</a> formations. However, <a href="Caliche%20%28mineral%29">caliche</a> deposits indicate at least periodic droughts occurred. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers.

"Deinocheirus" is thought to have been widely distributed within the Nemegt Formation, as the only three specimens found have been apart. The river systems of the Nemegt Formation provided a suitable niche for "Deinocheirus" with its omnivorous habits. The environment was similar to the <a href="Okavango%20Delta">Okavango Delta</a> of present-day <a href="Botswana">Botswana</a>. Within this ecosystem, "Deinocheirus" would have eaten plants and small animals, including fish. It may have competed for trees with other large herbivorous dinosaurs such as the long-necked theropod "Therizinosaurus", various <a href="titanosaurian">titanosaurian</a> sauropods, and the smaller hadrosaurid "<a href="Saurolophus">Saurolophus</a>". "Deinocheirus" may have competed with those herbivores for higher <a href="foliage">foliage</a> such as trees, but was also able to feed on material that they could not. Along with "Deinocheirus", the discoveries of "Therizinosaurus" and "<a href="Gigantoraptor">Gigantoraptor</a>" show that three groups of herbivorous theropods (ornithomimosaurs, therizinosaurs and oviraptorosaurs), independently reached their maximum sizes in the late Cretaceous of Asia.

The habitats in and around the Nemegt rivers where "Deinocheirus" lived provided a home for a wide array of organisms. Occasional <a href="mollusc">mollusc</a> fossils are found, as well as a variety of other aquatic animals like fish and turtles, and the crocodylomorph "<a href="Shamosuchus">Shamosuchus</a>". <a href="Mammal">Mammal</a> fossils are rare in the Nemegt Formation, but many birds have been found, including the <a href="enantiornithine">enantiornithine</a> "<a href="Gurilynia">Gurilynia</a>", the <a href="Hesperornithes">hesperornithiform</a> "<a href="Judinornis">Judinornis</a>", as well as "<a href="Teviornis">Teviornis</a>", a possible <a href="Anseriform">Anseriform</a>. Herbivorous dinosaurs of the Nemegt Formation include <a href="ankylosaurid">ankylosaurid</a>s such as "<a href="Tarchia">Tarchia</a>", the <a href="pachycephalosauria">pachycephalosauria</a>n "<a href="Prenocephale">Prenocephale</a>", large hadrosaurids such as "Saurolophus" and "<a href="Barsboldia">Barsboldia</a>", and sauropods such as "<a href="Nemegtosaurus">Nemegtosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Opisthocoelicaudia">Opisthocoelicaudia</a>". Predatory theropods that may have lived alongside "Deinocheirus" include tyrannosauroids such as "Tarbosaurus", "<a href="Alioramus">Alioramus</a>", and "<a href="Bagaraatan">Bagaraatan</a>", and <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a>s such as "<a href="Borogovia">Borogovia</a>", "<a href="Tochisaurus">Tochisaurus</a>", and "<a href="Zanabazar%20junior">Zanabazar</a>". Theropod groups with both omnivorous and herbivorous members include therizinosaurs, such as "Therizinosaurus", oviraptorosaurians, such as "<a href="Elmisaurus">Elmisaurus</a>", "<a href="Nemegtomaia">Nemegtomaia</a>", and "<a href="Rinchenia">Rinchenia</a>", and other ornithomimosaurians, such as "<a href="Anserimimus">Anserimimus</a>" and "Gallimimus".

Supernature (Goldfrapp album)

Supernature is the third studio album by English <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a> duo <a href="Goldfrapp">Goldfrapp</a>, released on 17 August 2005 by <a href="Mute%20Records">Mute Records</a>. The album received generally favourable reviews, with most critics complimenting its blend of <a href="pop%20music">pop</a> and <a href="electronic%20music">electronic music</a>. It debuted at number two on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> with first-week sales of 52,976 copies, and was certified platinum by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a>. "Supernature" has sold one million copies worldwide.

The album's lead single, "<a href="Ooh%20La%20La%20%28Goldfrapp%20song%29">Ooh La La</a>", reached number four on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>, becoming the duo's highest-peaking single to date. The album spawned three further singles: "<a href="Number%201%20%28Goldfrapp%20song%29">Number 1</a>", "<a href="Ride%20a%20White%20Horse">Ride a White Horse</a>" and "<a href="Fly%20Me%20Away">Fly Me Away</a>". In North America, where "Number 1" was promoted as the first single, the album was released on 7 March 2006 and reached number 138 on the charts. "Supernature" was nominated for a <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Electronic/Dance%20Album">Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album</a> in 2007.

"Supernature" contains music in the same pop and electronic dance styles featured on Goldfrapp's previous studio album, "<a href="Black%20Cherry%20%28Goldfrapp%20album%29">Black Cherry</a>" (2003)—especially its singles "<a href="Strict%20Machine">Strict Machine</a>" and "<a href="Twist%20%28Goldfrapp%20song%29">Twist</a>"—although it focuses on subtle <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hooks</a> instead of large choruses. Lead singer <a href="Alison%20Goldfrapp">Alison Goldfrapp</a> described the album's writing process as "an electronic/glam cross between <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> and North-East <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>".

Goldfrapp and <a href="Will%20Gregory">Will Gregory</a> recorded the bulk of "Supernature" in late 2004 in the countryside near <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, England—the same place they recorded "Black Cherry". They had rented a small house and spent some months writing music; they later explained that the unpopulated location kept them from distractions and that the majority of the process was "very basic". Goldfrapp called their writing relationship a "democracy", playing off one another while in the recording studio. The lyrical content of the song "Number 1", which became the album's second single, is about the importance and meaning of relationships, even though they do not necessarily last.

In an interview with "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", Goldfrapp explained that they had never intended to create <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a>. However, the singles released from "Black Cherry" became successes across nightclubs in North America, and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Although this made the duo nervous, "<a href="Ooh%20La%20La%20%28Goldfrapp%20song%29">Ooh La La</a>" was the group's first song to feature the <a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a>. Before its composition, the duo avoided the use of the guitar because of the guitar's overly recognisable rhythm. <a href="Four-on-the-floor%20%28dance%29">Four-on-the-floor</a> <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a>s are also present on several of the album's tracks, and the piano <a href="ballad">ballad</a> "Let It Take You" features evening-effects composed on a synthesiser. "You Never Know" begins with Alison Goldfrapp executing a synthesised voice, supported by both <a href="timbre">pads</a> and synthesisers. Goldfrapp and Gregory have cited "Satin Chic" as their favourite song on "Supernature".

Alison Goldfrapp named the <a href="Roland%20Corporation">Roland</a> String synth as one of her favourite <a href="keyboard%20instrument">keyboards</a>. "Number 1" features an old synth and a <a href="bass%20guitar">bass</a> arrangement that the group began to use frequently after recording the song. Another Roland keyboard, the SH-09 monophonic synthesiser first produced in 1979, is another favourite; she played the duo's song "<a href="Train%20%28Goldfrapp%20song%29">Train</a>" (2003) on it and enjoys the sounds that it makes. Goldfrapp was also impressed by a Russian synth, enamored with its <a href="Russian%20language">Russian-language</a> writing.

"Ooh La La", "Supernature"'s <a href="opening%20track">opening track</a>, inspired by <a href="T.%20Rex%20%28band%29">T. Rex</a>, was chosen as its lead single "because it was up and in your face and it carried on the theme of the glammy, discoey beat from the last album". It was the duo's first song to feature the electric guitar, and received positive reviews, often being noted as a highlight of the album. "Ooh La La" became Goldfrapp's most successful single on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> to date when it peaked at number four, while topping the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Songs">Hot Dance Club Play</a> chart in the United States. The second track, "Lovely 2 C U", received mixed reviews from critics, with one reviewer stating that it was the "worst offender of sounding by-numbers, its lazy glam affectations sounding all the worse amid a chorus striking only in its complete dullness".

"<a href="Ride%20a%20White%20Horse">Ride a White Horse</a>", the third single, was inspired by the <a href="disco">disco</a> era. Like previous singles from the album, the song was another top-20 single in the UK, where it peaked at number 15. The ballads "You Never Know" and "Let It Take You" have minimal background electronics, and were generally well received by critics, who drew comparisons to Goldfrapp's debut album "<a href="Felt%20Mountain">Felt Mountain</a>". Goldfrapp's performance on "You Never Know" was described as "chameleonic" with odes to <a href="Debbie%20Harry">Debbie Harry</a> and <a href="Siouxsie%20Sioux">Siouxsie Sioux</a>. "<a href="Fly%20Me%20Away">Fly Me Away</a>", another synth ballad, had an associated <a href="music%20video">music video</a> which featured Goldfrapp as an animated doll; the video, however, was never released. Serving as the fourth and final single from "Supernature", the song was not heavily promoted and was less commercially successful than the other singles, peaking at number 26 on the UK chart. "Slide In", an <a href="electroclash">electroclash</a> song about sex, and "Koko" were compared to <a href="Gary%20Numan">Gary Numan</a>'s early compositions.

"<a href="Satin%20Boys%2C%20Flaming%20Chic">Satin Chic</a>" is a disco song with <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> and <a href="cabaret">cabaret</a> influences, similar to early <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>. Cited by Goldfrapp and Gregory as their favourite song on "Supernature", it was remixed by <a href="The%20Flaming%20Lips">The Flaming Lips</a>, and issued as a limited-edition single on 4 September 2006. The 10th track, "Time Out from the World", features an orchestra and whispered vocals by Goldfrapp. Critics liked the song, writing that it was an "exception to the prevailing style of "Supernature"" due to its "haunting, yet glamorous, atmospherics". The album's closing track and second single "<a href="Number%201%20%28Goldfrapp%20song%29">Number 1</a>" is about the importance and meanings of relationships. The song, which is based around a synth and bass arrangement, reached number nine on the UK Singles Chart and number one on the US Hot Dance Club Play chart.

The album was released in two versions: a single-disc version, which used <a href="Opendisc">Opendisc</a> technology to offer extras via a website, and a double-disc version which included the album in surround sound on both discs. The first disc is a hybrid <a href="Super%20Audio%20CD">SACD</a> with <a href="surround%20sound">5.1</a> multichannel SACD audio, stereo SACD audio and stereo <a href="compact%20disc">CD</a> audio. The second disc, a <a href="DVD-Video">DVD-Video</a>, contains the multichannel version of the album in <a href="DTS%20%28sound%20system%29">DTS</a> 96/24 as well as a documentary and music videos for "Ooh La La" and "Number 1".

The album cover, photographed by Ross Kirton, is a rear-view shot of Alison against a sparkly black background, looking over her shoulder while covering her breast with her hand. The regular edition cover shows her from the waist up, whereas the US special edition shows the cover art in its entirety, with Alison wearing a long plume of peacock feathers and golden platform shoes. In late 2005, the album ranked number eight on the annual <a href="Best%20Art%20Vinyl">Best Art Vinyl</a> poll.

"Supernature" received positive reviews from music critics. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="weighted%20mean">weighted mean</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 27 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". In a review rated four out of five stars, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" said that the album was "a brash, beautiful celebration of love and dancing". In a review for <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>, Adrien Begrand said that "[a]lthough "Supernature" lacks the imagination of "Felt Mountain" and the saucy brilliance of "Black Cherry", it doesn't pander to the pop crowd." Lauren Gitlin of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" said the album was "[t]oxic and delicious" and that ""Supernature" will make you do bad things—and like it." However, <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> reviewer Nitsuh Abebe was less impressed, and wrote that the album's songs "keep feeling like exercises: too thick and melodic to work like dance music, but with melodies that refuse to stick as satisfyingly as pop." Michael Hubbard of <a href="musicOMH">musicOMH</a> wrote a review for every song on "Supernature", and although he felt that it was a "curious, rather than classic, record", he criticised it for "fading out early on, with poor, low quality songs at the end which leave the listener feeling cheated". <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> critic Heather Phares called "Supernature" "Goldfrapp's most accessible album" and named "Ooh La La" as its best song.

In a review for Canadian-based website <a href="Jam%21">Jam!</a>, Andrew Carver praised the different sounds on "Supernature", which range from "a blend of future noise" to "crushed velvet corruption"; he described the album as "one sharp recording". Jessica Suarez of "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" magazine compared "Ooh La La" to "Black Cherry"'s "Strict Machine", saying that "Ooh La La" sounds "so simplistic that [its] minimalist repetition occasionally teeters over into redundancy". She praised "Ride a White Horse" and "Fly Me Away" for featuring Alison Goldfrapp's "velvet-soft vocals, which stay that way even when heavily processed". A less favourable reception came from <a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a> reviewer Edward Oculicz, who stated ""Supernature" is not a great album" and called several of its tracks too "dull".

"Rolling Stone" magazine ranked the album at number 32 on its list of The Top 50 Albums of 2006. In January 2008, the album was included on "The Daily Telegraph"'s list of the 120 essential pop albums. At the <a href="49th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">2007 Grammy Awards</a>, Goldfrapp received nominations for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dance/Electronic%20Album">Best Electronic/Dance Album</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dance%20Recording">Best Dance Recording</a> for "Ooh La La".

"Supernature" debuted on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> at number two (blocked from the top position by <a href="James%20Blunt">James Blunt</a>'s "<a href="Back%20to%20Bedlam">Back to Bedlam</a>"), selling 52,976 copies in its first week. The album was certified platinum by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">British Phonographic Industry</a> on 13 January 2006. By 20 December 2010, the album had sold 500,000 copies in the United Kingdom. The album attained moderate success across Europe, reaching the top 10 in Ireland, the top 20 in Belgium, the top 30 in Germany and Switzerland, and the top 40 in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands and Norway. In Oceania, it peaked at number 23 in Australia and number 35 in New Zealand.

"Supernature" became Goldfrapp's first album to chart on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart in the United States, where it peaked at number 138. It reached number three on the <a href="Top%20Heatseekers">Top Heatseekers</a> chart and number five on the <a href="Dance/Electronic%20Albums">Top Electronic Albums</a> chart. The album had sold 49,000 copies in the US as of August 2006. "Supernature" was also the duo's first release in Canada, reaching number 88 on the <a href="Canadian%20Albums%20Chart">Canadian Albums Chart</a>. The album had sold one million copies worldwide as of February 2008.

Eliza Acton

Elizabeth "Eliza" Acton (17 April 1799 – 13 February 1859) was an English <a href="Food%20writing">food writer</a> and poet, who produced one of Britain's first cookbooks aimed at the domestic reader, "<a href="Modern%20Cookery%20for%20Private%20Families">Modern Cookery for Private Families</a>". The book introduced the now-universal practice of listing ingredients and giving suggested cooking times for each recipe. It included the first recipes in English for <a href="Brussels%20sprout">Brussels sprout</a>s and for <a href="spaghetti">spaghetti</a>, and contains the first printed reference to <a href="Christmas%20pudding">Christmas pudding</a>.

Acton was born in 1799 in <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>. She was raised in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a> where she ran a girls' <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> before spending time in France. On her return to England in 1826 she published a collection of poetry and released her cookery book in 1845, aimed at <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> families. Written in an engaging prose, the book was well received by reviewers. It was reprinted within the year and several editions followed until 1918, when <a href="Longman">Longman</a>, the book's publisher, took the decision not to reprint. In 1857 Acton published "<a href="The%20English%20Bread%20Book">The English Bread-Book for Domestic Use</a>", a more academic and studious work than "Modern Cookery". The work consisted of a history of bread-making in England, a study of European methods of baking and numerous recipes.

In the later years of its publication, "Modern Cookery" was eclipsed by the success of <a href="Isabella%20Beeton">Isabella Beeton</a>'s bestselling "<a href="Mrs%20Beeton%27s%20Book%20of%20Household%20Management">Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management</a>" (1861), which included several recipes <a href="plagiarism">plagiarised</a> from Acton's work. Although "Modern Cookery" was not reprinted in full until 1994, the book has been admired by English cooks in the second part of the 20th century, and influenced many of them, including <a href="Elizabeth%20David">Elizabeth David</a>, <a href="Jane%20Grigson">Jane Grigson</a>, <a href="Delia%20Smith">Delia Smith</a> and <a href="Rick%20Stein">Rick Stein</a>.

Eliza Acton was born on 17 April 1799 in <a href="Battle%2C%20East%20Sussex">Battle</a>, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, and was <a href="baptised">baptised</a> at her local <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a> on 5 June. She was the eldest of six sisters and three brothers born to John Acton, a <a href="brewer">brewer</a>, and his wife Elizabeth, "" Mercer. By 1800 the family had moved to <a href="Ipswich">Ipswich</a>, <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>, where they lived in a house adjoining the St. Peter's Brewery, where John took employment running Trotman, Halliday & Studd, the company that owned the brewery. In 1811 Trotman died, and John was offered the opportunity to become the junior partner in the firm; he accepted and the business was renamed Studd, Halliday and Acton. Sheila Hardy, in her biography of Eliza, considers it likely that John would have borrowed heavily to buy himself into the business.

In 1817 Acton, with a Miss Nicolson—about whom no further information is known—opened a "<a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> for young ladies" in <a href="Claydon%2C%20Suffolk">Claydon</a>, just outside Ipswich. In 1819 Acton left the school and opened another in September with her sisters, this time at nearby <a href="Great%20Bealings">Great Bealings</a>; the school moved to <a href="Woodbridge%2C%20Suffolk">Woodbridge</a> in 1822 and had probably closed by 1825.

Early in her life Acton spent some time in France—either in Paris or the south of the country—but it is not known when she left England; Hardy considers it likely that she travelled in 1823. The food historian Elizabeth Ray, writing in the "<a href="Oxford%20Dictionary%20of%20National%20Biography">Oxford Dictionary of National Biography</a>", states that Acton travelled abroad for the good of her health, because she had a weak constitution. It is possible that she was pregnant when she left for Paris and that she went abroad to have an <a href="illegitimate">illegitimate</a> daughter. The food writers Mary Aylett and Olive Ordish theorise that Acton's child was raised by Sarah, Eliza's sister. The two observe that "there is no evidence for this, other than family tradition". Hardy dismisses the theory, stating that Acton did not have a sister called Sarah, let alone one who was married (none of Acton's sisters were married); she also observes that she has found no baptismal or census record that would account for a child of the right age. While in France Acton had an unhappy relationship with a French army officer; it is possible there was an engagement, but if so it was broken off. She returned to England, probably in 1826.

Acton had been writing poetry since at least 1822, as she wrote that year on the bottom of one of her poems. She wrote at least one while in France, "On Approaching Paris", which she dated 1826. When she returned to England, she arranged for a collection to be published by <a href="Longman">Longman</a>. As was the practice for publishers at the time, Acton had to provide the names of subscribers—those who had pre-paid for a copy—who were listed inside the work; nearly all came from Suffolk. 328 copies were printed in October 1826 and a reprint was needed within a month. She subsequently wrote some longer poems, including "The Chronicles of Castel Framlingham", which was printed in the "Sudbury Chronicle" in 1838, and "The Voice of the North", which was written in 1842 on the occasion of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s first visit to Scotland. Other poems were published in a local periodical, the "Sudbury Pocket Book".

In 1827 John Acton was declared <a href="Bankruptcy">bankrupt</a>, and the company in which he was a partner was dissolved; one of his business partners was involved in the claim against him. The <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Bankruptcy%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">Commissioner of Bankruptcy</a> ordered John to surrender himself to the Office of the Commissioners to disclose his wealth, but he fled to France. In his absence his family moved into Bordyke House, near <a href="Tonbridge">Tonbridge</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, where Elizabeth Acton, Eliza's mother, turned the large building into a boarding house for <a href="upper%20class">upper class</a> guests, particularly for those who wanted to visit <a href="Royal%20Tunbridge%20Wells">Royal Tunbridge Wells</a> and enjoy the <a href="spa">spa</a> facilities there. It is likely that Elizabeth left Bordyke House around 1841, although her daughter remained in residence.

At some point—Hardy considers 1835; Aylett and Ordish consider 1837—Acton sent a further set of poems to Longman for publishing. The company reportedly declined the poems, and suggested that she write a cookery book instead; Hardy considers the story apocryphal. By her own account, Acton took ten years to develop her cookery book, which was published in January 1845 under the title "<a href="Modern%20Cookery%20for%20Private%20Families">Modern Cookery in all its Branches</a>". The work was aimed at the English <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>es; in the preface she wrote:

The details of domestic economy, in particular, are no longer sneered at as beneath the attention of the educated and accomplished; and the truly refined, intelligent, and high-minded women of England have ceased, in these days of comparative good sense, to consider their acquaintance with such details as inconsistent with their dignity or injurious to their attractions.

"Modern Cookery" consists of mainly English recipes, although Acton labelled several of them "French". A chapter covers <a href="curries">curries</a> (and potted meats), and gives recipes for Eastern "<a href="chutney">chatneys</a>" (chutney), treating them as a naturalised Anglo-Indian dish, rather than of solely Indian origin, according to the professor of English literature Susan Zlotnick. The book contains the first known mention of <a href="Christmas%20pudding">Christmas pudding</a>, which had previously been called plum pudding, the first recipe for <a href="brussels%20sprout">brussels sprout</a>s, and the first use in an English cookbook of the word "spaghetti"—which she spelled "sparghetti". Acton's layout for each recipe was for the description of the cooking process followed by a list of ingredients and the total cooking time required for the preparation of the dish. With the inclusion of timings and ingredients, "Modern Cookery" differed from other cookery books, and was a development of Acton's own. Acton wrote that each recipe had been cooked and "proved beneath our own roof and under our own personal inspection". The food historian Sarah Freeman describes the cooking instructions Acton produced as being written "so conscientiously, and with such gastronomic sensitivity, that ... ["Modern Cookery"] was as much a work of art on food as it was functional".

The reviews for "Modern Cookery" were positive, and the critic from "<a href="The%20Morning%20Post">The Morning Post</a>" considered it "unquestionably the most valuable compendium of the art that has yet been published". The review in "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" stated that the order of the book was "very natural", while "the methods are clearly described, and seem founded on chemical principles"; the reviewer for the "<a href="Kentish%20Gazette">Kentish Gazette</a>" also commended the clarity of the instructions, and the inclusion of ingredients and timings. The unnamed critic for "<a href="The%20Atlas%20%28newspaper%29">The Atlas</a>" described the layout for the recipes to be "excellent" and, in a positive review in "The Exeter and Plymouth Gazette", praise was given to "the intelligibility of the instructions which are given", which contrasted with other cookery books.

A second edition of "Modern Cookery" was released in May 1845, containing corrections and updates; Longmans also released this version in the US, through the Philadelphia company of Lea & Blanchard. The book sold well, and in June 1845 Longmans sent Acton £67 11<a href="shilling">s</a> 2d as her share of the profits. In subsequent years she earned £162 in 1846 and £189 in 1847, when she was being paid half the profits; in 1849 she dropped to quarter of the profits and received £83.

Some time after "Modern Cookery" was published, Acton moved from Tonbridge to <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, north west London. She became the cookery correspondent for the weekly magazines "The Ladies' Companion" and "Household Words", and began writing research for a book on nourishment for the ill, "Invalid Cookery". She interrupted her research to write a new edition of "Modern Cookery". This was published in 1855, and renamed as "Modern Cookery for Private Families", the name by which it is best known. This version contains an additional chapter named "Foreign and Jewish Cookery"; the Jewish recipes are from <a href="Ashkenazi%20cuisine">Ashkenazi cuisine</a>. Such was the success of her first editions of the book, it was increasingly copied by other cookery writers. In the preface to the 1855 edition, Acton wrote of "the unscrupulous manner in which large portions of my volume have been appropriated by contemporary authors, without the slightest acknowledgement of the source from which they have been derived". She was in increasingly poor health during the 1850s and wrote in her preface that she was "suffering at present too severe a penalty for ... over-exertion"; this toil, she continued, was "so completely at variance with all the previous habits of my life, and ... so injurious in its effects".

Acton had been disappointed that she had not been able to add as much information into the 1855 edition about bread-making as she wanted to, but decided, despite her health, that she would take on the subject in a new work, "<a href="The%20English%20Bread%20Book">The English Bread-Book for Domestic Use</a>". Published in May 1857, this was not a recipe book along the same lines as "Modern Cookery", but is described by Hardy as "a serious, scientific study ... much darker in tone than her previous work". It consists of a history of bread-making in England, improvements made to the bread-making process in Europe, an examination of the ingredients used and recipes of different types of bread. Acton also included information about the <a href="Adulterant">adulteration of bread</a> by <a href="Gristmill">flour millers</a> and bakers of the time, which included the addition of <a href="alum">alum</a> and what she called "other deleterious substances". The food writer Elizabeth Ray observes that the book was less successful than "Modern Cookery", and was not reprinted until 1990.

Acton, who suffered from poor health for much of her life, died at home on 13 February 1859, at the age of 59. She was buried four days later at <a href="St%20John-at-Hampstead">St John-at-Hampstead</a> church, London.

Lee Christine O'Brien, in her examination of 19th-century women's poetry, considers that Acton "participated in a poetic field the richness of which eclipsed her own output". O'Brien sees humour and humanity in some of Acton's poetry. Aylett and Ordish class Acton's poetry as being written in a <a href="Romantic%20poetry">romantic</a> style; they consider the work to be "accomplished rather than inspired", although it is also "derivative and often banal" and clichéd. Hardy identifies themes repeated through Acton's poems of the praise of nature and a pleasure in twilight; most of them were on the theme of <a href="unrequited%20love">unrequited love</a> and several may relate to her feelings towards her possible former fiancée. Hardy also sees in the poems an "almost masculine intensity and depth of feeling". O'Brien sees humour in some of Acton's poetry, and cites "Come To My Grave"—a work about "a mildly acerbic and witty potential revenant, musing on revenge"—as a parody of a love lyric with <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic romantic</a> overtones.

<poem>
Come to my grave when I am gone,
And bend a moment there alone;
It will not cost thee much of pain
To trample on my heart again–
Or, if it would, for ever stay
Far distant from my mouldering clay:
I would not wound thy breast to prove
E'en its most deep, 'remorse of love.'
The grave should be a shrine of peace
Where all unkindly feelings cease;–
Though thou wilt calmly gaze on mine
I would not live the hour to see,
Which doom'd my glance to rest on thine:–
That moment's bitter agony
Would bid the very life-blood start
Back, and congeal around my heart!–
</poem>

O'Brien sees that, through the high quality of Acton's prose, "Modern Cookery" is a unique cultural document. As the food writer <a href="Elizabeth%20David">Elizabeth David</a> writes,

[Acton's] ... book was the final expression ... of pre-Industrial England's taste in food and attitude to cookery. The dishes she describes and the ingredients which went into them would have been familiar to <a href="Jane%20Austen">Jane Austen</a> and <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>, to <a href="Frances%20Burney">Fanny Burnley</a> and <a href="Tobias%20Smollett">Tobias Smollett</a>.

Many of the dishes Acton describes belong, according to David, to the 18th century and, with increasing industrialisation and urbanisation of the 19th century, the staple foods described were already being replaced. David cites the example of <a href="Bird%27s%20Custard">Bird's Custard Powder</a>, launched in 1840, as an example of the radical changes being introduced to cooking. Acton adopted some of the changes in food science into the 1855 re-write of the book, including the developments of <a href="Justus%20von%20Liebig">Justus von Liebig</a>—the developer of the <a href="Oxo%20%28food%29">Oxo</a> brand beef <a href="bouillon%20cube">bouillon cube</a>—and <a href="William%20Gregory%20%28chemist%29">William Gregory</a>, Liebig's pupil and translator.

Acton, in her preface to "Modern Cookery", writes that her "first and best attention has been bestowed on ... what are usually termed plain English dishes" for her recipes, and Christopher Driver, the journalist and food critic, considers the book "as English as ... [its] eighteenth-century predecessors". Elizabeth Ray observes that while Acton "is basically a very English cook", many of the recipes are labelled as French dishes, and foreign food is given its own chapter. These are recipes from the cuisines of Indian, Syria, Turkey, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Mauritius, Switzerland and the West Indies. Acton was willing to learn from foreign food cultures, and wrote "Without adopting blindly foreign modes in anything merely because they "are" foreign, surely we should be wise to learn from other nations". Similarly, "The English Bread Book" was focused on British bread and, in her preface, Acton wrote "Bread is a first necessity of life to the great mass of the English people; being in part the food of all—the chief food of many—and almost the sole food of many more." She devotes a whole chapter to the approach to bread and bread-making in France, Germany and Belgium, and the book contains recipes for German <a href="pumpernickel">pumpernickel</a>, French <a href="baguette">baguette</a>s, Italian <a href="polenta">polenta</a> bread, Turkish rolls and Indian breads.

The food historian Bob Ashley identifies that the strongest theme in "Modern Cookery" is economy in food, although this is also tempered by Acton's advice to reject dubious ingredients. In her preface to the book, Acton writes that "It may be safely averred that good cookery is the best and truest economy, turning to full account every wholesome article of food, and converting into palatable meals what the ignorant either render uneatable or throw away in disdain". She provides a recipe for "Elegant Economist's Pudding", which uses left-over Christmas pudding; when giving a recipe for "Superlative Hare Soup", she also provides one for "A Less Expensive Hare Soup". The social historian <a href="John%20Burnett%20%28historian%29">John Burnet</a> observes that although the dishes were supposedly aimed at middle class families of modest income, the book contains recipes that include truffles in champagne, soles in cream and a pie of venison and hare.

The food writer <a href="Alan%20Davidson%20%28food%20writer%29">Alan Davidson</a> considers "Modern Cookery" to be "among the most elegantly written (and practical) cookery books ever published". Nicola Humble, in her book on the history of British cookbooks, writes that Acton provides "the quirky, confident perspective of the expert" in text that is "alive with adjectives and opinions ... the prose enthuses and evokes". In 1968 Elizabeth David wrote that Acton's recipes were both illuminating and decisive. Examining a 100-word paragraph in "Modern Cookery" for instructions on beating egg whites for a sponge cake, David considers it superior to an eight-page piece on the same topic in the 1927 work "<a href="La%20bonne%20cuisine%20de%20Madame%20E.%20Saint-Ange">La bonne cuisine de Madame E. Saint-Ange</a>".

There is humour in Acton's work, particularly when reporting on a recipe going wrong. Her recipe for Publisher's Pudding, which contains <a href="cognac">cognac</a>, <a href="macaroon">macaroon</a>s, cream and almonds, "can scarcely be made "too rich"", while the Poor Author's Pudding is made with milk, bread, eggs and sugar, and is a more simple dish. Similarly, in her recipe for Superior Pine-Apple Marmalade, she writes that if the mixture is placed onto a direct heat it "will often convert what would otherwise be excellent preserve, into a strange sort of compound, for which it is difficult to find a name".

"Modern Cookery" remained in print until 1918, when its popularity waned in the face of competition from other books and Longmans took the decision not to republish. Acton's works remained out of print until 1968 when a selection of her recipes was collected into "The Best of Eliza Acton", edited by Elizabeth Ray and including an introduction by Elizabeth David. "Modern Cookery" was not reprinted in full until 1994, although "The English Bread Book" was reprinted in 1990.

In 1857, when <a href="Isabella%20Beeton">Isabella Beeton</a> began writing the cookery column for "<a href="The%20Englishwoman%27s%20Domestic%20Magazine">The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine</a>", many of the recipes were <a href="plagiarism">plagiarised</a> from "Modern Cookery". In 1861 Isabella's husband, <a href="Samuel%20Orchart%20Beeton">Samuel</a>, published "<a href="Mrs%20Beeton%27s%20Book%20of%20Household%20Management">Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management</a>", which also contained several of Acton's recipes. Isabella Beeton's biographer <a href="Kathryn%20Hughes">Kathryn Hughes</a> gives as examples one third of Beeton's soup dishes and a quarter of her fish recipes, which are all taken from Acton. In her works, Isabella Beeton partly followed the new layout of Acton's recipes, although with a major alteration: whereas "Modern Cookery" provides the method of cooking followed by a list of the required ingredients, the recipes in "The Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine" and "Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management" list the timings and components before the cooking process.

The food historian <a href="Bee%20Wilson">Bee Wilson</a> considers many modern cookery writers to be indebted to Acton and her work. Elizabeth David wrote in 1977 that "The English Bread Book" was a major influence on and source for her own "English Bread and Yeast Cookery", and that she owes Acton a debt for it; David also describes "Modern Cookery" as "the greatest cookery book in our language". The cook <a href="Delia%20Smith">Delia Smith</a> is of a similar opinion, and describes Acton as "the best cookery writer in the English language". The cookery writer <a href="Jane%20Grigson">Jane Grigson</a> was influenced by Acton, particularly when she wrote "English Food" (1974), while the chef <a href="Rick%20Stein">Rick Stein</a> included her "Soles Stewed in Cream" in his cookbook "Seafood Lovers' Guide" (2000).

1911 Atlantic hurricane season

The 1911 Atlantic hurricane season was relatively inactive, with only six known tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic during the summer and fall. There were three suspected tropical depressions, including one that began the season in February and one that ended the season when it dissipated in December. Three storms intensified into hurricanes, two of which attained Category 2 status on the modern-day <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20Hurricane%20Scale">Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale</a>. Storm data is largely based on the <a href="HURDAT">Atlantic hurricane database</a>, which underwent a thorough revision for the period between 1911 and 1914 in 2005.

Most of the cyclones directly impacted land. A westward-moving hurricane killed 17 people and severely damaged <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, and the surrounding area in late August. A couple of weeks earlier, the <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a> area had a storm in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> that produced winds of over land. The fourth storm of the season struck the coast of <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>, killing 10 and causing extensive damage.

The <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a> hurricane database (HURDAT) officially recognizes six tropical cyclones from the 1911 season. Only three attained hurricane status, with winds of or greater. The third hurricane of the season was the most intense storm, with a minimum central <a href="barometric%20pressure">air pressure</a> of . A week after its dissipation, another hurricane formed with wind speeds that matched the previous storm, but with unknown air pressure. Three weak tropical depressions developed and remained below tropical storm force; the first formed in February and the third in December. The first storm to reach tropical storm intensity developed on August 4, and the final tropical storm of the year dissipated on October 31.

The early 1900s lacked modern forecasting and documentation. The hurricane database from these years is sometimes found to be incomplete or incorrect, and new storms are continually being added as part of the ongoing <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane%20reanalysis">Atlantic hurricane reanalysis</a>. The period from 1911 through 1914 was reanalyzed in 2005. Two previously unknown tropical cyclones were identified using records including historical weather maps and ship reports, and information on the known storms was amended and corrected. These storms are referred to simply by their number in chronological order, since tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were not given official names until much later.

Identified by its lack of associated <a href="weather%20front">frontal boundaries</a> and closed circulation center, the first tropical cyclone of the 1911 season formed on August 4 over southern <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. At only tropical depression strength, it tracked eastward and emerged into the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> the next day. Several days later, while located near <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>, the depression became a tropical storm and turned northeastward. The storm lasted several more days until dissipating on August 11. The storm produced heavy rainfall on the Bermuda, but no gale-force winds were reported. The storm was unknown until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane database revision recognized it as a tropical storm.

Based on ship observations in the southeastern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, a <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure area</a> developed north of <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a> in early August. It <a href="tropical%20cyclogenesis">developed</a> into a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> at 12:00 <a href="Coordinated%20Universal%20Time">UTC</a> on August 8, and strengthened into a <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a> at 06:00 UTC on August 9 while moving northwestward off the west coast of Florida. Gradual intensification continued, and at 06:00 UTC on August 11 the storm strengthened to hurricane status. At 22:00 UTC on August 11, the hurricane reached its peak intensity and concurrently made <a href="landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near the border between <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> and <a href="Florida">Florida</a> as a small tropical cyclone. During this time, the storm's <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s were estimated at 80 mph (130 km/h), making it the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day <a href="Saffir%E2%80%93Simpson%20hurricane%20wind%20scale">Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale</a>. A lull in the storm accompanied the nearby passage of its <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye</a> before conditions once again deteriorated. Although the lowest <a href="barometric%20pressure">barometric pressure</a> measured on land was 1007 <a href="bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 29.74 <a href="inches%20of%20mercury">inHg</a>) in <a href="Pensacola%2C%20Florida">Pensacola, Florida</a>, the storm's pressure was estimated to be much lower at 982 mbar (hPa: 29.00 inHg). After making landfall, the hurricane weakened and slowly drifted westward, weakening to a tropical depression over <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> on August 13, before dissipating over <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> by 12:00 UTC the next day.

While developing in the Gulf of Mexico, the tropical cyclone brought light rainfall to Key West, amounting to over two days. The hurricane's outer <a href="rainband">rainband</a>s affected the <a href="Florida%20panhandle">Florida panhandle</a> as early as August 10, producing winds as strong as in Pensacola, where it was considered the worst since <a href="1906%20Mississippi%20hurricane">1906</a>. During the afternoon of August 11, the <a href="United%20States%20Weather%20Bureau">United States Weather Bureau</a> issued <a href="tropical%20cyclone%20watches%20and%20warnings">storm warnings</a> for coastal areas of the <a href="United%20States%20Gulf%20Coast">gulf coast</a> where the hurricane was expected to impact. Upon making landfall, the storm brought heavy precipitation, peaking at in <a href="Molino%2C%20Florida">Molino, Florida</a>, although the heaviest rainfall was localized from Mississippi to central Alabama. Some washouts occurred during brief episodes of heavy rain as the storm drifted westward after landfall. Strong winds in the Pensacola area downed telecommunication lines and disrupted power, cutting off communication to outside areas for 24 hours. A pavilion on <a href="Santa%20Rosa%20Island%20%28Florida%29">Santa Rosa Island</a> had a third of its roof torn, and some other buildings inland were also unroofed. Offshore, twelve barges were grounded after being swept by the rough surf. Heavy losses were reported to timber after they were swept away when <a href="log%20boom">log boom</a>s failed. Damage figures from the Pensacola area were conservatively estimated at <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>12,600, considered lighter than expected, although there were some deaths.

Over a week after the dissipation of the previous hurricane, the third storm of the season developed on August 23 and slowly tracked west-northwestward. After attaining hurricane status, the storm turned more towards the northwest, and several days later reached its peak wind speeds of 100 mph (155 km/h); a barometric pressure of 972 mbar (hPa) was reported. The center passed inland a few miles south of <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a>, on August 28; upon making landfall, the hurricane rapidly degenerated. It deteriorated into a tropical depression on August 29 and persisted over land until dissipating a couple of days later.

The hurricane, relatively small in size, caused widespread damage between Savannah and <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. Savannah itself received only minor damage, although the storm's center passed close by. Along the coast of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, torrential rainfall caused numerous washouts on railroads. Crops, livestock and roads in the area took heavy damage. At Charleston, winds were estimated at after an <a href="anemometer">anemometer</a>, last reporting , failed, and of precipitation fell over three days.

The storm raged for more than 36 hours, causing severe damage; the winds unroofed hundreds of buildings, demolished many houses and had an extensive impact on power and telephone services. Tides above normal left a "confused mass of wrecked vessels and damaged wharfs", according to a local forecaster in Charleston, while six navy torpedo boats were ripped from their moorings and blown ashore. In total, 17 people were killed in the hurricane, and property damage in Charleston was estimated at $1 million (1911 USD, $ 2014 USD).

The next storm formed well to the east of the <a href="Lesser%20Antilles">Lesser Antilles</a> on September 3 and moved westward, attaining tropical storm status about a day later. The storm slowed and curved toward the southwest, nearing the northern coast of <a href="Colombia">Colombia</a> before pulling away from land and strengthening into a hurricane. It further intensified to Category 2 status before striking <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a> on September 10. Quickly weakening to a tropical storm, the cyclone continued westward across <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> and briefly entered the eastern <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>. It dissipated shortly thereafter. In the town of <a href="Corinto%2C%20Nicaragua">Corinto</a>, a report indicated the deaths of 10 people and 50 additional injuries. About 250 houses were destroyed, leaving approximately $2 million (1911 USD, $ 2014 USD) in damage. Data on this storm is extremely scarce; as such, only minor revisions could be made to its chronology in the hurricane database.

The fifth official tropical cyclone of the year was also previously unknown until contemporary reassessments. It exhibited some hybrid characteristics, and may have qualified for <a href="subtropical%20cyclone">subtropical cyclone</a> status according to the modern classification scheme. On September 15, the storm formed over the central Atlantic and initially moved westward. It gradually intensified as it turned northwestward, and on September 19 it transitioned into an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> southeast of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. The system was subsequently absorbed by a more powerful frontal boundary approaching from the northwest.

The final storm was first observed as a disturbance near <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> in the <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a> in late October. The disturbance was the precursor to a tropical depression which developed over the southern <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> and headed west-southwestward across <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, where, at <a href="Havana%2C%20Cuba">Havana</a>, winds blew from the southeast at . It became a tropical storm on October 27 and drifted southwestward. Near the eastern tip of the <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n%20Peninsula">Yucatán Peninsula</a>, the storm turned sharply northward. An area of <a href="high%20pressure%20area">high pressure</a> over the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> prevented the cyclone from turning eastward toward Florida, and it continued into the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. However, on October 31, the storm curved eastward and moved ashore over northern Florida. The storm decreased in intensity as it passed into the Atlantic. The storm's circulation center remained poorly defined throughout its course. It was long believed to have developed south of Cuba, although a reevaluation of ship data indicated the depression had actually formed east of the island. On October 26, the Weather Bureau hoisted hurricane warnings along the east coast of Florida from <a href="Key%20West%2C%20Florida">Key West</a> to <a href="West%20Palm%20Beach%2C%20Florida">West Palm Beach</a>, and on the west coast up to <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a>.
In addition to the six officially recognized tropical storms and hurricanes, three tropical depressions in the 1911 season have been identified. The first developed in February from a <a href="trough%20%28meteorology%29">trough</a> of low pressure in the open Atlantic and progressed westward. Although a ship dubiously reported winds of over in association with the system, a lack of supporting evidence precludes its designation as a tropical storm. The cyclone dissipated by February 21. The second depression evolved from an <a href="extratropical%20cyclone">extratropical cyclone</a> in mid- to late May, becoming a tropical cyclone on May 22 northeast of Bermuda. It persisted for three days as it meandered around the same general area before being absorbed by another non-tropical storm. The modern-day documentation of this system was also hindered by a lack of data. On December 11, the third tropical depression formed near the <a href="Turks%20and%20Caicos%20Islands">Turks and Caicos Islands</a>. It progressed westward and was situated just north of eastern Cuba the next day. The system began to weaken on December 13 and dissipated shortly thereafter.

Margaret Lea Houston

Margaret Lea Houston (April 11, 1819 – December 3, 1867) was First Lady of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas</a> during her husband <a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a>'s second term as <a href="President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Texas">President of the Republic of Texas</a>. They met following the first of his two non-consecutive terms as the Republic's president, and married when he was a representative in the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Texas">Congress of the Republic of Texas</a>. She was his third wife, remaining with him until his death.

She came from a close-knit family in Alabama, many of whom also moved to Texas when she married the man who was an accomplished politician in both Tennessee and Texas, and who had won the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a> during the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>. The couple had eight children, and she gave birth to most of them while he was away attending to politics. Her mother Nancy Lea was a constant in their lives, helping with the children, managing the household help, and always providing either financial assistance or temporary housing. With the help of her extended family in Texas, Margaret convinced her husband to give up both alcohol and profane language. He believed his wife to be an exemplary woman of faith and, under her influence, converted to the Baptist denomination, after he had many years earlier been baptized a Catholic in <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20Texas">Nacogdoches, Texas</a>.

Following the <a href="Annexation%20of%20Texas">Annexation of Texas</a> to the United States, Sam Houston shuttled back and forth to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> as the state's <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. senator</a> for 13 years, while Margaret remained in Texas raising their children. When he was elected the state's governor, Margaret became First Lady of the state of <a href="Texas">Texas</a> and was pregnant with their last child. Her brief tenure came on the cusp of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, at a time when the state was <a href="Texas%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">torn apart</a> over the debate of whether or not to secede from the United States, while her husband worked in vain to defeat the Texas <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">Ordinance of Secession</a>. There had been an attempt on his life, and angry mobs gathered in the streets near the governor's mansion. With children to protect, and no government security forces in place, she lived in fear for her family's safety.

Her husband was removed from office by the Texas Secession Convention for refusing to swear loyalty to the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a>. Margaret became a war-time mother, whose eldest son joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate Army</a> and was taken prisoner at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>. Her husband died before the end of the war. In her few remaining years, she became the keeper of the Sam Houston legacy and opened his records to a trusted biographer. When she died of <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> four and a half years later, Margaret could not be buried with her husband in a public cemetery in <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Texas">Huntsville</a> for fear of contamination, and was instead interred next to her mother on private property.

Margaret Moffette Lea was born April 11, 1819, into a family of devout <a href="Baptists%20in%20the%20United%20States">Baptists</a> in <a href="Perry%20County%2C%20Alabama">Perry County, Alabama</a>. Her father Temple Lea was a church deacon and the state treasurer of the <a href="Alabama%20Baptist%20Convention">Alabama Baptist Convention</a>, and her mother Nancy Moffette Lea was the only woman delegate at the convention's formation. Margaret was the fifth of six children that included older siblings Martin, Varilla, Henry Clinton and Vernal, as well as younger sister Antoinette. The Lea <a href="Plantations%20in%20the%20American%20South">cotton plantation</a> had been acquired with money from a Moffette family inheritance, and was operated by Nancy.

When her father died in 1834, she inherited four <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a>, including <a href="Joshua%20Houston">Joshua</a> and Eliza, her favorite. The older Lea children had married prior to Temple's death, but Vernal, Margaret and Antoinette accompanied the widowed Nancy when she moved into her son Henry's home at <a href="Marion%2C%20Alabama">Marion</a>. He was an accomplished attorney who sat on the boards of educational institutions, and would be elected to the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Senate">Alabama State Senate</a> in 1836. Margaret was enrolled at Professor McLean's School, and also attended <a href="Judson%20Female%20Institute">Judson Female Institute</a>. The latter was founded by Baptists to instruct genteel young women in what were acceptable goals of their time and place, "proficiency in needlework, dancing, drawing, and penmanship". Heavy emphasis was put on Baptist theology and missionary work. She wrote poetry and read romantic novels, while also becoming accomplished on guitar, harp and piano. Reverend Peter Crawford baptized her in the <a href="Siloam%20Baptist%20Church">Siloam Baptist Church</a> of Marion when she was 19, by which time the eligible young lady was considered "accomplished, well-connected and deeply religious".

<a href="Sam%20Houston">Sam Houston</a> was an attorney by profession and politically accomplished even before he moved to Texas. In Tennessee, he had been both a member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> and <a href="Governor%20of%20Tennessee">Governor</a>. His military victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a> elevated him to hero status in Texas. After completing his first term as <a href="President%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Texas">President of the Republic of Texas</a> in early December 1838, he continued to practice law from his office in <a href="Liberty%2C%20Texas">Liberty</a>. He arrived in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, in the early months of 1839 as a partner of the Sabine City Company, seeking investors to develop a community that is today known as <a href="Sabine%20Pass%2C%20Port%20Arthur%2C%20Texas">Sabine Pass</a>. Through Martin Lea, he made the acquaintance of Antoinette's husband William Bledsoe, a wealthy businessman who in turn suggested Nancy Lea as a possible investor. Invited to a garden party at Martin's home, it was there Houston first became acquainted with Margaret. The mutual attraction was instantaneous.

Nancy was favorably impressed with Houston's land sales pitch, but not so impressed with his interest in her daughter. She and others in the family were concerned about his reputation as a hard-drinking carouser with a proclivity for profanity, who was 26 years older than Margaret and twice married. Several weeks of love letters had been exchanged between Margaret and Houston by the time he proposed marriage that summer of 1839, presenting her with his image carved on a <a href="brooch">brooch</a>. In an effort to assuage the family's opposition to the union, Houston spent several weeks in the Lea home in Alabama.

In September during his absence from Texas, his supporters in <a href="San%20Augustine%20County%2C%20Texas">San Augustine County</a> elected him to serve in the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Texas">Republic of Texas House of Representatives</a>. When the couple's engagement was announced in newspapers, the Leas were not the only ones who were skeptical. Acquaintances in Texas were well versed with his personal history and aware that he had not divorced the first wife when he married again, only recently obtaining that divorce with hopes of marrying a Texas woman who, as it played out, rejected him for another suitor. Political crony <a href="Barnard%20E.%20Bee%20Sr.">Barnard E. Bee Sr.</a> tried to discourage him from making a third attempt at marriage, believing him to be "totally disqualified for domestic happiness."

As the day of their May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with uncertainty and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man with whom she had fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to <a href="Galveston%2C%20Texas">Galveston</a>, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the hustle and bustle and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.

The year before he met Margaret, Houston had purchased property at Cedar Point on <a href="Galveston%20Bay">Galveston Bay</a> in <a href="Chambers%20County%2C%20Texas">Chambers County</a>, which he named Raven Moor, and planned to expand with income from his law practice. The existing two-room log <a href="dogtrot%20house">dogtrot house</a> with its detached slaves' quarters overlooked <a href="Galveston%20Bay">Galveston Bay</a> and became the newlyweds' first home, filled with both Margaret's personal furnishings from Alabama, as well as newer pieces. She renamed it Ben Lomond as a <a href="hat%20tip">tip of the hat</a> to the romantic <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a> works she had read, and delegated management of the household to her mother Nancy. 

During his second term as representative from San Augustine, Houston was elected in 1841 to once again serve as the Republic's president. Margaret disliked campaign events and, giving up her privacy, frequently staying home while her husband traveled about the Republic canvassing for votes. Yet, when she rose to the occasion, such as the extended post-election tour of San Augustine County and victory celebrations in <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Texas">Washington County</a> and <a href="Houston">Houston City</a>, the public adored her, and she became an impressive political asset. She rode in a local presidential parade, but stayed home rather than travel to the inauguration in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin</a>. When the couple appeared at several events in <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20Texas">Nacogdoches</a>, his old friends took notice of his total avoidance of alcohol, and he continued to assure her that he was giving it up completely. He also began to clean up his language to please his new wife, and would eventually claim to have eliminated his profanity altogether.

Approximately north of Ben Lomond, the Bledsoes operated a sugar cane plantation at Grand Cane in <a href="Liberty%20County%2C%20Texas">Liberty County</a>. Financially supplemented by Nancy, the plantation became a family gathering place. About a year after Vernal and Mary Lea also moved there, Mary suffered a pregnancy <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. Not long after that, the couple accepted trusteeship of a 7-year-old Galveston orphan named Virginia Thorne, who was then placed in the care of Nancy. It was a problematic relationship from the beginning, and would grow to have legal ramifications for Margaret.

Events leading up to the 1842 <a href="Battle%20of%20Salado%20Creek%20%281842%29">Battle of Salado Creek</a> caused Houston to believe that Mexico was planning a full-scale invasion to re-take Texas. In response, he moved the Republic's capital farther east to <a href="Washington-on-the-Brazos%2C%20Texas">Washington-on-the-Brazos</a>, and sent Margaret back to her relatives in Alabama. Upon her later return, they temporarily lived with the Lockhart family at Washington-on-the-Brazos until they were able to acquire a small home there. The couple's first child Sam Houston Jr. was born in the new house on May 25, 1843. Upon learning of her son Martin's death in a duel, Nancy moved in with the Houstons, helping Margaret with the new baby, and over Houston's objections, pitching in with some financial assistance for food and household necessities.

When his presidential term ended on December 9, 1844, Houston turned his attention to the Raven Hill plantation he had acquired that year northwest of Grand Cane and east of <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Texas">Huntsville</a>. Margaret's slave Joshua was put in charge of the carpentry to build her a new house. Nancy, Margaret and sister Antoinette devoted their time to activities in Grand Cane's Concord Baptist Church, of which they were founding members. She continued to be a wife who was happiest when she and her husband stayed close to home. Although she accompanied him to President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>'s Tennessee funeral in the summer of 1845, she did not attend fetes held in her husband's honor by his old friends and supporters. During the latter part of the year, Antoinette's husband William died, followed a few months later by the death of Vernal's wife Mary. Prior to her death, she had elicited a promise from Margaret to assume the trusteeship of Virginia Thorne.

Texas officially relinquished its sovereignty on February 19, 1846, to become the <a href="Annexation%20of%20Texas">28th state</a> in the union, and Houston was elected by the <a href="Texas%20Legislature">Texas State Legislature</a> to serve in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>. Margaret's pregnancy prevented her from accompanying him, so when time and duty permitted he traveled back and forth between Texas and a temporary hotel residence in the nation's capital. When Reverend George W. Samson first met Houston at the E-Street Baptist Church in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, the senator told him that his attendance had been influenced by "one of the best Christians on earth," his wife Margaret. For the duration of his senatorial service, Houston regularly attended the E-Street church, sharing his wife's letters with Samson and delving into theological discussions pertaining to Margaret's interpretation of <a href="Christian%20biblical%20canons">scriptures</a>.

Margaret's sister Antoinette <a href="wikt%3Aelope">eloped</a> with wealthy Galveston businessman Charles Power in April and began a new life on his sugar plantation. Houston was home during a Congressional recess when their second child Nancy (Nannie) Elizabeth Houston was born at Raven Hill on September 6. About this time, in a letter to Houston that gave insight into Nancy's forceful constant presence in their lives, Margaret conceded, "She is high spirited and a little overbearing, I admit ..." but advised her husband to just give in to the insignificant issues. Houston replied, "I love the old Lady as a Mother, and have resolved to defer to her age and her disposition. Her blood is much like my own."
During the early part of 1847, Houston's letters to Margaret were filled with his weariness of being away from home, and his concern that he had no letters from her for weeks. He promised that at the end of the current legislative session, he would "... fly with all speed to meet and greet my Love and embrace our little ones." When she finally answered, she initially only told him of a serious illness that Sam Jr. had since recovered from, even though he was aware of previous problems she had with a breast lump. She had been advised to see a specialist in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>, if there was a recurrence. When complications appeared, family friend Dr. <a href="Ashbel%20Smith">Ashbel Smith</a> recommended surgery in Texas; only then, did she inform her husband of the situation. Upon receipt of her letter, Houston immediately departed Washington, D.C.

After his return home, Houston negotiated a labor-swap arrangement with Raven Hill's overseer Captain Frank Hatch. In lieu of a cash payment for his services, the bulk of Houston's slave labor force was engaged to work on Hatch's property at Bermuda Spring. The remaining slaves were retained as house labor for Margaret. Eventually, Houston became the owner of Bermuda Spring when he and Hatch swapped properties, and he set about to build the <a href="Woodland%20%28Huntsville%2C%20Texas%29">Woodland</a> home for his wife. The first child to be born in the house was Margaret (Maggie) Lea Houston, arriving on April 13, 1848, while Congress was in session and Houston was in Washington.

The widowed Vernal remarried to Catherine Davis Goodall in 1849, but trusteeship of Virginia Thorne, by now a teenager, remained with Margaret. With most of his time spent in the nation's capital, Houston's perception of Thorne was primarily second-hand gleanings from Margaret's letters; yet, he disliked and distrusted the orphaned girl to the point where he feared for the health and safety of his children with her in the house. Exacerbating the situation was Margaret's disapproval of the relationship that the teenage girl developed with overseer Thomas Gott. Push literally came to shove during an incident in which Margaret disciplined her for what she believed was rough handling of one of the children. Thorne alleged that during the ensuing dispute over the situation, Margaret had used threats and physical violence against her. After she eloped with Gott a month later, the couple filed assault and battery charges against Margaret. When a grand jury investigation resulted in a deadlock, the matter was referred to the local Baptist church that Margaret helped found, and she was acquitted of the charges. Houston came to believe that the filing of legal charges against his wife had been encouraged by his political enemies.

Daughter Mary William (Mary Willie) Houston was born on April 9, 1850, in the Woodland house, during another Congressional session when Houston was in the nation's capital. Their fourth child Antoinette (Nettie) Power Houston arrived on January 20, 1852, while he was again away on a business trip.

Many friends and acquaintances came to visit the Houstons at Woodland, including members of the <a href="Alabama-Coushatta%20Tribe%20of%20Texas">Alabama-Coushatta Tribe</a> who had allied with Houston during the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>; he in return had assisted them in their being granted a <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservation</a> in east Texas. Throughout the last years of his presidency, Houston had made numerous efforts for the Republic to find common ground with the various tribes, asserting their right to own land. Many tribes had come to respect him as their friend.

Nancy moved southwest of Huntsville to <a href="Independence%2C%20Texas">Independence</a> in 1852, and much of the remaining Lea family began to form its nucleus in the Washington County community. Antoinette and Charles Power were also living in Independence after their Galveston sugar plantation was decimated by a hurricane. Brothers Vernal and Henry both died that year. The following year, Varilla's husband Robertus Royston also died and she joined the rest of the family in Independence. That August, the Houstons bought a house near the original <a href="Baylor%20University">Baylor University</a> campus in Independence. While Houston was attending to business in Washington, their sixth child <a href="Andrew%20Jackson%20Houston">Andrew Jackson Houston</a> was born on June 21, 1854.
As required by Mexican federal law for property ownership in <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>, Houston had been <a href="baptism">baptized</a> into the Catholic faith in the <a href="Adolphus%20Sterne%20House">Adolphus Sterne House</a> in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence. By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he felt compelled to make a public profession of faith, perhaps on the floor of the United States Senate, Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he decided to make the profession among those who knew him best in Texas.

Word quickly spread about Houston's upcoming public baptism, and spectators traveled from neighboring communities to witness the event. Reverend <a href="Rufus%20Columbus%20Burleson">Rufus Columbus Burleson</a>, the president of <a href="Baylor%20University">Baylor University</a> and local church pastor, performed the rite in Little Rocky Creek, southeast of town. Houston afterwards still felt unworthy of taking the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a> and becoming a member of Margaret's church. At her request, Reverend <a href="George%20Washington%20Baines">George Washington Baines</a> of Brenham counseled with him to eliminate his self-doubts. In gratitude and celebration, Nancy sold her silverware to purchase a bell for the Rocky Creek Baptist Church.

The state legislature decided during Houston's third senatorial term not to re-elect him, so he ran for the office of <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Texas">Governor of Texas</a>, <a href="Texas%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201857">losing</a> to <a href="Hardin%20Richard%20Runnels">Hardin Richard Runnels</a>. He was still in Washington when William (Willie) Rogers Houston was born on May 25, 1858, their last child born in the Woodland home. In order to satisfy creditors of his gubernatorial campaign debts, Houston was forced to sell the house to his political supporter J. Carroll Smith. He subsequently <a href="Texas%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201859">defeated</a> incumbent Runnels with a second bid for the office during a period when the populace was bitterly divided over the issue of secession from the United States, and was sworn in December 31, 1859.

Construction on the <a href="Texas%20Governor%27s%20Mansion">Texas Governor's Mansion</a> in Austin had been completed three years earlier and first occupied by Governor <a href="Elisha%20M.%20Pease">Elisha M. Pease</a>, whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped by for a visit. The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate. The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua, since the state government had no budget for staffing, furnishing or maintaining the governor's residence. That financial burden fell on the shoulders of the incumbent, and the state partially defaulted on Houston's salary. Margaret feared for the family's safety, as her husband worked towards defeating passage of the state's <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">Ordinance of Secession</a>. There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston, and she saw throngs of angry malcontents gathering in the city. Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but those with an invitation from the Houstons.

The family and household slaves resided on the second floor of the mansion, while others lived in the stable. As with everywhere else had they lived, she cared nothing about public life, and instead worked with Eliza and the other servants to create a home that welcomed extended family members and personal friends of the Houstons. Houston would occasionally hire out some of his labor force. The first child born in the Texas governor's mansion was also the last of the Houston children; <a href="Temple%20Lea%20Houston">Temple Lea Houston</a> was delivered on August 12, 1860. This last birth left the 41-year-old Margaret debilitated for almost two weeks, with a watchful Houston constantly by her side.

The Texas Secession Convention passed the Texas Ordinance of Secession on February 1, 1861, effectively becoming part of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a> on March 1. Houston, like all other office holders in the state, was expected to take an oath of loyalty to the Confederacy. He refused and was removed from office by the Secession Convention on March 16, succeeded by Lieutenant Governor <a href="Edward%20Clark%20%28governor%29">Edward Clark</a>.

Their home in Independence having been leased out to the Baptists, retreating there was not an option. Houston was in poor health, as well as spiritually and financially broken. After a brief sojourn in Nancy's home, and over her objections, the family returned to Ben Lomond in early April.

Sometime during August 1861, Sam Houston, Jr., enlisted in the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate States Army</a> <a href="2nd%20Texas%20Infantry%20Regiment">2nd Texas Infantry Regiment</a>, Company C Bayland Guards, sending Margaret into <a href="melancholia">melancholia</a>. She dreaded that her first-born child would never be home again. "My heart seems almost broken ... what shall I do? How shall I bear it? When I first heard the news, I thought I would lie down and die," she wrote to her mother. Houston tried to help out by assuming care of their other children in between his extended visits to Galveston. Her fears seemed well-founded when her son was critically wounded and left for dead at the April 1862 <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>. A second bullet was stopped by his Bible, bearing an inside inscription from Margaret. He was found languishing in a field by a <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> clergyman who picked up the Bible and also found a letter from Margaret in his pocket. Taken prisoner and sent to <a href="Camp%20Douglas%20%28Chicago%29">Camp Douglas</a> in Illinois, he was later released in a prisoner exchange and received a medical discharge in October.
Lacking the financial means to buy back their Woodland home, they rented the <a href="Steamboat%20House%20%28Huntsville%2C%20Texas%29">Steamboat House</a> in Huntsville. The 69-year-old Houston was in his final days and physically feeble, requiring the use of a cane to get around. Until daughter Maggie took over as his personal assistant, his wife shouldered the duties. Even so, during this period, he managed to get the Confederate War Department to discharge all draftees from the Alabama-Coushatta tribe, which had distanced itself completely from the conflict.

On July 26, 1863, with Margaret at his bedside reading the <a href="Psalm%2023">23rd Psalm</a> to him, Houston died. His will named her as his executrix, and named his cousin <a href="Thomas%20Caruthers">Thomas Caruthers</a>, as well as family friends Thomas Gibbs, J. Carroll Smith and <a href="Anthony%20Martin%20Branch">Anthony Martin Branch</a>, as executors. He had died land rich, but cash poor. The inventory compiled of his estate after his death listed several thousand acres in real estate, $250 cash, slaves (one of which was <a href="Joshua%20Houston">Joshua Houston</a>), a handful of livestock and his personal possessions.

Margaret was now a widow with seven of her eight children under the age of 18 and financially dependent on her. She returned to live near her mother in Independence, Texas swapping land for a nearby property that became known as the <a href="Mrs.%20Sam%20Houston%20House">Mrs. Sam Houston House</a>. The Texas legislature eventually gave Margaret an amount equivalent to her husband's unpaid gubernatorial salary; nevertheless, in order to afford Sam Jr.'s enrollment at medical school at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a>, she rented out the Ben Lomond plantation.

Nancy Lea died of an undiagnosed set of flu-like ailments on February 7, 1864, and was entombed on the grounds of her home. Margaret died on December 3, 1867, having contracted <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> during an epidemic. <a href="Walter%20Reed">Walter Reed</a> would not make his discovery of the cause of yellow fever through mosquito bite until 1900; contamination through contact was the pervading fear in 1867, and prevented Margaret's remains from being interred in a public cemetery with her husband's. She was buried in the ground beside Nancy's tomb at 11 p.m. by her servant Bingley, family friend Major Eber Cave, and her two daughters Nettie and Mary Willie. No funeral service was performed.

Two years after Sam Houston's death, Baylor University president <a href="William%20Carey%20Crane">William Carey Crane</a> was commissioned by Margaret to write her husband's biography, allowing complete access to all correspondence and records. Crane was a Lea family friend from Alabama who had little more than a passing acquaintance with "the hero of San Jacinto". His perception of Margaret, however, was that of an extraordinary woman, in many aspects equal to the man she married. He stated that Houston's "guardian angel", as he called her, had set out from the time she met Houston to refine his rough edges and provide a solid foundation for his personal life. That assessment of Margaret's relationship with her husband was echoed over a century later by author <a href="James%20L.%20Haley">James L. Haley</a>, "... Houston trusted the care of his soul to Margaret, that he had no more war to fight within himself, left him with more energy to wage political battle." Ultimately, several of Houston's associates were cooperative with the Crane endeavor, but not everyone was inspired to join the effort. According to daughter Maggie, the author had told her that many valuable documents were destroyed by Margaret in a fit of anger when someone she considered a friend expressed disinterest. "Life and Select Literary Remains of Sam Houston of Texas" was rejected by the initial publisher, but was eventually published by <a href="J.%20B.%20Lippincott%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">J. B. Lippincott</a> in 1884.

After emancipation and Margaret's death, "Aunt Eliza", as the children called her, alternated her time between Nannie's and Maggie's households. When Eliza died in 1898, at her request, she was buried next to Margaret. Nancy's tomb fell to decay over the years, after which she was re-interred in the ground with Margaret and Eliza. There was much discussion during the Texas 1936 centennial about moving Margaret's remains next to her husband's in Huntsville, but the family and various authorities never came to an agreement over it. Not until May 15, 1965, was an historical marker erected in Independence to denote her contributions to Texas history.

Fossa (animal)

The fossa ( or ; ; "Cryptoprocta ferox") is a <a href="cat">cat</a>-like, carnivorous <a href="mammal">mammal</a> <a href="endemic">endemic</a> to <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. It is a member of the <a href="Eupleridae">Eupleridae</a>, a <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> of <a href="carnivora">carnivora</a>ns closely related to the <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a> family (Herpestidae). Its <a href="biological%20classification">classification</a> has been controversial because its physical traits resemble those of <a href="Felidae">cats</a>, yet other traits suggest a close relationship with <a href="Viverridae">viverrids</a> (most <a href="civet">civet</a>s and their relatives). Its classification, along with that of the other Malagasy carnivores, influenced hypotheses about how many times mammalian carnivores have colonized Madagascar. With genetic studies demonstrating that the fossa and all other Malagasy carnivores are most closely related to each other (forming a <a href="Cladistics">clade</a>, recognized as the family Eupleridae), carnivorans are now thought to have colonized the island once, around 18 to 20 million years ago.

The fossa is the largest mammalian <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a> on the island of Madagascar and has been compared to a small <a href="cougar">cougar</a>. Adults have a head-body length of and weigh between , with the males larger than the females. It has semi-retractable claws (meaning it can extend but not retract its claws fully) and flexible ankles that allow it to climb up and down trees head-first, and also support jumping from tree to tree. The fossa is unique within its family for <a href="%23External%20genitalia">the shape of its genitalia</a>, which share traits with <a href="Cat%20anatomy%23Genitalia">those of cats</a> and <a href="hyena">hyena</a>s.

The species is widespread, although <a href="population%20density">population densities</a> are usually low. It is found solely in forested habitat, and actively hunts both by day and night. Over 50% of its diet consists of <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s, the endemic <a href="primate">primate</a>s found on the island; <a href="tenrec">tenrec</a>s, <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, lizards, birds, and other animals are also documented as prey. Mating usually occurs in trees on horizontal limbs and can last for several hours. Litters range from one to six pups, which are born blind and toothless (<a href="altricial">altricial</a>). Infants wean after 4.5 months and are independent after a year. <a href="Sexual%20maturity">Sexual maturity</a> occurs around three to four years of age, and life expectancy in captivity is 20 years. The fossa is listed as a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. It is generally feared by the Malagasy people and is often protected by their "<a href="Fady%20%28taboo%29">fady</a>" (taboo). The greatest threat to the species is <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>.

The <a href="name%20of%20a%20biological%20genus">generic name</a> "Cryptoprocta" refers to how the animal's <a href="anus">anus</a> is hidden by its anal pouch, from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> words "crypto-" "hidden", and "procta" "anus". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">species name</a> "ferox" is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> adjective "fierce" or "wild". Its common name is spelled fossa in English or "fosa" in <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a>, the <a href="Austronesian%20languages">Austronesian language</a> from which it was taken, but some authors have adopted the Malagasy spelling in English. The word is similar to "posa" (meaning "cat") in the <a href="Iban%20language">Iban language</a> (another Austronesian language) from <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>, and both terms may derive from <a href="trade%20language">trade language</a>s from the 1600s. However, an alternative <a href="etymology">etymology</a> suggests a link to another word that comes from <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a>: "pusa" refers to the <a href="Malayan%20weasel">Malayan weasel</a> ("Mustela nudipes"). The Malay word "pusa" could have become "posa" for cats in Borneo, while in Madagascar the word could have become "fosa" to refer to the fossa.

The fossa was formally described by <a href="Edward%20Turner%20Bennett">Edward Turner Bennett</a> on the basis of a specimen from Madagascar sent by <a href="Charles%20Telfair">Charles Telfair</a> in 1833. The common name is the same as the generic name of the <a href="Malagasy%20civet">Malagasy civet</a> ("Fossa fossana"), but they are different species. Because of shared physical traits with <a href="civet">civet</a>s, <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>s, and cats (<a href="Felidae">Felidae</a>), its <a href="biological%20classification">classification</a> has been controversial. Bennett originally placed the fossa as a type of civet in the family <a href="Viverridae">Viverridae</a>, a classification that long remained popular among taxonomists. Its compact <a href="braincase">braincase</a>, large <a href="Orbit%20%28anatomy%29">eye sockets</a>, retractable claws, and specialized carnivorous <a href="dentition">dentition</a> have also led some taxonomists to associate it with the felids. In 1939, <a href="William%20King%20Gregory">William King Gregory</a> and Milo Hellman placed the fossa in its own subfamily within Felidae, the Cryptoproctinae. <a href="George%20Gaylord%20Simpson">George Gaylord Simpson</a> placed it back in Viverridae in 1945, still within its own subfamily, yet conceded it had many cat-like characteristics.
In 1993, Géraldine Veron and François Catzeflis published a <a href="DNA%20hybridization">DNA hybridization</a> study suggesting that the fossa was more closely related to mongooses (family <a href="Herpestidae">Herpestidae</a>) than to cats or civets. However, in 1995, Veron's <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> study once again grouped it with Felidae. In 2003, <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">molecular phylogenetic</a> studies using <a href="Nuclear%20DNA">nuclear</a> and <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial genes</a> by <a href="Anne%20Yoder">Anne Yoder</a> and colleagues showed that all native Malagasy carnivorans share a common ancestry that excludes other carnivores (meaning they form a <a href="Cladistics">clade</a>, making them <a href="Monophyly">monophyletic</a>) and are most closely related to Asian and African Herpestidae. To reflect these relationships, all Malagasy carnivorans are now placed in a single family, <a href="Eupleridae">Eupleridae</a>. Within Eupleridae, the fossa is placed in the subfamily <a href="Euplerinae">Euplerinae</a> along with the <a href="falanouc">falanouc</a> ("Eupleres goudoti") and Malagasy civet, but its exact relationships are poorly resolved.

An extinct relative of the fossa was described in 1902 from <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains and recognized as a separate species, "<a href="Cryptoprocta%20spelea">Cryptoprocta spelea</a>", in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large "fosa mainty" ("black fossa") and the smaller "fosa mena" ("reddish fossa")—and a white form has been reported in the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of <a href="melanism">melanism</a> and <a href="leucism">leucism</a>—or whether there is indeed more than one species of living fossa.
The fossa appears as a diminutive form of a large felid, such as a cougar, but with a slender body and muscular limbs, and a tail nearly as long as the rest of the body. It has a <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>-like head, relatively longer than that of a cat, although with a muzzle that is broad and short, and with large but rounded ears. It has medium brown eyes set relatively wide apart with pupils that contract to slits. Like many carnivorans that hunt at night, its <a href="Tapetum%20lucidum">eyes reflect light</a>; the reflected light is orange in hue. 
Its head-body length is and its tail is long. There is some <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, with adult males (weighing ) being larger than females (). Smaller individuals are typically found north and east on Madagascar, while larger ones to the south and west. Unusually large individuals weighing up to have been reported, but there is some doubt as to the reliability of the measurements. The fossa can smell, hear, and see well. It is a robust animal and illnesses are rare in captive fossas.
Both males and females have short, straight fur that is relatively dense and without spots or patterns. Both sexes are generally a reddish-brown dorsally and colored a dirty cream ventrally. When in <a href="Rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rut</a>, they may have an orange coloration to their <a href="abdomen">abdomen</a> from a reddish substance secreted by a chest <a href="gland">gland</a>, but this has not been consistently observed by all researchers. The tail tends to be lighter in coloration than the sides. Juveniles are either gray or nearly white.

Several of the animal's physical features are adaptions to climbing through trees. It uses its tail to assist balance and has semi-retractable claws that it uses to climb trees in its search for prey. It has <a href="plantigrade">semiplantigrade</a> feet, switching between a plantigrade-like gait (when <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a>) and a <a href="digitigrade">digitigrade</a>-like one (when <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a>). The soles of its paws are nearly bare and covered with strong pads. The fossa has very flexible ankles that allow it to readily grasp tree trunks so as to climb up or down trees head first or to leap to another tree. Captive juveniles have been known to swing upside down by their hindfeet from knotted ropes.

The fossa has several <a href="scent%20gland">scent gland</a>s, although the glands are less developed in females. Like herpestids it has a <a href="perianal">perianal</a> skin gland inside an <a href="anal%20sac">anal sac</a> which surrounds the anus like a pocket. The pocket opens to the exterior with a horizontal slit below the tail. Other glands are located near the penis or vagina, with the <a href="penile%20glands">penile glands</a> emitting a strong odor. Like the herpestids, it has no <a href="prescrotal">prescrotal</a> glands.

One of the more peculiar physical features of this species is its external genitalia. The male fossa has an unusually long penis and <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone), reaching to between his forelegs when erect, with an average thickness of . The <a href="glans">glans</a> extends about halfway down the <a href="Corpus%20cavernosum%20penis">shaft</a> and <a href="penile%20spines">is spiny</a> except at the tip. In comparison, the <a href="Penis%23Felidae">glans of felids</a> is short and spiny, while that of viverrids is smooth and long. The female fossa exhibits transient <a href="masculinization">masculinization</a>, starting at about 1–2 years of age, developing an enlarged, spiny <a href="clitoris">clitoris</a> that resembles a male's penis. The enlarged clitoris is supported by an <a href="os%20clitoris">os clitoris</a>, which decreases in size as the animal grows. The females do not have a pseudo-scrotum, but they do secrete an orange substance that colors their underparts, much like the secretions of males. Hormone levels (<a href="testosterone">testosterone</a>, <a href="androstenedione">androstenedione</a>, <a href="dihydrotestosterone">dihydrotestosterone</a>) do not seem to play a part in this transient masculinization, as those levels are the same in masculinized juveniles and non-masculinized adults. It is speculated that the transient masculinization either reduces sexual harassment of juvenile females by adult males, or reduces aggression from <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> females. While females of other mammal species (such as the <a href="spotted%20hyena">spotted hyena</a>) have a <a href="pseudo-penis">pseudo-penis</a>, no other is known to diminish in size as the animal grows.

Overall, the fossa has features in common with three different carnivoran families, leading researchers to place it and other members of Eupleridae alternatively in Herpestidae, Viverridae, and Felidae. Felid features are primarily those associated with eating and <a href="digestion">digestion</a>, including tooth shape and <a href="facial">facial</a> portions of the skull, the tongue, and the <a href="digestive%20tract">digestive tract</a>, typical of its exclusively carnivorous diet. The remainder of the skull most closely resembles skulls of genus "<a href="Viverra">Viverra</a>", while the general body structure is most similar to that of various members of Herpestidae. The permanent dentition is (three <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, one <a href="canine%20tooth">canine</a>, three or four <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s, and one <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> on each side of both the upper and lower jaws), with the <a href="deciduous%20teeth">deciduous</a> formula being similar but lacking the fourth premolar and the molar. The fossa has a large, prominent <a href="rhinarium">rhinarium</a> similar to that of viverrids, but has comparatively larger, round ears, almost as large as those of a similarly sized felid. Its facial <a href="vibrissae">vibrissae</a> (whiskers) are long, with the longest being longer than its head. Like some mongoose genera, particularly "<a href="Galidia">Galidia</a>" (which is now in the fossa's own family, Eupleridae) and "<a href="Herpestes">Herpestes</a>" (of Herpestidae), it has <a href="carpal">carpal</a> vibrissae as well. Its claws are retractile, but unlike those of Felidae species, they are not hidden in skin sheaths. It has three pairs of nipples (one inguinal, one ventral, and one pectoral).

The fossa has the most widespread geographical range of the Malagasy carnivores, and is generally found in low numbers throughout the island in remaining tracts of forest, preferring pristine undisturbed forest habitat. It is also encountered in some degraded forests, but in lower numbers. Although the fossa is found in all known forest habitats throughout Madagascar, including the western, dry <a href="deciduous%20forest">deciduous forest</a>s, the eastern <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s, and the southern <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20thickets">spiny forests</a>, it is seen more frequently in humid than in dry forests. This may be because the reduced <a href="canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> in dry forests provides less shade, and also because the fossa seems to travel more easily in humid forests. It is absent from areas with the heaviest habitat disturbance and, like most of Madagascar's fauna, from the central high plateau of the country.

The fossa has been found across several different elevational gradients in undisturbed portions of protected areas throughout Madagascar. In the Réserve Naturelle Intégrale d'Andringitra, evidence of the fossa has been reported at four different sites ranging from . Its highest known occurrence was reported at ; its presence high on the <a href="Andringitra%20Massif">Andringitra Massif</a> was subsequently confirmed in 1996. Similarly, evidence has been reported of the fossa at the elevational extremes of and in the <a href="Andohahela%20National%20Park">Andohahela National Park</a>. The presence of the fossa at these locations indicates its ability to adapt to various elevations, consistent with its reported distribution in all Madagascar forest types.

The fossa is active during both the day and the night and is considered <a href="cathemeral">cathemeral</a>; activity peaks may occur early in the morning, late in the afternoon, and late in the night. The animal generally does not reuse sleeping sites, but females with young do return to the same den. The home ranges of male fossas in <a href="Kirindy%20Forest">Kirindy Forest</a> are up to large, compared to for females. These ranges overlap—by about 30 percent according to data from the eastern forests—but females usually have separated ranges. Home ranges grow during the dry season, perhaps because less food and water is available. In general, <a href="tracking%20collar">radio-collared</a> fossas travel between per day, although in one reported case a fossa was observed moving a straight-line distance of in 16 hours. The animal's population density appears to be low: in <a href="Madagascar%20dry%20deciduous%20forests%23Kirindy%20Forest">Kirindy Forest</a>, where it is thought to be common, its density has been estimated at one animal per in 1998. Another study in the same forest between 1994 and 1996 using the <a href="mark%20and%20recapture">mark and recapture</a> method indicated a population density of one animal per and one adult per .

Except for mothers with young and occasional observations of pairs of males, animals are usually found alone, so that the species is considered solitary. A 2009 publication, however, reported a detailed observation of cooperative hunting, wherein three male fossas hunted a sifaka ("<a href="Propithecus%20verreauxi">Propithecus verreauxi</a>") for 45 minutes, and subsequently shared the prey. This behavior may be a vestige of cooperative hunting that would have been required to take down larger <a href="subfossil%20lemur">recently extinct lemurs</a>.

Fossas communicate using sounds, scents, and visual signals. Vocalizations include purring, a threatening call, and a call of fear, consisting of "repeated loud, coarse inhalations and gasps of breath". A long, high yelp may function to attract other fossas. Females mew during mating and males produce a sigh when they have found a female. Throughout the year, animals produce long-lasting <a href="scent%20mark">scent mark</a>s on rocks, trees, and the ground using glands in the anal region and on the chest. They also communicate using face and body expression, but the significance of these signals is uncertain. The animal is aggressive only during mating, and males in particular fight boldly. After a short fight, the loser flees and is followed by the winner for a short distance. In captivity, fossas are usually not aggressive and sometimes even allow themselves to be stroked by a zookeeper, but adult males in particular may try to bite.

The fossa is a <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a> that hunts small to medium-sized animals. One of eight carnivorous species endemic to Madagascar, the fossa is the island's largest surviving endemic terrestrial mammal and the only predator capable of preying upon adults of all extant <a href="List%20of%20lemur%20species">lemur species</a>, the largest of which can weigh as much as 90 percent of the weight of the average fossa. Although it is the predominant predator of lemurs, reports of its dietary habits demonstrate a wide variety of prey selectivity and specialization depending on habitat and season; diet does not vary by sex. While the fossa is thought to be a lemur specialist in <a href="Ranomafana%20National%20Park">Ranomafana National Park</a>, its diet is more variable in other rain forest habitats.

The diet of the fossa in the wild has been studied by analyzing their distinctive <a href="feces">scats</a>, which resemble gray cylinders with twisted ends and measure long by thick. Scat collected and analyzed from both Andohahela and Andringitra contained lemur matter and rodents. Eastern populations in Andringitra incorporate the widest recorded variety of prey, including both vertebrates and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s. Vertebrates consumed ranged from reptiles to a wide variety of birds, including both <a href="understory">understory</a> and ground birds, and mammals, including <a href="insectivore">insectivore</a>s, <a href="rodent">rodent</a>s, and lemurs. Invertebrates eaten by the fossa in the high mountain zone of Andringitra include insects and crabs. One study found that vertebrates comprised 94% of the diet of fossas, with lemurs comprising over 50%, followed by <a href="tenrec">tenrec</a>s (9%), lizards (9%), and birds (2%). Seeds, which comprised 5% of the diet, may have been in the stomachs of the lemurs eaten, or may have been consumed with fruit taken for water, as seeds were more common in the stomach in the dry season. The average prey size varies geographically; it is only in the high mountains of Andringitra, in contrast to in humid forests and over in dry deciduous forests. In a study of fossa diet in the dry deciduous forest of western Madagascar, more than 90% of prey items were vertebrates, and more than 50% were lemurs. The primary diet consisted of approximately six lemur species and two or three spiny tenrec species, along with snakes and small mammals. Generally, the fossa preys upon larger lemurs and rodents in preference to smaller ones.

Prey is obtained by hunting either on the ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing them down to the ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest <a href="sifaka">sifaka</a>s suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.

This wide variety of prey items taken in various rainforest habitats is similar to the varied dietary composition noted occurring in the dry forests of western Madagascar, as well. As the largest endemic predator on Madagascar, this dietary flexibility combined with a flexible activity pattern has allowed it to exploit a wide variety of niches available throughout the island, making it a potential <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a> for the Madagascar ecosystems.

Fossas have a <a href="polyandrous">polyandrous</a> mating system. Most of the details of reproduction in wild populations are from the western dry deciduous forests; determining whether or not certain of these details are applicable to eastern populations will require further field research. Mating typically occurs during September and October, although there are reports of its occurring as late as December, and can be highly conspicuous. In captivity in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, fossas instead mate in the northern spring, from March to July. <a href="Sexual%20intercourse">Intromission</a> usually occurs in trees on horizontal limbs about off the ground. Frequently the same tree is used year after year, with remarkable precision as to the date the season commences. Trees are often near a water source, and have limbs strong enough and wide enough to support the mating pair, about wide. Some mating has been reported on the ground as well.

As many as eight males will be at a mating site, staying in close vicinity to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete for the attention of the female with a significant amount of <a href="animal%20communication">vocalization</a> and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate does not seem to have any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places his paws on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a <a href="copulatory%20tie">copulatory tie</a>, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.

The birthing of the litter of one to six (typically two to four) takes place in a concealed location, such as an underground den, a termite mound, a rock crevice, or in the hollow of a large tree (particularly those of the genus "<a href="Commiphora">Commiphora</a>"). Contrary to older research, litters are of mixed sexes. Young are born in December or January, making the <a href="gestation%20period">gestation period</a> 90 days, with the late mating reports indicating a gestational period of about six to seven weeks. The newborns are blind and toothless and weigh no more than . The fur is thin and has been described as gray-brown or nearly white. After about two weeks the cubs' eyes open, they become more active, and their fur darkens to a pearl gray. The cubs do not take solid food until three months old, and do not leave the den until they are 4.5 months old; they are weaned shortly after that. After the first year, the juveniles are independent of their mother. Permanent teeth appear at 18 to 20 months. Physical maturity is reached by about two years of age, but <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> is not attained for another year or two, and the young may stay with their mother until they are fully mature. Lifespan in captivity is up to or past 20 years of age, possibly due to the slow juvenile development.

The fossa has been assessed as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">Vulnerable</a>" by the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> since 2008, as its population size has probably declined by at least 30 percent between 1987 and 2008; previous assessments have included "<a href="Endangered%20species">Endangered</a>" (2000) and "Insufficiently Known" (1988, 1990, 1994). The species is dependent on forest and thus threatened by the widespread destruction of Madagascar's native forest but is also able to persist in disturbed areas. A suite of <a href="Microsatellite%20%28genetics%29">microsatellite</a> markers (short segments of DNA that have a repeated <a href="DNA%20sequence">sequence</a>) have been developed to help aid in studies of genetic health and <a href="population%20dynamics">population dynamics</a> of both captive and wild fossas. Several <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>s have been isolated from the fossa, some of which, such as <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> and <a href="canine%20distemper">canine distemper</a>, are thought to have been transmitted by feral dogs or cats. "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>" was reported in a captive fossa in 2013.

Although the species is widely distributed, it is locally rare in all regions, making fossas particularly vulnerable to extinction. The effects of <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">habitat fragmentation</a> increase the risk. For its size, the fossa has a lower than predicted population density, which is further threatened by Madagascar's rapidly disappearing forests and dwindling lemur populations, which make up a high proportion of its diet. The loss of the fossa, either locally or completely, could significantly impact ecosystem dynamics, possibly leading to over-grazing by some of its prey species. The total population of the fossa living within protected areas is estimated at less than 2,500 adults, but this may be an overestimate. Only two protected areas are thought to contain 500 or more adult fossas: <a href="Masoala%20National%20Park">Masoala National Park</a> and <a href="Midongy%20du%20sud%20National%20Park">Midongy-Sud National Park</a>, although these are also thought to be overestimated. Too little population information has been collected for a formal <a href="population%20viability%20analysis">population viability analysis</a>, but estimates suggest that none of the protected areas support a <a href="Small%20population%20size">viable population</a>. If this is correct, the extinction of the fossa may take as much as 100 years to occur as the species gradually declines. In order for the species to survive, it is estimated that at least is needed to maintain smaller, short-term viable populations, and at least for populations of 500 adults.

<a href="Taboo">Taboo</a>, known in Madagascar as "fady", offers protection for the fossa and other carnivores. In the Marolambo District (part of the <a href="Atsinanana">Atsinanana</a> region in <a href="Toamasina%20Province">Toamasina Province</a>), the fossa has traditionally been hated and feared as a dangerous animal. It has been described as "greedy and aggressive", known for taking fowl and piglets, and believed to "take little children who walk alone into the forest". Some do not eat it for fear that it will transfer its undesirable qualities to anyone who consumes it. However, the animal is also taken for <a href="bushmeat">bushmeat</a>; a study published in 2009 reported that 57 percent of villages (8 of 14 sampled) in the Makira forest consume fossa meat. The animals were typically hunted using slingshots, with dogs, or most commonly, by placing <a href="snare%20trap">snare trap</a>s on animal paths. Near <a href="Ranomafana%20National%20Park">Ranomafana National Park</a>, the fossa, along with several of its smaller cousins and the introduced <a href="small%20Indian%20civet">small Indian civet</a> ("Viverricula indica"), are known to "scavenge on the bodies of ancestors", which are buried in shallow graves in the forest. For this reason, eating these animals is strictly prohibited by "fady". However, if they wander into villages in search of domestic fowl, they may be killed or trapped. Small carnivore traps have been observed near chicken runs in the village of Vohiparara.

Fossas are occasionally held in captivity in <a href="zoo">zoo</a>s. They first bred in captivity in 1974 in the zoo of <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a>, France. The next year, at a time when there were only eight fossas in the world's zoos, the <a href="Duisburg%20Zoo">Duisburg Zoo</a> in Germany acquired one; this zoo later started a successful breeding program, and most zoo fossas now descend from the Duisburg population. Research on the Duisburg fossas has provided much data about their biology.

The fossa was depicted as an antagonist in the DreamWorks 2005 animated film <a href="Madagascar%20%282005%20film%29">"Madagascar"</a>, accurately shown as the lemurs' most feared predator.

Voluntary Human Extinction Movement

The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an <a href="environmental%20movement">environmental movement</a> that calls for all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary <a href="Human%20extinction">extinction of humankind</a>. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it would prevent <a href="environmental%20degradation">environmental degradation</a>. The group states that a decrease in the human population would prevent a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of <a href="resources">resources</a> required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by <a href="human%20overpopulation">human overpopulation</a>.

VHEMT was founded in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became involved in the <a href="Environmental%20movement%20in%20the%20United%20States">environmental movement</a> in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's <a href="biosphere">biosphere</a> and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop <a href="Sustainable%20living">sustainable lifestyles</a> or can <a href="Human%20population%20planning">reduce their population</a> to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever the merits of the idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.

The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement was founded by Les U. Knight, a high school substitute teacher living in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. After becoming involved in the environmental movement as a college student in the 1970s, Knight attributed most of the dangers faced by the planet to human overpopulation. He joined the <a href="Zero%20Population%20Growth">Zero Population Growth</a> organization, and chose to be <a href="vasectomy">vasectomised</a> at age 25. He later concluded that the extinction of humanity would be the best solution to the Earth's environmental problems. He believes that this idea has also been held by some people throughout human history.

In 1991, Knight began publishing VHEMT's newsletter, known as "These Exit Times". In the newsletter, he asked readers to further human extinction by not procreating. VHEMT has also published cartoons, including a comic strip titled "Bonobo Baby", featuring a woman who forgoes childbearing in favor of adopting a <a href="bonobo">bonobo</a>. In 1996, Knight created a website for VHEMT; it was available in 11 languages by 2010. VHEMT's logo features the letter "V" (for voluntary) and a picture of the Earth with north at the bottom.

VHEMT functions as a loose network rather than a formal organization, and does not compile a list of members. Daniel Metz of <a href="Willamette%20University">Willamette University</a> stated in 1995 that VHEMT's mailing list had just under 400 subscribers. Six years later, <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a> said the list had only 230 subscribers. Knight says that anyone who agrees with his ideology is a member of the movement; and that this includes "millions of people".

Knight serves as the spokesman for VHEMT. He attends environmental conferences and events, where he publicizes information about population growth. VHEMT's message has, however, primarily been spread through coverage by media outlets, rather than events and its newsletter. VHEMT sells buttons and T-shirts, as well as <a href="bumper%20sticker">bumper sticker</a>s that read "Thank you for not breeding".

Knight argues that the <a href="human%20population">human population</a> is far greater than the Earth can handle, and that the best thing for Earth's biosphere is for humans to voluntarily cease reproducing. He says that humans are "incompatible with the biosphere" and that human existence is causing environmental damage which will eventually bring about the extinction of humans (as well as other organisms). According to Knight, the vast majority of human societies have not lived <a href="Sustainable%20living">sustainable lifestyles</a>, and attempts to live environmentally friendly lifestyles do not change the fact that human existence has ultimately been destructive to the Earth and many of its non-human organisms. Voluntary human extinction is promoted on the grounds that it will prevent human suffering and the <a href="Extinction%23Modern%20extinctions">extinction of other species</a>; Knight points out that many species are threatened by the increasing human population.

James Ormrod, a psychologist who profiled the group in the journal "Psychoanalysis, Culture & Society", notes that the "most fundamental belief" of VHEMT is that "human beings should stop reproducing", and that some people consider themselves members of the group but do not actually support human extinction. Knight, however, believes that even if humans become more environmentally friendly, they could still return to environmentally destructive lifestyles and hence should eliminate themselves. Residents of <a href="First%20World">First World</a> countries bear the most responsibility to change, according to Knight, as they consume the largest proportion of resources.

Knight believes that Earth's non-human organisms have a higher overall value than humans and their accomplishments, such as art: "The plays of Shakespeare and the work of Einstein can't hold a candle to a tiger". He argues that species higher in the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a> are less important than lower species. His ideology is drawn in part from <a href="deep%20ecology">deep ecology</a>, and he sometimes refers to the Earth as <a href="Gaianism">Gaia</a>. He notes that human extinction is unavoidable, and that it is better to become extinct soon to avoid causing the extinction of other animals. The potential for evolution of other organisms is also cited as a benefit.

Knight sees abstinence from reproduction as an <a href="Altruism">altruistic</a> choice – a way to prevent involuntary human suffering – and cites the deaths of children from preventable causes as an example of needless suffering. Knight claims that non-reproduction would eventually allow humans to lead idyllic lifestyles in an environment comparable to the <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Garden of Eden</a>, and maintains that the last remaining humans would be proud of their accomplishment. Other benefits of ceasing human reproduction that he cites include the end of abortion, war, and starvation. Knight argues that "procreation today is de facto child abuse". He maintains that the standard of human life will worsen if resources are consumed by a growing population rather than spent solving existing issues. He speculates that if people ceased to reproduce, they would use their energy for other pursuits, and suggests adoption and foster care as outlets for people who desire children.

VHEMT rejects government-mandated <a href="human%20population%20control">human population control</a> programs in favor of voluntary population reduction, supporting only the use of <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a> and willpower to prevent pregnancies. Knight states that coercive tactics are unlikely to permanently lower the human population, citing the fact that humanity has survived catastrophic wars, famines, and viruses. Though their newsletter's name recalls the suicide manual "<a href="Final%20Exit">Final Exit</a>", the idea of mass suicide is rejected, and they have adopted the slogan "May we live long and die out". A 1995 survey of VHEMT members found that a majority of them felt a strong moral obligation to protect the Earth, distrusted the ability of political processes to prevent harm to the environment, and were willing to surrender some of their rights for their cause. VHEMT members who strongly believed that "Civilization [is] headed for collapse" were most likely to embrace these views. However, VHEMT does not take any overt political stances.

VHEMT promotes a more extreme ideology than <a href="Population%20Action%20International">Population Action International</a>, a group that argues humanity should reduce—but not eliminate—its population to care for the Earth. However, the VHEMT platform is more moderate and serious than the <a href="Church%20of%20Euthanasia">Church of Euthanasia</a>, which advocates population reduction by suicide and cannibalism. The 1995 survey found that 36% considered themselves members of <a href="Earth%20First%21">Earth First!</a> or had donated to the group in the previous five years.

Knight states his group's ideology runs counter to contemporary society's <a href="natalism">natalism</a>. He believes this pressure has stopped many people from supporting, or even discussing, population control. He admits that his group is unlikely to succeed, but contends that attempting to reduce the Earth's population is the only moral option.

Reception of Knight's idea in the mainstream media has been mixed. Writing in the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>", Gregory Dicum states that there is an "undeniable logic" to VHEMT's arguments, but he doubts whether Knight's ideas can succeed, arguing that many people desire to have children and cannot be dissuaded. Stephen Jarvis echoes this skepticism in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", noting that VHEMT faces great difficulty owing to the basic human reproductive drive. At "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s website, Guy Dammann applauds the movement's aim as "in many ways laudable", but argues that it is absurd to believe that humans will voluntarily seek extinction. Freelance writer Abby O'Reilly writes that since having children is frequently viewed as a measure of success, VHEMT's goal is difficult to attain. Knight contends in response to these arguments that though <a href="sexual%20desire">sexual desire</a> is natural, human desire for children is a product of <a href="enculturation">enculturation</a>.

The <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20New%20York">Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York</a> has criticized Knight's platform, arguing that the existence of humanity is divinely ordained. Ormrod claims that Knight "arguably abandons <a href="deep%20ecology">deep ecology</a> in favour of straightforward <a href="misanthropy">misanthropy</a>". He notes that Knight's claim that the last humans in an extinction scenario would have an abundance of resources promotes his cause based on "benefits accruing to humans". Ormrod sees this type of argument as counter-intuitive, arguing that it borrows the language of "late-modern consumer societies". He faults Knight for what he sees as a failure to develop a consistent and unambiguous ideology. "<a href="The%20Economist">The Economist</a>" characterizes Knight's claim that voluntary human extinction is advisable due to limited resources as "Malthusian bosh". The paper further states that compassion for the planet does not necessarily require the pursuit of human extinction. Sociologist <a href="Frank%20Furedi">Frank Furedi</a> also deems VHEMT to be a <a href="Malthusian">Malthusian</a> group, classifying them as a type of environmental organization that "[thinks] the worst about the human species". Writing in "<a href="Spiked%20%28magazine%29">Spiked</a>", Josie Appleton argues that the group is indifferent to humanity, rather than "anti-human".

Brian Bethune writes in "<a href="Maclean%27s">Maclean's</a>" that Knight's logic is "as absurd as it's unassailable". However, he doubts Knight's claim that the last survivors of the human race would have pleasant lives and suspects that a "collective loss of the will to live" would prevail. In response to Knight's platform, journalist <a href="Sheldon%20Richman">Sheldon Richman</a> argues that humans are "active agents" and can change their behavior. He contends that people are capable of solving the problems facing Earth. <a href="Alan%20Weisman">Alan Weisman</a>, author of "<a href="The%20World%20Without%20Us">The World Without Us</a>", suggests a limit of one child per family as a preferable alternative to abstinence from reproduction.

<a href="Katharine%20Mieszkowski">Katharine Mieszkowski</a> of <a href="Salon.com">Salon.com</a> recommends that childless people adopt VHEMT's arguments when facing "probing questions" about their childlessness. Writing in the "Journal for Critical Animal Studies", Carmen Dell'Aversano notes that VHEMT seeks to renounce children as a symbol of perpetual human progress. She casts the movement as a form of "queer oppositional politics" because it rejects perpetual reproduction as a form of motivation. She argues that the movement seeks to come to a new definition of "civil order", as <a href="Lee%20Edelman">Lee Edelman</a> suggested that <a href="queer%20theory">queer theory</a> should. Dell'Aversano believes that VHEMT fulfills Edelman's mandate because they embody the <a href="death%20drive">death drive</a> rather than ideas that focus on the reproduction of the past.

Although Knight's organization has been featured in a book titled "<a href="Donna%20Kossy%23Kooks%20%281994%29">Kooks: A Guide to the Outer Limits of Human Belief</a>", "The Guardian" journalist <a href="Oliver%20Burkeman">Oliver Burkeman</a> notes that in a phone conversation Knight seems "rather sane and self-deprecating". Weisman echoes this sentiment, characterizing Knight as "thoughtful, soft-spoken, articulate, and quite serious". Philosophers <a href="Steven%20Best">Steven Best</a> and <a href="Douglas%20Kellner">Douglas Kellner</a> view VHEMT's stance as extreme, but they note that the movement formed in response to extreme stances found in "modern <a href="humanism">humanism</a>".

In 1973, D. Keith Mano published a science fiction novel entitled "The Bridge" in which mankind has decided that its presence is environmentally intolerable and that all human beings must die.

Emanuel Moravec

Emanuel Moravec (17 April 1893 – 5 May 1945) was a Czech army officer and writer who served as the collaborationist Minister of Education of the <a href="Protectorate%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia">Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia</a> between 1942 and 1945. He was also chair of the <a href="Board%20of%20Trustees%20for%20the%20Education%20of%20Youth">Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth</a>, a fascist youth organisation in the protectorate.

In World War I, Moravec served in the Austro-Hungarian Army, but following capture by the Russians he changed sides to join Russian-backed Serbian forces and then the Czechoslovak Legion, which went on to fight on the side of the White Russians in the Russian Civil War. During the interwar period he commanded an infantry battalion in the Czechoslovak Army. As a proponent of democracy during the 1930s, Moravec was outspoken in his warnings about the expansionist plans of Germany under <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and appealed for armed action rather than capitulation to German demands for the <a href="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a>. In the aftermath of the German occupation of the rump Czechoslovakia, he became an enthusiastic collaborator, realigning his political worldview towards <a href="fascism">fascism</a>. He committed suicide in the final days of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

Unlike some other officials of the short-lived protectorate government, whose reputations were rehabilitated in whole or in part after the war, Moravec's good reputation did not survive his tenure in office and he has been widely derided as a "Czech <a href="Quisling">Quisling</a>".

Emanual Moravec was born in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, the son of a modest <a href="merchant">merchant</a> family originally from <a href="Kutn%C3%A1%20Hora">Kutná Hora</a>. He graduated from a vocational school and found employment as a clerk at a Prague company. At the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, Moravec was <a href="conscription">conscripted</a> into the <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> and dispatched with his unit to the <a href="Carpathian%20Front">Carpathian Front</a>.

Moravec was captured by the <a href="Imperial%20Russian%20Army">Imperial Russian Army</a> in 1915 and held at a prisoner-of-war camp in <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a>. He was subsequently paroled and given command of a machine-gun platoon in the <a href="First%20Serbian%20Volunteer%20Division">First Serbian Volunteer Division</a>, a unit consisting of former prisoners of war, including Serbs and other <a href="Slavs">Slavs</a> from the countries of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, fighting on the Russian side. In September 1916, following fierce action against <a href="Bulgaria%20in%20World%20War%20I">Bulgarian forces</a> along the Dobrudzha Front, Moravec was hospitalized with <a href="shell%20shock">shell shock</a>. Upon his release, he joined the <a href="Czechoslovak%20Legion">Czechoslovak Legion</a>, falsely claiming to hold an engineering degree to receive an <a href="officer%20%28military%29">officer</a>'s commission.

The Czechoslovak Legion, a volunteer unit composed of diaspora Czechs and Slovaks as well as deserters from the Austro-Hungarian Army, had been formed in 1917 to support the Allies; it later became involved in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a>, fighting on the side of the <a href="White%20movement">White Russians</a>. Over the next two years, Moravec saw combat with the Legion in Russia.

Moravec returned to a newly independent <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> at the end of World War I with the legionary rank of <a href="captain">captain</a>. He was accepted into Prague's <a href="War%20College%20%28Prague%29">War School</a> and, upon graduation, commissioned as a <a href="major">major</a> in the <a href="Czechoslovak%20Army">Czechoslovak Army</a>. He ultimately came to command the 1st Field Battalion of the 21st Infantry <a href="Regiment">Regiment</a> in <a href="Znojmo">Znojmo</a>. Simultaneous with his military career, Moravec contributed to newspapers and magazines, including "<a href="Lidov%C3%A9%20noviny">Lidové noviny</a>", on political and military matters. Writing under the pen name Stanislav Yester, he won the <a href="Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Ba%C5%A5a">Baťa Prize for Journalism</a>.

In 1931 Moravec was appointed an instructor at the War School and promoted to <a href="colonel">colonel</a>. In his writings, Moravec had become increasingly emphatic about the growing ambitions of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. He called for Czechoslovakia to form an alliance with Poland and Italy against what he saw as a rising German threat. Moravec came to be seen as one of Czechoslovakia's leading geopolitical strategists and caught the attention of <a href="President%20of%20Czechoslovakia">President</a> <a href="Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Garrigue%20Masaryk">Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk</a>. Moravec wrote the preface to a printed edition of one of Masaryk's addresses to the Czechoslovak Army. In it, he signaled his support for the creation of the democratic state of Czechoslovakia that had come out of World War I, as well as his personal loyalty to Masaryk:

When Masaryk died in 1935, Moravec served as one of the pallbearers at his funeral. In 1938 Moravec warned that "if Czechoslovakia should fall, France would find herself politically on the European periphery". Moravec argued that the head of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> Basin was guarded by what he described as the "fortress of Bohemia"—the land barrier that marked the natural border between eastern and western Europe. If a state were to take Czechoslovakia it would, therefore, control the head of the Danube basin and be free to strike against either France or Poland with ease. Although Moravec was concerned with German political and military aims he generally rejected some of the more extreme aspects of anti-German thought, taking a cautiously receptive approach to <a href="Emanuel%20R%C3%A1dl">Emanuel Rádl</a>'s thesis which posited the existence of an irrational Czech <a href="racism">racism</a> towards Germans.

In 1938, German demands for the <a href="Sudetenland">Sudetenland</a> came to a head. In September, General <a href="Jan%20Syrov%C3%BD">Jan Syrový</a>, inspector-general of the Czechoslovak Army, was installed by President <a href="Edvard%20Bene%C5%A1">Edvard Beneš</a> as prime minister. In response to the German ultimatum, Syrový declared that "further concessions from our side are no longer possible"; 42 Czechoslovak divisions were mobilized in preparation for an expected German invasion. By the end of September, with Czechoslovakia abandoned by France and Britain, and territorial demands <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Czechoslovak%20border%20conflicts%23Annexations%20by%20Poland%20in%201938">piled on from Poland</a>, Beneš backtracked on Czechoslovakia's refusal to accept further German requests.

At this time, as well as holding his army post, Moravec was serving as a member of the Committee for the Defense of the Republic, a nationalist pressure group led by the son of the former Czechoslovak finance minister <a href="Alois%20Ra%C5%A1%C3%ADn">Alois Rašín</a>. In that capacity he sought an audience with Beneš during the last week of September, on the eve of the Munich ratification. During a two-hour confrontation with Beneš, Moravec pleaded with the president to declare war against Germany, and not capitulate to German demands. His pleas went unheeded.

The Munich Agreement left Moravec disillusioned with both Western democracies and Beneš' diplomatic competence. According to Moravec, "apostles without courage" had led Czechoslovakia to capitulation. He expressed anger at the government's evocation of national ideals in its announcement of the agreement, declaring that a state unwilling to defend its ideals should not boast of them in the same way "a whore has no right to boast of her honor". As a further expression of his contempt for the government, he mockingly requested leave to join the army of <a href="El%20Salvador">El Salvador</a>.

During the short-lived <a href="Second%20Czechoslovak%20Republic">Second Czechoslovak Republic</a>, with Prague actively seeking to appease Germany to avoid further territorial losses, Moravec was forced to quit teaching at the military academy. Moreover, he found himself prohibited by the government from writing for newspapers due to concerns that the incendiary, anti-German nature of his editorials would be unduly provocative.

On March 16, 1939, Germany occupied the <a href="Resttschechei">rump Czechoslovak state</a> and the German-controlled <a href="Protectorate%20of%20Bohemia%20and%20Moravia">Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia</a> was declared. According to <a href="Franti%C5%A1ek%20Moravec">František Moravec</a>, Emanuel Moravec attempted to leave the <a href="Czech%20lands">Czech lands</a> prior to the German arrival and join the military <a href="cadre%20%28military%29">cadre</a> being sent abroad. His offer of service was rejected. Moravec was particularly concerned that his earlier denunciations of Germany, and his reputation as a strident anti-German polemicist, might make him a target of the new regime. He was surprised, therefore, when the new German authorities informed him he could resume writing books and newspaper columns. Moravec returned to writing with gusto and a reoriented editorial line, declaring "our nation could have died in war [with Germany]. Now the whole nation will die of fright and fear".
Writing in "V úloze mouřenína – Československá tragedie 1938", the most popular of his works, Moravec sought to more fully reconcile his support for the Germans with his earlier calls for resistance. He indicted Beneš and the <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a> for Czechoslovakia's defeat and declared it was the unwillingness of the elite to confront Germany militarily that demonstrated democracy's moral decay, thereby ultimately justifying its termination:

In 1941 Moravec helped found the <a href="Board%20of%20Trustees%20for%20the%20Education%20of%20Youth">Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth</a>, a fascist youth group, and served as its chairman. The following year, <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a> who, in his role as the Berlin-appointed Deputy Protector of Bohemia and Moravia held penultimate day-to-day authority in the protectorate, compelled President <a href="Emil%20H%C3%A1cha">Emil Hácha</a> to appoint Moravec as the protectorate's education minister. Unlike other protectorate ministries, the education ministry under Moravec was given a measure of independence and not required to report to an overseer in the office of the Reich Protector. As with all protectorate ministers, Moravec's mandate to hold office was at the pleasure of the Reich Protector, as set-out in the March 16, 1939 <a href="decree">decree</a> of the German government.

By the time Moravec was given authority for the education ministry, Czech universities had been closed, school textbooks revised, and more than 1,000 student leaders deported to <a href="Sachsenhausen%20concentration%20camp">Sachsenhausen concentration camp</a>.

In his new post as minister of education, Moravec instituted the study of <a href="German%20language">German</a> as a compulsory subject in schools, explaining that it would become a "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of Europe: "[e]very Czech who desires to excel in the future must acquire the German language so that work opportunities in all fields are open to them not only in the Reich, but also in Europe and the whole world ... learn German in order that the Czechs' good reputation can spread way beyond the frontiers of Bohemia and Moravia". He also promoted the idea of Czech culture as an historic component of Germanic culture. The Czech Women's Center, originally founded during the Second Republic as a group of professional women seeking greater gender equality, operated under Moravec's auspices. It was at his suggestion that it became a leading advocate for nutritional education.

Moravec did not limit himself to educational questions. In 1943, he advanced a proposal to deploy the <a href="Government%20Army%20%28Bohemia%20and%20Moravia%29">Army of the Protectorate</a> to the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a> in support of German operations. Hácha discussed the proposal with Reich Minister for Bohemia and Moravia <a href="Karl%20Hermann%20Frank">Karl Hermann Frank</a> who ultimately decided not to forward it to <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.

Moravec reportedly offered the noted Czech journalist <a href="Ferdinand%20Peroutka">Ferdinand Peroutka</a> release from <a href="Buchenwald%20concentration%20camp">Buchenwald concentration camp</a> in exchange for accepting a position writing for the newspaper "<a href="Lidov%C3%A9%20noviny">Lidové noviny</a>", an offer Peroutka declined.

During his tenure as education minister, Moravec adopted an <a href="anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> worldview that largely mirrored that of the Nazi Party. It positioned Germany as fighting a war to save humanity from <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>. Moravec publicly blamed Jews for pre-war tensions between the former Czechoslovakia and Germany. He claimed that "Jewish <a href="capitalist">capitalist</a> interests hitched themselves to Anglo-French strategic interests and, entirely artificially and cunningly, escalated Czech hatred of the German nation to a state of unbounded fury." In "Tatsachen und Irrtümer" ("Facts and Errors") Moravec declared that the annexation of the Czech lands to Germany would benefit Czechs "because the Jews have been excluded from the German nation, the agents of capitalism have been rendered powerless in Germany".

In the winter of 1939–40, the Czechoslovak resistance group known as the <a href="Three%20Kings%20%28Czech%20anti-Nazi%20resistance%29">Three Kings</a> attempted to kill Moravec with a <a href="letter%20bomb">letter bomb</a>. The <a href="Czechoslovak%20government-in-exile">Czechoslovak government-in-exile</a> also considered targeting Moravec for assassination, but decided to go after Heydrich instead in what became known as <a href="Operation%20Anthropoid">Operation Anthropoid</a>. Following Heydrich's death, Moravec keynoted several mass rallies throughout the Protectorate. These were intended to demonstrate the opposition of ordinary Czechs to Heydrich's killing.

During the <a href="Prague%20Uprising">Prague Uprising</a> of May 1945, Moravec attempted to drive to a radio station under German control in the hope of broadcasting an appeal for calm. When the vehicle he was traveling in ran out of fuel, Moravec dismounted and shot himself in the head with a pistol, presumably to avoid capture.

Moravec was a <a href="Master%20Mason">Master Mason</a>, a fact that earned him contempt from some in the pre-Protectorate Czech fascist community such as the "<a href="Vlajka">Vlajka</a>".

Both Moravec and his private secretary, Franz Stuchlik, were keen rock collectors. After Moravec's death, his collection was confiscated by the Czechoslovak state and donated to the <a href="National%20Museum%20%28Prague%29">National Museum</a>. As of 2015, 107 mineral samples from Moravec's private collection were still held by the museum.

Moravec was married three times. His first wife Helena Georgijevna Beka, whom he met while a prisoner of war in Samarkand, was a close relative of the prominent <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> <a href="Alexei%20Rykov">Alexei Rykov</a>. With her he had two sons, Igor and Yuri. In 1932 he was divorced from his first wife and, in April that year, married Pavla Szondy, who gave birth to Moravec's third son, Pavel. This marriage also ended in separation, Moravec and Szondy divorcing in 1938. In 1942 Moravec married Jolana Emmerová, his <a href="Maid">housemaid</a>, who was only sixteen when their relationship caused the end of his previous marriage.

Igor fought on the Eastern Front as a volunteer with the <a href="3rd%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Totenkopf">3rd SS Panzer Division "Totenkopf"</a>. His younger brother, Yuri, served in the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a>'s <a href="137th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">137th Infantry Division</a> and unlike Igor was privately critical of his father's political views. While serving in France, Yuri was caught drunk on guard duty and sentenced to six months imprisonment and a one grade demotion. At the request of Emanuel Moravec, Frank personally appealed to <a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">OKW</a> operations chief Gen. <a href="Alfred%20Jodl">Alfred Jodl</a> in the matter and the young Moravec's sentence was quashed.

Pavel was sent to school in <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a> after the establishment of the Protectorate and died in an air raid in 1944; Igor was arrested and executed by hanging at the end of the war on charges of <a href="murder">murder</a> and <a href="treason">treason</a>. Yuri, meanwhile, was arrested and sentenced to a prison term at the end of the war and upon release emigrated to <a href="West%20Germany">West Germany</a>.

Denounced by the Allies and the Czech government-in-exile during World War II as a "Czech <a href="Quisling">Quisling</a>", Moravec has been described by <a href="John%20Laughland">John Laughland</a> as "an enthusiastic collaborator" with Nazi Germany. This contrasts with other protectorate-era officials like Hácha, whom Laughland calls "a tragic figure", or <a href="Jaroslav%20Eminger">Jaroslav Eminger</a>, who was later completely exonerated for his service in the Protectorate government. During the 2006 presentation of the Gratias Agit Award, given annually by the Czech <a href="Ministry%20of%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Czech%20Republic%29">Ministry of Foreign Affairs</a> to recognize those who promote the Czech Republic, foreign minister <a href="Cyril%20Svoboda">Cyril Svoboda</a> declared that "... we are also a country of those who have deformed our good name, people [such] as Emanuel Moravec, <a href="Klement%20Gottwald">Klement Gottwald</a>".

Czech historian <a href="Ji%C5%99%C3%AD%20Pernes">Jiří Pernes</a> has argued that had Moravec died before March 1939 he would have been remembered as a well-regarded Bohemian patriot. His pre-war record was sufficiently distinguished to earn him a place in history. 

In 1997 Pernes published a biography of Moravec. He was later criticized for the volume which, it was alleged, was heavily plagiarized from a doctoral dissertation on Moravec's life written by Josef Vytlačil.

In the Czech television series "Ceské století" ("Czech Century"), <a href="Daniel%20Landa">Daniel Landa</a> portrays Moravec.

HMS Eagle (1918)

HMS "Eagle" was an early <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Ordered by Chile during the <a href="South%20American%20dreadnought%20race">South American dreadnought race</a> as the "Almirante Cochrane", she was laid down before <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. In early 1918 she was purchased by Britain for conversion to an aircraft carrier; this work was finished in 1924. Her completion was delayed by labour troubles and the possibility that she might be repurchased by Chile for reconversion into a battleship, as well as the need for comparative trials to determine the optimum layout for aircraft carriers. The ship was initially assigned to the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a> and then later to the <a href="China%20Station">China Station</a>, spending very little time in home waters other than for periodic refits.

"Eagle" spent the first nine months of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> searching for German <a href="commerce%20raider">commerce raider</a>s. During the early part of the war, the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> was desperately short of <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> and "Eagle" was equipped solely with <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s until late 1940. She was transferred to the Mediterranean in May 1940, where she escorted <a href="Malta%20convoys">convoys</a> to <a href="Malta">Malta</a> and <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and attacked Italian shipping, naval units and bases in the Eastern Mediterranean. The ship also participated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Calabria">Battle of Calabria</a> in July but her aircraft failed to score any hits when they attempted to torpedo Italian cruisers during the battle. Whenever "Eagle" was not at sea, her aircraft were disembarked and used ashore.

The ship was relieved by a more modern carrier in March 1941 and ordered to hunt for <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a> shipping in the Indian Ocean and the <a href="South%20Atlantic">South Atlantic</a>. Her aircraft sank a German <a href="blockade%20runner">blockade runner</a> and disabled a German <a href="oil%20tanker">oil tanker</a> in mid-1941 but did not find any other Axis ships before the ship was ordered home for a refit in October. After completing an extensive refit in early 1942, the ship made trips delivering fighter aircraft to Malta to boost its air defences in the first half of 1942. "Eagle" was torpedoed and sunk by the on 11 August 1942 while escorting a convoy to Malta during <a href="Operation%20Pedestal">Operation Pedestal</a>.

In 1911, the <a href="Chilean%20Navy">Chilean Navy</a> ordered one <a href="super-dreadnought">super-dreadnought</a> battleship, with an option for a second ship, each to be armed with ten 14-inch (356 mm) and sixteen six-inch (152 mm) guns, that were named and "Almirante Cochrane". "Almirante Latorre" was laid down in December 1911, followed by "Almirante Cochrane" at the <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong yards</a> at <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> on 20 February 1913. On the outbreak of the First World War, construction of the two ships was suspended. As "Almirante Latorre" was almost complete, she was purchased for the Royal Navy, entering service as in 1915. "Almirante Cochrane" was almost complete up to the forecastle, although her side armour had not yet been installed when war broke out. No work was carried out during the war until the British decided to complete her as an aircraft carrier for the Royal Navy. She was therefore purchased from Chile on 28 February 1918 to be converted into the carrier HMS "Eagle". She was the fourteenth ship of the Royal Navy to bear that name.

The <a href="Director%20of%20Naval%20Construction">Director of Naval Construction</a> began preliminary design work even before the ship was purchased and submitted an outline design on 8 February 1918. This design had a full-length <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> and its most distinctive features were the two <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23I">islands</a> separated by the flight deck. Each island was to be long, containing two <a href="funnel%20%28ship%29">funnels</a> and a tripod mast. Although they were staggered to make it more difficult for an enemy ship to estimate the ship's course, they were to be connected to each other with heavy bracing. The <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a> was to be mounted on top of this bracing which left a clear height of for the aircraft on the flight deck. There was to be a wide space between the islands where the aircraft were to be assembled before taking off. Aircraft would be transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">aircraft lifts</a> (elevators). A <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> was to be located at the aft end of each island to lift aircraft aboard and to recover <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a>s. Bulk <a href="petrol">petrol</a> storage consisted of in tins stowed on the forecastle deck and protected by plating. Two ready-use tanks near the islands would allow aircraft on the flight deck to refuel. The ship's planned armament consisted of nine 6-inch guns and four <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> guns mounted on the platform between the islands. "Eagle" retained the battleship's mixture of coal and <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a>, but the quantities were increased to of coal and of oil, as the forward and rear 14-inch <a href="magazine%20%28artillery%29">magazines</a> and shell rooms were converted to be used as oil tanks.
Based on trials with , in which pilots were found generally to turn to port when recovering from an aborted landing, the design was revised to eliminate the port island in April 1918. The starboard island was lengthened to and its width was reduced to to minimise air turbulence. The island contained the bridge, both funnels and the tripod mast that carried the <a href="fire-control%20director">fire-control director</a>s for the armament. At the request of Admiral <a href="David%20Beatty%2C%201st%20Earl%20Beatty">David Beatty</a>, commander of the <a href="Grand%20Fleet">Grand Fleet</a>, the main armament was increased to 12 six-inch guns, including one mounted on the island, and eighteen torpedo tubes were added, three triple fixed mounts on each <a href="broadside">broadside</a>, in case the ship met German <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s at night. The anti-aircraft armament was reduced to a single 4-inch gun mounted on the island between the funnels as Beatty believed that the ship's own fighters would be her best defence against enemy aircraft. This design was approved in June, although work had begun earlier.

The armour planned for her upper <a href="Belt%20armor">belt</a> was used to protect the ship's <a href="waterline">waterline</a>. The already-completed superstructure was removed as were the <a href="barbette">barbette</a>s for the 14-inch guns. "Eagle" was launched on 8 June 1918 and was towed downriver to the shipbuilder's High Walker yard for <a href="fitting-out">fitting-out</a> ten days later. The boiler uptakes were re-routed and the existing openings were plated over. The existing upper deck became the floor of the hangar deck and a new superstructure was built above it. The flight deck was thick and served as the uppermost strength deck, or main supporting deck, of the ship. When the war ended in November 1918, the ship was about nine months from completion.

Construction was slowed by <a href="industrial%20action">industrial action</a> after the war, and was suspended on 21 October 1919 as Chile wanted to repurchase the ship and have it re-converted to a battleship. The £2.5 million cost of doing so would have been higher than the £1.5 million offered by the Chileans and the Admiralty decided to retain the ship. The Royal Navy needed to carry out flying trials with a carrier fitted with an island, and the Admiralty approved the use of "Eagle" on 11 November. Armstrong Whitworth plated over the openings for the undelivered elevators on the flight deck (which had been cancelled when they could not meet the specifications), finished the rear funnel, removed the torpedo tubes, and plated over the forward funnel uptakes before she sailed to the <a href="HMNB%20Portsmouth">Royal dockyard at Portsmouth</a> for the modifications necessary for the trials on 20 April 1920. Only two of her boilers, converted to run on fuel oil only, could be used during the trials.

The trials principally tested the longitudinal <a href="arresting%20gear">arresting gear</a> used previously on the small aircraft carrier . They were not intended to stop landing aircraft—the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind—but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and falling off the flight deck. Initially, the arresting gear was about long and was installed too far forward. Over the course of the trials it was moved further to the rear and lengthened to a total of .

The ship was commanded during the trials by <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Wilmot%20Nicholson">Wilmot Nicholson</a>, who had previously commanded the carrier in 1918, and the Royal Air Force representative was <a href="Group%20Captain">Group Captain</a> <a href="Charles%20Samson">Charles Samson</a>. Taxiing trials began on 10 May with <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> fighters and <a href="Parnall%20Panther">Parnall Panther</a> reconnaissance aircraft while the ship was still docked. Flights over and around the ship to evaluate air currents over the flight deck and around the island began shortly afterward and the first on-board landing was made on 1 June. Larger aircraft like the <a href="Bristol%20F2B">Bristol F2B</a> fighter, the <a href="Sopwith%20Cuckoo">Sopwith Cuckoo</a> torpedo bomber, and the <a href="De%20Havilland%20DH.9">De Havilland DH.9</a> bomber were also evaluated during the trials. They were generally successful with only 12 minor accidents in 143 landings in all types of weather conditions, although they did reveal that aircraft landing aboard carriers would need <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> fitted with <a href="Oleo%20strut%20%28aircraft%20suspension%29">shock absorbers</a> to handle the impact of landing on a pitching deck. Group Captain Samson strongly preferred the elimination of the island entirely, but Nicholson recommended that the ship be retained for service, although he was not satisfied with the size and shape of the island. He also recommended that "Eagle" be converted to burn <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> exclusively and that the removal of the 6-inch guns in exchange for anti-aircraft guns would allow the tripod mast in the island to be eliminated, since it would not then be required for fire control purposes .

The ship was <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a> on 16 November, but did not begin construction to a revised design until 24 March 1921 at Portsmouth. The Admiralty accepted some of Nicholson's suggestions, but not all. The shape and size of the island was modified in accordance with the results from <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a> testing at the <a href="National%20Physical%20Laboratory%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Physical Laboratory</a>, but the 6-inch guns were retained. The forward edge of the flight deck was faired into the ship's bow to smooth out the air currents over the bow and the 4-inch anti-aircraft guns were mounted on and around the island. The forward elevator was moved to the forward end of the <a href="hangar">hangar</a>. After construction began, <a href="anti-torpedo%20bulge">anti-torpedo bulge</a>s were added, deep, and the petrol tin storage room was replaced by a tank. The ship's designed fuel capacity was , but this was increased to when she was bulged. However, of this amount was required to act as ballast to offset the weight of the island and its equipment.

"Eagle" had an <a href="length%20overall">overall length</a> of , a beam of , and a <a href="draft%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She displaced at <a href="Standard%20displacement">standard load</a>. Each of the ship's four sets of Brown-Curtis geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s drove one 3-bladed propeller. They were powered by 32 <a href="Yarrow%20Shipbuilders">Yarrow</a> small-tube <a href="water-tube%20boiler">boilers</a>. During her <a href="sea%20trial">sea trial</a>s on 9–10 September 1923, the turbines produced and gave "Eagle" a speed of , but this caused leaks in the turbine joints and she was limited to a maximum of in service. She had a range of at .

The ship's flight deck was long and her <a href="hangar">hangar</a> was long and no less than wide. Its minimum height was , and it was equipped with four steel shutter <a href="fire%20curtain">fire curtain</a>s to isolate any fires in the hangar. The forward lift's dimensions were and the aft lift was . The fore-and-aft arresting gear was long and extended the length of the flight deck between the edges of the lifts. A large <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> with a radius was positioned behind the island. The ship's aircraft capacity was 25 to 30 and, in 1939, the ship's crew totalled 41 officers and 750 men, exclusive of the air group.

For self-defence against enemy warships, "Eagle" had nine <a href="BL%206%20inch%20naval%20guns%20Mk%20XIII%20%E2%80%93%20XVIII%236-inch%20Mark%20XVII%20gun%20in%20Royal%20Navy%20service">BL Mk XVII 6-inch guns</a>, three at the stern and six along both sides of the ship. The ship carried 200 rounds per gun. Two of her five <a href="QF%204%20inch%20Mk%20V%20naval%20gun">QF Mk V 4-inch</a> AA guns were positioned on the flight deck in front of the island while a third was behind the island. The remaining two guns were mounted on top of the island, one between the two funnels, and each gun was provided with 150 rounds.

"Eagle" was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet on 7 June 1924 after she commissioned on 26 February and finished <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a>. She was the largest aircraft carrier in the world at the time and embarked 24 aircraft in four six-aircraft flights of the <a href="Fleet%20Air%20Arm">Fleet Air Arm</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. These consisted of <a href="No.%20402%20%28Fleet%20Fighter%29%20Flight%20RAF%20/%20No.%20402%20%28Fleet%20Fighter%29%20Flight%20FAA">No. 402 Flight</a> with <a href="Fairey%20Flycatcher">Fairey Flycatcher</a>s, <a href="No.%20422%20%28Fleet%20Spotter%29%20Flight%20RAF%20/%20No.%20422%20%28Fleet%20Spotter%29%20Flight%20FAA">No. 422 Flight</a> with <a href="Blackburn%20Blackburn">Blackburn Blackburn</a> reconnaissance aircraft, <a href="No.%20440%20%28Fleet%20Reconnaissance%29%20Flight%20RAF%20/%20No.%20440%20%28Fleet%20Reconnaissance%29%20Flight%20FAA">No. 440 Flight</a> (<a href="Supermarine%20Seagull%20%281921%29">Supermarine Seagull</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>s) and <a href="No.%20460%20%28Fleet%20Torpedo%29%20Flight%20RAF%20/%20No.%20460%20%28Fleet%20Torpedo%29%20Flight%20FAA">No. 460 Flight</a> with <a href="Blackburn%20Dart">Blackburn Dart</a> torpedo bombers.

While in the Mediterranean, one flight usually operated ashore at either <a href="RAF%20Hal%20Far">RAF Hal Far</a>, <a href="Malta">Malta</a>, or <a href="Aboukir">Aboukir</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>. The Seagulls proved to be unsatisfactory in service and they were replaced by <a href="Fairey%20III">Fairey III</a>Ds in January 1925. <a href="Avro%20Bison">Avro Bison</a> spotters of <a href="No.%20421%20%28Fleet%20Spotter%29%20Flight%20RAF%20/%20No.%20421%20%28Fleet%20Spotter%29%20Flight%20FAA">No. 421B Flight</a> operated aboard for a time in late 1925. "Eagle" sailed for <a href="HMNB%20Devonport">Devonport</a> at the end of 1925 for a brief refit where the longitudinal arresting gear was removed as it had been found to be virtually useless in service. Two single <a href="QF%202%20pounder%20naval%20gun">QF 2-pounder "pom-pom"</a> light anti-aircraft guns were added forward of the 4-inch guns on the flight deck in front of the island and the ship's petrol capacity was increased to .

When the ship returned to the Mediterranean after the completion of her refit in 1926, the Bisons of <a href="No.%20448%20%28Fleet%20Spotter%20Reconnaissance%29%20Flight%20FAA">No. 448 Flight</a> replaced No. 422 Flight. In 1928 she was joined by which allowed the fleet to experiment with multi-carrier operations. "Eagle" was refitted again in early 1929 and a salt-water spray system was fitted to fight hangar fires. On 29 June 1929, she rescued <a href="Spanish%20Air%20Force">Spanish Air Force</a> <a href="Major">Major</a> <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20Franco">Ramón Franco</a> – brother of future Spanish dictator <a href="Francisco%20Franco">Francisco Franco</a> – and his crew, who had been adrift in the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic Ocean</a> since 22 June when their <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a>, the <a href="Dornier%20Do%20J">Dornier Do J Wal</a> ("Whale") "Numancia" was forced down due to fuel exhaustion on the first leg of an attempt to fly westward around the world.

When "Eagle" returned to the Mediterranean later in the year, both 440 and 448 Flights had re-equipped with Fairey IIIF reconnaissance aircraft. "Eagle" departed Malta on 8 January 1931, en route to Portsmouth to load the latest carrier aircraft for a demonstration at the British Industries Exhibition at <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>. She returned to the Mediterranean to participate in the summer fleet exercises before sailing for Devonport where she began a lengthy refit in August.

The ship's boilers were replaced during the refit and the 4-inch gun between the funnels was replaced by an eight-barrel QF 2-pounder Mark V "pom-pom" mount. A single quadruple <a href="Vickers%20.50%20machine%20gun">Vickers .50 machine gun mount</a> was added on the starboard aft side of the flight deck. Four <a href="Fire%20fighting%20foam">fire-fighting foam</a> generators were also fitted on the flight deck. A single <a href="High%20Angle%20Control%20System">High Angle Control System</a> (HACS) director was fitted on the aft end of the control top on the tripod mast. The crew, now numbering 753 sailors and 253 airmen, benefited from improved accommodation. The refit was completed on 28 November 1932, but personnel shortages prevented her from <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a> until April 1933.
Following the refit, "Eagle" was sent to the Far East, serving on the China Station throughout 1934, with her aircraft being deployed against <a href="Piracy">pirate ships</a> and their bases. The tropical heat caused problems in cooling the bomb magazines, and the food storage rooms and the ventilation proved to be barely satisfactory. Another quadruple .50 machine gun mount was added forward of the 2-pounder gun on the flight deck and the original mounting was shifted over to the port side. During this time, the ship's air group comprised nine <a href="Hawker%20Osprey">Hawker Osprey</a> fighters of <a href="803%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">803 Squadron</a> and 12 Fairey IIIFs of <a href="824%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">824 Squadron</a>; the latter unit was re-designated as <a href="825%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">825 Squadron</a> in October 1934. 803 Squadron transferred to when she relieved "Eagle" at the end of 1934. They were replaced by <a href="Blackburn%20Baffin">Blackburn Baffin</a> torpedo bombers of <a href="812%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">812 Squadron</a> when "Eagle" arrived in the Mediterranean in February 1935. Both squadrons remained behind at RAF Hal Far when the ship sailed for Devonport for another refit in June.

"Eagle" was paid off until her refit began in early 1936. Transverse arresting gear was installed and a second octuple "pom-pom" replaced the 2-pounders in front of the island. Two more quadruple .50 machine gun mounts were installed in <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s on either side of the bow. The capacity of her bomb magazines was also increased during this refit, and the ship's ventilation and insulation arrangements were improved as well. She was sent back to the Far East in 1937 with only nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers (cloth-covered biplanes) of <a href="813%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">813 Squadron</a> aboard as well as nine more Swordfish to re-equip 824 Squadron when it transferred from "Hermes" in April. Captain <a href="Clement%20Moody">Clement Moody</a> commanded "Eagle" from 1 January 1937 until relieved by Captain A. R. M. Bridge on 16 June 1939. In August 1939 the ship's crew was exchanged in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> and "Eagle" sailed for <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> to begin a short refit on 12 August.

When World War Two began the following month, the ship had just completed her refit in Singapore. She put to sea a few days later and began searching for German merchant ships in company with the <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a> and escorted by the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> . A Swordfish discovered the freighter south of the port of <a href="Padang%2C%20Indonesia">Padang</a> on <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> and "Birmingham" was ordered to intercept it while "Eagle" continued her air patrols. She arrived in <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, on 10 September and until 5 October she searched the Indian Ocean for German ships between the west coast of India and the <a href="Maldive%20Islands">Maldive Islands</a> with the light cruiser . "Eagle" was then assigned to Force I together with the heavy cruisers and , to search the Indian Ocean for the <a href="pocket%20battleship">pocket battleship</a> and other German <a href="commerce%20raider">commerce raider</a>s. In mid-December her boilers and bottom were cleaned during a period of maintenance in <a href="Durban">Durban</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.
"Eagle" continued to patrol the Indian Ocean in 1940, but escorted a large Australian troop convoy to Suez early in the year. While in the vicinity of the <a href="Nicobar%20Islands">Nicobar Islands</a> on 14 March, a bomb accidentally exploded, killing 14 men. The damage to the ship was mostly confined to the bomb magazines, although two generators were knocked out. The explosion flashed upwards through the port bomb lift and ignited the wing on one Swordfish stowed in the hangar. All but four of the aircraft were damaged by the corrosive salt-water spray system when the fire was doused. She was repaired at Singapore between 15 March and 9 May when the ship sailed for Colombo en route to the Mediterranean, which she reached on 26 May. In June three crated <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Sea Gladiators</a> were found in storage at <a href="HMS%20Grebe">Dekheila</a> and these aircraft became the only fighters available for the entire fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.

Flying from shore bases on 5 July, 813 Squadron attacked <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> harbour in a combined attack with the RAF at dusk, sinking the and the freighter , and blowing the bow off the destroyer . Two other merchantmen had to be beached before they sank. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Calabria">Battle of Calabria</a> on 9 July, 813 Squadron was used to search and track the Italian fleet while 824 Squadron made two unsuccessful attacks on Italian cruisers without loss. On the evening of 10 July, "Eagle"s aircraft attacked <a href="Augusta%2C%20Sicily">Augusta</a> harbour in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, sinking the destroyer . While under heavy aerial attack on 13 July, pilots of the Sea Gladiator Flight shot down three Italian bombers. On the night of 20 July, six aircraft from 824 Squadron, flying from <a href="Sidi%20Barrani">Sidi Barrani</a>, sank the destroyers and as well as the freighter . While providing distant cover to a convoy bound for Greece, one <a href="Savoia-Marchetti%20SM.79">Savoia-Marchetti SM.79</a> medium bomber was shot down on 29 July by "Eagle"s Sea Gladiators while attacking the fleet.

On 22 August three Swordfish from 824 Squadron, flying from Sidi Barrani, attacked and sank the and the depot ship "Monte Gargano" in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Bomba">Gulf of Bomba</a>. The ships were carrying <a href="Frogman">eight frogmen</a> and four <a href="manned%20torpedo">manned torpedo</a>es to attack British shipping in Alexandria harbour. In September, she was joined by the carrier and both ships attacked Italian airbases on <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> on 9 September. "Eagle"s 12 Swordfish were late in taking off and attacked the airfield at Maritza after the Italians had been alerted by the earlier attack by "Illustrious" aircraft on the nearby airbase at Collato. Four aircraft were shot down by the defending <a href="Fiat%20CR.32">Fiat CR.32</a> and <a href="Fiat%20CR.42">Fiat CR.42</a> fighters, but two SM.79s were destroyed on the ground and four other aircraft were damaged. These losses were the ship's heaviest in any single mission of the war.

While covering another convoy to Malta on 12 October, she was damaged by near misses from SM.79s based in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>. The damage to her aviation fuel system was not immediately apparent and she covered another convoy later that month. While returning to Alexandria, her aircraft attacked Maltezana seaplane base on Rhodes on 27 October. Four of her Swordfish from 824 Squadron had been disembarked earlier and were flown to Fuka Landing Ground for a night attack on Tobruk harbour. The 824 Squadron aircraft distracted the defences with 250-pound bombs, while the 12 other Swordfish laid <a href="mine%20%28naval%29">mines</a>. On 28 October, "Eagle" and the rest of the Mediterranean Fleet patrolled off the west coast of Greece for a few days hoping to intercept the Italian Navy if it supported the Italian Army in their invasion of Greece, but no contact was made.

When the ship was examined on 5 November, her aviation fuel system was leaking and required repairs. Five of her aircraft were transferred to "Illustrious" for an attack on 11 November on <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a> (<a href="Battle%20of%20Taranto">Operation Judgement</a>), whilst "Eagle" remained in Alexandria. One of "Eagle"s Swordfish was shot down by the intense Italian anti-aircraft fire. The ship covered multiple convoys to Greece and Malta during the rest of November. Six of her aircraft bombed <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> harbour during the night of 24/25 November without loss. "Eagle" spent most of December in Alexandria, but her aircraft supported the ground war, most notably when they spotted for the <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s and during the bombardment of <a href="Bardia">Bardia</a> on 2 January 1941. In mid-January, the ship covered a convoy to Greece, but bad weather foiled plans to attack Italian bases en route. After her return, her aircraft complement was reorganised to include more fighters, as "Eagle" now had sole responsibility for fighter cover over the fleet after the crippling of "Illustrious" by German <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s on 11 January. In order to make room for the fighters, one of the Swordfish squadrons was disembarked and used to support the ground war. When "Eagle" was covering another convoy to Malta in mid-February, the ship carried nine <a href="Fairey%20Fulmar">Fairey Fulmar</a>s of <a href="813%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">805 Squadron</a>, five Sea Gladiators and six Swordfish.

After the carrier arrived on 9 March to relieve "Illustrious", orders were cancelled that would have transferred Eagle to the South Atlantic to hunt for German commerce raiders and the ship did not leave Alexandria until 9 April. In the meantime, both Swordfish squadrons were transferred to <a href="Port%20Sudan">Port Sudan</a> to operate against Italian shipping in <a href="Massawa">Massawa</a>, in <a href="Italian%20East%20Africa">Italian East Africa</a>, on 25 March. They were very successful and returned to the ship on 13 April after she had passed through the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. After she reached <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a>, <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, on 26 April, she was ordered to sea on 29 April on an unsuccessful search for a raider in the Indian Ocean. The ship was then ordered on 1 May to proceed to <a href="Durban">Durban</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, to rendezvous with the battleship and to proceed to <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>. After the two ships arrived in <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a>, <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, on 25 May to refuel, "Nelson" was ordered to continue to Gibraltar, but "Eagle"s orders changed and she was now charged with hunting for German supply ships in the South Atlantic. Captain A. R. M. Bridge was relieved by <a href="Edmund%20Rushbrooke">E. G. H. Rushbrooke</a> at this time.

"Eagle" began searching the South Atlantic on 29 May, usually accompanied by "Dorsetshire" or the light cruiser . The carrier's Swordfish discovered, bombed and sank the blockade runner "Elbe" on 6 June. The oil tanker "Lothringen" was captured on 15 June by "Dunedin" after it had been bombed and <a href="Strafing">strafed</a> by several Swordfish. The ship continued patrolling without incident except for a hangar fire that killed one aircraft mechanic on 20 September. All but four of the ship's Swordfish were damaged by the spray used to put out the fire, but the ship herself was undamaged.

In October 1941, "Eagle" was ordered to return to Britain for a refit at <a href="Gladstone%20Dock">Gladstone Dock</a>, <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. She arrived off <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a> on 26 October and was docked at Liverpool on 1 November. The quadruple .50 machine guns were replaced by 12 manually operated automatic <a href="Oerlikon%2020%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bmm%20cannon">20 mm Oerlikon</a> light anti-aircraft guns, six in sponsons on each side of the flight deck, and the crews of the four-inch AA guns were given protection from splinters by the addition of <a href="zareba%20%28ship%20structure%29">zarebas</a> around each weapon. The HACS was moved to the front of the control top and fitted with a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20285">Type 285</a> gunnery <a href="radar">radar</a>. A <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20290">Type 290</a> air warning radar was also installed. The ship's oil fuel capacity was reduced to in exchange for an increase in her petrol storage of . This reduced her range to at a speed of .

"Eagle"s refit was completed on 9 January 1942 and she was working up for the next five weeks. She joined the convoy WS16 en route to Gibraltar on 16 February and reached it a week later. 813 and 824 Squadrons had rejoined the ship with their Swordfish and they were supplemented by four <a href="Hawker%20Hurricane">Hawker Sea Hurricane 1B</a> fighters from a detachment of <a href="804%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">804 Squadron</a> and the Fighter Flight of 813 Squadron. Because their wings could not fold, they could not use either lift and remained on the flight deck at all times. The ship reached Gibraltar on 23 February and was assigned to <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a>.

Upon "Eagle"'s arrival in Gibraltar, 824 Squadron transferred to <a href="RAF%20Gibraltar">RAF North Front</a> and the ship loaded 15 <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> fighters brought to Gibraltar by the carrier . These aircraft were partly assembled dockside and hoisted aboard for final assembly. They were too big to fit below deck and remained on the flight deck, where they impeded the operations of "Eagle"s aircraft, except for those few also carried on the flight deck, until the ferried aircraft were flown off. On 27 February 1942, she sailed to deliver the Spitfires to Malta, escorted by the battleship , "Argus", the cruiser , and nine destroyers, but the operation had to be cancelled when the long-range fuel tanks of the Spitfires proved defective. The problems were not rectified until 7 March, when the 15 Spitfires were successfully flown off to Malta. Upon her return, the ship's engines required repairs that lasted until 13 March. Nine more Spitfires were delivered to Malta on 21 March and an additional seven on 29 March. After her return, her steering gear required extensive repairs that lasted until the end of April.
As part of <a href="Operation%20Bowery">Operation Bowery</a>, "Eagle" rendezvoused on the night of 7/8 May with the American carrier , carrying 47 Spitfires, while "Eagle" had landed her entire aircraft complement to make room for 17 Spitfires of her own. Sixty of them arrived safely at Malta. For the next operation on 17 May, the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes of 813 Squadron flew back on board to join the 17 Spitfires and six <a href="Fairey%20Albacore">Fairey Albacore</a> torpedo bombers destined for Malta. The fighters flew off without incident, but engine problems forced all of the Albacores to return. After they had landed, the ship was attacked by a half-dozen SM.79 torpedo bombers which failed to score any hits. The radar-guided guns of the escorting light cruiser, , were instrumental in driving off the determined Italian aircraft.

"Eagle" disembarked all of her aircraft, except for her four Sea Hurricanes, to make room for 31 Spitfires and flew them off on 3 June during <a href="Operation%20Style">Operation Style</a>. Another 32 were flown off on 9 June during <a href="Operation%20Salient">Operation Salient</a>. Later in the month, the ship provided air cover for another convoy, <a href="Operation%20Harpoon%20%281942%29">Operation Harpoon</a>, which departed for Malta at the same time as the <a href="Operation%20Vigorous">Operation Vigorous</a> convoy did, from the opposite direction. A dozen Sea Hurricanes of <a href="801%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">801 Squadron</a> and four Fulmars from <a href="807%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">807 Squadron</a> reinforced the four Sea Hurricanes of 813's Fighter Flight to deal with the heavy air attacks anticipated. The convoy was subject to heavy air attacks by both the German and Italian Air Forces; "Eagle"s Sea Hurricanes managed to disrupt many attacks, claiming nine aircraft destroyed and a further two probably destroyed for the loss of one Sea Hurricane from 813 Squadron and three Fulmars. The escorts reached Gibraltar on 17 June and did not make the next delivery of aircraft until 14 July when 32 Spitfires were flown off to Malta (<a href="Operation%20Pinpoint">Operation Pinpoint</a>). During this time, the carrier's aircraft complement consisted solely of six Sea Hurricanes of 801 Squadron. Another 29 Spitfires as well as four Swordfish of 824 Squadron were loaded on 20 July and the Spitfires were flown off the following day. Earlier in the day, the ship was unsuccessfully attacked by the .

"Eagle" covered Operation Pedestal together with the carriers and . "Eagle" carried 16 Sea Hurricanes of 801 and 813 Squadrons as well as four reserve aircraft for the operation. On the early afternoon of 11 August, "Eagle" was hit by four torpedoes from the , commanded by <a href="Helmut%20Rosenbaum">Helmut Rosenbaum</a>, and sank within four minutes, south of <a href="Cape%20Salinas">Cape Salinas</a> at position
. 131 officers and men, mainly from the ship's machinery spaces, were lost in the sinking, Sixteen Sea Hurricanes were lost; four from 801 were aloft when the ship was torpedoed, and landed on other carriers. The destroyers and and the <a href="tug">tug</a> "Jaunty" rescued 67 officers and 862 sailors.

13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)

The 13th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian) was a <a href="Gebirgsj%C3%A4ger">mountain infantry</a> <a href="Division%20%28military%29">division</a> of the <a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>, an armed branch of the German <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> that served alongside but was never formally part of the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> during World War II. From March to December 1944, it fought a <a href="counter-insurgency">counter-insurgency</a> campaign against communist-led <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisan">Yugoslav Partisan</a> resistance forces in the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a>, a <a href="fascist">fascist</a> <a href="puppet%20state">puppet state</a> of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Germany</a> that encompassed almost all of modern-day <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, all of modern-day <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> as well as parts of <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a>. It was given the title <a href="Khanjar">Handschar</a> () after a local <a href="fighting%20knife">fighting knife</a> or <a href="Scimitar">sword</a> carried by Ottoman policemen during the centuries that the region was part of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. It was the first non-Germanic "Waffen"-SS division, and its formation marked the expansion of the "Waffen"-SS into a multi-ethnic military force. Composed of <a href="Bosniaks">Bosnian Muslims</a> (ethnic Bosniaks) with some Catholic <a href="Croats">Croat</a> soldiers and mostly German and <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslav "Volksdeutsche"</a> (ethnic German) <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officers</a> and <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s, it took an oath of allegiance to both <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> and the Croatian leader <a href="Ante%20Paveli%C4%87">Ante Pavelić</a>.

The division fought briefly in the <a href="Syrmia">Syrmia</a> region north of the <a href="Sava">Sava</a> river prior to crossing into northeastern Bosnia. After crossing the Sava, it established a designated "security zone" in northeastern <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a> between the Sava, <a href="Bosna%20%28river%29">Bosna</a>, <a href="Drina">Drina</a> and <a href="Spre%C4%8Da">Spreča</a> rivers. It also fought outside the security zone on several occasions, and earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against <a href="Serb">Serb</a> and <a href="Jews">Jewish</a> civilians. In late 1944, parts of the division were transferred briefly to the <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> area, after which the non-German members began to desert in large numbers. Over the winter of 1944–45, it was sent to the <a href="Baranya%20%28region%29">Baranja region</a> where it fought against the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> and <a href="Fatherland%20Front%20%28Bulgaria%29">Bulgarians</a> throughout southern <a href="Hungary%20during%20World%20War%20II">Hungary</a>, falling back via a series of defensive lines until they were inside the Reich frontier. Most of the remaining Bosnian Muslims left at this point and attempted to return to Bosnia. The rest retreated further west, hoping to surrender to the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Western Allies</a>. Most of the remaining members became <a href="Prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners</a> of the <a href="British%20Army%20during%20the%20Second%20World%20War">British Army</a>. Subsequently, 38 officers were <a href="Extradition">extradited</a> to <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> to face criminal charges, and 10 were executed. Hundreds of former members of the division fought in the <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20Civil%20War%20in%20Mandatory%20Palestine">1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine</a> and the <a href="1948%20Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20War">1948 Arab–Israeli War</a>.

After the <a href="Invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">invasion</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Kingdom of Yugoslavia</a> by the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis powers</a> on 6 April 1941, the extreme <a href="Croat%20nationalist">Croat nationalist</a> and <a href="fascist">fascist</a> <a href="Ante%20Paveli%C4%87">Ante Pavelić</a>, who had been in exile in <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>'s <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Italy">Italy</a>, was appointed "<a href="Poglavnik">Poglavnik</a>" (leader) of an <a href="Usta%C5%A1e">Ustaše</a>-led Croatian state – the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> (often called the NDH, from the ). The NDH combined almost all of modern-day <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, all of modern-day <a href="Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Bosnia and Herzegovina</a> and parts of modern-day <a href="Serbia">Serbia</a> into an "Italian-German quasi-protectorate". NDH authorities, led by the <a href="Usta%C5%A1e%20Militia">Ustaše Militia</a>, subsequently implemented genocidal policies against the <a href="Serb">Serb</a>, <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> and <a href="Romani%20people">Roma</a> population living within the borders of the new state.

In an effort to secure the loyalty of the Bosnian Muslims, Pavelić ordered that a property in <a href="Zagreb">Zagreb</a> be converted into a <a href="mosque">mosque</a> that he named the "Poglavnik's Mosque". Despite Pavelić's assurances of equality with the Croats, many Muslims quickly became dissatisfied with Croatian rule. A Muslim leader reported that not one Muslim occupied an influential post in the administration. Although this was an overstatement, Muslims were underrepresented in government positions, comprising only two of 20 ministerial positions, none of the six state secretaries was a Muslim, and there were only 13 Muslim "people representatives" in a total of 206. Fierce fighting broke out between the Ustaše, <a href="Serb">Serb</a>-chauvinist <a href="Chetniks">Chetniks</a> and pan-<a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a> in NDH territory. Some Ustaše Militia units became convinced that the Muslims were <a href="communist">communist</a> sympathizers, and burned their villages and murdered many civilians. The Chetniks accused the Muslims of taking part in the Ustaše violence against Serbs and perpetrated similar atrocities against the Muslim population. The Muslims received little protection from the <a href="Croatian%20Home%20Guard%20%28Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia%29">Croatian Home Guard</a>, the regular army of the NDH, whom the Germans described as "of minimal combat value". Local militias were raised, but these were also of limited value and only one, the <a href="Tuzla">Tuzla</a>-based Home Guard <a href="Had%C5%BEiefendi%C4%87%20Legion">Hadžiefendić Legion</a>, led by <a href="Muhamed%20Had%C5%BEiefendi%C4%87">Muhamed Hadžiefendić</a>, was of any significance.

The Bosnian Muslim elite and notables in various cities and towns issued resolutions or memoranda that publicly denounced Croat-German collaborationist measures along with laws and violence against Serbs. These were issued in: <a href="Prijedor">Prijedor</a> (23 September 1941), <a href="Sarajevo">Sarajevo</a> (12 October), <a href="Mostar">Mostar</a> (21 October), <a href="Banja%20Luka">Banja Luka</a> (12 November), <a href="Bijeljina">Bijeljina</a> (2 December) and Tuzla (11 December). The resolutions condemned the Ustaše in Bosnia and Herzegovina, both for their mistreatment of Muslims and for their attempts to turn Muslims and Serbs against one another. One memorandum declared that since the beginning of the Ustaše regime, the Muslims had dreaded the lawless activities that the Ustaše, Croatian government authorities and various illegal groups had been perpetrating against the Serbs.

The Bosnian Muslims' dissatisfaction with the Ustaše rule of the NDH and their need for protection were combined with nostalgia for the period of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Habsburg</a> rule in Bosnia and a generally friendly attitude towards Germany among prominent Bosnian Muslims. These factors led to a push towards autonomy for the Bosnian Muslim community which was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, the autonomists were desperate to protect the Muslim people and wrote to <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich.

On 6 December 1942, "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> and key <a href="Waffen-SS">"Waffen"-SS</a> recruiting officer "SS-<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS</a>" <a href="Gottlob%20Berger">Gottlob Berger</a> approached Hitler with the proposal to raise a Bosnian Muslim SS division. Both the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> and the "Waffen"-SS were concerned about the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the NDH that tied down German military personnel needed elsewhere. A German source noted that by 1943 over 100,000 Bosnian Muslims had been killed and 250,000 had become refugees. In addition, a serious food shortage threatened the region. "The Muslims," remarked "<a href="Gruppenf%C3%BChrer">SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Waffen-SS</a>" <a href="Artur%20Phleps">Artur Phleps</a>, "bear the special status of being persecuted by all others".

The romantic notions that Himmler had about the Bosnian Muslims were probably significant in the division's genesis. He was personally fascinated by the Islamic faith and believed that Islam created fearless soldiers. He found their ferocity preferable to the gentility of Christians and believed their martial qualities should be further developed and put to use. He thought that Muslim men would make perfect SS soldiers as Islam "promises them Heaven if they fight and are killed in action." As for their ethnic background and SS requirements, it appears that Himmler accepted the theories advanced by both Croatian and German nationalists that the Croatian people, including the Muslims, were not ethnic Slavs but pure <a href="Aryan%20race">Aryans</a> of either <a href="Goths">Gothic</a> or <a href="Iranian%20peoples">Iranian</a> descent.

Himmler was inspired by the noted successes of the <a href="Bosnian-Herzegovinian%20Infantry">Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry</a> in World War I. He "endeavored to restore what he called 'an old Austrian' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former <a href="Austro-Hungarian%20Army">Austro-Hungarian Army</a> in the form of a Bosnian Muslim SS Division". Once raised, the division was to engage and destroy <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a>'s Partisan forces operating in north-eastern Bosnia, thus restoring local "order". Himmler's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population, but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia. "Srem (Syrmia) is the breadbasket of Croatia, and hopefully it and our beloved German settlements will be secured. I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by ... the Bosnian division ... so that we can at least restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state."

Hitler formally approved the project in mid-February 1943 and Himmler put Phleps, commander of the <a href="7th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Mountain%20Division%20Prinz%20Eugen">7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division "Prinz Eugen"</a>, in charge of raising the first SS division to be recruited from a non-<a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> people.

On 18 February 1943, Phleps travelled to Zagreb to begin formal negotiations with the NDH government. He met with German foreign ministry envoy <a href="Siegfried%20Kasche">Siegfried Kasche</a> and NDH Foreign Minister Dr. <a href="Mladen%20Lorkovi%C4%87">Mladen Lorković</a> who represented Pavelić. Pavelić had already agreed to raise the division, but the "Waffen"-SS and NDH governments had very different ideas of how it would be recruited and controlled. Lorković suggested that it be named the SS Ustaša Division, a Croatian unit raised with SS assistance, with familiar geographically based regimental names such as "<a href="Bosna%20%28river%29">Bosna</a>", "<a href="Krajina">Krajina</a>" and "<a href="Una%20%28Sava%29">Una</a>". This reflected the concerns shared by Pavelić and Kasche that an exclusively Muslim division might aid a Muslim bid for independence. As a compromise, the word "Croatian" was included in its official title and Catholic Croatian officers were recruited. Himmler and Phleps largely prevailed and created the division as they saw fit, leaving the NDH very unhappy with the outcome, particularly regarding its ethnic composition.

"SS-<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>" <a href="Karl%20von%20Krempler">Karl von Krempler</a>, a specialist in Islam who spoke <a href="Serbo-Croatian">Serbo-Croatian</a>, was charged by Himmler and Phleps with organising the division. On 3 March 1943, Phleps met with von Krempler, who was to work with NDH government representative Dr. Alija Šuljak. The campaign began on 20 March 1943, when von Krempler and Šuljak began an 18-day recruiting tour through 11 Bosnian districts. With assistance from the SS, recruiting rallies were held in the towns of <a href="%C5%BDivinice">Živinice</a> and <a href="Gra%C4%8Danica%2C%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Gračanica</a>. In the meantime the Germans began raising the divisional headquarters staff in Berlin, including "SS-Standartenführer der Reserve" Herbert von Oberwurzer, who was transferred from the <a href="6th%20SS%20Mountain%20Division%20Nord">6th SS Mountain Division Nord</a> to command the division.

Šuljak and von Krempler soon fell out over the aims and purposes of the proposed division. Šuljak, an entirely political appointee, criticized von Krempler's Serbian dialect and his use of traditional Islamic colours and emblems (green flags and crescent moons) during the recruitment drive rather than the Ustaše symbols. When he reached Tuzla in central Bosnia, von Krempler met with the militia leader Hadžiefendić. On 28 March, Hadžiefendić escorted von Krempler to Sarajevo, where he introduced him to the leader of Bosnia's Islamic clergy, Hafiz Muhamed Pandža, the "<a href="reis-ul-ulema">reis-ul-ulema</a>", as well as other leading Muslim politicians not involved with the Ustaše. The NDH government and Kasche were furious, demanding von Krempler's immediate removal. The SS ignored the demand and von Krempler continued recruiting, including deserters from the NDH armed forces.

In March–April 1943, both Himmler and a group of Muslim leaders within the NDH requested that the <a href="Mufti%20of%20Jerusalem">Mufti of Jerusalem</a>, <a href="Haj%20Amin%20al-Husseini">Haj Amin al-Husseini</a>, then resident in Berlin, assist in organising and recruiting Muslims into the "Waffen"-SS and other units. He was escorted by von Krempler, who spoke Turkish. From 30 March to 10 April, the Mufti visited Zagreb, Sarajevo and Banja Luka to meet senior Muslim leaders and agitate in support of the new division. The Mufti also visited in order to bless and inspect the division. The Mufti insisted, "The most important task of this division must be to protect the homeland and families [of the Bosnian volunteers]; the division must not be permitted to leave Bosnia", but the Germans paid no attention.

Despite the support of al-Husseini, recruitment of Muslims for the division fell well short of the numbers needed. Himmler then allowed a 10 percent Christian component, but the recruitment of sufficient Muslims continued to prove difficult, resulting in the induction of 2,800 Catholic Croats into the division. To Himmler's dismay, this was greater than the ratio of Catholics to Muslims that he had wanted.

Hussein Biščević (Husejin Biščević or Biščević-beg; born 28 July 1884) was the highest ranking (and perhaps the oldest) Bosnian military officer to volunteer. Bišcević had served in the Austro–Hungarian army and in August 1943 was appointed as an "<a href="Obersturmbannf%C3%BChrer">SS-Obersturmbannführer</a>" to command the divisional anti-aircraft battalion. He was eventually judged unsuitable, and was replaced with a German just before the division went into combat.

Sources differ regarding the division's initial composition. Pavlowitch states that sixty percent of its recruits were Muslims and the rest were <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslav "Volksdeutsche"</a> who made up the majority of its <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officers</a> and <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s. Tomasevich states that it was formed with 23,200 Muslims and 2,800 Croats, with mostly German officers. He further states it was the largest of the Muslim SS divisions with 26,000 men. Lepre indicates that the division's prescribed strength was reduced from 26,000 to 21,000, and Cohen states that the division achieved a maximum strength of 17,000 in April 1944. The division had a Muslim <a href="imam">imam</a> for each battalion other than the all-German <a href="Military%20communications">signal</a> battalion. For about six months the division included about 1,000 ethnic <a href="Albanians">Albanians</a> from <a href="Kosovo">Kosovo</a> and the <a href="Sand%C5%BEak">Sandžak</a> region who made up the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Regiment, which later became the 1st Battalion of the 28th Regiment (I/28).

By the time the division had completed its training, it was still about one third below its designated strength in both officers and NCOs, and its officer corps remained almost entirely German. Most of the officers and NCOs were drawn from replacement units of other "Waffen"-SS divisions.

The division was initially sent to southern France for formation and training, where it was accommodated mainly in towns and villages in the <a href="Aveyron">Aveyron</a> and <a href="Loz%C3%A8re">Lozère</a> <a href="d%C3%A9partement">département</a>s. For a long period after its official formation, the division was unnamed and was referred to as the "Kroatische SS-Freiwilligen-Division" (Croatian SS-Volunteer Division) or the "Muselmanen-Division" (Muslim Division). The decision by the "Waffen"-SS to form and train the division outside Bosnia was contrary to advice given by the NDH's German plenipotentiary general, <a href="Edmund%20Glaise-Horstenau">Edmund Glaise von Horstenau</a>. This advice soon proved prophetic.

On 9 August 1943, "<a href="Oberst">Oberst</a>" <a href="Karl-Gustav%20Sauberzweig">Karl-Gustav Sauberzweig</a> took command of the division from von Oberwurzer. Sauberzweig transferred to the "Waffen"-SS and was appointed to the rank of "<a href="Oberf%C3%BChrer">SS-Oberführer</a>". He was a <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n who had been decorated as an eighteen-year-old company commander during World War I, and had served as a regimental commander during the early stages of <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">Operation Barbarossa</a> before being wounded. A "proven leader of men", he spoke no Serbo-Croatian but quickly gained the lasting respect and affection of the men of the division.

On the night of 16/17 September 1943, while the 13th SS Division was training in <a href="Villefranche-de-Rouergue">Villefranche-de-Rouergue</a> in France, a group of pro-Partisan soldiers led by Muslim and Catholic junior officers staged a mutiny within the Pioneer battalion. Led by <a href="Ferid%20D%C5%BEani%C4%87">Ferid Džanić</a>, Božo Jelinek (aka Eduard Matutinović), Nikola Vukelić and Lutfija Dizdarević, they captured most of the German personnel and executed five German officers, including battalion commander "SS-Obersturmbannführer" Oskar Kirchbaum. Apparently, the mutineers believed that many of the enlisted men would join them and they could reach the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Western Allies</a>.

The revolt was put down with the assistance of the unit imam, <a href="Halim%20Malko%C4%8D">Halim Malkoč</a>, and unit physician Dr. Willfried Schweiger. Malkoč told the Bosnian enlisted men of 1st Company that they were being deceived, released the German NCOs and rallied the company to hunt down the ringleaders. Schweiger did the same with 2nd Company. Dizdarević and Džanić were shot and killed during the fighting, and Vukelić was captured, while Jelinek escaped.

Sources vary on the number of mutineers killed after the revolt was suppressed. Tomasevich states that 78 of the worst offenders were executed, but Lepre lists only 14 executions while four more deserters were located and shot in late September. Cohen states that about 150 mutineers were killed immediately, while <a href="Noel%20Malcolm">Noel Malcolm</a> writes that 15 of the mutineers died and a further 141 were killed in a subsequent "clean-up operation." The Germans attributed the infiltration to Tito's suggestion that his Partisan followers enlist for police duty to receive superior weapons, uniforms and training. Enlistees who were deemed "unsuitable for service" or "politically unreliable" were subsequently purged. Eventually, 825 Bosnians were removed from the division and sent to Germany for labour service with "<a href="Organisation%20Todt">Organisation Todt</a>". Of these, 265 refused and were sent to the <a href="Neuengamme%20concentration%20camp">Neuengamme concentration camp</a> where dozens of them died.

Speaking of the Bosnian Muslim troops who had served in the Austro–Hungarian army, Himmler later said, "I knew there was a chance that a few traitors might be smuggled into the division, but I haven't the slightest doubt concerning the loyalty of the Bosnians. These troops were loyal to their supreme commander twenty years ago, so why shouldn't they be so today." Himmler awarded both Malkoč and Schweiger the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross Second Class</a> for thwarting the mutiny. Five soldiers were also decorated.

When Villefranche-de-Rouergue was liberated in 1944, the local population decided to pay tribute to the mutineers by naming one of its streets "Avenue des Croates" (Bosnian Muslims were seen by the local population as Croats of Islamic faith) and commemorating "the revolt of the Croats" every 17 September. Cohen states that after the war, the Yugoslav government requested it be changed to "the revolt of the Yugoslavs" in order to obscure the mutineers' ethnicity; this request was refused by the French. The <a href="Villefranche-de-Rouergue%20uprising">Villefranche-de-Rouergue uprising</a> was originally commemorated in the city with a monument designed by Croatian sculptor <a href="Vanja%20Radau%C5%A1">Vanja Radauš</a>.

As a result of the mutiny, the division was moved to the <a href="%C5%9Awi%C4%99tosz%C3%B3w">Neuhammer</a> training grounds in the <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>n region of Germany (present-day Poland) to complete its training. During the training phase, the German officers, pleased with its progress, coined the term "Mujo" for the Bosnian Muslims. The members of the division swore an oath of allegiance to both Hitler and Pavelić.

On 9 October 1943, SS headquarters officially named the division the "13. SS-Freiwilligen b.h. Gebirgs-Division (Kroatien)", but a short time later a change was made to differentiate it from those that were composed of Germans and it became the 13th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian) (, ). The division was named <a href="Khanjar">"Handschar"</a>, after a local <a href="fighting%20knife">fighting knife</a> or <a href="Scimitar">sword</a> carried by Turkish policemen during the centuries that the region was part of the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. On 15 February 1944, the division completed its training and returned to the NDH by rail.

The division was formed for the primary role of securing around of territory (the designated security zone) in north-eastern Bosnia within the NDH. The security zone encompassed the <a href="Posavje%20District%20%28Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia%29">Posavina</a>, <a href="Semberija">Semberija</a> and <a href="Majevica">Majevica</a> regions between the Sava, Bosna, Drina and Spreča rivers. It roughly corresponded with the area of operations of the Partisan <a href="3rd%20Corps%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">3rd Corps</a>. Himmler saw this task as critical to the safeguarding of important agricultural areas and "Volksdeutsche" settlements in the Syrmia region to the north.

The division participated in what may have been the largest anti-Partisan sweep of World War II: Operation "Maibaum". The 13th SS Division also participated in other divisional and <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized anti-Partisan operations between March and May 1944.

The division first saw action during Operation "Wegweiser" (Signpost) from 9 to 12 March 1944. The aim of Operation "Wegweiser" was to clear a part of the <a href="Syrmia">Syrmia</a> region which was occupied by Partisans who threatened the Zagreb-Belgrade railway. The Partisans were operating from forests around <a href="Bosut%20%28Sremska%20Mitrovica%29">Bosut</a> and villages along the Sava. As the division entered the area, the Partisans withdrew to the south-east, avoiding decisive engagement. Sauberzweig claimed the Partisans suffered 573 killed and 82 captured. Hoare writes that the division massacred hundreds of Serb civilians during the operation. According to <a href="Vladimir%20Dedijer">Vladimir Dedijer</a> and <a href="Antun%20Mileti%C4%87">Antun Miletić</a>, 223 civilians were killed in Bosut, 352 in <a href="Sremska%20Ra%C4%8Da">Sremska Rača</a>, and 70 in <a href="Jamena">Jamena</a>, mostly old men, women and children. The operation was a success in clearing the Bosut forests, but the Partisans returned to the area soon after it concluded.

On 15 March 1944, Operation "Save" was launched with the objective of clearing Partisans from the Semberija region. Sauberzweig wrote an open letter to the division: "We have now reached the Bosnian frontier and will (soon) begin the march into the homeland. ... The Führer has provided you with his best weapons. Not only do you (have these) in your hands, but above all you have an idea in your hearts – to liberate the homeland. ... Before long, each of you shall be standing in the place that you call home, as a soldier and a gentleman; standing firm as a defender of the idea of saving the culture of Europe – the idea of Adolf Hitler."

Sauberzweig also ordered that each commander read a prepared message as his unit crossed the Sava River, which emphasized that the "liberation of Bosnia" and ultimately the liberation of "Muslim Albania" was their goal. This was a direct appeal to the Albanian troops as well as the Bosnians. The 27th Regiment crossed the Sava at dawn at <a href="Ra%C4%8Da%20Bridge">Bosanska Rača</a> near the confluence with the <a href="Drina">Drina</a>. The rest crossed at <a href="Br%C4%8Dko%20%28town%29">Brčko</a> covered by an intense artillery bombardment. Contact was immediately made with Partisan forces, who quickly withdrew into the forests. The service support units remained north of the Sava in <a href="Vinkovci">Vinkovci</a>, which became their permanent garrison area. The 27th Regiment advanced easily across the <a href="Pannonian%20Plain">Pannonian Plain</a> through <a href="Velino%20Selo">Velino Selo</a> to Brodac and then on to Bijeljina which was taken against light Partisan resistance late on 16 March.

The 27th Regiment then consolidated its position in Bijeljina while the 28th Regiment and the divisional reconnaissance battalion () bore the brunt of the fighting as they advanced through <a href="Pukis">Pukis</a>, <a href="%C4%8Celi%C4%87">Čelić</a> and Koraj at the foot of the Majevica mountains. Sauberzweig later recorded that the 2nd battalion of the 28th Regiment (II/28) "at Čelić stormed the Partisan defenses with (new) battalion commander <a href="Hans%20Hanke">Hans Hanke</a> at the point" and that enemy forces withdrew after a hard battle with heavy losses, low on ammunition.

Once the area was secured, defensive positions were established along the Čelić–<a href="Lopare">Lopare</a> road and company strength units were sent out to conduct reconnaissance. On the night of 17–18 March, elements of the Partisan <a href="16th%20Vojvodina%20Division%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">16th Vojvodina Division</a> and <a href="36th%20Vojvodina%20Division%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">36th Vojvodina Division</a> mounted unsuccessful attacks against the 28th Regiment's positions at Koraj and <a href="Zabr%C4%91e%20%28Ugljevik%29">Zabrđe</a>, losing over 200.

After Operation "Save", the division remained relatively static for more than three weeks, mopping up and repelling local Partisan attacks. The Muslims were impatient to push further into Bosnia, but the reconnaissance battalion was heavily engaged on the divisional western flank, attacking positions held by the Partisan 3rd Vojvodina Brigade of the 36th Vojvodina Division at <a href="Gornji%20Rahi%C4%87">Gornji Rahić</a> on 26 March, killing 124 Partisans and capturing 14. The battalion captured several more Partisan positions in the following week. In early April, 200 Partisans of the 16th Muslim Brigade surrendered to the division. They were mostly former members of various Muslim militias who had been conscripted into the ranks of the Partisans.

Operation "Osterei" (Easter Egg) began on 12 April 1944 with the goal of clearing the Majevica mountain, which was held by elements of the 3rd Corps led by General <a href="Kosta%20Na%C4%91">Kosta Nađ</a>. The 27th Regiment quickly captured <a href="Janja">Janja</a> and drove through <a href="Trnova%2C%20Ugljevik">Donja Trnova</a> to reach the <a href="Ugljevik">Ugljevik coal mines</a>, an important economic objective for the German war machine. Following fighting which continued into the evening of 13 April, the 27th Regiment reported Partisan casualties of 106 dead, 45 captured and two deserters along with large amounts of weapons and ammunition. The regiment also seized a huge amount of medical supplies from aid stations in the area of Donja Trnova.

The 28th Regiment drove south through Mačkovac and during fighting around <a href="Priboj">Priboj</a>, its 1st Battalion (I/28), made up of Albanians, incurred heavy casualties. The Partisan 3rd Corps then withdrew the 16th and 36th Vojvodina Divisions south across the Tuzla–<a href="Zvornik">Zvornik</a> road. The reconnaissance battalion continued the advance, driving into the western Majevicas and capturing <a href="Srebrnik">Srebrnik</a> and <a href="Grada%C4%8Dac">Gradačac</a> then linking up with the Croatian Home Guard 1st Mountain Brigade. The Germans considered Operation "Osterei" a major success, achieving all objectives with minimal losses.

During the final phase of Operation "Osterei", I/28 was withdrawn from the fighting and transferred to <a href="Pristina">Pristina</a> in Kosovo to form part of the <a href="21st%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Skanderbeg%20%281st%20Albanian%29">21st "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Skanderbeg" (1st Albanian)</a> being raised by Himmler's order. A new I/28 was raised from other divisional units and new recruits.

In the latter part of Operation "Osterei", "Jagdkommandos", lightly armed and mobile "hunter teams" of company or battalion strength, were used to break up and harass Partisans still operating on the flanks. These teams killed over 380 Partisans and captured over 200 between 21 and 23 April. By mid-April, half of the security zone had been cleared of Partisans.

The ambitious goal of Operation "Maibaum" (Maypole) was to destroy the Partisan 3rd Corps. <a href="Army%20Group%20F">Army Group F</a> ordered <a href="V%20SS%20Mountain%20Corps">V SS Mountain Corps</a> to form a blockade along the Drina to prevent the Partisan force from crossing into Serbia. Operation "Maibaum" was one of the largest counter-insurgency operations of World War II and included 7th SS Division and NDH forces. The 13th SS Division was under the command of V SS Corps, and the primary tasks of the division were to capture Tuzla and Zvornik, then drive south parallel with the Drina to meet other Corps elements. The original plan included the parachute insertion of <a href="500th%20SS%20Parachute%20Battalion">500th SS Parachute Battalion</a> into the <a href="Vlasenica">Vlasenica</a> area, but this was cancelled due to unsuitable weather. Flank security was to be provided by the reconnaissance battalion in the Srebrnik area. The deployment south of the Spreča, and therefore outside the security zone, during Operation "Maibaum" was ordered by the corps commander, Phleps, despite opposition from Sauberzweig. This caused friction between the two that eventually required Himmler's intervention.

On 23 April, the 28th Regiment pushed south along mountain roads through Tuzla. The following day it continued on as far as <a href="Stupari%20%28Lukavac%29">Stupari</a>. On 25 April, the 27th Regiment advanced south to capture Zvornik. At the same time, the 28th Regiment sent I/28 east towards Vlasenica and II/28 continuing south towards <a href="Kladanj">Kladanj</a>, capturing the town on 27 April. Due to the level of the <a href="Drinja%C4%8Da">Drinjača</a> at Kladanj, instead of fording the river and pushing east towards Vlasenica, II/28 continued south-east towards <a href="Han%20Pijesak">Han Pijesak</a>, where they met elements of 7th SS Division advancing north.

I/28 captured Vlasenica on 28 April, but was almost immediately attacked from the east by two Partisan divisions. A third Partisan division surrounded the headquarters of 28th Regiment at <a href="%C5%A0ekovi%C4%87i">Šekovići</a>, 30 kilometres north-west of Vlasenica. Both II/28 and the reconnaissance battalion were rushed to Vlasenica, where II/28 relieved the battered I/28 and then surrounded Šekovići. After a 48-hour battle, during which II/28 was decimated, the town was taken.

While the battle of Šekovići raged, the 27th Regiment extended the Drina blockade further south, ambushing a Partisan column and reaching <a href="Nova%20Kasaba">Nova Kasaba</a> on 30 April. After the situation at Šekovići improved on 1 May, the 27th Regiment returned to patrolling the Tuzla–Zvornik road. The 28th Regiment moved to the Simin Han-Lopare area on 5 May, while the 7th SS Division pursued the Partisans withdrawing south.

Operation "Maibaum" had not only stopped the Partisan 3rd Corps from crossing the Drina into Serbia, it had scattered the Partisan formation. On 6 May, V SS Mountain Corps ordered the division to return to the security zone north of the Spreča.

On 17–18 May 1944, the division, along with the local Majevica-Tuzla Chetnik unit commanded by Radivoj Kerović, commenced Operation "Maiglöckchen" (May Bell) to destroy several Partisan brigades in the Majevicas. The Partisans were encircled in the Stolice heights. An attempt by the Partisan 16th Vojvodina Division to relieve the surrounded force was defeated by the reconnaissance battalion and elements of the 28th Regiment. The relieving column was driven back across the Spreća. After heavy bombardment by the artillery regiment, the trapped Partisan force escaped south out of the pocket under cover of darkness on 18 May. The Partisans suffered considerable casualties, for example the 17th Majevica Brigade of the <a href="27th%20East%20Bosnia%20Division">27th East Bosnia Division</a> lost 16 killed and 60 missing. At the conclusion of Operation "Maiglöckchen", the 27th Regiment remained near Zvornik and the 28th Regiment deployed near <a href="Srebrenik">Srebrenik</a>.

After Operation "Maiglöckchen", the division shifted to a largely defensive posture aimed at denying the Partisans access to the security zone. Since its arrival in the zone the division had been assisted in this task by local forces of varying reliability. These included four groups of Chetniks numbering 13,000, Nešad Topčić's "Zeleni kadar" (or <a href="Green%20cadres%20%28paramilitary%29">Green Cadres</a>, a Muslim nationalist militia) most of which eventually joined the Partisans, and both <a href="Usta%C5%A1e%20militia">Ustaše militia</a> and the Croatian Home Guard, neither of which was effective. These same groups, along with the Partisans, had simultaneously been trying to encourage Bosnian and Croat members to defect. Between March and June 1944, these attempts were largely fruitless, producing fewer than 200 deserters.

Following <a href="Operation%20R%C3%B6sselsprung%20%281944%29">Operation "Rösselsprung"</a> (Knight's Move), the German attempt to kill or capture Tito at <a href="Drvar">Drvar</a> in western Bosnia on 25 May 1944, the Partisan leader ordered a general uprising. The Partisan 3rd Corps planned an offensive that involved three parallel columns of divisional strength thrusting north into the zone to engage and destroy German and local allied forces. The columns comprised:

Operation "Vollmond" (Full Moon) was devised quickly after the reconnaissance battalion observed Partisan forces crossing the Tuzla–Zvornik road on the evening of 6 June 1944. Sauberzweig's aim was to assault from the east and north, pushing the advancing Partisan forces against the Drina. The German plan underestimated the strength of the Partisan "Western Column" and had placed only one battalion (I/28) on high ground in the Partisans' path. This battalion included many raw recruits, and was protecting two batteries of the artillery regiment, one of which (7/AR13) was deployed just east of Lopare.

Late on 7 June, the Partisans scattered I/28 and although II/28 was sent from Srebrenik to assist, the 16th Vojvodina Division surged forward against the positions of 7/AR13, which consisted of 80 men with four 150 mm guns and only one <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>. After four hours fighting, and with half the battery's personnel dead, the artillerymen ran out of small arms ammunition and scattered into the forest. As a result of a counterattack by II/28 on the afternoon of 9 June and throughout 10 June, the 16th Vojvodina Division withdrew that afternoon and the battalion pursued both the "Western Column" and "Centre Column" south. The guns and vehicles of 7/AR13 had been destroyed by the Partisans before they withdrew and there were reports that the German dead at Lopare had been mutilated. The "Eastern Column" was stopped by the 27th Regiment and the last of the Partisan 3rd Corps was pushed back across the Spreča on 12 June.

According to German accounts, Operation "Vollmond" cost the division 205 dead, 528 wounded and 89 missing. I/28 had been decimated, with only 180 men remaining. Sauberzweig claimed 3,000 Partisans were killed in this operation, but Phleps dismissed this as "a large exaggeration". According to one German after-action report, they had killed over 1,500 Partisans and captured large amounts of arms and ammunition. According to Partisan sources, the losses of the Partisan 3rd Corps were:

At the conclusion of Operation "Vollmond", the commander of the 27th Regiment, <a href="Desiderius%20Hampel">Desiderius Hampel</a>, was appointed division commander at his substantive rank of "Standartenführer" and Sauberzweig was tasked with forming a new corps headquarters, the <a href="IX%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Corps%20of%20the%20SS%20%28Croatian%29">IX "Waffen" Mountain Corps of the SS (Croatian)</a>. The commander of the 28th Regiment, <a href="Helmuth%20Raithel">Helmuth Raithel</a>, was tasked to raise the new <a href="23rd%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Kama%20%282nd%20Croatian%29">23rd "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Kama" (2nd Croatian)</a>. Both the new corps headquarters and new division were to be formed in southern Hungary. Three NCOs from every company of 13th SS Division, along with other personnel, were transferred to form the core of 23rd SS Division. New commanders were appointed to the two mountain infantry regiments, notably Hanke to the 28th.

Soon after Hampel's assumption of command, he became aware that local Chetniks were scavenging the Operation "Vollmond" battlefields for divisional equipment. He met with the Chetnik leader Kerović and arranged for the return of the equipment in exchange for small arms ammunition and boxes of <a href="hand%20grenade">hand grenade</a>s.

Throughout the remainder of June 1944 and into the first week of July, the division was engaged in fighting off attempted Partisan incursions into the security zone and reinforcing local NDH and Chetniks who were under attack from the Partisans. During the summer of 1944, elements of the division were tasked with guarding Hungarian Jewish forced labourers building fortifications in Tuzla. While guarding the labourers, they subjected them to cruel treatment, and shot 22 who were unable to continue working.

Operation "Fliegenfänger" (Flypaper) was launched on 14 July 1944. It aimed to destroy a makeshift Partisan runway in the <a href="Osmaci">Osmaci</a> area about southeast of Tuzla, south of the Tuzla–Zvornik road and the Partisan forces guarding it. The airstrip was just north of the southern boundary of the security zone and was being used by Allied aircraft to bring in supplies and evacuate wounded Partisans to Italy. It had been built by the 19th Birač Brigade of the 27th East Bosnia Division between 3 and 6 July, and the first flight into the airfield occurred on the night of 6/7 July. The 19th Birač Brigade was also responsible for its defence. Two battalions of the 27th Regiment, along with a battalion of Chetniks from Majevica launched the operation from the line of <a href="Caparde%20%28Kalesija%29">Caparde</a>–<a href="Memi%C4%87i%20%28Kalesija%29">Memići</a>–<a href="Prnjavor%20%28Kalesija%29">Prnjavor</a>, and captured the towns of Osmaci and Memići and damaged the airfield despite stiff resistance. That afternoon, the 19th Birač Brigade counter-attacked and pushed the German and Chetniks back across the Tuzla–Zvornik road. At the same time as the counter-attack was underway, the headquarters of the Partisan 3rd Corps ordered the 36th Vojvodina Division to clear the enemy from the area so that the airfield could be used. During the night of 14/15 July, elements of the 36th Vojvodina Division arrived in the Osmaci area and relieved the 19th Birač Brigade, which moved towards <a href="Srebrenica">Srebrenica</a>. During the night of 16/17 July, Allied aircraft delivered equipment to Osmaci and about 100 wounded Partisans were airlifted to Italy.

According to German reports, 42 Partisans were killed, while the division's losses were four dead and seven wounded. The Partisan force withdrew south to the Vlasenica–<a href="Raji%C4%87i%2C%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Rajići</a> area. The cooperation with the Chetnik battalion was described in the IX SS Mountain Corps war diary as "effective".

While the division was conducting Operation "Fliegenfänger", the Second Panzer Army was developing a plan to block a large Partisan force from moving from central Bosnia into western Serbia to reinforce the Partisans. Due to issues with the availability of various units of V SS Mountain Corps, the planned Operation "Rose" was cancelled.

In the interim, since most of the division was deployed in the southern part of the security zone, Hampel planned a divisional-level operation, named Operation "Heiderose" (Wild Rose) targeting Partisan positions north-west of Šekovići, south of the Spreča. The 27th Regiment, reinforced by the same Chetnik battalion that cooperated in Operation "Fliegenfänger", would attack east towards Šekovići and the 28th Regiment would push south. A detached battalion of 7th SS Division would act as a blocking force driving north. Hampel was apparently unhappy with the performance of the new commander of the 27th Regiment ("SS-Obersturmbannführer" Hermann Peter) and put the divisional chief of staff, "SS-<a href="Sturmbannf%C3%BChrer">Sturmbannführer</a>" Erich Braun, in charge of the 27th Regiment.

On 17 July, the operation began. Fierce resistance was immediately encountered by the 28th Regiment, while the 27th Regiment climbed the heights to Udrč before dusk without serious opposition. Early on 18 July, the Chetniks attacked from Matkovac towards Šekovići. The 27th Regiment reached Bačkovac and seized the high ground south of Šekovići on 19 July 1944. The 28th Regiment forced the Partisan 36th Vojvodina Division back. The battalion from 7th SS Division encountered serious resistance around Vlasenica but pushed through. On 19 July, the 28th Regiment drove north towards Gornje Petrovice to attack the Partisan <a href="12th%20Corps%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">12th Corps</a> at <a href="%C5%BDivinice">Živinice</a>. The reconnaissance battalion of 7th SS Division pushed in from <a href="Vare%C5%A1">Vareš</a> as a blocking force to stop the Partisans from withdrawing via Kladanj.

The Partisans then committed the 16th Vojvodina Division to assist the 36th Vojvodina Division that had borne the brunt of Operation "Heiderose" to this point. On 20 July, both divisions attacked the 27th Regiment, which counterattacked the following day after the Partisans were rebuffed with heavy casualties. On 23 July, the Partisans began to withdraw south out of the area. The division began to search for the hidden Partisan bases that German intelligence had indicated were located there. After a day of searching, the division uncovered more than ten Partisan bases, which the cooperating Chetniks began to clear despite having shown little interest in actually fighting the Partisans in previous days.

Operation "Heiderose" was a significant success for the division, inflicting serious losses on the Partisans. More than 900 Partisans were killed and a large amount of equipment was captured: one anti-tank gun, two mortars, 22 machine guns, over 800 rifles and nearly 500,000 rounds of small arms ammunition. The division suffered 24 killed and over 150 wounded. Communist sources hold that the Partisans suffered serious losses, with the 12th Corps alone having 250 dead, wounded and missing. However, Partisan reports estimate that German losses were significantly larger than their own. Erich Braun was recommended for the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross but the recommendation was not supported, apparently due to disagreements between the divisional staff and Phleps that had occurred during the division's formation.

In the first week of August 1944, the Second Panzer Army was finally ready to move to thwart the Partisan advance from Bosnia into Serbia, originally planned as Operation Rose. Renamed Operation "Rübezahl" (Mountain Spirit), the revamped plan required the 7th and 13th SS Divisions to form the Bosnian phase of the operation, named Operation "Hackfleisch" (Minced Meat). "Hackfleisch" aimed to drive out the Partisans occupying the area between the towns of Kladanj, Vlasenica, <a href="Sokolac">Sokolac</a> and <a href="Olovo">Olovo</a>, south of the security zone. The overall plan involved columns that were to force the Partisans eastwards into the pincers of the other units, thereby destroying them.

The columns were allocated tasks and composed as follows:

The 27th Regiment became locked in fierce fighting with the Partisan 27th East Bosnia Division and <a href="38th%20Bosnia%20Division%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">38th Bosnia Division</a>, which had launched an offensive near Vlasenica. The inability of the 27th Regiment to push forward meant that the plan to encircle the Partisan force was not achieved and the Partisans escaped by crossing the Vlasenica–Han Pijesak road to the east. Other Partisan forces withdrew in the direction of <a href="Gora%C5%BEde">Goražde</a>.

As far as the Germans were concerned, Operation "Hackfleisch" was a moderate success, with 227 Partisans killed and over 50 prisoners taken. It delayed, but did not prevent, the Partisans' advance into Serbia. In order to allow the 7th SS Division to pursue Partisan forces withdrawing towards central Bosnia, both I/28 and III/28 were placed under the command of that division for the period of 8–17 August 1944. During the remainder of August 1944, the rump of the division fought hard to keep the Partisans out of the security zone. The Partisan <a href="11th%20Krajina%20Division%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">11th Krajina Division</a> and 38th Bosnia Division quickly infiltrated into the southern part of the security zone and the 27th East Bosnia Division crossed into the area north-west of Srebrenica and drove towards <a href="Bratunac">Bratunac</a>. After a series of rapid redeployments and battalion and regimental attacks, the division scattered the 11th Krajina Division and mauled the 27th East Bosnia Division.

The division had by now been fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, it had been exhausted even before Operation "Hackfleisch" began. The cumulative effect of this exhaustion, the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.

In early September 1944, the division returned north to the security zone, basing the infantry battalions in the villages of Kurukaja, Vukovije (south of Foča), Osmaci and Srebrnik. Almost immediately, the Partisan 3rd Corps commenced an offensive, attacking II/28 at Srebrnik. It held on despite being pressed hard during two days of fighting against the 11th Krajina Division. By the end of the first week in September, divisional supply columns were being attacked by Chetniks, sensing German weakness and looking for arms and supplies. Three members of the division were killed in these attacks. Over the same week, the Allies conducted <a href="Operation%20Ratweek%20%281944%29">Operation Ratweek</a> throughout the Balkans, which involved Allied air power pounding Axis troop concentrations and key infrastructure in order to impede the German withdrawal from Greece. The local effect was to complicate the division's logistics through destruction of the Sarajevo-<a href="Brod%2C%20Bosnia%20and%20Herzegovina">Brod</a> railway and mass desertions of NDH troops tasked with securing supply lines.

On 8 September, II/27 was assaulted unsuccessfully by the Partisans at Matkovac. After the first week of September, most of the division's fighting power was shifted to the western boundary of the security zone to meet Partisan incursions. The division succeeded in dislodging Partisan units from Slatna and <a href="Me%C4%91e%C4%91a%20%28Vi%C5%A1egrad%29">Međeđa</a> and allied Chetniks captured Skurgić. After relief by NDH forces, the division's fighting regiments withdrew to Brčko for rest and refit. As a result of the shift to the western area of the security zone, the zone's southern area was quickly overrun by Partisan forces. Zvornik and Tuzla had fallen by mid-September.

On 17 August 1944, Tito offered a general amnesty and many in the division took advantage of this opportunity. During the first three weeks of September, while hard fighting continued, over 2,000 Bosnians deserted, many taking their weapons with them. They went home, joined the Green Cadres militia or went over to the Ustaše. Many defected to the Partisans, with over 700 having joined the Partisan 3rd Corps by early October.

Due to high rates of desertion from 13th SS Division, Sauberzweig proposed to disarm the Bosnians in both 13th SS Division and 23rd SS Division, but Himmler instead opted to transport the 2,000 Bosnians of 23rd SS Division from Hungary to Bosnia and re-organise the remaining troops of both divisions there, with key support units from 13th SS Division centralised under IX SS Mountain Corps, which would also move to Bosnia from Hungary.

In the early morning of 3 October 1944, the Partisan <a href="28th%20Slavonia%20Division%20%28Yugoslav%20Partisans%29">28th Slavonia Division</a> assaulted a squadron of the reconnaissance battalion at Janja close to the Drina on the eastern boundary of the security zone. As they broke out of the encirclement to the north, the rest of the reconnaissance battalion drove south from Bijeljina and stopped the Partisan advance at heavy cost. Rushing towards Janja from the east, III/27 came into contact with Partisans around <a href="Modran">Modran</a>, reaching the Janja garrison at 10 pm that night and received artillery reinforcement by 3/AR 13 during the night. At dawn the following day, an additional four Partisan brigades attacked the garrison in Janja, with fighting continuing throughout the day before the Partisans withdrew to the south. "Jagdkommandos" were sent after the fleeing enemy but were not able to inflict significant losses on them as they had already crossed the Drina into the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a>. Following this battle, Army Group F concluded that the division's overall combat value was minimal.

A few days later, the 9th Company of the 28th Regiment (9/28) displayed what could still be achieved by the Bosnians under determined leadership when "<a href="Leutnant">Leutnant</a>" Hans König ambushed the Partisan 17th Majevica Brigade near <a href="Vukosavci">Vukosavci</a>, killing at least 67 and capturing orders for future operations. König was awarded the <a href="German%20Cross%20in%20Gold">German Cross in Gold</a> for his fanatical leadership.

While 9/28 was fighting near Vukosavci, a number of units, consisting mainly of artillery, were temporarily detached for duty with other formations of Second Panzer Army fighting Soviet troops within the German-occupied territory of Serbia. The division was not re-united until January 1945.

After a request from Army Group F to Himmler, a decision was made to move IX SS Mountain Corps and the division to perform road and railway security duties near Zagreb. This would relieve LXIX Army Corps from those duties so that it could reinforce a defensive line along the Drina facing the advancing Red Army. The 28th Regiment, I/27 and III/AR 13 were to remain behind at the Brčko bridgehead to keep the Sava river bridge open. The heavy desertions from the division were the main reason for the move from north-east Bosnia to northern Croatia, but it made matters worse: the Bosnians were very reluctant to leave Bosnia and the already serious desertion rate became a flood when the move began on 16 October 1944. Many took their weapons with them and hundreds joined the Partisans. In mid-October, 700 members of the division stationed at <a href="Ora%C5%A1je%2C%20Bosnia">Orašje</a> joined the Partisans, and were distributed between the 17th Majevica Brigade and 21st East Bosnian Brigade.

On 20 October, the Red Army and Partisan forces <a href="Belgrade%20Offensive">captured Belgrade</a> and the following day the divisional staff imam, <a href="Abdulah%20Muhasilovi%C4%87">Abdulah Muhasilović</a>, incited a mutiny and led 100 men back to Bosnia. Himmler finally agreed to the disarming of the "unreliable" Bosnians under Operation "Herbstlaub" (Autumn Leaves) on 25 October. Between 900 and 1,000 Bosnians in the Brčko bridgehead and over 2,300 in Zagreb were allocated to labour battalions and similar non-combatant auxiliary duties, although the disarming operation was not completed in the Zagreb area until mid-November. By the beginning of November the division, which had been ninety five percent non-German in January 1944, became fifty percent German. The plans to re-organise the division were abandoned and Sauberzweig was relieved of command. In addition, Sauberzweig's IX SS Mountain Corps staff was dissolved and the remnants were placed under the command of LXVIII Army Corps, under which they remained for the rest of the war.

Meanwhile, the advance of the Red Army through Belgrade and north into the formerly Hungarian-occupied Yugoslav region of <a href="Baranya%20%28region%29">Baranja</a> made holding the line of the <a href="Danube">Danube</a> critical for the Germans. In early November the Soviet troops established a bridgehead over the Danube from <a href="Apatin">Apatin</a> (in modern-day Serbia). From 9 November onward, the division was committed in several stages to the Eastern Front, starting with the reconnaissance battalion which went into action at <a href="Darda%2C%20Croatia">Dárda</a> west of the Apatin bridgehead on 10 November. They were followed by a grouping of three battalions (I/27, II/28 and II/28), an artillery battalion (III/AR 13) and <a href="Assault%20pioneer">pioneer</a> support. Known as "<a href="Kampfgruppe">Kampfgruppe</a> Hanke" after their commander Hans Hanke, they moved from the Brčko bridgehead and joined a blocking position at <a href="Beli%20Manastir">Pélmonostor</a> on 14 November south-west of a second Soviet bridgehead that had been established at <a href="Batina">Batina</a> (in modern-day Croatia). As a result, the last Muslim SS troops left Bosnia. Within a week they were joined by the reconnaissance battalion, which had acquitted itself well in fighting west of Apatin. By 20 November, the Red Army was across the Danube in force at Batina. The following day "Kampfgruppe Hanke" was driven out of its positions, when the remaining 200 troops withdrew. By 25 November the rest of the division was on its way from the Zagreb area. The remnants of "Kampfgruppe Hanke" were placed under command of <a href="44th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">"Reichsgrenadier Division Hoch und Deutschmeister"</a>, withdrawing as far as <a href="Sikl%C3%B3s">Siklós</a> in southern <a href="Hungary">Hungary</a> by 29 November.

Within days "Kampfgruppe Hanke" was withdrawn from the front line to rejoin the division and re-fit, and they were moved to <a href="Barcs">Barcs</a> on the <a href="Drava">Drava</a> river for that purpose. On 2 December the division was reunited, except for the rest of the pioneer battalion, which remained stranded in Bosnia by damaged bridges and railways. As a result of continued desertions and the catastrophic casualties suffered by "Kampfgruppe Hanke", the division retained little of its original Bosnian character. Despite the return of disarmed Bosnians from labour units, the attachment of Hungarian infantry and artillery units and arrival of German replacements meant the division looked little different from any other unit in the Second Panzer Army.

After a short break, the division was allocated to a sector of the Margarethe Line, a series of fixed defensive works south of <a href="Lake%20Balaton">Lake Balaton</a> which held up the Soviet advance. After several Red Army assaults were repulsed, static trench warfare developed between December 1944 and January 1945. In early March 1945, a few units took part in <a href="Operation%20Fr%C3%BChlingserwachen">Operation Frühlingserwachen</a> (Spring Awakening), which was to be Germany's last major offensive. Meanwhile, from December 1944 to March 1945, the rest of the division remained at Barcs rebuilding. In February, they had been joined by the divisional pioneer battalion, which had finally managed to withdraw from Bosnia. On 16 March, the Soviets launched the <a href="Vienna%20Offensive">Vienna Offensive</a>, bypassing the Barcs area. That night, the division attacked the flanks of the Soviet drive at <a href="Heresznye">Heresznye</a>, where it undertook its last offensive operation of the war.

On 29 March, the <a href="57th%20Army%20%28Soviet%20Union%29">Soviet 57th Army</a> and the <a href="First%20Army%20%28Bulgaria%29">Bulgarian First Army</a> assaulted the entire Second Panzer Army front, quickly breaching the line near <a href="Nagybajom">Nagybajom</a>. The division, holding positions just south of the penetration, began to withdraw to the north-west. It fell back to the <a href="Mur%20%28river%29">Mura</a> and barely managed to cross under constant air and ground attacks, with grievous casualties. Unable to take up effective positions, the division crossed the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Reich</a> frontier on 6 April and took up positions at <a href="Ptuj">Pettau</a> in the so-called "Reich Defence Line", where it remained until 5 May. Its last fighting was around Kiesmanndorff on 19 April.

On 5 May, the division's remaining men, both German and Bosnian, began to retreat northwards towards <a href="Austria%20under%20National%20Socialism">Austria</a>. On 8 May, an order was sent to retreat to <a href="Wolfsberg%2C%20Carinthia">Wolfsberg, Carinthia</a>. On learning of the orders, unit imams of the 28th Regiment "approached their commander, Hans Hanke and requested that they and their men be discharged and be allowed to attempt to return to their homeland ... Soon, all of the Bosnians remaining in the division were asked if they wished to remain." There are two reports of large-scale reprisal killings of these members of the division by the Partisans, one of which included the mass shooting of 1,400 soldiers.

The retreat continued until 11 May. On 12 May, Hampel carried out surrender negotiations with the <a href="British%20Army%20during%20the%20Second%20World%20War">British Army</a> at <a href="Sankt%20Veit%20an%20der%20Glan">Sankt Veit an der Glan</a>. On 15 May most of the men were transported to <a href="Rimini">Rimini</a> in Italy, where they were incarcerated with other <a href="prisoners%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> from 7th SS Division and <a href="16th%20SS%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS</a>. Scattered remnants did not surrender until 18 May and many attempted to obliterate their <a href="SS%20blood%20group%20tattoo">SS blood group tattoo</a>. Hampel escaped from a <a href="prisoner-of-war%20camp">prisoner-of-war camp</a> in Fallingbostel.

While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by the spring and summer of 1944.

Thirty-eight members of the division were <a href="extradition">extradited</a> to Yugoslavia to face trial following the war. Some committed suicide, including "<a href="General%20%28Germany%29">Generalleutnant</a>" Sauberzweig on 20 October 1946 and "SS-<a href="Obersturmf%C3%BChrer">Obersturmführer</a>" Hans König. Trials took place at a military court in Sarajevo between 22 and 30 August 1947. Only seven of the 38 defendants were charged with specific offenses, although the indictment accused the division of murdering some 5,000 people. The accused were defended by three Yugoslav lawyers: two civilian and one military officer. All were found guilty; 10 were sentenced to death, and 28 received prison terms of between five years and life. "SS-Obersturmführer" Imam Halim Malkoč had already been executed in <a href="Biha%C4%87">Bihać</a> on 7 March 1947. All of those who were executed were junior officers and non-commissioned officers. Almost all the prisoners were released early and by 1952 all had been freed, except for one who had died. Having escaped, Hampel never faced trial and lived in Graz, Austria until his death on 11 January 1981.

Hundreds of members of the 13th and 23rd SS Divisions volunteered to fight in the 1948–1949 <a href="1948%20Arab%E2%80%93Israeli%20War">Arab–Israeli War</a>. The Syrian government made a request for the transfer of 8,000 Bosnian Muslim refugees to Syria, many for recruitment into the <a href="Syrian%20Armed%20Forces">Syrian Armed Forces</a>. Iraq sent representatives to Europe and invited 2,500 Bosnian Muslims to settle there. Frantzman and Culibrk estimate that approximately 1,000 former Bosnian Muslim SS members fought in Palestine. Many of the volunteers served in the <a href="Arab%20Liberation%20Army">Arab Liberation Army</a>'s Ajnaddin Battalion.

The following officers commanded the division. The first two raised and trained the division in its early stages of development and Sauberzweig and Hampel commanded it on active operations against the Partisans and later against the Red Army and Bulgarians:

Several members were decorated with high German military awards, with five awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (including Hampel and Hanke), five awarded the German Cross in Gold (including Hanke) and one awarded the German Cross in Silver. All five presentations of the Knight's Cross to members of the division are disputed and cannot be verified at the German National Archive. According to Gerhard von Seemen, Hampel, <a href="Karl%20Liecke">Karl Liecke</a> and Hanke presumably received the Knight's Cross on the same day from the commander of the 2nd Panzer Army, "General der Artillerie" <a href="Maximilian%20de%20Angelis">Maximilian de Angelis</a>.


From 24 September 1944, the supply and logistics battalions were combined to form the 13th SS Service Support/Supply Regiment.

The uniform was regular SS M43 field-jacket issue, with a divisional collar patch showing an arm holding a scimitar over a <a href="swastika">swastika</a>. On the left arm was a Croatian armshield (red-white chessboard) and on the right an <a href="Edelweiss">Edelweiss</a> flower patch. The chessboard armshield was controversial, especially with the imams, who, after crossing the Sava river, removed them. Former SS personnel serving in the division were entitled to wear a <a href="Sig%20Rune">Sig Rune</a> badge that was attached to the left breast pocket of the tunic.

Headgear was either the SS M43 <a href="fez">fez</a> which was to be worn by all ranks, while German officers had the option to wear the mountain cap ("Bergmütze"). The fez was chosen by Himmler because it had been worn by the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry regiments of the Austro-Hungarian army from 1894 to 1918, as well as by the Austro-Hungarian <a href="Albanian%20Legion">Albanian Legion</a> from 1916 to 1918. There were two versions of the fez: a field gray model to be worn in combat and while on duty and a red model for parades, marching exercises and while off duty. Both the fez and mountain cap bore the death's head and eagle of the SS. The mountain cap was also adorned with an Edelweiss flower patch, worn on the left side of the cap.

Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel

Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel is a <a href="situation%20comedy">situation comedy</a> <a href="radio%20show">radio show</a> starring two of the <a href="Marx%20Brothers">Marx Brothers</a>, <a href="Groucho%20Marx">Groucho</a> and <a href="Chico%20Marx">Chico</a>, and written primarily by <a href="Nat%20Perrin">Nat Perrin</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Sheekman">Arthur Sheekman</a>. The series was originally broadcast in the United States on the <a href="NBC">National Broadcasting Company</a>'s <a href="Blue%20Network">Blue Network</a> beginning November 28, 1932, and ended May 22, 1933. Sponsored by the <a href="Standard%20Oil">Standard Oil</a> Companies of <a href="Esso">New Jersey</a>, Pennsylvania and <a href="Standard%20Oil%20of%20Louisiana">Louisiana</a> and the Colonial Beacon Oil Company, it was the Monday night installment of the "<a href="Five-Star%20Theater">Five-Star Theater</a>", an <a href="old-time%20radio">old-time radio</a> variety series that offered a different program each weeknight. Episodes were broadcast live from NBC's <a href="WABC%20%28AM%29%23As%20WJZ">WJZ</a> station in New York City and later from a sound stage at <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> in Los Angeles, California, before returning to WJZ for the final episodes.

The program depicts the misadventures of a small New York <a href="law%20firm">law firm</a>, with Groucho as attorney Waldorf T. Flywheel (a crooked lawyer) and Chico as Flywheel's assistant, Emmanuel Ravelli (a half-wit who Flywheel uses as a <a href="fall%20guy">fall guy</a>). The series was originally titled "Beagle, Shyster, and Beagle", with Groucho's character named Waldorf T. Beagle, until a real lawyer from New York named Beagle contacted NBC and threatened to file a lawsuit unless the name was dropped. Many of the episodes' plots were partly or largely based upon <a href="Marx%20Brothers%23Filmography">Marx Brothers films</a>.

The show garnered respectable ratings for its early evening time slot, although a second season was not produced. It was thought that, like most radio shows of the time, the episodes had not been recorded. The episodes were thought entirely lost until 1988, when 25 of the 26 scripts were rediscovered in the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> storage and republished. Adaptations of the recovered scripts were performed and broadcast in the UK, on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>, between 1990 and 1993. In 1996, some recordings of the original show were discovered (all recorded from the final three episodes), including a complete recording of the last episode to air.

In 1932 <a href="Texaco">Texaco</a> introduced its "Fire Chief" gasoline to the public, so named because its <a href="octane%20rating">octane rating</a> was 66, higher than the United States government's requirements for fire engines. To advertise its new premium grade fuel, Texaco approached <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> comic <a href="Ed%20Wynn">Ed Wynn</a> to star in a radio show titled "Fire Chief". Wynn played the <a href="fire%20chief">fire chief</a> in front of an audience of 700 and the show was aired live over the <a href="NBC%20Red%20Network">NBC Red Network</a>, beginning April 24, 1932. It immediately proved popular with over two million regular listeners and a Co-Operative Analysis of Broadcasting (CAB) Rating of 44.8%.

Upon seeing the success of Wynn's "Fire Chief", the Standard Oils in New Jersey, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, and Colonial Beacon, decided to sponsor their own radio program to promote <a href="Esso">Esso</a> Gasoline and Essolube Motor Oil. They turned to the advertising agency <a href="McCann%20Erickson">McCann Erickson</a>, which developed "<a href="Five-Star%20Theater">Five-Star Theater</a>", a variety series that offered a different show each night of the week. <a href="Groucho%20Marx">Groucho</a> and <a href="Chico%20Marx">Chico Marx</a>, one half of the popular vaudeville and film stars the <a href="Marx%20Brothers">Marx Brothers</a>, were approached to appear in a comedy show. <a href="Harpo%20Marx">Harpo</a> and <a href="Zeppo%20Marx">Zeppo</a> were not required, as their trademark <a href="shtick">shtick</a>s of mute and <a href="double%20act">straight man</a> did not work well on radio. Before this decision was officially reached, early drafts of the scripts featured <a href="guest%20appearance">guest appearance</a>s written for both absent brothers, with Harpo being represented through honks of his horn and other trademark sound effects.

<a href="Nat%20Perrin">Nat Perrin</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Sheekman">Arthur Sheekman</a>, who had contributed to the scripts of the Marx Brothers' films "<a href="Monkey%20Business%20%281931%20film%29">Monkey Business</a>" (1931) and "<a href="Horse%20Feathers">Horse Feathers</a>" (1932), were enlisted to write the comedy show. It was titled "Beagle, Shyster, and Beagle", and its premise involved an unethical lawyer/private detective and his bungling assistant.

Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, the same name as the Italian character he played in the film "<a href="Animal%20Crackers%20%281930%20film%29">Animal Crackers</a>" (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that <a href="Broderick%20Crawford">Broderick Crawford</a> also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20States">Great Depression</a>, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, <a href="Greta%20Garbo">Greta Garbo</a>'s weekly salary from <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for "Fire Chief". In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for "not" appearing on the show, even though his mute character would have little to do in a radio program anyway.

"Five-Star Theater" was broadcast from NBC's <a href="flagship%20station">flagship station</a>, <a href="WPLJ%23Early%20years">WJZ</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Because Groucho, Chico, Perrin, and Sheekman were living and working in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Hollywood</a>, they had to make a three-day train journey from <a href="Pasadena%2C%20California">Pasadena</a> each week, and then another three-day trip back. The first episode was written as they took their first train ride to New York.

A number of "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel"s scripts reused plots from Marx Brothers films. The plot of Episode 17 was suggested by the stolen painting plot in "Animal Crackers", though it was a "Beauregard" in the film, not a <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>. The 23rd episode also reused scenes from "Animal Crackers", including the stolen diamond plot and Groucho's lines regarding the need for a seven-cent <a href="Nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">nickel</a>. "Monkey Business" influenced two skits in Episode 25, and "<a href="The%20Cocoanuts">The Cocoanuts</a>" gave Episode 19 its plot. Episode 26, "The Ocean Cruise", lifted some scenes virtually unchanged from the Marx Brothers' film "<a href="Animal_Crackers_%281930_film%29">Animal Crackers</a>". Vaudeville acts of the 1920s typically based their stage routines on the assumption that all audiences were <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a>; some episodes of "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" accordingly included relatively low-key <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a> jokes taken from the Marx Brothers' stage act.

Despite reusing some scripts from other sources, Perrin said that he and Sheekman "had hands full turning out a script each week". They found help from Tom McKnight and George Oppenheimer, whose names were passed along to Groucho. Perrin explained, " was in the men's room during a break, and he was complaining to the guy standing next to him, 'Geez, I wish we could find another writer or two to make life easier.' Suddenly there's a voice from one of the stalls: 'I've got just the guys for you!' Having Tom and George "did" make life easier, although Arthur and I went over their scripts for a light polishing."

After traveling to New York to perform the first seven episodes, the four men decided to broadcast from Los Angeles instead. NBC did not have a studio on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>, so for the next thirteen weeks, between January 16 and April 24, 1933, the show was transmitted from a borrowed empty <a href="soundstage">soundstage</a> at <a href="RKO%20Radio%20Pictures">RKO Radio Pictures</a>. Folding chairs were brought in for the audience of around thirty or forty people – coming from vaudeville, Groucho and Chico preferred to perform to a crowd – and were quickly cleared out at the end of each performance so that the stage would be ready for any filming the following day. The last four episodes of the show were performed back at WJZ in New York.

Chico was often late for rehearsals, so Perrin would have to stand in for him on the read-throughs. When Chico eventually made his appearance, Perrin remembers, "he'd be reading Ravelli's lines and Groucho would tell him to stop 'show him how the line should be read'. My Italian accent was better than Chico's, you see. But Chico didn't care."

"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" aired Monday nights at 7:30 p.m. on the <a href="NBC%20Blue%20Network">NBC Blue Network</a> to thirteen <a href="network%20affiliate">network affiliate</a>s in nine <a href="Eastern%20United%20States">Eastern</a> and <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern</a> states. Twenty-six episodes were made, which were broadcast between November 28, 1932 and May 22, 1933. Each episode is introduced by the Blue Network announcer and features about fifteen minutes of drama and ten minutes of orchestral music between acts. The episodes end with Groucho and Chico – not in character, but as themselves – performing a 60-second skit promoting Esso and Essolube.

"Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" was not a success for Standard Oil. Although the successful Marx films "Monkey Business" and "Horse Feathers" contained plots involving adultery, "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" did not appreciate them in the radio show:

Despite the content, Groucho's 13-year-old son <a href="Arthur%20Marx">Arthur</a> found the show "extremely funny", albeit conceding that he may have been "a very easy audience".

Following the airing of the first episodes, a New York attorney named Morris Beagle filed a lawsuit for $300,000 alleging his name had been slandered, and that its use was damaging his business and his health. He also claimed that people were calling his law firm and asking, "Is this Mr. Beagle?" When he answered, "Yes", the callers would say, "How's your partner, Shyster?" and hang up the phone. The sponsors and studio executives panicked, and from episode four the title of the show was changed to ""Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel"", and Walter T. Beagle was renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel. It was explained in the episode that the character had divorced and reverted to his "maiden name".

The CAB Rating for the show was 22.1% and placed 12th among the highest rated evening programs of the 1932–33 season. The CAB Rating was not disappointing – popular established shows such as "<a href="The%20Shadow%23Radio%20program">The Shadow</a>" and "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" did not perform as well – but it was less than half of Texaco's "Fire Chief", which got a 44.8% CAB Rating and was the third highest-rated program of the season. One reason for the lower ratings may be because of the time slot the show aired. In September 1932, only 40% of radio owners were listening to the radio at 7:00 p.m., whereas 60% listened at 9:00 p.m. The 1932–1933 season's top-rated shows, "<a href="The%20Chase%20and%20Sanborn%20Hour">The Chase and Sanborn Hour</a>", <a href="Jack%20Pearl">Jack Pearl</a>'s "Baron Münchhausen", and "Fire Chief" all aired after 9:00 p.m. Standard Oil decided it could not compete with Texaco in the ratings and "Five-Star Theater" was not renewed for a second season.

In his 1959 autobiography, "Groucho and Me", Groucho comments, "We thought we were doing pretty well as comic lawyers, but one day a few Middle East countries decided they wanted a bigger cut of the oil profits, or else. When this news broke, the price of gasoline nervously dropped two cents a gallon, and Chico and I, along with the other shows, were dropped from the network." In his 1976 book, "The Secret Word Is Groucho", he writes, "Company sales, as a result of our show, had risen precipitously. Profits doubled in that brief time, and Esso felt guilty taking the money. So Esso dropped us after twenty-six weeks. Those were the days of guilt-edged securities, which don't exist today."

However, the show was later praised by other comedians of the time. In 1988, <a href="Steve%20Allen">Steve Allen</a> said, "when judged in relation to other radio comedy scripts of the early 30s, they hold up very well indeed and are, in fact, superior to the material that was produced for the Eddie Cantor, Rudy Vallee, Joe Penner school. The rapid-fire jokes run the gamut from delightful to embarrassing." <a href="George%20Burns">George Burns</a> also found it "funny". Modern reviews of "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" have also been positive. The "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" Herbert Mitgang described it as "one of the funniest radio shows of the early 1930s", adding that "the radio dialogue was so witty and outrageous, innocent form of original comedy – as well as serious drama". Rob White of the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> said the show "glitter[s] with a thousand-and-one sockeroos."

The episodes of "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" were recorded, but for many years it was thought the recordings had not been preserved. At the time of the broadcasts, pre-recorded shows were frowned upon by advertisers and audiences. However, in 1988, Michael Barson, who worked in the <a href="United%20States%20Copyright%20Office">United States Copyright Office</a> at the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> discovered that the scripts for twenty-five of the twenty-six episodes had been submitted to the Office, where they had been placed in storage. Nobody was aware that they still existed and their copyrights had not been renewed. This meant that "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" had fallen into the <a href="public%20domain">public domain</a>. The scripts were published that same year by <a href="Pantheon%20Books">Pantheon</a> in a book titled "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel: The Marx Brothers' Lost Radio Show", edited by Michael Barson and with an interview with Perrin. In October 1988, "Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel" scenes were broadcast for the first time since the show went off the air in 1933 when <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a>, a <a href="non-profit">non-profit</a> media organization that provides content to <a href="public%20radio">public radio</a> <a href="List%20of%20NPR%20stations">stations</a> around the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, aired an 18-minute recreation of "Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel" in markets such as <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, <a href="Dallas%2C%20Texas">Dallas, Texas</a>, and <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a>, using <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>-based <a href="Arena%20Stage%20%28Washington%2C%20D.C.%29">Arena Stage</a> actors to perform the Chico and Groucho lead roles from the published scripts. Years later, three recordings of "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel" were found, including a five-minute excerpt of Episode 24 and a fifteen-minute recording of Episode 25. A complete recording of Episode 26 exists and was broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> in 2005.

In 1990 the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">British Broadcasting Corporation</a>'s <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">Radio 4</a> aired a version of "Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel". <a href="Michael%20Roberts%20%28impersonator%29">Michael Roberts</a> and <a href="Frank%20Lazarus%20%28performer%29">Frank Lazarus</a> performed the lead roles of Flywheel and Ravelli, wearing make-up and clothing similar to Groucho and Chico. The regular cast also included <a href="Lorelei%20King">Lorelei King</a> in all the female roles, <a href="Graham%20Hoadly">Graham Hoadly</a> as many of the other male characters and guest-starred <a href="Spike%20Milligan">Spike Milligan</a> and <a href="Dick%20Vosburgh">Dick Vosburgh</a>. The scripts for the BBC series were adapted for a modern British audience by <a href="Mark%20Brisenden">Mark Brisenden</a> and were produced and directed by <a href="Dirk%20Maggs">Dirk Maggs</a>. Each episode incorporated material from two or three different original episodes, and occasionally included additional jokes from Marx Brothers' films.

Commenting on the series, Maggs has said it was his favorite among the comedies he had directed, and described how they were performed.

Six episodes were performed and recorded at the <a href="Paris%20Theatre">Paris Theatre</a> and aired weekly between June 2 and July 7, 1990. The success of the first series led to another two being commissioned. The second series aired from May 11 to June 15, 1991, and the third from July 11 to August 15, 1992. The first series was made available by <a href="BBC%20Enterprises">BBC Enterprises</a> on a two-cassette release in 1991, but the second and third series were not.

Herschel Greer Stadium

Herschel Greer Stadium is an abandoned <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">Minor League Baseball</a> <a href="baseball%20park">park</a> in <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, on the grounds of <a href="Fort%20Negley">Fort Negley</a>, an <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> fortification, approximately south of the city's downtown district. The facility has been closed and unused since the end of the 2014 baseball season, and deserted since early 2015. , the stadium is still standing, but the city expects to begin demolition in early 2019 before reincorporating the land into Fort Negley Park.

Greer was opened in 1978 for the <a href="Nashville%20Sounds">Nashville Sounds</a>, an expansion franchise of the <a href="Double-A%20%28baseball%29">Double-A</a> <a href="Southern%20League%20%28baseball%29">Southern League</a> who moved to the <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">Triple-A</a> <a href="American%20Association%20%2820th%20century%29">American Association</a> in 1985 and to the Triple-A <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a> in 1998. The stadium played host to the team until 2014. The subject of numerous upgrades and repairs to maintain its functionality, Greer became one of the oldest stadiums used by a Triple-A team, and by the end of its use had fallen well below <a href="professional%20baseball">professional baseball</a>'s standards for a stadium at that class level. For over a decade, the Sounds attempted to secure agreements with the <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County</a> for a new ballpark to replace Greer, eventually resulting in the construction of <a href="First%20Tennessee%20Park">First Tennessee Park</a>, which became the Sounds' new home in 2015.

Amidst the Sounds' 37-season run, Greer simultaneously hosted two professional baseball clubs in 1993 and 1994, acting as a temporary home to a displaced Southern League franchise known during that period as the <a href="Nashville%20Xpress">Nashville Xpress</a>. The stadium also saw occasional use as a venue for college baseball, high school football, and charity softball events. It has been the site of three minor league <a href="all-star%20game">all-star game</a>s, eight <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a>s, including one <a href="perfect%20game%20%28baseball%29">perfect game</a>, and a 24-inning game which tied the record for the longest game in Pacific Coast League history. The stadium is best recognized by its distinctive guitar-shaped scoreboard.

<a href="Larry%20Schmittou">Larry Schmittou</a>, the leader of an effort to bring professional baseball back to <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville</a> in the late 1970s, knew he would need to build a new <a href="ballpark">ballpark</a> for his team as the city's previous ballpark, <a href="Sulphur%20Dell">Sulphur Dell</a>, had been demolished in 1969. He learned from a member of the Metro Board of Parks and Recreation that neither the Parks Board or the city of Nashville would be willing to pay for such a park. So, Schmittou, along with help from <a href="country%20music">country music</a>ian <a href="Conway%20Twitty">Conway Twitty</a>, put together a group of investors including other country artists <a href="Cal%20Smith">Cal Smith</a> and <a href="Jerry%20Reed">Jerry Reed</a>, as well as other Nashvillians, to finance a stadium and a minor league team. The Metro Parks Board agreed to lease to Schmittou a plot of land at the foot of St. Cloud Hill on the grounds of <a href="Fort%20Negley">Fort Negley</a>, an <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> fortification, approximately south of downtown, for a period of 20 years as long as he built a stadium with a minimum capacity of 6,500 at a cost of at least US$400,000 within 10 years. The city would also relocate the city-owned <a href="softball">softball</a> complex that occupied the site. Schmittou would be responsible for building the stadium, paying the property taxes, and paying the city seven percent of the team's total revenue in the second ten years.

Stoll-Reed Architects advised Schmittou that construction of a suitable stadium would cost between $300,000 and $500,000, but bids for the project ranged from $980,000 to $1.2 million. Schmittou looked to local suppliers to donate construction materials, took out a $30,000 loan from a bank, sold season tickets in advance of having a team, and even mortgaged his own home to help pay for the facility. The actual cost totaled $1.5 million. The stadium was posthumously named for <a href="Herschel%20Lynn%20Greer">Herschel Lynn Greer</a>, a prominent Nashville businessman and the first president of the <a href="Nashville%20Vols">Nashville Vols</a> baseball team, whose family donated $25,000 for stadium construction.

The home opener for Greer's first tenants, the <a href="Southern%20League%20%28baseball%29">Southern League</a>'s <a href="Nashville%20Sounds">Nashville Sounds</a>, <a href="Double-A%20%28baseball%29">Double-A</a> affiliate of the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, was scheduled for April 25, 1978. Construction was underway, but Schmittou knew the ballpark would not be ready by that date. The team requested to open the season with road games and had to swap a series with the <a href="Chattanooga%20Lookouts">Chattanooga Lookouts</a> in order to have more time to complete the stadium. Even with this extra time, the ballpark was still behind schedule. Much of the <a href="sod">sod</a> that been laid that winter died. By the time the replacement grass had arrived, the crew hired to lay the sod had left. General Manager Farrell Owens organized a volunteer crew to lay the sod by calling a local radio station to announce the team was having a "sod party". A group of approximately 50 people came out to lay and roll the sod the day before the scheduled opening game.

The scheduled April 25 Greer home opener was rained out and pushed back to the evening of April 26. After playing their first ten games away from home, and with tractors and grading machines still preparing the field on game day, the Sounds played their first home game on April 26, 1978. The 12–4 victory against the <a href="Savannah%20Braves">Savannah Braves</a> was witnessed by a sellout crowd of 8,156 spectators. Southern League president <a href="Billy%20Hitchcock">Billy Hitchcock</a> was on hand to witness the event, and Conway Twitty threw out the first pitch. On the field, Sounds <a href="catcher">catcher</a> Joe Griffin led the 16-<a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a> Nashville offense with 4 hits and 5 <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBI) while <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a> <a href="Bruce%20Berenyi">Bruce Berenyi</a> got the <a href="win%20%28baseball%29">win</a> and <a href="closer%20%28baseball%29">closer</a> <a href="Doug%20Corbett">Doug Corbett</a> earned a <a href="save%20%28baseball%29">save</a>.

Though the stadium was opened on time, the late sod was not the only issue on opening day. The electricity was turned on only five minutes before the gates opened. Only two women's restrooms and one men's restroom were functioning, though a few portable toilets were also available. The stadium's seats, which had previously been installed in <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>'s <a href="Fulton%20County%20Stadium">Fulton County Stadium</a>, arrived just in time. Construction of the <a href="backstop%20%28baseball%29">backstop</a> was still being completed on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the visiting Braves had concerns about the safety of playing on the quickly installed <a href="Infield%23Baseball">infield</a>, initially refusing to play on the surface. <a href="Left%20fielder">Left fielder</a>s complained about the extra-steep slope in left field that prevented them from seeing <a href="home%20plate">home plate</a>. The outfield grass was taken up and the soil <a href="grading%20%28engineering%29">regraded</a> to alleviate this problem while the Sounds were away on an eight-day road trip.

Initially, Greer was capable of seating 7,200 spectators, but was expanded to 8,800 by the end of the inaugural season. Theater-type seats with back support and armrests accounted for 3,000 of the stadium's seats; bleacher seats made up the remainder. The <a href="press%20box">press box</a> included two radio broadcast booths and an <a href="organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> booth. There were locker rooms for two teams, which each accommodated 25 people, as well as a locker room for <a href="umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpires</a>. The field measured 330 feet (100 m) down the left and right field lines, 375 feet (114 m) to left- and right-center fields, and 405 feet (123 m) to center field. The home team occupied the third base dugout, and visitors occupied the first base dugout, with each team's bullpen located in foul territory in the outfield corners. Eight lighting grids atop steel poles 100 feet (30 m) high provided illumination for night games. Amenities for customers at the park included two men's and women's restrooms and seven concession stands.

With the addition of 5,000 permanent seats, Greer's seating capacity was increased to 13,000 for the 1979 season. Improvements to the playing field included new irrigation and drainage systems which raised the field 5 feet (1.5 m) above its previous elevation.

Prior to the 1981 season, Greer underwent a number of renovations including the addition of over 1,200 box seats and over 1,000 new general admission seats. Two wooden general admission seating areas were replaced by 2,000 contoured seats. The original backstop which consisted of several steel poles was upgraded to a steel cable system, eliminating most of the poles. Other stadium upgrades included two new dugouts, three entrance and exit ramps, a new sound system, doubling the size of the reader panel on the scoreboard, and enlarging the ticket booth. The ballpark's all-time attendance record was set on August 18, 1982, when 22,315 people watched the Sounds defeat the <a href="Columbus%20Astros">Columbus Astros</a>, 3–0. Portions of the outfield had to be roped off to accommodate the crowd, which was far in excess of Greer's seating capacity.

From February through mid-summer 1984, major renovations and additions were made to the facility. A full-service restaurant, The Hall of Fame Stadium Club, and a mini-roof, to cover the last five rows of the reserved seating section and the main concourse, were built. A new press box included accommodations for additional members of the media, two separate booths for home and visiting radio broadcasts, and two separate booths for home and visiting television broadcasts. Ten <a href="luxury%20box">sky boxes</a> were built adjacent the press box; by 1989, the number of sky boxes had increased to 18.

In July 1984, Schmittou purchased the Triple-A <a href="Evansville%20Triplets">Evansville Triplets</a> of the <a href="American%20Association%20%2820th%20Century%29">American Association</a>. The team moved from <a href="Evansville%2C%20Indiana">Evansville</a> to Nashville for the 1985 season, upon which the Triplets' legacy was retired and the franchise adopted the Sounds' name and history, effectively elevating the organization from Double-A to Triple-A. The Double-A Southern League franchise was moved to <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville, Alabama</a>, where the team began play as the <a href="Huntsville%20Stars">Huntsville Stars</a> at the hastily constructed <a href="Joe%20W.%20Davis%20Stadium">Joe W. Davis Stadium</a>.

To prepare for the move to Triple-A, renovations continued prior to the 1985 season with the addition of 1,200 box seats, which replaced some of the reserved grandstand seating, as well as more seating past the right field foul pole. A 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3.0 m) high replaced the stadium's original, which was relocated to far left field to serve as an out-of-town scoreboard, providing scores for <a href="American%20League">American League</a>, <a href="National%20League">National League</a>, and American Association baseball games.

Schmittou's desire to land a Triple-A team was part of a larger plan to put Nashville in a position to contend for a <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> franchise in the future. Along with this goal, the need for more seating, and a desire to make Greer a more attractive ballpark, significant renovations began after the 1987 season. The number of box seats was increased by 40 percent, the clubhouse and umpire facilities were upgraded, and the dugouts were entirely rebuilt. The new dugouts took up slightly more room than the previous ones, resulting in a minor contraction of the field's dimensions: 327 feet (100 m) down the left and right field lines, 371 feet (113 m) to left and right-center fields, and 400 feet (120 m) to center field. The main concourse entrance was redesigned to incorporate the <a href="stonemasonry">stonemasonry</a> of the adjacent Fort Negley. This expansion brought Greer's total seating capacity up to 18,000.

In 1990, Major League Baseball (MLB) team owners met to demand that minor league owners improve their ballparks in order to meet their desired standards. Greer had already fallen behind other parks when it came to the quality of the field and clubhouse, and it also lacked a weight room and batting cages. Following a failed bid to secure an MLB team for Nashville in the <a href="1993%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20expansion">1993 Major League Baseball expansion</a> process (Nashville was one of ten cities considered, but was eliminated from contention very early in the process; the two new franchises were eventually awarded to <a href="Colorado%20Rockies">Denver</a> and <a href="Miami%20Marlins">Miami</a>), Schmittou focused on scaling-back his proposed MLB stadium into a new Triple-A facility for the Sounds. At a time when other Triple-A cities were building new, relatively luxurious ballparks, Schmittou was unable to convince mayor <a href="Phil%20Bredesen">Phil Bredesen</a> or the Metro Council to pay for such a new park. He considered moving the team to a surrounding county, and explored sites in <a href="La%20Vergne%2C%20Tennessee">La Vergne</a>, <a href="Cool%20Springs%2C%20Tennessee">Cool Springs</a>, and <a href="Mount%20Juliet%2C%20Tennessee">Mount Juliet</a>. He even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the Metro Council to pass a referendum to let taxpayers vote on a temporary tax increase to pay off a proposed $40 million stadium in three years. In the end, Schmittou elected to keep the Sounds at Greer but make significant improvements to the stadium.

Greer's distinctive <a href="guitar">guitar</a>-shaped <a href="scoreboard">scoreboard</a>, made by the Fair-Play company, was installed behind the left-center field wall prior to the 1993 season. Another addition in 1993 was that of a second team to play at Greer. From 1993 to 1994, the ballpark simultaneously served as the home field for the Sounds and the <a href="Nashville%20Xpress">Nashville Xpress</a>, the Double-A affiliate of the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a> which played in the Southern League. This came about when <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>, acquired a Triple-A expansion franchise in 1993, leaving the city's Double-A team, the <a href="Charlotte%20Knights">Charlotte Knights</a>, without a home. Schmittou offered Greer Stadium as a temporary home for the team. In order to accommodate another club at Greer, the Xpress scheduled its home games during the Sounds' road trips. This marked the first time that two minor league teams would operate in the same city since 1972, when the <a href="Charlotte%20Hornets%20%28baseball%29">Charlotte Hornets</a> and <a href="Charlotte%20Twins">Charlotte Twins</a> shared <a href="Calvin%20Griffith%20Park">Calvin Griffith Park</a>. 

The Xpress played their first home game at Greer on April 16, 1993, against the <a href="Orlando%20Cubs">Orlando Cubs</a>. Pitchers <a href="Todd%20Ritchie">Todd Ritchie</a>, <a href="Mike%20Misuraca">Mike Misuraca</a>, and Jason Klonoski limited Cubs hitters to five hits and no runs in the 4–0 shutout. Nashville's <a href="Brian%20Raabe">Brian Raabe</a> <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">doubled</a> in the second inning bringing home David Rivera and <a href="Rich%20Becker">Rich Becker</a> giving the Xpress all the runs they needed. The game was attended by just 1,715 people on a bitterly cold evening. In April 1994, <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>'s foray into professional baseball attracted 16,842 fans to Greer to see the Xpress face his team, the <a href="Birmingham%20Barons">Birmingham Barons</a>, for the first time that season. The Nashville Xpress played their last home game on September 1, 1994, against the Huntsville Stars. With Nashville holding a 1–0 lead going into the eighth inning, Huntsville scored three runs in both the eighth and ninth innings on the way to a 6–2 defeat of the home team. In 1995, the Xpress relocated to <a href="Wilmington%2C%20North%20Carolina">Wilmington, North Carolina</a>, and became the <a href="Port%20City%20Roosters">Port City Roosters</a>.

Over $200,000 was spent on renovations in the fall and winter before the 1995 season. The home clubhouse and weight room were remodeled, aisles behind the dugouts were resurfaced to reduce slippery areas, and the entire playing field was re-sodded. This was the first replacement and upgrading of the field since the original sod was laid in 1978. First, all of the old grass was stripped from the field. Then, the grounds crew installed a new drainage system. Four trenches were dug and laid with 2,500 feet (760 m) of drainage pipe to carry water away from the field and beyond the center field wall. A layer of gravel was laid over the pipe, and a 4-to-6-inch (10 to 15 cm) layer of sand was placed above the gravel. After raising the level of the infield dirt and brick <a href="warning%20track">warning track</a> to the same height of the new field, 100,000 square feet (9,300 m²) of Tifton 419 <a href="Cynodon">Bermuda Grass</a> was installed on the field and edged into a baseball diamond configuration.

The 1996 season marked the last that Schmittou was the team's president and part majority owner. With the city prepared to welcome a <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a> franchise, the <a href="Tennessee%20Titans">Tennessee Titans</a>, Schmittou felt that revenue would be drawn away from his baseball team, so he and businessman Walter Nipper sold their 59 percent stake in the Sounds to Chicago-based businessmen Al Gordon, Mike Murtaugh, and Mike Woleben. The new ownership group, operating as AmeriSports Companies LLC, refurbished every area of the stadium, including the concession stands, bathrooms, concourse, stadium exterior, home clubhouse (a visitor's clubhouse had been built under the third base bleachers for the 1996 season), and parking lots. Several sections of bleachers in left field past third base were removed and replaced by tents and a group picnic area. This reduced the seating capacity to 11,500.

Following the 1997 season, the American Association was dissolved, and the Sounds became members of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). As a result, Greer became the eastern-most stadium in PCL history behind the <a href="Indianapolis%20Indians">Indianapolis Indians</a>' <a href="Bush%20Stadium">Bush Stadium</a> when that team played in the PCL from 1964 to 1968. Greer was the eastern-most active PCL stadium from 1998 to 2014.

As consumer preferences changed and in an effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line in right field. A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot tub.

The aging Greer Stadium had never been meant to last longer than 30 years, and was the subject of many renovations in the early 2000s to meet minimum Triple-A standards. In 2003, the Sounds proposed a new stadium to be built with a mix of public and private funds at the corner of 1st Avenue South and Gateway Boulevard (now Korean Veterans Boulevard) in Downtown Nashville on the former site of the city's thermal transfer energy plant, targeting an opening date in April 2006. After two years of the Sounds lobbying for the new park and threatening to leave town (either for the suburbs or a new city altogether), Mayor <a href="Bill%20Purcell%20%28mayor%29">Bill Purcell</a> agreed to support preliminary plans for the stadium on October 25, 2005, and the Nashville Metro Council approved the new stadium on February 7, 2006, due in part to the Sounds securing construction financing through a consortium of banks, avoiding taxpayer expense. The facility was to be called <a href="First%20Tennessee%20Field">First Tennessee Field</a>. Opening day at the proposed venue was repeatedly pushed back, eventually to as late as April 2009. However, the Sounds and private developers Struever Brothers, Eccles, & Rouse were unable to finalize financing and design plans for the new stadium by the April 15, 2007, deadline set by the Metro Council. As a result, the First Tennessee Field construction project was canceled and the Sounds remained at Greer with an uncertain future.

Following the dissolution of the plans for the new ballpark, and prior to the 2008 season, more than $1 million in upgrades and repairs were made to Greer. The improvements, which included a new clubhouse for the Sounds and visiting teams beyond the center field wall, improved field lighting, and improvements to restrooms, walkways, and seating, were made in order to keep the stadium functional for another three to five years.

MFP Baseball, which purchased the Sounds in early 2009, invested over $2 million to make repairs and upgrades to the aging stadium's playing field, restrooms, concession stands, scoreboard, sound system, and seating. The infield was re-sodded and leveled, protective railing was installed along the edge of the field, and the backstop netting was replaced. The entire concourse and guitar scoreboard were repainted, broken seats were replaced, and the fourth-floor Sluggers Sports Bar & Grill was remodeled. A permanent concert stage and a family fun zone were constructed by the concourse entrance.

In 2011, MFP Baseball and the Mayor's Office began working toward a new stadium, with the city identifying three potential sites for construction, and recruiting stadium-builder <a href="Populous%20%28company%29">Populous</a> to study each. The three sites were an area on the north end of The Gulch, the state-owned parking lot on the site of Nashville's first ballpark (<a href="Sulphur%20Dell">Sulphur Dell</a>), and various areas directly adjacent to <a href="Nissan%20Stadium">Nissan Stadium</a> and the eastern terminus of the <a href="John%20Seigenthaler%20Pedestrian%20Bridge">John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge</a>. The Sounds still preferred the previous Thermal site due to its proximity to the city's entertainment and central business districts, but the city was not willing to make a second attempt at a stadium in that location (<a href="Ascend%20Amphitheater">Ascend Amphitheater</a> was eventually built there). Mayor <a href="Karl%20Dean">Karl Dean</a> preferred the Sulphur Dell site, in an attempt to bolster economic growth on downtown's sluggish North side, while incorporating the ballpark into the surrounding neighborhoods. In late summer 2013, the Sounds and the Nashville Metropolitan Government reached an agreement to build a new $37 million downtown ballpark at Sulphur Dell. Construction on <a href="First%20Tennessee%20Park">First Tennessee Park</a> began after necessary land-swaps with the State of Tennessee, and the new ballpark opened in time for the start of the 2015 season.

Knowing that the 2014 season would be the team's 37th and final campaign at the old ballpark, the Sounds launched the "Last Cheer at Greer", a season-long celebration of the stadium that included nods to its history and promotional giveaways to commemorate the closing. On August 27, 2014, the Sounds hosted their final game at Greer Stadium: an 8–5 loss to the <a href="Sacramento%20River%20Cats">Sacramento River Cats</a>. In his only plate appearance of the evening, Nashville catcher <a href="Lucas%20May">Lucas May</a> struck out swinging with a full count and the bases loaded to end the game. Announced attendance at the game was a standing-room-only crowd of 11,067, the first sellout since 2010, and the largest crowd since 2007.

After the Sounds' administrative offices were moved to First Tennessee Park in early 2015, Greer became essentially abandoned. Vandals peppered the site with graffiti, and many of the building's windows and box seats were damaged. The playing field became overgrown with brush, and photos of the stadium's interior began appearing on the websites and social media accounts of anonymous <a href="Urban%20exploration">urban explorers</a>.

Later that year, Mayor Dean expressed interest in converting the facility to a community sporting complex or a new city park, but, nearing the end of his term, ultimately deferred the decision to the next mayor (<a href="Megan%20Barry">Megan Barry</a>, elected 2015). In the meantime, Metropolitan Director of Parks Tommy Lynch recommended that the stadium be demolished due to the potential costs for any renovation, including the removal of <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a>. The department asked Mayor Barry for $800,000 to fund the demolition of the concourse and seating bowl so as to expand the green space at the property which could then be sold to private developers.

Proposed uses for the land included a <a href="Association%20football">soccer</a> stadium, an indoor <a href="tennis">tennis</a> facility for <a href="Belmont%20University">Belmont University</a>, public tennis courts, <a href="rodeo">rodeo</a> grounds, a <a href="Kroger">Kroger</a> grocery store, and a neighborhood park. In a letter to the editor of "<a href="The%20Tennessean">The Tennessean</a>", former Sounds President Larry Schmittou expressed his interest in Greer becoming an amateur baseball park, citing its amenities and several Metro high schools that lacked baseball diamonds of their own. Two public meetings were held in September 2016 to discuss these and other proposals and ideas for the space.

The city's goal was to create a mixed-use development with green space and affordable housing. By April 2017, a special committee had narrowed the search for a plan and site developer down to five proposals. In May 2017, the Barry administration selected a proposal called Cloud Hill by the Nashville-based Mathews Company and backed by music producer <a href="T%20Bone%20Burnett">T Bone Burnett</a>. The proposed redevelopment of the 21-acre site included music and art space, a community center, open park space, and affordable housing. The footprint of the baseball diamond and outfield would have been turned into the Great Lawn, a green space accommodating amateur baseball and soccer. Renderings showed the guitar scoreboard and a portion of the outfield wall intact. The plan, which awaited final approval by Metro Parks and the Metro Council, was met with concerns by citizens and groups whom preferred to see the property restored entirely to parkland and the site's Civil War history preserved. Other concerns were raised over the lack of transparency in the city's planning process and the privatization of publicly owned land. Cloud Hill's developers cancelled their plans in January 2018 after archaeologists determined that undisturbed areas on the edge of the Greer property, but not part of the stadium itself, were the unmarked burial sites of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slaves</a> forced to build Fort Negley. Mayor Barry expressed her desire that the site honor the history of those who died building the fort.

Following Barry's resignation in March 2018, acting Mayor <a href="David%20Briley">David Briley</a> proposed the demolition of Greer Stadium, which would reincorporate the site into Fort Negley Park. He has sought Metro Council approval for the approximately $1 million needed to demolish the stadium, which would then be seeded over with grass. The Metro Historical Commission has been tasked with determining a plan to convert the site into one which will honor its Civil War history. The city has sought a firm to demolish the stadium. , Greer is still standing, but the city expects demolition to begin in early 2019.

The Southern League All-Star Game was held twice at Greer Stadium, first in 1979 and again in 1983. The July 12, 1979, contest pitted a team of the league's All-Stars against the major league <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>. In the third inning, Braves pitcher <a href="Preston%20Hanna">Preston Hanna</a> was taken deep for a <a href="home%20run">home run</a> by <a href="Columbus%20Astros">Columbus</a> outfielder <a href="Danny%20Heep">Danny Heep</a>, and Nashville's <a href="Duane%20Walker">Duane Walker</a> added a run with his RBI single, scoring Memphis second baseman <a href="Tim%20Raines">Tim Raines</a> from third. Up 2–0, the All-Stars never trailed. The All-Stars went on to defeat the Braves, 5–2, before a crowd of 11,079 fans. <a href="Charlotte%20O%27s">Charlotte</a> pitcher Larry Jones was the winning pitcher. Walker, who in addition to his run-scoring base hit, also drew a <a href="base%20on%20balls">walk</a>, <a href="stolen%20base">stole two bases</a>, and completed a <a href="double%20play">double play</a> from third base, was selected as the game's <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> (MVP). Nashville was further represented on the All-Star squad by <a href="Geoff%20Combe">Geoff Combe</a>, <a href="Paul%20Householder">Paul Householder</a>, <a href="Dave%20Van%20Gorder">Dave Van Gorder</a>, and manager <a href="George%20Scherger">George Scherger</a> who coached the team.

The midseason exhibition returned to Nashville on June 19, 1983. This time, the Sounds were enlisted to serve as the All-Stars' competition. Consequently, no Sounds player could be voted on to All-Star team. In lieu of this, the league chose to recognize all Sounds players as All-Stars. MLB Commissioner <a href="Bowie%20Kuhn">Bowie Kuhn</a> was on hand to toss out the first pitch before an audience of 1,221 who had waited out nearly an hour's rain delay. The All-Stars scored three runs in the sixth inning, including a two-run homer by Birmingham's George Foussianes, the game's eventual MVP. After rallying back with two runs on <a href="Scott%20Bradley%20%28baseball%29">Scott Bradley</a>'s dual RBI single in the eighth, Nashville's Erik Peterson stuck out in the ninth with the tying and winning runs on base to end the game. The league's team had bested Nashville, 3–2. <a href="Jacksonville%20Suns">Jacksonville</a>'s <a href="Mark%20Gubicza">Mark Gubicza</a> earned the win.

Greer played host to the <a href="Triple-A%20All-Star%20Game">Triple-A All-Star Game</a> on July 13, 1994, with a crowd of 11,601 on hand in addition to live television and radio audiences. Players from all three Triple-A leagues (the American Association, Pacific Coast League, and <a href="International%20League">International League</a>) were divided into two teams, American and National, based on their MLB parent club's affiliation. Despite an early American League lead, the Nationals came back to score the winning run in the fifth inning when <a href="Tucson%20Toros">Tucson</a>'s <a href="Brian%20Hunter%20%28outfielder%29">Brian Hunter</a> came home on a <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a>. The Nationals won by a final score of 8–5. The "Star of Stars", or MVP, for the American Association was Nashville's <a href="Ray%20Durham">Ray Durham</a> who had three hits and scored the game's first run. <a href="Luis%20Lopez%20%28catcher%29">Luis Lopez</a> of the <a href="Richmond%20Braves">Richmond Braves</a> was the International League's MVP for his three-hit, two-RBI night; <a href="Paul%20Faries">Paul Faries</a>, of the <a href="Phoenix%20Firebirds">Phoenix Firebirds</a>, was the PCL's MVP with one hit and two RBI.

Other All-Star festivities included a Hollywood All-Star Game featuring celebrities <a href="Fred%20Willard">Fred Willard</a>, <a href="Jason%20Bateman">Jason Bateman</a>, <a href="Barry%20Bostwick">Barry Bostwick</a>, <a href="Treat%20Williams">Treat Williams</a>, and <a href="Kristoff%20St.%20John">Kristoff St. John</a>. There was also a <a href="Triple-A%20Home%20Run%20Derby">Home Run Derby</a> with four of Triple-A's top home run hitters: <a href="Scott%20Coolbaugh">Scott Coolbaugh</a> of the <a href="Louisville%20Redbirds">Louisville Redbirds</a>, <a href="Rich%20Aude">Rich Aude</a> of the <a href="Buffalo%20Bisons">Buffalo Bisons</a>, <a href="Dwayne%20Hosey">Dwayne Hosey</a> of the <a href="Omaha%20Royals">Omaha Royals</a>, and Drew Denson of the Sounds. Each batter being given ten swings each to hit as many home runs as possible, Coolbaugh and Denson advanced to the finals with two homers apiece. In the final round, Coolbaugh won the derby by hitting six home runs in his ten swings.

Greer hosted 18 major league exhibition games in the 1980s and 1990s. Five were competitions between the Nashville Sounds and their MLB parent clubs, while the other thirteen were <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> games between major league clubs.

The first such game occurred on April 16, 1981, when the <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> made a stop in Nashville to play an exhibition game against their Double-A Sounds. The 10–1 Yankees victory was played in front of a standing-room only crowd of 17,318 spectators. Some Yankees present at the game included owner <a href="George%20Steinbrenner">George Steinbrenner</a>, coach <a href="Yogi%20Berra">Yogi Berra</a>, and players <a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a>, <a href="Bucky%20Dent">Bucky Dent</a>, <a href="Lou%20Piniella">Lou Piniella</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Murcer">Bobby Murcer</a>, <a href="Goose%20Gossage">Goose Gossage</a>, <a href="Tommy%20John">Tommy John</a>, and <a href="Johnny%20Oates">Johnny Oates</a>. The Yankees returned for another game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. Former Sound <a href="Don%20Mattingly">Don Mattingly</a>, as well as Yankees manager <a href="Billy%20Martin">Billy Martin</a> and players <a href="Ken%20Griffey%20Sr">Ken Griffey Sr</a> and Goose Gossage were in attendance. The Sounds, who trailed the Yankees, 4–0, going into the bottom of the ninth inning, scored five runs to beat the Yankees, 5–4, before a crowd of 13,641. The tying and winning runs came off the bat of catcher Frank Kneuer who, with two outs, doubled down the left filed line bringing home Matt Gallegos and Derwin McNealy from second and first.

On April 12, 1985, Nashville competed in an exhibition game against their major league affiliate, the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>. Manager <a href="Sparky%20Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a>'s Detroit club included <a href="Kirk%20Gibson">Kirk Gibson</a>, <a href="Alan%20Trammell">Alan Trammell</a>, <a href="Lou%20Whitaker">Lou Whitaker</a>, <a href="Rusty%20Kuntz">Rusty Kuntz</a>, <a href="Milt%20Wilcox">Milt Wilcox</a>, and <a href="Larry%20Herndon">Larry Herndon</a>. Trailing 2–0 after the first inning, Detroit scored three runs in the top of the fifth on a trio of Sounds errors and a single, but Nashville tied the game with a Pedro Chavez RBI double in the bottom half. In the end, the Tigers outlasted the Sounds, scoring six runs in the tenth inning to defeat Nashville, 9–3, before a crowd of 16,182. On April 23, 1990, 14,012 fans attended an exhibition game at Greer between Nashville and their new affiliate, the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>. Reds pitchers <a href="Danny%20Jackson">Danny Jackson</a> and <a href="Ron%20Robinson%20%28baseball%29">Ron Robinson</a> held the Sounds to just five hits, three by <a href="Terry%20McGriff">Terry McGriff</a> and two by <a href="Keith%20Lockhart%20%28baseball%29">Keith Lockhart</a>. <a href="Luis%20Qui%C3%B1ones">Luis Quiñones</a> scored the winning run in the first when he came home on a misplayed ball hit on the ground by <a href="Paul%20O%27Neill%20%28baseball%29">Paul O'Neill</a>. <a href="Lou%20Piniella">Lou Piniella</a>'s Cincinnati squad shutout Nashville, 3–0. An April 3, 1994, game was scheduled between the Sounds and <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>, but cancelled due to wet grounds and the fear of player injury, especially to top White Sox stars <a href="Tim%20Raines">Tim Raines</a> and <a href="Ozzie%20Guill%C3%A9n">Ozzie Guillén</a> who were slotted to play.

In March 1996, Greer hosted eight major league teams competing in seven games across the span of four days in what was billed as the Nashville Baseball Classic. The <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a>, <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>, <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a>, <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a>, <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>, and <a href="Texas%20Rangers%20%28baseball%29">Texas Rangers</a> all visited Nashville as they prepared for the 1996 season. The Sounds played an exhibition game against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> on June 3, 1999, attended by 5,720 fans. Nine home runs were hit in the game which was dominated by offence. The Pirates, whose roster included <a href="Jason%20Kendall">Jason Kendall</a>, <a href="Emil%20Brown">Emil Brown</a>, and <a href="Dale%20Sveum">Dale Sveum</a>, plated 13 runs in the fifth inning on the way to 16–15 win. 

Greer Stadium was the setting for eight <a href="no-hitter">no-hit game</a>s, including one <a href="perfect%20game%20%28baseball%29">perfect game</a>. The first took place on May 16, 1981, when <a href="Jeff%20Cornell">Jeff Cornell</a>, of the visiting <a href="Jacksonville%20Suns">Jacksonville Suns</a>, pitched a 4–0 no-hitter game against the Sounds. The second no-hitter at Greer was <a href="Jim%20Deshaies">Jim Deshaies</a>' 5–1 win over the <a href="Columbus%20Astros">Columbus Astros</a> on May 4, 1984. In the second inning, Deshaies <a href="base%20on%20balls">walked</a> three batters and <a href="hit%20by%20pitch">hit</a> another, accounting for the only Astros <a href="run%20%28baseball%29">run</a> of the game, part of a seven-inning <a href="doubleheader%20%28baseball%29">doubleheader</a>. The third, a 6–0 win over the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%2089ers">Oklahoma City 89ers</a>, was thrown by Nashville's <a href="Bryan%20Kelly%20%28baseball%29">Bryan Kelly</a> on July 17, 1985. Kelly allowed just one <a href="baserunner">baserunner</a> via a walk in the near-perfect game.

In a rare occurrence, the Sounds and the <a href="Indianapolis%20Indians">Indianapolis Indians</a> exchanged no-hitters on back-to-back nights on August 6 and 7, 1988. First, Indianapolis' <a href="Randy%20Johnson">Randy Johnson</a> and <a href="Pat%20Pacillo">Pat Pacillo</a> combined for a no-hit loss against the Sounds, a 1–0 Nashville win. Nashville won when <a href="Lenny%20Harris">Lenny Harris</a> walked to first base, <a href="Stolen%20base">stole</a> second base and third base, and then came home, scoring on a <a href="out%20%28baseball%29">groundout</a>. The next night, Nashville's <a href="Jack%20Armstrong%20%28baseball%29">Jack Armstrong</a> registered a no-hit game against the Indians, a 4–0 Sounds victory. This was the only time in American Association history that teams played in back-to-back no-hit games.

On April 7, 2003, <a href="John%20Wasdin">John Wasdin</a> tossed a perfect game at Greer in a 4–0 win over the <a href="Albuquerque%20Isotopes">Albuquerque Isotopes</a>. This was just the second nine-inning perfect <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a> in the 100-year history of the Pacific Coast League. Wasdin threw 100 pitches, <a href="strikeout">striking out</a> 15 batters. Later in the year, on August 2, <a href="Colorado%20Springs%20Sky%20Sox">Colorado Springs Sky Sox</a> pitchers <a href="Chris%20Gissell">Chris Gissell</a> (7 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings pitched</a> (IP)) and <a href="Jes%C3%BAs%20S%C3%A1nchez%20%28baseball%29">Jesús Sánchez</a> (2 IP) combined for a no-hit 3–0 win against the Sounds. The final no-hit effort at Greer took place on July 15, 2006, when Nashville pitchers <a href="Carlos%20Villanueva%20%28baseball%29">Carlos Villanueva</a> (6 IP), <a href="Mike%20Meyers%20%28pitcher%29">Mike Meyers</a> (2 IP), and Alec Zumwalt (1 IP) combined on a 2–0 win over the <a href="Memphis%20Redbirds">Memphis Redbirds</a>.

On May 5–6, 2006, Greer was the site of a game which tied the record for the longest game, in terms of innings played, in Pacific Coast League history. The Sounds and the <a href="New%20Orleans%20Zephyrs">New Orleans Zephyrs</a> competed in a 24-inning game, played over the course of two days, which lasted a total of eight hours and seven minutes. New Orleans defeated Nashville, 5–4. The record was originally set on June 8, 1909, in a game between the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Seals%20%28baseball%29">San Francisco Seals</a> and <a href="Oakland%20Oaks%20%28PCL%29">Oakland Oaks</a>. A few years later, on September 10, 1911, the record was tied by the <a href="Sacramento%20Solons">Sacramento Solons</a> and <a href="Portland%20Beavers">Portland Beavers</a>. The Sounds and Zephyrs set the PCL records for the most pitchers used in one game by both clubs (17), and tied the record for the most players used by both clubs (40). They set the records for the most strikeouts, batting and pitching, in a game by both clubs (48), the most <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>s by both teams (166), and the most <a href="assist%20%28baseball%29">assists</a> by both teams (53). The Sounds tied the records for the most pitchers used by one team (9) and the most assists by a single team (28).

In 1979 and 1980, Greer Stadium was the home of the <a href="NAIA%20World%20Series">National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) World Series</a>. The <a href="Lipscomb%20Bisons">Lipscomb Bisons</a> of Nashville's <a href="Lipscomb%20University">Lipscomb University</a> won the 1979 series, and the <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20Antelopes%20baseball">Grand Canyon Antelopes</a> of <a href="Grand%20Canyon%20University">Grand Canyon University</a> won in 1980. Until the 2011 opening of <a href="E.%20S.%20Rose%20Park">E. S. Rose Park</a>, the <a href="Belmont%20Bruins%20baseball">Belmont Bruins baseball</a> team played the majority of its season at Greer.

In the early 1980s, Greer served as the home field for the <a href="Father%20Ryan%20High%20School">Father Ryan High School</a> <a href="American%20football">football</a> team. Father Ryan returned to playing at Greer from 2006 through 2008, before moving to a new school athletic complex for the 2009 season. In the football configuration, the field ran along the first base line.

Greer was the site of the <a href="City%20of%20Hope%20National%20Medical%20Center">City of Hope</a> Celebrity <a href="Softball">Softball</a> Challenge from 1991 to 2014. Two teams of country music stars participated in the game, from which proceeds went toward the research and treatment of cancer and other life-threatening diseases. Participants included <a href="Vince%20Gill">Vince Gill</a>, <a href="Carrie%20Underwood">Carrie Underwood</a>, <a href="Brad%20Paisley">Brad Paisley</a>, <a href="Billy%20Ray%20Cyrus">Billy Ray Cyrus</a>, <a href="Sara%20Evans">Sara Evans</a>, <a href="Montgomery%20Gentry">Montgomery Gentry</a>, and <a href="Phil%20Vassar">Phil Vassar</a>. Through the 2008 event, more than $1.5 million had been raised. In 2015, the game relocated to <a href="First%20Tennessee%20Park">First Tennessee Park</a>.

From 2001 to 2011, Greer was home to the <a href="Jeff%20Fisher">Jeff Fisher</a> & Friends Charity Softball Game. Then-<a href="Tennessee%20Titans">Tennessee Titans</a> <a href="head%20coach">head coach</a> Jeff Fisher and players from the team, past and present, competed in order to benefit local charities. Titans participants included <a href="Vince%20Young">Vince Young</a>, <a href="Steve%20McNair">Steve McNair</a>, <a href="Eddie%20George">Eddie George</a>, <a href="Frank%20Wycheck">Frank Wycheck</a>, <a href="Rob%20Bironas">Rob Bironas</a>, and <a href="Keith%20Bulluck">Keith Bulluck</a>, among others. <a href="Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Vokoun">Tomáš Vokoun</a> and head coach <a href="Barry%20Trotz">Barry Trotz</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a>'s <a href="Nashville%20Predators">Nashville Predators</a> also took part.

<a href="The%20Oak%20Ridge%20Boys">The Oak Ridge Boys</a>, including Sounds' minority shareholder <a href="Richard%20Sterban">Richard Sterban</a>, were photographed standing in the seats along Greer's left field line for the cover of their 1989 album, "<a href="American%20Dreams%20%28The%20Oak%20Ridge%20Boys%20album%29">American Dreams</a>". In 2002, the music video for <a href="Steve%20Earle">Steve Earle</a>'s "Some Dreams", a song featured in the motion picture "<a href="The%20Rookie%20%282002%20film%29">The Rookie</a>", was filmed at Greer. The video, intercut with clips from the film, shows Earle and his band performing the song on the empty ballpark's field.

Greer's distinctive <a href="guitar">guitar</a>-shaped <a href="scoreboard">scoreboard</a> was manufactured by the Fairtron Corporation and installed by the Joslin Sign Company prior to the 1993 season at a cost of $400,000. It was originally conceived as the centerpiece for a proposed major league ballpark in Nashville sought after by owner Larry Schmittou as a part of the <a href="1993%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20expansion">1993 Major League Baseball expansion</a>. Originally painted blue with red and white trim to match the Nashville Sounds' color scheme, it was repainted black with red, yellow, and white trim to match their then-current color scheme in 2008, and is located behind the outfield wall in left-center field.

The entire scoreboard measures 115.6 feet (35.2 m) across, 53 feet (16 m) high, and 2 feet (0.61 m) deep. Individual components of the guitar are as follows: 60-foot (18 m) <a href="sound%20box">body</a>, 36-foot (11 m) <a href="Neck%20%28music%29">neck</a>, and 19.6-foot (6.0 m) <a href="machine%20head">tuning key</a> section. It is installed approximately 80 feet (24 m) above the ground. It takes 243,155 <a href="watt">watt</a>s to power its 8,179 total lamps, which are connected to 64,169 feet (19,559 m) of wire. The entire display weighs 35,825 pounds (16,250 kg).

The <a href="Box%20score%20%28baseball%29">line score</a> was displayed on the guitar's neck, while the <a href="strike%20zone">ball</a>/<a href="strike%20zone">strike</a>/<a href="out%20%28baseball%29">out</a> count, the batter's uniform number, and the <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hit</a>/<a href="error%20%28baseball%29">error</a> indicator are all situated on the <a href="headstock">headstock</a>. Six small advertising signs represent the tuning keys. The body of the guitar features only an <a href="Light-emitting%20diode">LED</a> display board for displaying messages. Initially, the scoreboard featured two matrix message boards: a low-resolution <a href="RGB%20color%20model">RGB</a> color board on the left which featured advertising and animations, and a white-light monochromatic board on the right, which primarily featured statistical information and other text-based messages. The monochrome board was replaced by an orange-tinted LED display board in 2009 which served both purposes, while the color board was deactivated and covered with advertising signage. The scoreboard has never had the ability to display video or any kind of high-resolution images. Between the two boards are an analog clock and a temperature display. As of 2014, the temperature display was no longer active. Surrounding the boards are four large spaces for advertising; the two on top are static, and the two on bottom rotate between three images each (the rotating spaces were covered with static signage beginning in 2009). High-tension nets cover the electronic sections to protect them from home run balls. Above the board is a circular advertising space. This sign originally displayed the team's guitar-swinger logo, and at times has displayed other Sounds logos. Originally, when a home run was hit, the guitar-swinger logo would light up and perimeter lights around the entire scoreboard would begin flashing; it was also capable of shooting <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a> after each Sounds home run. By the mid-2000s, the scoreboard had fallen into a state of disrepair and obsolescence, and was only marginally functional. Many of the lights were no longer able to be lit, and replacement parts were becoming hard to find. When MFP Baseball purchased the team in late 2008, the organization made minor renovations to the scoreboard, rendering it once again fully functional, although not to its original specifications. It was also repainted black, red, yellow, and white over its original red, white, and blue color scheme to reflect the team's present colors at the time. By 2013, due to leaks in its exterior, the scoreboard's functionality could be crippled for a period of time following a rainstorm, rendering many of its electronic features dark.

Greer's guitar scoreboard was not moved to First Tennessee Park when the Sounds moved in 2015, and remains standing as of February 2019. The Sounds organization installed a modern version at the new venue, capable of displaying high-definition video. The first design renderings of First Tennessee Park did not feature a guitar scoreboard. On April 22, 2014, at the announcement of First Tennessee's naming rights agreement, Sounds owner Frank Ward told "The Tennessean": "The guitar scoreboard at Greer is staying at Greer. At some point in time we will share what our new scoreboard will look like, but it's too early in the process. We're trying to figure it out as we speak." Two months later, on June 20, 2014, Ward announced that a new guitar scoreboard would indeed be constructed, citing overwhelming demand from the community.

Before the installation of the guitar, Greer's original scoreboard was a black, non-descript, rectangular unit with a 2-line reader panel. In 1985, it was moved to beside the left field foul pole to make room for a new rectangular 4-line scoreboard 10 feet (3 m) high with a fully animated reader panel. The original unit was then used as an out-of-town scoreboard, displaying the scores of other baseball games. When the guitar display was installed in 1993, the original scoreboard was removed and replaced by the second scoreboard, which became the new out-of-town board. From 2008 to 2014, the out-of-town scoreboard was not used to display scores; instead it was used only as a support for additional advertising signage.

Seating at the ballpark included fixed stadium seats, general admission <a href="bleacher">bleacher</a>s, some with contoured seats, and eighteen <a href="luxury%20box">skyboxes</a> located on the third floor. As of 2014, total seating capacity was 10,300. Games could be watched from one of four picnic areas—one behind home plate, one on the third base line, one in the third base stands, and one beyond the right field wall. A rentable hot tub deck was located in the right field corner. There was a concert stage and family fun zone located on The Plaza inside the concourse entrance.

Several concession stands and cart vendors were located on the concourse. A full-service restaurant known as Sluggers Sports Bar and Grill, constructed in 1984 as The Hall of Fame Stadium Club, was located on the fourth floor. The restaurant and bar was open during all Sounds home dates, and games could be viewed from the restaurant via windows overlooking the field.

Jennings Trophy</a> along with teammate <a href="Corey%20Crawford">Corey Crawford</a>, awarded to the goaltender or goaltenders who give up the fewest goals in the season. Emery finished the 2012–13 season with a 1.94 <a href="goals%20against%20average">goals against average</a> and a 0.922 <a href="save%20percentage">save percentage</a>. His 17 wins included 12 straight to start the year, the best such streak in NHL history. Emery was a two-time <a href="Bill%20Masterton%20Memorial%20Trophy">Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy</a> finalist for his dedication and perseverance. His teammates and fans often referred to him as "Razor" or "Sugar Ray" for his aggressive playing style.

Raymond Robert Emery was born September 28, 1982 to Sharlene and Paul Emery. He was the eldest of three sons. He was born in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, and grew up in small town <a href="Cayuga%2C%20Ontario">Cayuga, Ontario</a>, in a century-old farmhouse. Emery excelled in school, and was offered a scholarship. He played many sports other than ice hockey, including golf, baseball, and soccer. In hockey, he originally played <a href="Defenceman">defense</a>, but switched to goaltender at nine years old due to a shortage of goaltenders in his league.

Emery committed to hockey on the advice of his mother, after a potential scholarship during his pursuit for higher education pushed him to take advantage of his natural ability. At 16 years old, Emery landed with the <a href="Ontario%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">Ontario Junior Hockey League</a> Junior C Dunnville Terriers after unsuccessfully trying out for eight different junior teams. Emery was named the league's Rookie of the Year.

The <a href="Ontario%20Hockey%20League">Ontario Hockey League</a> (OHL)'s <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20Greyhounds">Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds</a> drafted Emery in the fifth round of the 1999 OHL Draft. Emery split the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20OHL%20season">1999–2000 season</a> between the Welland Cougars of the OHA and the Greyhounds in the OHL. In <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20OHL%20season">2000–01</a>, he played with the Greyhounds. During his last season in junior hockey, 2001–02, Emery gained notoriety for his fighting ability. He was named the OHL's Goaltender of the Year, setting a record of 33 wins and a <a href="Goals%20against%20average">GAA</a> of 2.73.

Emery was selected in the fourth round, 99th overall by the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a> in the <a href="2001%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2001 NHL Entry Draft</a>. In <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20AHL%20season">2002–03</a>, Emery joined the <a href="Binghamton%20Senators">Binghamton Senators</a> of the <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> (AHL) and immediately assumed the position of starting goaltender for his first professional season with the team. He was named to the AHL All-Star team, made the league's all-rookie team and became Binghamton's MVP.

Emery was suspended twice for on-ice incidents the same season, once for bumping a referee which resulted in a three-game suspension; the second time for an altercation with <a href="Denis%20Hamel">Denis Hamel</a> of the <a href="Rochester%20Americans">Rochester Americans</a> who admitted to uttering a <a href="pejorative">racial slur</a>. Emery retaliated and was suspended for three games. Emery and Hamel later became teammates in Binghamton, and Hamel apologized "for not thinking about what was saying, in the heat of a game".

With the Ottawa Senators, Emery began his NHL career in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20NHL%20season">2005–06</a> by setting a record for wins to start a career, winning his first 9 games, moving ahead of <a href="Bob%20Froese">Bob Froese</a>, who started the <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20NHL%20season">1982–83 season</a> with eight wins while playing for the <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a>. In March of the same season, Emery won 12 games, tying <a href="Bernie%20Parent">Bernie Parent</a>'s 1974 record for the most wins in a month.

At the beginning of the 2005–06 season, Emery had won nine straight games during the regular season as the back-up to <a href="Dominik%20Ha%C5%A1ek">Dominik Hašek</a>. When Hašek injured his groin during the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics%20%E2%80%93%20Men%27s%20tournament">2006 Winter Olympics</a>, Emery became Ottawa's de facto starter, with <a href="Mike%20Morrison%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Mike Morrison</a>, claimed off of <a href="waivers%20%28NHL%29">waivers</a> from the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>, as Emery's <a href="Back-up%20goaltender">backup</a>. Emery was the starting goaltender for the rest of the season, leading the Senators to the second round of the <a href="2006%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2006 Stanley Cup playoffs</a>.

After the 2005–06 season, the Senators opted not to bring back Hašek, instead acquiring <a href="Martin%20Gerber">Martin Gerber</a> to compete with Emery for the starter position. Gerber was the starter at the beginning of the season, but due to his poor play, Emery replaced him in mid-November. On February 10, 2007, Emery was suspended for three games from the NHL for striking <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> forward <a href="Maxim%20Lapierre">Maxim Lapierre</a> in the face with his stick after Lapierre crashed into Emery's net.

Twelve days later, after his suspension had ended, Emery was involved in a mêlée between the Senators and the <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a>. He and Sabres goaltender <a href="Martin%20Biron">Martin Biron</a> left their creases to fight each other. After the first fight was finished, Sabres <a href="Enforcer%20%28ice%20hockey%29">enforcer</a> <a href="Andrew%20Peters">Andrew Peters</a> grabbed Emery and a second fight ensued. Both goaltenders received game misconducts, and Emery had the rare feat (for a goaltender) of receiving two five-minute majors for fighting in the same incident. In total, Emery received 22 penalty minutes (two five-minute majors for fighting, a two-minute minor for leaving the crease and the 10-minute game misconduct) for this altercation. After the altercation, fans and media dubbed him "Sugar Ray" in reference to retired boxer <a href="Sugar%20Ray%20Robinson">Sugar Ray Robinson</a> and Emery's reputation as a fighter. Then-teammate <a href="Brian%20McGrattan">Brian McGrattan</a> opined that if Emery were a position player and not a goalie, he would likely rank among the top five fighters in the NHL.

Prior to the <a href="2007%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2007 playoffs</a>, Emery and the Senators won 5–2 against Montreal on March 30, 2007, which was his 100th NHL game. Emery's strong play in the season continued in the playoffs, as the Senators defeated the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>, <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> and <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a> each in five-game series en route to their first <a href="2007%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Final</a> appearance since the team was founded in 1992, where the Senators ultimately lost to the <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Anaheim Ducks</a> in five games. He became a restricted free agent after the end of the season and filed for salary arbitration, later agreeing to a three-year deal with the Senators worth $9.5 million before the hearings were held.
By the pre-season of the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">2007–08 campaign</a>, Emery had suffered a wrist injury that limited him to just 40 minutes of the pre-season and forced him to miss several games early in the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20Ottawa%20Senators%20season">Senators' season</a>. On April 18, 2008, Murray announced to the media in an end-of-season press conference that Emery would not return to the Senators for the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season">2008–09 season</a>. On June 20, 2008, Emery was waived by the Senators; he cleared waivers three days later and became a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> as a result.

Emery signed a one-year, $2 million contract with <a href="Atlant%20Moscow%20Oblast">Atlant Moscow Oblast</a> of the newly formed <a href="Kontinental%20Hockey%20League">Kontinental Hockey League</a> (KHL) on July 9, 2008. After giving up five goals during a game, he chased a trainer who attempted to put a sponsored cap on Emery's head. As a foreign goaltender, Emery was only allowed to play in 65% of his team's 56 regular season games due to rules that encourage the development of Russian goaltenders. He split duties for the season with former <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> goaltender <a href="Vitaly%20Kolesnik">Vitaly Kolesnik</a> and completed the season as a top goaltender in the KHL with a .926 save percentage & 1.86 GAA.

On June 10, 2009, the Philadelphia Flyers announced that they had agreed to terms with Emery on a one-year contract worth $1.5 million. On December 8, Emery was placed on injured reserve to have surgery on a torn muscle in his abdomen. Originally expected to miss about six weeks, the prognosis changed when it was discovered that he had <a href="avascular%20necrosis">avascular necrosis</a>. In March 2010, Flyers general manager <a href="Paul%20Holmgren">Paul Holmgren</a> announced that Emery would be out for the remainder of the season due to the diagnosis and that a bone graft would be done to alleviate his hip issues.

Doctors were able to catch the disease early on before it spread, unlike the case of baseball and American football player <a href="Bo%20Jackson">Bo Jackson</a>. As a result, in April, doctors announced an extremely successful surgery. Jackson spoke out about Emery, speculating that they were the only two athletes to come back after the disease. Jackson added, "I take my hat off [to him]. I want him to know I am in his corner. It's a lot of hard work. To come back and play, it takes a very, very special and driven person. He's got a different makeup to want to do all the little things he needs to compete on a professional level." Unlike Jackson, who required numerous hip replacements, Emery had the benefit of advancements in modern medicine, undergoing a very specialized and complex procedure that involved removing 13 centimetres from his right fibula, and then grafting it to the femur to re-introduce a proper blood supply to the area. Holmgren said that while the surgery went better than expected, he did not know exactly how long Emery's recovery would take.

On July 1, Emery became an unrestricted free agent as his injury deemed him unable to play until he recuperated. In August, he was given the go-ahead to begin the grueling and tedious workout and rehabilitation process. In November 2010, <a href="The%20Sports%20Network">TSN</a> visited Emery during an on-ice workout and were surprised to see him get down into the <a href="butterfly%20%28ice%20hockey%29">butterfly</a> position and play for the first time since surgery. Emery stated that he did not "care if [he could] walk in seven years", and he "just [wanted] to play". To the surprise of his doctors and trainers, Emery has been doing better than expected. In January 2011, Emery began skating with an OHL team, taking shots and training with <a href="Eric%20Lindros">Eric Lindros</a>, and working with personal trainer Matt Nichol and goalie coach Eli Wilson. According to Wilson, Emery was "as sharp and ready now as he was the summer before Ottawa's Stanley Cup Final run".

In March 2011, Emery's injury and undefeated return to the NHL with the Anaheim Ducks garnered much media attention and fascination, with a special segment featured on <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">CBC</a>'s "<a href="Hockey%20Night%20in%20Canada">Hockey Night in Canada</a>". Emery had 13 centimetres of bone missing from his leg. This later garnered him a nomination for the <a href="Bill%20Masterton%20Memorial%20Trophy">Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy</a>.

On February 7, 2011, four NHL teams showed interest in signing Emery before he signed a one-year, <a href="two-way%20contract">two-way contract</a> with the Anaheim Ducks. He was then assigned to the <a href="Syracuse%20Crunch">Syracuse Crunch</a> to begin the standard two-week conditioning AHL stint where he went on to play a total of five games for the Crunch in their 2010–11 season, posting a 4–1–0 record, 1.98 GAA and .943 save percentage. On February 23, 2011, upon completion of his conditioning stint, Emery was called up to the Ducks. Emery made his Ducks debut on March 11, 2011, to a standing ovation against the <a href="Arizona%20Coyotes">Phoenix Coyotes</a> when he replaced goaltender <a href="Dan%20Ellis">Dan Ellis</a>, making it his first NHL appearance since he last played in March 2010 with the Flyers. Emery went on to win six straight starts to open his Anaheim career, falling one shy of matching the Ducks record for consecutive wins by a goaltender, held by <a href="Guy%20Hebert">Guy Hebert</a>. In the week of March 14, Emery was honoured with the NHL's Second Star of the Week after going 2–0–0 with a 0.99 GAA and .968 save percentage.

Emery led the Ducks into the playoffs, finishing tied for fourth in the league and posting a 7–2–0 record with 2.28 GAA and .926 save percentage in 10 regular season NHL appearances. In April, Emery's comeback was recognized when the Anaheim chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association (PHWA) named Emery as their nominee for the 2011 Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. The NHL also nominated Emery for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, making him one of three finalists.

On October 3, 2011 Emery signed a one-year contract for the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20NHL%20season">2011–12 season</a> with the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> after a successful try-out. By the end of the season, Emery compiled a 15–9–4 record and 2.81 GAA in 34 regular-season appearances, posting a 10–0–3 record and 2.15 GAA in 16 appearances at Chicago's <a href="United%20Center">United Center</a>. Emery was again nominated, this time by the Blackhawks, for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy, honouring dedication and perseverance. In April 2012, the Blackhawks signed Emery to a one-year extension worth $1.15 million to keep him with the team into the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20NHL%20season">2012–13 season</a>.

Emery made NHL history in March 2013 by becoming the first goaltender to ever start a season with 10 straight wins, going 10–0–0. He improved his NHL record to 11 straight wins against the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> on March 18. Emery went to 12–0–0 in a shutout win against the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a>, in his 200th NHL start. On April 10, he made franchise history by recording his third shutout in five games, helping him to be third in the NHL with a 1.90 GAA and seventh in save percentage at .924 with a 15–1–0 record. Emery proved his previous injuries were no longer a concern, posting career highs.
In April 2013, Emery and teammate <a href="Corey%20Crawford">Corey Crawford</a> won the award for the NHL's best combined GAA, the 2013 <a href="William%20M.%20Jennings%20Trophy">William M. Jennings Trophy</a>, awarded to the goaltender who gives up the fewest goals in the season. Emery finished the season with a 1.94 GAA, .922 save percentage, and 17 wins. He won his first <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> when the Blackhawks defeated the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> in the <a href="2013%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">2013 Stanley Cup Finals</a>.

On July 5, 2013, Emery signed a one-year deal with the Philadelphia Flyers worth $1.65 million. With the Flyers, Emery served as the backup to regular goaltender <a href="Steve%20Mason%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Steve Mason</a>. On November 1, Emery participated in a brawl against the Capitals, sucker-punching opposing goaltender <a href="Braden%20Holtby">Braden Holtby</a>, who was uninterested in fighting. For the season, he was 9–12–2 with a 2.96 GAA in 28 appearances. On July 1, 2014, he re-signed for another year in the same role for $1 million. In 31 appearances with the Flyers in the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20NHL%20season">2014–15 season</a>, Emery had a 10–11–7 record and 3.06 GAA, and his save percentage was under .900.

On September 8, 2015, the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> announced that Emery would be attending training camp on a PTO (professional tryout). During the preseason he was released from this PTO on September 27. In October and November 2015, Emery trained with the Ontario Reign of the AHL, affiliate to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>. It was announced on December 18, 2015, that Emery had signed a professional tryout agreement with the <a href="Toronto%20Marlies">Toronto Marlies</a> of the <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> (AHL), who are associated with the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>.

Emery was praised for his leadership and mentoring abilities; on January 24, 2016, upon Crawford recording his league-leading seventh shutout of the season with the Blackhawks after a win against the Blues, he credited Emery for turning around his work habits. Crawford stated that Emery's work habits led him to increase his focus and preparation before a game and during practice. "As a goalie, I've never seen a guy be so focused and ready for a game", Crawford said. "I was kind of doing the opposite – being nonchalant and doing other stuff and not having a routine. You get in that physical routine that just makes you ready mentally. You trick yourself into knowing that it's game time and time to play." Kyle Dubas, assistant GM of the Marlies, cited Emery for his mentorship towards the team.

On February 5, 2016, Emery signed with <a href="Adler%20Mannheim">Adler Mannheim</a> of the German elite league <a href="Deutsche%20Eishockey%20Liga">Deutsche Eishockey Liga</a> for the remainder of the season, thus ending his professional tryout with the Marlies. On March 29, he signed a tryout contract with the Flyers, and on April 1, the team announced that it had signed Emery for the remainder of the season. At the end of the season, Emery retired from the NHL.

Emery was a fan-favorite and celebrated fighter in the NHL, a sport that allows fighting, because it was rare for a goaltender to engage. Emery was a boxing fan and had images of <a href="Joe%20Frazier">Joe Frazier</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Hopkins">Bernard Hopkins</a>, <a href="Mike%20Tyson">Mike Tyson</a> and the fictional <a href="Rocky%20Balboa">Rocky Balboa</a> on his helmets.

Emery had alleged off-ice incidents publicized, and was subject to much speculation by the press during his tenure with the Ottawa Senators in 2007–2009. Allegations included anger management, vehicular incidents, and speculated recreational drug use. Press members publicized a missed flight during the playoffs, Emery being late for practice, fights with teammates in practice, including a physical altercation with teammate <a href="Brian%20McGrattan">Brian McGrattan</a>, and a stick-smashing incident at practice because Emery was not receiving as much ice time as <a href="Martin%20Gerber">Martin Gerber</a>, as coach <a href="John%20Paddock">John Paddock</a> claimed. Paddock told the press that Emery was displaying erratic behaviour, was sent home (missing most of training camp) and threw a mini tantrum at the end of a morning skate. The media speculated that Emery was involved with a bad crowd and recreational drugs. When asked by <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, Emery stated, "I'm not a saint and I'm not in jail, either." Paddock later expressed regret on how Emery was handled and was partially responsible for signing Emery to the Flyers, where they worked together, during 2013–2016.

A viral video surfaced of Emery trying to punch and chasing a team trainer while the trainer was attempting to place a hat on his head in January 2009. Emery said he took anger management classes in the minor leagues and underwent eight weeks of behavioural counselling.

In June 2010, Emery began dating Canadian singer <a href="Keshia%20Chant%C3%A9">Keshia Chanté</a>, and starred as the love interest in Chanté's music video for "Test Drive". On June 16, 2016, Emery proposed to Chanté on her birthday in <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>, <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. Emery and Chanté were set to wed in June 2017, however, simultaneously with the release of her cover on "Today's Bride", Chanté announced via her <a href="Instagram">Instagram</a> account that she had called off the wedding. On September 18, 2017, Emery was arrested for uttering threats and assault with a weapon towards Chanté, after she went to police seeking a restraining order. Chanté required Emery to attend anger management in exchange for charges being absolved, which Emery agreed to and successfully completed. On July 16, 2018, Chanté penned an emotional tribute to Emery stating that she was "heartbroken" and that he was "a Superhero" who was "loving, affectionate, intelligent, hilarious, giving". She also stated that they "may have had differences" but they "forgave each other and continued to love each other right to the very end."

On October 15, 2018, prior to a game versus the <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a>, the Senators presented a tribute for Emery. Among those present were his close friend <a href="Jason%20Spezza">Jason Spezza</a>, who was playing for the Stars, and Chanté, who sung the national anthems.

In March 2007, Emery was charged in a minor crash heading to the airport, forcing him to miss a team chartered flight to a road game. In September 2007, he had a much-publicized road rage incident with a 65-year-old man he was accused of threatening to kill and cutting off on the highway. No charges were laid.

In February 2008, <a href="Ottawa%20Police%20Service">Ottawa police</a> pulled over Emery, who allegedly cut off a police cruiser with his <a href="Hummer">Hummer</a>. They said he was aggressive with officers. In March 2009, he was charged for stunt driving for having gone 50 km/h or more over the posted speed limit. Police impounded his Hummer. He appeared on <a href="The%20Sports%20Network">TSN</a>'s "<a href="Off%20the%20Record%20with%20Michael%20Landsberg">Off the Record with Michael Landsberg</a>", saying that, at the time, his Hummer was pulled over at least 30 times in the previous years.

On July 14, 2018, Emery was helping raise money, along with other former and current pro hockey players for Hamilton charity Food4Kids. On July 15, 2018, Emery went swimming with friends near the <a href="Leander%20Boat%20Club%20%28Canada%29">Leander Boat Club</a> in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>. He jumped off a boat and friends called emergency services at approximately 6:00 AM when he did not resurface. His body was found at about 2:50 PM that same day, about 20 yards from where he went into the water, according to <a href="Hamilton%20Police%20Service">Hamilton Police</a>, who referred to the incident as a "case of misadventure". The search for Emery took longer than anticipated due to unspecified safety concerns for the dive team before they could enter the water. Police stated that although <a href="Crime">foul play</a> was not suspected, the exact circumstances surrounding Emery's death were still under investigation.

Marwari horse

The Marwari or Malani is a rare <a href="horse%20breed">breed of horse</a> from the <a href="Marwar">Marwar</a> (or Jodhpur) region of <a href="India">India</a>. Known for its inward-turning ear tips, it comes in all <a href="equine%20coat%20color">equine colours</a>, although <a href="Piebald%20and%20skewbald%20horse">piebald and skewbald</a> patterns tend to be the most popular with buyers and breeders. It is known for its hardiness, and is quite similar to the <a href="Kathiawari%20%28horse%29">Kathiawari</a>, another Indian breed from the <a href="Kathiawar">Kathiawar</a> region southwest of Marwar. Many breed members exhibit a natural <a href="ambling">ambling</a> <a href="Horse%20gait">gait</a>. The Marwari horses are descended from native Indian ponies crossed with <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian horse</a>s, possibly with some <a href="Mongolian%20horse">Mongolian</a> influence.

The <a href="Rathores">Rathores</a>, traditional rulers of the <a href="Marwar">Marwar</a> region of western India, were the first to breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and hardiness. Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor management practices resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for light <a href="draft%20horse">draught</a> and agricultural work, as well as <a href="equestrianism">riding</a> and <a href="Pack%20horse">packing</a>. In 1995, a <a href="Breed%20registry">breed society</a> was formed for the Marwari horse in India. The exportation of Marwari horses was banned for decades, but between 2000 and 2006, a small number of exports were allowed. Since 2008, visas allowing temporary travel of Marwari horses outside India have been available in small numbers. Though they are rare they are becoming more popular outside of India due to their unique looks.

The Marwari horse averages between high. Horses originating in different parts of India tend to be of different heights, with the breed having an outside range of high. They can be <a href="bay%20%28horse%29">bay</a>, <a href="gray%20%28horse%29">grey</a>, <a href="chestnut%20%28coat%29">chestnut</a>, <a href="palomino">palomino</a>, <a href="piebald">piebald</a>, or <a href="skewbald">skewbald</a>. Although <a href="White%20%28horse%29">white horses</a> are bred specifically for religious use in India, they are generally not accepted into Marwari <a href="stud%20book">stud book</a>s. Gray horses are considered auspicious and tend to be the most valuable, with piebald and skewbald horses the second-most favoured. <a href="Black%20%28horse%29">Black</a> horses are considered unlucky, as the colour is a symbol of death and darkness. Horses that have the <a href="Horse%20markings">white markings</a> of a <a href="Horse%20markings%23Facial%20markings">blaze</a> and four white socks are considered lucky.
The facial profile is straight or slightly Roman, and the ears are medium-sized and curving inward so that the tips meet; also, the Marwari horse can rotate its ears 180º. The neck is arched and carried high, running into pronounced <a href="withers">withers</a>, with a deep chest and muscular, broad, and angular shoulders. Marwaris generally have a long back and sloping <a href="Rump%20%28animal%29">croup</a>. The legs tend to be slender and the hooves small but well-formed. Members of the breed are hardy and <a href="easy%20keeper">easy keeper</a>s, but they can also be of tenacious and unpredictable temperaments. They are quite similar to the <a href="Kathiawari%20horse">Kathiawari horse</a>, another breed from India, having much of the same history and physical features. The main difference between the Marwari and the Kathiawari is their original geographic origin – Marwaris are mainly from the <a href="Marwar">Marwar</a> region while Kathiawaris are from the <a href="Kathiawar">Kathiawar</a> peninsula. Kathiawaris have inward-slanting ears, a short back, and a straight, slender neck and are more similar to Arabians, but they are pure in breed. Kathiawaris are slightly smaller than Marwaris in general.

The Marwari horse often exhibits a natural <a href="ambling">ambling</a> gait, close to a <a href="Horse%20gait%23Pace">pace</a>, called the "revaal", "aphcal", or "rehwal". <a href="Hair%20whorl%20%28horse%29">Hair whorls</a> and their placement are important to breeders of Marwaris. Horses with long whorls down the neck are called "devman" and considered lucky, while horses with whorls below their eyes are called "anusudhal" and are unpopular with buyers. Whorls on the <a href="fetlock">fetlock</a>s are thought to bring victory. The horses are expected to have correct proportions, based on the width of a finger, said to be the equal of five grains of <a href="barley">barley</a>. For example, the length of the face should be between 28 and 40 fingers, and the length from the <a href="Poll%20%28livestock%29">poll</a> to the <a href="Rump%20%28animal%29">dock</a> should be four times the length of the face.

The Marwari is descended from native Indian ponies crossed with <a href="Arabian%20horse">Arabian horse</a>s. The ponies were small and hardy, but with poor <a href="Equine%20conformation">conformation</a>; the influence of the Arabian blood improved the appearance without compromising the hardiness. The Arabians possibly came ashore from a <a href="cargo%20ship">cargo ship</a> wrecked off India's west coast. Legend in India states that the Arabian ship, containing seven Arabian horses of good breeding, was shipwrecked off the shore of the <a href="Kachchh%20District">Kachchh District</a>. These horses were then taken to the Marwar district and used as <a href="foundation%20bloodstock">foundation bloodstock</a> for the Marwari. There is also the possibility of some <a href="Mongolian%20horse">Mongolian</a> influence from the north. The breed probably originated in northwest India on the Afghanistan border, as well as in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and takes its name from the Marwar region (also called the Jodhpur region) of India.

The <a href="Rathores">Rathores</a>, rulers of Marwar and successful <a href="Rajput">Rajput</a> cavalry, were the traditional breeders of the Marwari. The Rathores were forced from their <a href="Kannauj">Kingdom of Kanauj</a> in 1193, and withdrew into the <a href="Great%20Indian%20Desert">Great Indian</a> and <a href="Thar%20Desert">Thar Desert</a>s. The Marwari was vital to their survival, and during the 12th century they followed strict selective breeding processes, keeping the finest stallions for the use of their subjects. During this time, the horses were considered <a href="divine%20being">divine being</a>s, and at times they were only allowed to be ridden by members of the Rajput families and the <a href="Kshatriyas">Kshatriyas</a> warrior caste. When the Moguls captured northern India in the early 16th century they brought <a href="Turkoman%20horse">Turkoman horse</a>s that were probably used to supplement the breeding of the Marwari. Marwaris were renowned during this period for their bravery and courage in battle, as well as their loyalty to their riders. During the late 16th century, the Rajputs of Marwar, under the leadership of <a href="Moghul">Moghul</a> emperor <a href="Akbar">Akbar</a>, formed a cavalry force over 50,000 strong. The Rathores believed that the Marwari horse could only leave a battlefield under one of three conditions – victory, death, or carrying a wounded master to safety. The horses were trained to be extremely responsive in battlefield conditions, and were practised in complex riding maneuvers. Over 300 years later, during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, Marwar <a href="lancer">lancer</a>s under <a href="Pratap%20Singh%20of%20Idar">Sir Pratap Singh</a> assisted the British.

The period of the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> hastened the Marwari's downfall, as did the eventual independence of India. The British occupiers preferred other breeds, and tried to eliminate the Marwari, along with the Kathiawari. The British instead preferred <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>s and <a href="polo%20pony">polo ponies</a>, and reduced the reputation of the Marwari to the point where even the inward-turning ears of the breed were mocked as the "mark of a native horse". During the 1930s the Marwari deteriorated, with breeding stock diminishing and becoming of poorer quality due to poor breeding practices. Indian independence, along with the obsolescence of warriors on horseback, led to a decreased need for the Marwari and many animals were subsequently killed. In the 1950s many Indian noblemen lost their land and hence much of their ability to take care of animals, resulting in many Marwari horses being sold as <a href="pack%20horse">pack horse</a>s, <a href="castration">castrated</a>, or killed. The breed was on the verge of extinction until the intervention of <a href="Umaid%20Singh">Maharaja Umaid Singhji</a> in the first half of the 20th century saved the Marwari. His work was carried on by his grandson, <a href="Gaj%20Singh%2C%20Maharaja%20of%20Jodhpur">Maharaja Gaj Singh II</a>.

A British horsewoman named Francesca Kelly founded a group called Marwari Bloodlines in 1995, with the goal of promoting and preserving the Marwari horse around the world. In 1999, Kelly and Raghuvendra Singh Dundlod, a descendant of Indian nobility, led a group that founded the Indigenous Horse Society of India (of which the Marwari Horse Society is part), a group that works with the government, breeders, and the public to promote and conserve the breed. Kelly and Dunlod also entered and won endurance races at the Indian national equestrian games, convincing the Equestrian Federation of India to sanction a national show for indigenous horses – the first in the country. The pair worked with other experts from the Indigenous Horse Society to develop the first breed standards.

The government of India had originally banned the export of indigenous horse breeds, although not <a href="polo%20pony">polo ponies</a> or <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>s, in 1952. This ban was partially lifted in 1999, when a small number of indigenous horses could be exported after receiving a special license. Kelly imported the first Marwari horse into the United States in 2000. Over the next seven years, 21 horses were exported, until, in 2006, licenses stopped being granted over concerns that native breeding populations were being threatened. One of the last Marwaris to be exported was the first to be imported to Europe, in 2006, when a stallion was given to the French <a href="Living%20Museum%20of%20the%20Horse">Living Museum of the Horse</a>. In 2008, the Indian government began granting licenses for "temporary exports" of up to one year, to allow horses to be exhibited in other countries. This was in response to breeders and the breed society, who felt they were not being allowed a fair chance to exhibit their animals.

In late 2007 plans were announced to create a <a href="stud%20book">stud book</a> for the breed, a collaborative venture between the Marwari Horse Society of India and the Indian government. A registration process was initiated in 2009, when it was announced that the Marwari Horse Society had become a government body, the only government-authorized registration society for Marwari horses. The registration process includes an evaluation of the horse against the breed standards, during which unique identification marks and physical dimensions are recorded. After the evaluation, the horse is <a href="Livestock%20branding%23Freeze%20branding">cold branded</a> with its registration number and photographed. In late 2009 the Indian government announced that the Marwari horse, along with other Indian horse breeds, would be commemorated on a set of stamps issued by that country.

As a direct result of indiscriminate breeding practices, as of 2001 only a few thousand purebred Marwari horses existed. Research studies have been conducted to examine the genetics of the Marwari horse and its relationship to other Indian and non-Indian horse breeds. Six different breeds have been identified in India: the Marwari, Kathiawari, <a href="Indian%20Country%20Bred">Spiti pony</a>, <a href="Indian%20Country%20Bred">Bhutia pony</a>, <a href="Manipuri%20Pony">Manipuri Pony</a>, and <a href="Zaniskari%20pony">Zanskari</a>. These six are distinct from each other in terms of unique performance traits and different agroclimactic conditions in the various areas of India where they originated. A 2005 study was conducted to identify past <a href="genetic%20bottleneck">genetic bottleneck</a>s in the Marwari horse. The study found that, in the DNA of the horses tested, there was no evidence of a genetic bottleneck in the breed's history. However, since the population has decreased rapidly in past decades, bottlenecks may have occurred that were not identified in the study. In 2007, a study was conducted to assess <a href="genetic%20variation">genetic variation</a> among all Indian horse breeds except the Kathiawari. Based on analysis of <a href="Microsatellite%20%28genetics%29">microsatellite</a> DNA, the Marwari was found to be the most genetically distinct breed of the five studied, and was most <a href="genetic%20distance">distant</a> from the Manipuri; none of the breeds were found to have close genetic ties to the Thoroughbred. The Marwari was distinguishable from the other breeds in terms of both physical characteristics (mainly height) and environmental adaptability. The physical differences were attributed to differing ancestries: the Marwari horse are closely associated with the Arabian horse, while the four other breeds are supposedly descended from the <a href="Tibetan%20pony">Tibetan pony</a>.
The Marwari horse is primarily maintained for show, horse safaris, sport, ceremonial & religious purposes, and during earlier days in war. Marwari horses are often crossed with Thoroughbreds to produce a larger horse with more versatility. Despite the fact that the breed is indigenous to the country, cavalry units of the Indian military make little use of the horses, although they are popular in the <a href="Jodhpur">Jodhpur</a> and <a href="Jaipur">Jaipur</a> areas of <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, India. They are particularly suited to <a href="dressage">dressage</a>, in part due to a natural tendency to perform. Marwari horses are also used to play <a href="polo">polo</a>, sometimes playing against Thoroughbreds. Within the Marwari horse breed was a <a href="Pedigree%20chart">strain</a> known as the Natchni, believed by local people to be "born to dance". Decorated in silver, jewels, and bells, these horses were trained to perform complex prancing and leaping movements at many ceremonies, including weddings. Although the Natchni strain is extinct today, horses trained in those skills are still in demand in rural India.

Convention of 1832

The Convention of 1832 was the first political gathering of colonists in <a href="Mexican%20Texas">Mexican Texas</a>. Delegates sought reforms from the Mexican government and hoped to quell the widespread belief that settlers in Texas wished to secede from Mexico. The convention was the first in a series of unsuccessful attempts at political negotiation that eventually led to the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas</a> Revolution.

Under the <a href="1824%20Constitution%20of%20Mexico">1824 Constitution of Mexico</a>, Texas was denied independent statehood and merged into the new state <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>. After growing suspicious that the United States government would attempt to seize Texas by force, in 1830 Mexican President <a href="Anastasio%20Bustamante">Anastasio Bustamante</a> enacted the <a href="Law%20of%20April%206%2C%201830">Law of April 6, 1830</a> which restricted immigration and called for customs duty enforcement. Tensions erupted in June 1832, when Texas residents systematically expelled all Mexican troops from eastern Texas.

The lack of military oversight emboldened the colonists to increase their political activity. On October 1, 1832, 55 political delegates met at <a href="San%20Felipe%2C%20Texas">San Felipe de Austin</a> to petition for changes in the governance of Texas. Notably absent was any representation from <a href="San%20Antonio%20de%20B%C3%A9xar">San Antonio de Béxar</a>, where many of the native Mexican settlers ("<a href="Tejano">Tejano</a>s") lived. The delegates elected <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a>, a highly respected "<a href="empresario">empresario</a>", as president of the convention.

Delegates passed a series of resolutions requesting, among other things, a repeal of the immigration restrictions, a three-year exclusion from customs duties enforcement, permission to form an armed <a href="militia">militia</a> and independent statehood. They also voted themselves the power to call future conventions. Before the petition could be delivered to Mexico City, the political chief of Texas, <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20M%C3%BAsquiz">Ramón Músquiz</a>, ruled that the convention was illegal and annulled the resolutions. In a compromise, the "<a href="Cabildo%20%28council%29">ayuntamiento</a>" (city council) of San Antonio de Béxar drafted a new petition with similar language to the convention resolutions and submitted it through proper legal channels. Músquiz forwarded the new document to the Mexican Congress.

In 1821 several of Spain's former colonies in the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> won their independence and banded together to create a new country, Mexico. The <a href="Constitution%20of%201824">Constitution of 1824</a> established Mexico as a <a href="federalism">federalist</a> republic comprising multiple states. Sparsely populated former Spanish provinces were denied independent statehood and instead merged with neighboring areas. The former <a href="Spanish%20Texas">Spanish Texas</a>, which marked Mexico's eastern border with the United States, was combined with <a href="Coahuila">Coahuila</a> to form the new state <a href="Coahuila%20y%20Tejas">Coahuila y Tejas</a>. To assist in governing the large area, the state was subdivided into several departments; all of Texas was included in the Department of Béxar. With the formation of a new state government, the Texas provincial governing committee was forced to disband, and the capital was moved from <a href="San%20Antonio%20de%20B%C3%A9xar">San Antonio de Béxar</a> to <a href="Saltillo">Saltillo</a>. Many "<a href="Tejano">Tejano</a>s"—native Mexican citizens who lived in Texas—were reluctant to give up their self-rule.

The bankrupt federal government was unable to provide much military assistance to the settlers in Texas, who faced frequent raids by native tribes. Hoping that an influx of settlers could control the raids, in 1824 the government appointed "<a href="empresario">empresario</a>s" to encourage families from the United States and Europe to settle in Texas. However, as the number of settlers from the US and other non-Spanish-speaking areas increased in Texas, Mexican authorities became apprehensive that the United States might wish to annex the area, possibly using force. On April 6, 1830, the Mexican government passed a <a href="Laws%20of%20April%206%2C%201830">series of laws</a> restricting immigration from the United States into Texas. The laws also cancelled all unfilled "empresario" contracts and called for the first enforcement of customs duties.
The new laws angered both "Tejanos" and recent immigrants (<a href="Texian">Texian</a>s). <a href="Stephen%20F.%20Austin">Stephen F. Austin</a>, a well-respected "empresario" who had brought the first group of American settlers to Texas, warned Mexican President <a href="Anastasio%20Bustamante">Anastasio Bustamante</a> that the laws seemed designed to destroy the colonies. Texas's two delegates to the state legislature, both "Tejanos", were so vocal in their opposition that one of them was expelled from the legislature. Austin was elected to fill his seat, and in December 1830 he left for Saltillo.

Implementation of the laws led to much tension within Texas. Much to the displeasure of the colonists, a new military post was established in <a href="Anahuac%2C%20Texas">Anahuac</a> to begin collecting customs duties. The commander of the post, Colonel <a href="Juan%20Davis%20Bradburn">Juan Davis Bradburn</a>, often clashed with the locals over his strict interpretation of Mexican law. In June 1832, colonists armed themselves and marched on Anahuac. As a result of these <a href="Anahuac%20Disturbances">Anahuac Disturbances</a>, Bradburn was forced to resign.

The small Texian rebellion coincided with a revolt led by General <a href="Antonio%20L%C3%B3pez%20de%20Santa%20Anna">Antonio López de Santa Anna</a> against Bustamante's <a href="centralized%20government">centralist</a> government. The chaos in the Mexican interior and the Texian success at Anahuac emboldened other Texas settlers to take arms against garrisons throughout eastern Texas. Within weeks, settlers expelled all Mexican soldiers from eastern Texas. Free from military oversight, the settlers began to increase their political activity.

Buoyed by their success, Texians organized a political convention to persuade Mexican authorities to weaken the <a href="L830">L830</a>. On August 22, the "ayuntamiento" at <a href="San%20Felipe%2C%20TX">San Felipe de Austin</a> (the capital of Austin's colony) called for each district to elect five delegates. Although Austin attempted to dissuade the instigators, elections were held before his return from Saltillo. Sixteen communities chose delegates. The two municipalities with the largest "Tejano" population, <a href="San%20Antonio%20de%20B%C3%A9xar">San Antonio de Béxar</a> and <a href="Victoria%2C%20TX">Victoria</a>, refused to participate. The majority of the elected delegates were known as relatively even-tempered. Many known agitators, such as <a href="James%20Bowie">James Bowie</a> and <a href="William%20B.%20Travis">William B. Travis</a>, were defeated. "Tejanos" did not have a large presence at the convention, largely due to the boycott by the Béxar and Victoria municipalities. Convention organizers invited several prominent "Tejanos" from these towns to attend, but all declined.

On October 1, 1832, 55 delegates met in San Felipe de Austin; attendance may have been diminished due to the short notice. The gathering marked the first time residents from each of the colonies had convened to discuss common goals.

The convention was called to order by <a href="John%20Austin%20%28soldier%29">John Austin</a>, one of the "alcaldes" of San Felipe de Austin. In his remarks, John Austin laid out four key points that the convention needed to address: the "misrepresentations" made by "enemies of Texas" that the settlers desired independence from Mexico, an appeal of the restrictions on immigration from the United States, a method to grant land titles to residents in certain areas of the province, and reduction of tariffs on many imported items. The first order of business was the election of officers. Stephen F. Austin and <a href="William%20H.%20Wharton">William H. Wharton</a>, a known hothead, were nominated to lead the convention; Austin won, 31–15. <a href="Frank%20W.%20Johnson">Frank W. Johnson</a>, who had led the armed resistance at the Anahuac Disturbances, was elected secretary. In his acceptance speech, Austin praised the delegates for exerting their constitutional rights to petition the government.

Over the next six days, the delegates adopted a series of resolutions requesting changes in the governance of Texas. Historian <a href="Eugene%20Campbell%20Barker">Eugene Campbell Barker</a> suggests that the discussions would likely not have concluded so swiftly unless the delegates had done "considerable preparation before the meeting". Several of the resolutions were designed to stimulate the local economy. Delegates requested that customs duty enforcement be delayed until 1835 and that citizens be granted a method to remove corrupt customs officers. Resolutions encouraged that land titles be issued more quickly and that public lands be sold to raise money for bilingual schools. Delegates from <a href="Nacogdoches%2C%20TX">Nacogdoches</a> asked that the government take a firmer hand in preventing new settlers from encroaching on lands that had previously been promised to native tribes. After explaining that law-abiding potential citizens were being excluded from Texas while disreputable squatters continued to stream illegally in, the delegates asked for the repeal of the prohibition on immigration from the United States. Furthermore, they requested permission to raise a militia, ostensibly for protection from marauding native tribes. The most controversial resolution asked that Texas become an independent state, separate from Coahuila. The separation request was added by a vote of 36–12. The motion included as justification the fact that Coahuila and Texas were very dissimilar in climate and economy and mentioned that Texas's limited representation in the state legislature made it very difficult to enact laws that specifically addressed the needs of its citizens. Delegates insisted that independent statehood was not a pretext for secession from Mexico.

After approving the list of resolutions, delegates created a seven-member central committee to convene future meetings. The central committee would be based in San Felipe "for the purpose of circulating information of events of importance to the interest of the people". In addition, each municipality was asked to create a committee of correspondence and safety. The sub-committees would keep in close contact with the central committee because "united our strength and resources are more than adequate to our defense in any possible event. Disunited, we may become an easy prey, even to a handful of cowardly invaders."

The convention adjourned on October 6 after unanimously electing Wharton to deliver the resolutions to the state legislature in Saltillo and to the <a href="Congress%20of%20Mexico">Mexican Congress</a> in Mexico City. Just before the group dispersed, <a href="Rafael%20Manchola">Rafael Manchola</a>, the "<a href="alcalde">alcalde</a>" (mayor) of <a href="Goliad%2C%20Texas">Goliad</a>, arrived. He was the only delegate from Goliad and the only "Tejano" to appear at the convention. Manchola volunteered to accompany Wharton at his own expense—he and other delegates thought the expedition might have more success if a "Tejano" was also involved. Days later, Austin wrote that "we have just had a convention of all Texas, native Mexicans and foreign settlers—all united as one man".

Following the convention, much of the unrest in Texas subsided. Austin believed the public was calmed simply by having the opportunity to air their grievances. Before the list of concerns could be presented to the state and federal governments, <a href="Ram%C3%B3n%20M%C3%BAsquiz">Ramón Músquiz</a>, the political chief, or head, of the Department of Béxar, ruled that the convention was illegal. This type of activism was traditionally forbidden in Texas. The law directed that citizens should protest to their local "<a href="Cabildo%20%28council%29">ayuntamiento</a>" (similar to a city council), which would forward their concerns to the political chief. The political chief could then escalate the concerns to the state or federal government. Because the colonists had not followed this process, Músquiz annulled their resolutions. The "ayuntamientos" at San Felipe, Nacogdoches, <a href="Gonzales%2C%20TX">Gonzales</a> and <a href="Liberty%2C%20TX">Liberty</a> half-heartedly apologized for their participation, and Wharton's mission was cancelled.

The lack of "Tejano" representation and the San Antonio de Béxar residents' refusal to participate fostered a perception that only newcomers to Texas were dissatisfied. Austin agreed to meet with the political leaders in San Antonio de Béxar to persuade them to support the resolutions. These "Tejano" leaders, including <a href="Erasmo%20Seguin">Erasmo Seguin</a>, largely agreed with the result of the convention but opposed the methods by which the resolutions had been proposed. The "Tejano" leaders urged patience; Bustamante was still president and would not look favorably on a petition from Texas settlers who had sided with his rival, Santa Anna.

Austin and the "Tejano" leaders agreed to a compromise. Because San Antonio de Béxar was the seat of the Department of Béxar, its "ayuntamiento" drafted a petition containing similar language to the convention resolutions. The petition was endorsed by the "ayuntamientos" at Goliad, San Felipe, and Nacogdoches and then given to Músquiz, who forwarded it to the Mexican Congress in early 1833. Although Músquiz had publicly supported the petition, he secretly included a note to the Coahuila y Tejas governor warning that this might be a precursor to secession.

The political leaders also agreed to Austin's stipulation that if the federal government refused to address the petition within several months, Texas residents would form their own state government, essentially declaring independence from Coahuila, if not from Mexico. The central committee elected by the convention was too impatient to wait long. In late December, the committee called for a March election for delegates to the <a href="Convention%20of%201833">Convention of 1833</a>. The second convention reiterated some of the previous concerns and took additional steps to declare Texas an independent state, further concerning Mexican authories, who feared this was a step towards Texas joining the United States.

The Mexican government attempted to address some of the concerns identified by the conventions of 1832 and 1833. In November 1833, part of the Laws of April 6, 1830 were repealed, allowing Americans to immigrate legally to Texas. Several months later, Texas was granted increased representation in the Coahuila y Tejas legislature. Several American legal concepts, such as <a href="trial%20by%20jury">trial by jury</a>, were introduced to Texas, and English was authorized as a second language. Unimpressed with these compromises, some Texas residents continued to campaign for independent statehood. Rising tensions eventually led to the <a href="Texas%20Revolution">Texas Revolution</a>, which began in October 1835.

Sloan–Parker House

The Sloan–Parker House is a late 18th-century stone residence near <a href="Junction%2C%20West%20Virginia">Junction</a>, <a href="Hampshire%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hampshire County</a>, in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It was added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on June 5, 1975, becoming Hampshire County's first property to be listed on the register. The Sloan–Parker House has been in the Parker family since 1854. The house and its adjacent farm are located along the <a href="Northwestern%20Turnpike">Northwestern Turnpike</a> (<a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20West%20Virginia">US 50</a>/<a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%2028">WV 28</a>) in the rural <a href="Mill%20Creek%20%28South%20Branch%20Potomac%20River%29">Mill Creek valley</a>.

The original <a href="fieldstone">fieldstone</a> section of the house was erected in about 1790 for Richard Sloan and his wife Charlotte VanHorn Sloan. Originally from Ireland, Sloan arrived in the United States after the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> and became an <a href="Indentured%20servitude">indentured servant</a> of David VanHorn. Sloan eloped with VanHorn's daughter Charlotte and they settled in the Mill Creek valley, where they built the original "Stone House" portion of the Sloan–Parker House. The Sloans had ten children, including John and Thomas Sloan, who each (later) represented Hampshire County in the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a>. Richard Sloan and his family operated a successful weaving business from the Stone House and their Sloan <a href="Quilt%23Block%20designs">counterpanes</a> (quilts with block-designs) became well known in the <a href="Potomac%20River%23South%20Branch%20Potomac%20River">South Branch Valley</a> region.

The Sloan family sold the Stone House and to three brothers in the Parker family in 1854. The Parker family operated a <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a> line on the <a href="Moorefield%20and%20North%20Branch%20Turnpike">Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike</a>; the journey included a stop at the Stone House, where the family served meals to travelers. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, the Stone House was visited by both <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> and <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> forces, and was ransacked by Union troops for goods and supplies. The Stone House served as a local polling station, and its use as a stagecoach stop ended after the completion of the <a href="South%20Branch%20Valley%20Railroad">Hampshire Southern Railroad</a> in 1910. The Parker family opened the house for tours, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. 

The Sloan–Parker House consists of the original stone section, which faces toward the Northwestern Turnpike, and a <a href="Framing%20%28construction%29">wooden frame</a> addition (built c.1900) adjacent to the original stone section. The stone section's exterior wall is about thick at the basement level and tapers to a thickness of about at the attic level. Most of the stone section's flooring, and the <a href="Door%20furniture">hardware</a> on the doors, are original. Other features of the Sloan–Parker House property include a large barn (built in 1803) and, to the northeast of the house, the Sloan–Ludwick Cemetery.

The Sloan–Parker House and farm are situated within a rural, agricultural section of the <a href="Mill%20Creek%20%28South%20Branch%20Potomac%20River%29">Mill Creek</a> valley in southwestern <a href="Hampshire%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hampshire County</a>. <a href="Patterson%20Creek%20Mountain">Patterson Creek Mountain</a>, a forested <a href="Anticline">anticlinal</a> mountain ridge, rises to the west of the Mill Creek valley, and the forested western rolling foothills of the anticlinal <a href="Mill%20Creek%20Mountain">Mill Creek Mountain</a> rise to the valley's east. The <a href="Potomac%20River%23South%20Branch%20Potomac%20River">South Branch Potomac River</a> is located across Mill Creek Mountain, approximately to the east of the house.

The house and its adjacent farm are located along the <a href="Northwestern%20Turnpike">Northwestern Turnpike</a> (concurrently <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20West%20Virginia">US 50</a> and <a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%2028">WV 28</a>) about east of the <a href="unincorporated%20community">unincorporated community</a> of <a href="Junction%2C%20West%20Virginia">Junction</a> (also known as Moorefield Junction). Junction is centered around and named for the intersection of Purgitsville Pike (concurrently <a href="U.S.%20Route%20220%20in%20West%20Virginia">US 220</a> and WV28) with the Northwestern Turnpike (concurrently US50 and US220 westward to <a href="Knobly%20Mountain">Knobly Mountain</a> and concurrently US50 and WV28 eastward to <a href="Romney%2C%20West%20Virginia">Romney</a>).

The Sloan–Parker House is located atop a hillside just south of the Northwestern Turnpike. Mill Creek flows west to east approximately to the north of the house. An unnamed <a href="Stream%23Intermittent%20and%20ephemeral%20streams">ephemeral stream</a> that runs just west of the house joins Mill Creek to the north. Mill Creek continues east through the <a href="Mechanicsburg%20Gap">Mechanicsburg Gap</a> in Mill Creek Mountain at <a href="Mechanicsburg%2C%20West%20Virginia">Mechanicsburg</a> and joins the South Branch Potomac River.

The Mill Creek valley and the land on which the Sloan–Parker House is located were originally part of the <a href="Northern%20Neck%20Proprietary">Northern Neck Proprietary</a>, a land grant that the exiled <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> awarded to seven of his supporters in 1649 during the <a href="Interregnum%20%28England%29">English Interregnum</a>. Following the <a href="Restoration%20%28England%29">Restoration</a> in 1660, CharlesII finally ascended to the English throne. He renewed the Northern Neck Proprietary grant in 1662, revised it in 1669, and again renewed the original grant favoring original grantees <a href="Thomas%20Colepeper%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Colepeper">Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper</a>, and <a href="Henry%20Bennet%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Arlington">Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington</a>, in 1672. In 1681 Bennet sold his share to Lord Colepeper, who received a new charter for the entire land grant from <a href="James%20II%20of%20England">James II</a> in 1688. Following the deaths of Lord Colepeper, his wife Margaret, and his daughter Katherine, the Northern Neck Proprietary passed to Katherine's son <a href="Thomas%20Fairfax%2C%206th%20Lord%20Fairfax%20of%20Cameron">Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron</a>, in 1719.

As conflicts with Native Americans began to ease, Lord Fairfax sought to entice European settlers to inhabit the sparsely populated western lands of his Northern Neck Proprietary. The Mill Creek valley was one of the first areas of present-day Hampshire County to be settled by Europeans, beginning in the mid-18th century. Early settlers were drawn by the valley's fertility. Job Parker, a direct ancestor of the Parker family that later acquired the Sloan–Parker House, settled in the Mill Creek valley during this period.

The original <a href="fieldstone">fieldstone</a> section of the Sloan–Parker House was erected around 1790 for Richard Sloan and his wife Charlotte VanHorn Sloan. Richard Sloan was originally from <a href="County%20Monaghan">County Monaghan</a>, <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a>, Ireland. Following the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, Sloan sailed on a <a href="passenger%20ship">passenger ship</a> from Great Britain to the United States. Despite paying his passage fare prior to his voyage, he was charged again upon his arrival. Unable to make this second payment, he became an <a href="Indentured%20servitude">indentured servant</a> of David VanHorn. After several months with the VanHorn family, Sloan eloped with David VanHorn's daughter Charlotte, and the couple went to Baltimore, where they stayed briefly. After observing healthy cattle from <a href="Old%20Fields%2C%20West%20Virginia">Old Fields</a> in <a href="Hardy%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hardy County</a>, they decided to relocate there. On their journey to Old Fields, Sloan and his wife arrived in <a href="Romney%2C%20West%20Virginia">Romney</a> and chose to settle in <a href="Hampshire%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Hampshire County</a> instead. They later moved southwest of Romney to their property in the Mill Creek valley, where the Sloan–Parker House stands today.

To construct the two-story Stone House, Sloan and his wife hired laborers to quarry the native fieldstone and lay the stonework. Richard and Charlotte Sloan had ten children together (four girls and six boys), and the large house afforded the couple sufficient room to raise them. The house also provided the family with the necessary space to engage in the manufacture of woven goods. Sloan was a fabric <a href="Weaving">weaver</a> by trade, and he and his family developed a thriving weaving industry on their lands in the Mill Creek valley. Their entire production process was initially accomplished inside the Stone House until Sloan erected a separate <a href="loom">loom</a> house. There, he and his sons built and operated six looms. On their farm, Sloan and his family raised their own sheep and grew <a href="flax">flax</a>; they also sourced flax and <a href="Wool">raw wool</a> from local residents. The majority of the Sloan family's woven products were sold locally, and their Sloan <a href="Quilt">counterpanes</a> became well known in the South Branch Valley region. The family's trade in <a href="woolen">woolen</a> goods and <a href="linens">linens</a> thrived until the middle of the 19thcentury. The present Parker family occupants of the Sloan–Parker House retain several <a href="woven%20coverlet">woven coverlet</a>s produced by the Sloans.

According to Sloan family tradition, Richard and Charlotte Sloan used a method of <a href="Cleromancy">casting lots</a> to decide which of their ten children should marry. Their youngest son James won a contest in <a href="drawing%20straws">drawing straws</a>, and was the only one of their ten children to marry when he wed Magdaline Arnold on January 6, 1834. James and Magdaline operated the Sloan household while the other members attended to their family's weaving business.

Two of Richard and Charlotte Sloan's sons, John and Thomas, were active in the military and in local and state politics. John Sloan served in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> and was later appointed Major General of the 3rdDivision, Virginia Militia, by the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> in 1842. He also served as a county justice from 1824 until 1828, a county surveyor in 1827, a county sheriff in 1839, and a member of the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">Virginia House of Delegates</a> representing Hampshire County from 1825 to 1827. Thomas Sloan represented Hampshire County in the Virginia House of Delegates from 1832 to 1834 and again from 1835 to 1837. He also served as a delegate to the <a href="Virginia%20Constitutional%20Convention%20of%201850">Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1850</a>, representing a district comprising <a href="Frederick%20County%2C%20Virginia">Frederick</a>, Hampshire, and <a href="Morgan%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Morgan</a> counties.

The Sloan family sold the Stone House and of surrounding land to brothers John Peyton Parker, Benjamin Parker, and William Parker on December 29, 1854, for $4,000. Following its acquisition by the Parker brothers, the Stone House continued as the center of a large farm.

Because of its convenient location along the Northwestern Turnpike, the house served as a regional <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a> stop and local <a href="polling%20place">polling place</a>. From the early 19thcentury until the completion of the <a href="South%20Branch%20Valley%20Railroad">Hampshire Southern Railroad</a> to <a href="Petersburg%2C%20West%20Virginia">Petersburg</a> in 1910, this stretch of the Northwestern Turnpike between Romney and Junction was part of a major north–south transportation route connecting <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a> and Romney with <a href="Moorefield%2C%20West%20Virginia">Moorefield</a> and Petersburg to the south. By 1845 the <a href="Moorefield%20and%20North%20Branch%20Turnpike">Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike</a> stage line connected the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a> (B&O) Main Line at <a href="Green%20Spring%2C%20West%20Virginia">Green Spring</a> with the north–south route in <a href="Springfield%2C%20West%20Virginia">Springfield</a>, allowing stagecoach transportation between Green Spring and Moorefield. The route of present-day WV28 aligns with this north–south route from the Maryland state line at <a href="Wiley%20Ford%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wiley Ford</a> to Petersburg, and is concurrent with the Northwestern Turnpike (US50) from Romney to Junction and US220 from Junction to Petersburg.

The Parker family operated their own stagecoach line along the Moorefield and North Branch Turnpike between the B&O Main Line at Green Spring and Moorefield until 1884, when the B&O South Branch Line was completed to Romney Depot. The Parkers' stagecoach line transported passengers down present-day Green Spring Road (CR1), Cumberland Road (WV28), and the Northwestern Turnpike (US50/WV28) to the Stone House, where the stagecoaches would stop to allow passengers to have meals before continuing the journey to Moorefield via present-day US220/WV28. When a stagecoach arrived at the Stone House, a loud horn would sound to announce its arrival, and then meals were provided to the travelers in the basement kitchen and dining areas (or "keeping rooms"). Travelers' horses and other stock were watered and fed outside the basement door. As well as their stagecoach line, the Parker family operated a <a href="toll%20house">toll house</a> on the Northwestern Turnpike on the west side of its crossing of the South Branch Potomac River, approximately northeast of the Stone House.

During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, the Stone House was visited by both <a href="Union%20Army">Union</a> and <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate</a> forces due to its location along the Northwestern Turnpike. The small room under the Stone House's front porch was also used as a <a href="Picket%20%28military%29">picket</a> station to guard the turnpike. Union Army troops ransacked and frequently visited the Stone House to retrieve goods and supplies from the house and farm as they traveled along the Northwestern Turnpike. Despite its convenient location and the Parker family's <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> sympathies, the Stone House and its farm did not suffer major damage during the war. The Federal government later reimbursed the Parker family for the items appropriated by the Union forces during the war. The Parkers were provided with bills annotating the "purchase" of $162.45 in goods and parts during the years 1862, 1863, and 1864. These bills exist today and are in the possession of the Parker family. Extant records also indicate that the Parker family sold farm goods to Confederate forces as well.

One of the Parker brothers, Benjamin Parker, married Isabel "Belle" Parker and they had two sons together: Renick Seymour Parker, who died at the age of 27 years, and John Henry Parker, Sr., who married Eleanor DuBois Johnson. She had the wooden frame section added to the Stone House around 1900, at which time the Sloan–Parker House took its current form. After Eleanor Parker died, her husband John Henry, Sr., married Kate Parker.

The Sloan–Parker House occasionally served as a polling place for the Junction community after 1900, and it ceased being used as a stagecoach stop following the completion of the Hampshire Southern Railroad in 1910. The house and farm were formerly serviced by post offices operated in nearby Junction from 1866 to 1868, 1874 to 1876 (as Moorefield Junction), and 1877 until 1997 when service was suspended. Junction's post office was finally shuttered in 2005; afterward, the house was assigned a Romney address.

By 1962 John Henry Parker, Jr., the son of John Henry, Sr. and Kate Parker, was residing at the Sloan–Parker House with his wife Ruth Harmison Parker and their son David Renick Parker. While under their ownership and through their efforts, the Sloan–Parker House and an adjacent were added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on June 5, 1975. It became Hampshire County's first property to be listed on the register.

Ruth Harmison Parker was a local historian and member of the Hampshire County Historical Society. She and her husband opened the Sloan–Parker House for tours in 1962, and again in July 1976, when they displayed furniture, glassware, coverlets, and Civil War relics handed down from the Sloan and Parker families. John Henry Parker, Jr., died in 2000, and his wife Ruth died in 2005. David Parker is a seventh generation male-line descendant of early Mill Creek settler Jeb Parker. He and his wife Jill have three daughters and one son.

The Sloan–Parker House, as of 2018, consists of the original stone section (built ), which faces toward the Northwestern Turnpike, and a <a href="Framing%20%28construction%29">wooden frame</a> addition (built c.1900) positioned adjacent to the original stone section. Together, the stone section and the frame addition form a T-shaped structure. The original stone section of the house, built of fieldstone, has remained mostly unchanged since its initial construction; slight alterations were made to accommodate the frame addition. Similarly, the frame addition has undergone only minor modifications since its construction.

The Sloan–Parker House derives its other name as the "Stone House" from this original section of the house. The stone section was built using locally available materials, and its size was probably considered large for its time. It is rectangular in its plan and measures approximately in width and in depth. The stone section is symmetrical in its overall interior and exterior design with minor exceptions in its basement. It consists of two stories, one basement level, and an attic. The stone section is topped with a steep metal <a href="gable">gable</a>d roof with <a href="Metal%20roof%23Material%20types">standing seam</a> profiles. The stone section's exterior wall is about thick at the basement level and tapers to a thickness of about at the attic level.

The north elevation (main façade) has three <a href="Bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a> on its first and second stories and one window in the western room of its basement level. Three six-over-nine double-hung wooden <a href="sash%20window">sash window</a>s are on the second story, two nine-over-one double-hung wooden sash windows are on the first story, and one small window with two sliding panels of four panes each is on the basement level. At the center of the north elevation, a tall stone platform reaches from the ground to the first story and supports a large covered porch framed with wooden handrails and <a href="baluster">balustrades</a> on its north and west sides. The porch's roof is supported by five square wooden columns: three along the north edge and two <a href="engaged%20column">engaged column</a>s against the house's stone exterior. The porch is topped with a metal roof with standing seam profiles. The front door, located between the first story's two large windows, features vertical boards on its exterior side and horizontal boards on its interior side. The front door is topped by a four-pane <a href="Transom%20%28architectural%29">transom window</a>.

The east and west elevations of the stone section of the house are similar in design, but the west elevation has a door and large porch at the basement level. It also has a small one-over-one double-hung wooden sash window on the first story that was added after the wooden frame section was constructed. The stone section's east elevation features a small porch and a door, which were built onto the north end of the first floor around 1915. The porch is topped with a metal roof with standing seam profiles, and is supported by three wooden <a href="Tuscan%20order">Tuscan</a> columns and two square wooden engaged columns against the house. Both the east and west elevations of the stone section have an interior fieldstone chimney. At the top of each chimney, the original fieldstone has been replaced with brick. Each chimney is centered between two small two-over-four double-hung wooden sash windows at the attic level.

The south elevation (rear façade) of the stone section remains intact, and serves as the northern wall of the wooden frame section. A window in the stone section's second story was removed to connect the second story of the wooden frame addition. Likewise, what used to be the stone section's rear door now connects the first floor of the stone section with the wooden frame section. This door is also topped by a four-pane transom window.

The interior of the stone section contains two floors, each with two rooms, in addition to a basement and attic. The former kitchen and dining room (or "keeping rooms") are on the west side of the basement level, and feature a large fireplace. The east side of the basement serves as a large storage area. The two rooms on the first floor formerly served as bedrooms, but they are now used as formal living and sitting rooms. The first floor originally had one fireplace on the east side, but the design was changed around 1915 to allow for a fireplace on the west side as well. The second story consists of two bedrooms, each with a fireplace. The attic is completely open from west to east. The rafters are exposed, and secured together with wooden pins. They still contain markings of letters and numbers that enabled the proper placement of components as they were lifted from the ground during construction. The majority of the stone section's flooring, and the <a href="Door%20furniture">hardware</a> on the doors, are original.

The wooden frame section of the Sloan–Parker House features various sizes and types of doors and windows. A deep porch adjoins the east and south elevations of the frame section, and reaches to a canted three-bay window on the frame section's west side. The entire frame section is covered with wooden shingles and is topped with a steep metal roof with standing seam profiles. The interior of the frame section consists of a dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and several bedrooms.

Ancillary structures on the Sloan–Parker House farm consist of an old log smokehouse, and a large barn erected in 1803. Widely spaced unhewn logs are located on the barn's interior and its south elevation. The remainder of the barn is enclosed with <a href="Framing%20%28construction%29">wooden framing</a>. There are also several other barns and storage buildings on the property.

The Sloan–Ludwick Cemetery is approximately northeast of the Sloan–Parker House in a grove of trees along the edge of an agricultural field. Richard Sloan and his wife Charlotte VanHorn Sloan are <a href="burial">interred</a> in this cemetery. Other burials in the cemetery include Richard Sloan's son Major General John Sloan and American Revolutionary War soldier Leonard Ludwick and his wife Katherine. Benjamin Parker and some of his descendants were buried in this cemetery before they were reinterred at <a href="Indian%20Mound%20Cemetery">Indian Mound Cemetery</a> in Romney.

Cleopatra Selene of Syria

Cleopatra Selene (; – 69 BC) was the monarch of Syria as Cleopatra II Selene (82–69 BC). She was the daughter of <a href="Ptolemy%20VIII%20Physcon">Ptolemy VIII of Egypt</a> by <a href="Cleopatra%20III%20of%20Egypt">Cleopatra III</a>, in whose political maneuvers Cleopatra Selene, favored by her mother, became a pawn. In 115 BC, Cleopatra III forced her son <a href="Ptolemy%20IX%20Lathyros">Ptolemy IX</a> to divorce his sister-wife <a href="Cleopatra%20IV%20of%20Egypt">Cleopatra IV</a>, and chose Cleopatra Selene as the new queen consort of Egypt. Tension between the king and his mother grew and ended with his expulsion from Egypt, leaving Cleopatra Selene behind; she probably then married the new king, her other brother <a href="Ptolemy%20X%20Alexander%20I">Ptolemy X</a>.

In 102 BC, Cleopatra III decided to establish an alliance with <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> of <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> <a href="Syria%20%28region%29">Syria</a>; Cleopatra Selene was sent as his bride and stayed with him until his assassination in 96 BC. The now widowed queen decided to marry Antiochus VIII's brother <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a>, but she lost her new husband in 95 BC. Her last marriage was to her stepson, Antiochus IX's heir <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a>, who disappeared from the records and is presumed to have died in 92 BC. Cleopatra Selene hid somewhere in Syria with her children until 83/82 BC (230 <a href="Seleucid%20era">Seleucid year (SE)</a>), when the Seleucid throne in <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a>, ruled by <a href="Antiochus%20XII%20Dionysus">Antiochus XII</a>, became vacant.

Cleopatra Selene had many children by several husbands; probably following the death of Antiochus XII, she declared <a href="Antiochus%20XIII%20Asiaticus">Antiochus XIII</a>, her son by Antiochus X, king, and seems to have declared herself co-ruler. But the people of the Syrian capital <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a> and the governor of the southern capital Damascus, exhausted by the Seleucids' civil wars, invited foreign monarchs to rule them: <a href="Tigranes%20the%20Great">Tigranes II</a> of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Armenia</a> took Antioch, while <a href="Aretas%20III">Aretas III</a> of <a href="Nabataean%20Kingdom">Nabataea</a> took Damascus. Cleopatra Selene controlled several coastal towns until Tigranes II besieged her in 69 BC in <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Ptolemais</a>; the Armenian king captured the queen and later executed her.

By the second century BC, the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a> and the <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Ptolemaic Kingdom</a> were weakened by dynastic feuds, constant wars against each other (known as the <a href="Syrian%20Wars">Syrian Wars</a>), and <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> interference. To ease the tension, the two dynasties intermarried. <a href="Cleopatra%20I%20Syra">Cleopatra I</a> of Syria married <a href="Ptolemy%20V%20Epiphanes">Ptolemy V</a> of Egypt in 193 BC, and her granddaughter <a href="Cleopatra%20Thea">Cleopatra Thea</a> married three Syrian kings in succession starting in 150 BC. Those intermarriages helped Egypt destabilize Syria which was especially fragmented between different claimants to the throne; brothers fought between themselves and Egypt interfered by supporting one claimant against the other.

Cleopatra Selene was born between 135 and 130 BC to <a href="Ptolemy%20VIII%20Physcon">Ptolemy VIII</a> and <a href="Cleopatra%20III%20of%20Egypt">Cleopatra III</a>. Cleopatra Selene had many siblings, including <a href="Ptolemy%20IX%20Lathyros">Ptolemy IX</a>, <a href="Ptolemy%20X%20Alexander%20I">Ptolemy X</a>, and <a href="Cleopatra%20IV%20of%20Egypt">Cleopatra IV</a>. Ancient writers, such as <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> and <a href="Appian">Appian</a>, mention that the queen's name is Selene, and <a href="Strabo">Strabo</a> clarified that she was surnamed "Cleopatra". On the other hand, modern scholars, such as Arthur Houghton and Catharine Lorber, believed that Selene was actulay an epithet. The archaeologist Nicholas L. Wright suggested that she assumed the epithet "Selene" when she became queen of Egypt and that it is a divinising epithet, indicating that Cleopatra Selene presented herself as the manifestation of the moon goddess on earth. Coins struck in her name record her as Cleopatra Selene. Selene was the name of the Greek <a href="Selene">moon goddess</a> and it is connected to the word selas (σέλας), meaning "light". "Cleopatra" was a Ptolemaic dynastic name; it means "famous in her father" or "renowned in her ancestry". As a queen of Syria, she was the second to rule with the name 'Cleopatra'. Hence, she is termed "Cleopatra II Selene" to differentiate her from her predecessor and aunt Cleopatra I Thea, who was the mother of Cleopatra Selene's husbands <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> and <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a>. Classicist <a href="Grace%20Macurdy">Grace Macurdy</a> numbered Cleopatra Selene as "Cleopatra V" within the Ptolemaic dynasty and many historians have used this convention.

<a href="Sibling%20marriage">Sibling marriage</a> was known in ancient Egypt and, although it was not a general practice, it was acceptable for the Egyptians; the Ptolemaics practiced it, perhaps to consolidate the dynasty. In 116 BC, Ptolemy VIII died and his will left Cleopatra III to rule alongside a co-ruler of her choice from between her two sons; she wanted to choose Ptolemy X but the people of <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> (the capital of Egypt) opposed this, forcing her to accept Ptolemy IX's ascension to the throne. Shortly after his elevation, Cleopatra III forced Ptolemy IX to divorce Cleopatra IV, his sister whom he had married before their father's death; the 2nd-century historian <a href="Justin%20%28historian%29">Justin</a> implied that Cleopatra III made this a condition of accepting him as co-ruler. Cleopatra Selene, favored by her mother Cleopatra III, was chosen as the new queen consort in 115 BC. In 107 BC, the relationship between Ptolemy IX and his mother deteriorated; Cleopatra III forced him out of Egypt, and he left his wife and children behind.

The same year, 107 BC, Cleopatra Selene was probably married off to the new king, her younger brother, Ptolemy X. In 103 BC, Ptolemy IX was fighting in <a href="Judea">Judea</a>. The queen mother feared an alliance against her between Ptolemy IX and his friend Antiochus IX of Syria, who was fighting a civil war with his brother Antiochus VIII; this led her to send troops to Syria. Cleopatra III and Ptolemy X conquered <a href="Acre%2C%20Israel">Ptolemais</a>, and according to Justin, the king, shocked by his mother's cruelty, abandoned her and ran away; Cleopatra III then decided to marry Cleopatra Selene to Antiochus VIII, as a step to bring Antiochus VIII to her side in order to counter an alliance between Ptolemy IX and Antiochus IX. If it is accepted that Cleopatra Selene married Ptolemy X, then Cleopatra III divorced her from him after he deserted.

The marriage of Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus VIII took place c. 102 BC; historian Leo Kadman suggested that Cleopatra III gave her daughter to the Syrian king in Ptolemais before she retreated to Egypt, and that Cleopatra Selene kept that city as her main base until the end of her life. Details of Cleopatra Selene's life with Antiochus VIII are not clear; no known offspring resulted from the marriage, though six of Antiochus VIII's children from his previous marriage are known. In 96 BC, <a href="Herakleon%20of%20Beroia">Herakleon of Beroia</a>, a general of Antiochus VIII, assassinated his monarch and tried to usurp the throne, but failed and retreated to his home-town <a href="Aleppo">Beroia</a>. The capital of Syria, <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>, was part of Antiochus VIII's realm at the time of his assassination; Cleopatra Selene probably resided there.

The queen held out in the capital for a while before marrying Antiochus IX. The manner in which Antiochus IX took control of Antioch and his new wife in 95 BC is not clear; he could have taken the city by force or it could be that Cleopatra Selene herself opened the gates for him. In the view of historian <a href="Auguste%20Bouch%C3%A9-Leclercq">Auguste Bouché-Leclercq</a>, Cleopatra Selene had little reason to trust the five sons of her previous husband; the queen needed an ally who would help her control the capital while Antiochus IX needed a wife and Cleopatra Selene's influence over the city's garrison and her late husband's officials. It is unlikely that this marriage was received well by Antiochus VIII's sons. The first of them to act was <a href="Seleucus%20VI%20Epiphanes">Seleucus VI</a> who was established in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. Within a year of his marriage to Cleopatra Selene, Antiochus IX marched against his nephew but was defeated and killed. Soon afterwards, Seleucus entered the capital. Cleopatra Selene probably fled before the new king's arrival. Alternatively, she might have been sent to <a href="Arwad">Arados</a> by Antiochus IX for protection before he marched against Seleucus.

In 218 SE (95/94 BC), <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a>, the son of Antiochus IX, proclaimed himself king in Arados, and married Cleopatra Selene. The Seleucid dynasty had a precedent of a son marrying his stepmother: <a href="Antiochus%20I%20Soter">Antiochus I</a> had married his stepmother <a href="Stratonice%20of%20Syria">Stratonice</a>, and this might have made it easier for Cleopatra Selene. Yet, the marriage was scandalous. Appian wrote an anecdote concerning the epithet of Antiochus X, ""Eusebes"" ("the pious"): the Syrians gave it to him to mock his show of loyalty to his father by bedding his widow. The rationale for the marriage might have been pragmatic: Antiochus X sought to be king, but had little resources and needed a queen. Cleopatra Selene was in her forties and could not simply marry a foreign king. Antiochus X pushed Seleucus VI out of Antioch in 94 BC and ruled northern Syria and Cilicia, while Seleucus VI's brothers <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus">Philip I</a> and <a href="Demetrius%20III%20Eucaerus">Demetrius III</a> ruled Beroea and <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> respectively. The last evidence for the reign of Antiochus X is dated to 92 BC; he is generally assumed to have died at around this date. However, ancient sources contain contradictory accounts and dates, and the numismatist Oliver D. Hoover suggested the date of 224 SE (89/88 BC) for Antiochus X's demise. Antioch was taken by Demetrius III then Philip I.

Cleopatra Selene's location during the reign of Antiochus X's successors in Antioch is unknown. She evidently took shelter with her children somewhere in the kingdom, and possibly fled to Cilicia or <a href="Coele-Syria">Coele-Syria</a>, probably the city of Ptolemais, which she held until her death. <a href="Antiochus%20XII%20Dionysus">Antiochus XII</a>, another son of Antiochus VIII who was ruling in Damascus, died in 230 SE (83/82 BC). With the throne of Antiochus XII vacant, Cleopatra Selene declared her son <a href="Antiochus%20XIII%20Asiaticus">Antiochus XIII</a> king.

Based on the evidence of the coins depicting her alongside her ruling son, it appears that Cleopatra Selene acted as the regent. Many of those coins have been found, and they depict Antiochus XIII in the background and herself in the foreground, in the style of a <a href="queen%20regnant">queen regnant</a>, where Cleopatra Selene's name is written before that of the king's. When she declared her son king, Cleopatra Selene controlled lands in Cilicia or <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a> or both. The archaeologist <a href="Alfred%20Bellinger">Alfred Bellinger</a> suggested that she was in control of several coastal Syrian cities from a base in Cilicia; she certainly controlled Ptolemais and probably <a href="Seleucia%20Pieria">Seleucia Pieria</a>. The 1st-century historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> wrote of "Selene ... who ruled in Syria", indicating her continued influence despite her never controlling the capital Antioch. Her children probably remained in Cilicia or somewhere else in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a> for protection, which would explain Antiochus XIII's nickname, ""Asiaticus"".

According to Josephus, "those that held Damascus" invited <a href="Aretas%20III">Aretas III</a>, King of the <a href="Nabataeans">Nabataeans</a>, to rule them because they feared Ptolemy (son of Mennaeus), king of the <a href="Iturea">Iturea</a>. Damascus' history between the death of Antiochus XII and 241 SE (72/71 BC), when the Armenian king Tigranes II took the city, is obscure. Based on her <a href="jugate">jugate</a> coins which depict her alongside Antiochus XIII, Hoover suggested that Selene operated from Damascus; those coins used a broken-bar <a href="Alpha">Alpha</a>, cursive <a href="Epsilon">Epsilon</a> and squared <a href="Sigma">Sigma</a>. This typography appeared in the Damascene coins of Demetrius III and Antiochus XII and is otherwise rare in the Hellenistic world. If her currency was minted in Damascus, then it dates to the period between the death of Antiochus XII and Tigranes II' occupation of the city. Two scenarios are possible:


In the north, Philip I ruled until his death, after which Cleopatra Selene claimed the rights of her children with Antiochus X to the vacant throne. The queen's claims of authority were not generally accepted by the Syrians, and the people of Antioch invited Tigranes II to rule Syria, being frustrated by the Seleucids' constant civil wars. The year in which this event took place is debated; 83 BC is, without any proof, commonly accepted as Philip I's year of death by the majority of scholars who count on the account of Appian, who assigned a reign of fourteen years for Tigranes II, which ended in 69 BC. Oliver D. Hoover suggested that <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus%23End%20and%20Succession">Tigranes II invaded Syria only in 74 BC</a>, with Philip I ruling until 75 BC in Northern Syria, allowing Cleopatra Selene and Antiochus XIII to claim the country unopposed for a while. An argument in favor of Cleopatra Selene and her son being the sole claiments of Syria in 75 BC is a statement by Cicero: the Roman statesman wrote that Antiochus XIII and his brother were sent to Rome by their mother in 75 BC. They returned to Syria in 240 SE (73/72 BC); the brothers claimed the throne of Egypt based on their mother's birthright. To impress the <a href="Roman%20Senate">Roman Senate</a>, the queen endowed her children with sufficient assets, which included a jewelled candelabrum that was dedicated to the temple of <a href="Temple%20of%20Jupiter%20Optimus%20Maximus">Jupiter Capitolinus</a>. The Senate refused to hear their petition for the Egyptian throne, but, according to Cicero, their "de jure" right to the Syrian throne which they had inherited from their ancestors was already acknowledged.

The statement of Cicero indicates that in 75 BC, Tigranes II was still not in control of Syria, for if he were, Antiochus XIII would have asked the Roman Senate for support to regain Syria, since Tigranes II was the son-in-law of Rome's enemy, <a href="Mithridates%20VI%20of%20Pontus">Mithridates VI of Pontus</a>. Likewise, Philip I could not have been alive since Antiochus XIII went to Rome without having to assert his right to Syria. In a paper presented at the 131st annual meeting of the <a href="American%20Historical%20Association">American Historical Association</a>, <a href="Nikolaus%20Overtoom">Nikolaus Overtoom</a>, based on Hoover's chronology, suggested that Cleopatra Selene was in control of the south while Philip I ruled the north until 75 BC; his death meant that Cleopatra Selene's son was the strongest candidate to the throne, but Philip I's faction, being opposed to Cleopatra Selene, offered the crown to Tigranes II who invaded and conquered the country in 74 BC.

The regency of Cleopatra Selene probably ended in 75 BC as the journey of Antiochus XIII to Rome indicates that he had already reached his majority or was close to it. Tigranes II, whose invasion probably took place during Antiochus XIII's absence, never controlled the entire country and took Damascus only in 72 BC. Cleopatra Selene resisted the Armenians in Ptolemais while Antiochus XIII probably took shelter in Cilicia. In 69 BC, Tigranes II besieged Ptolemais; the city fell according to Josephus, but Tigranes II had to move north fast as the Romans started attacking Armenia. According to Strabo, Tigranes II imprisoned the queen in <a href="Seleucia%20at%20the%20Zeugma">Seleucia</a> and later had her killed. Those accounts seem to contradict each other, but in the view of the seventeenth century historian <a href="William%20Whiston">William Whiston</a>, they do not, since Josephus does not mention that Tigranes II captured the queen in Ptolemais. Historian <a href="John%20D.%20Grainger">John D. Grainger</a> explained Tigranes II' action as a consequence of Cleopatra Selene's political importance; she was a winning card in the hands of her husbands, and Tigranes II sought to deny other ambitious men from acquiring influence through her. Others see Cleopatra Selene as a pawn in political schemes who later evolved into a schemer in her own right, one who decided her actions effectively based on her own benefit.

Cleopatra Selene's long career, as the wife of three successive Syrian monarchs, and the mother of one and a ruler in her own right, in addition to her divine status, turned her into a symbol of Seleucid continuity. The ancient <a href="Near%20East">Near East</a> was ruled by successive dynasties whose monarchs claimed the title of <a href="Great%20King">Great King</a>, i.e. imperial overlord. When the Romans ended the Seleucid dynasty in 64 BC, they attempted to simply replace the Syrian monarchs as an imperial authority, but the political reality of Rome as a republic meant that its legitimacy in the East was questioned. The Seleucid <a href="diadem">diadem</a> was considered a symbol of legitimacy even after the fall of the Seleucid dynasty, and many eastern kings, such as the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian</a> monarch <a href="Mithridates%20II%20of%20Parthia">Mithridates II</a>, used Seleucid royal iconography to gain the local nobility's support in their domains. The Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt were the closest relatives of the Seleucids and their legitimate successors; <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra VII</a> of Egypt used the name of Cleopatra Selene for her daughter <a href="Cleopatra%20Selene%20II">Cleopatra Selene of Mauretania</a>, born 40 BC; this can be viewed in the context of Cleopatra VII's attempts to claim the Seleucid succession rights in the East.


Cleopatra Selene possibly bore Ptolemy X his son <a href="Ptolemy%20XI%20Alexander%20II">Ptolemy XI</a> but her maternity can not be confirmed; Cleopatra IV might have been the mother instead, but this is also an assumption and the identity of Ptolemy XI's mother remains a mystery.

Identifying Antiochus X and Cleopatra Selene's children is problematic; Cicero wrote that the queen had two sons, one of them named Antiochus. More children, perhaps a daughter, might have resulted from the marriage, but it can not be confirmed; according to <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>, Tigranes II "put to death the successors of Seleucus, and [carried] off their wives and daughters into captivity". Thus, it is possible that Cleopatra Selene had a daughter captured by Tigranes II.

Hod Stuart

William Hodgson "Hod" Stuart (February 20, 1879 – June 23, 1907) was a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> <a href="defenceman%20%28ice%20hockey%29">cover-point</a> (now known as a defenceman) who played nine seasons for several teams in different leagues. He also played briefly for the <a href="Ottawa%20Rough%20Riders">Ottawa Rough Riders</a> <a href="Canadian%20football">football</a> team. With his brother <a href="Bruce%20Stuart">Bruce</a>, Stuart played in the first professional ice hockey league, the American-based <a href="International%20Professional%20Hockey%20League">International Professional Hockey League</a> (IPHL), where he was regarded as one of the best players in the league.

Frustrated with the violence associated with the IPHL, he left the league late in 1906 and returned to Canada, where in 1907 he helped the <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Montreal Wanderers</a> win the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>, the championship trophy for hockey. Two months later, he died in a diving accident. To raise money for his widow and children, the <a href="Eastern%20Canada%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association</a> hosted an all-star game, the first of its kind to be played in any sport. An estimated 3,800 spectators attended the Hod Stuart Memorial Game on January 2, 1908, described by the "Montreal Herald" as "unique in the history of hockey in Montreal, if not in the whole of Canada".

In an era when <a href="defencemen">defencemen</a> were expected to stay behind during the play, Stuart became known for his ability to score goals while playing a defensive role, and for his ability to remain calm during matches that often turned violent. He also became known for his work to reduce that violence and to increase the salaries of hockey players. His efforts were acknowledged when the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> was created in 1945 and he became one of the first nine players to be inducted. He was joined there by his brother Bruce in 1961.

Stuart was born in Ottawa, Ontario, the eldest son of William Stuart and Rachel Hodgson. He had two brothers, Alex and Bruce, and two sisters, Jessie and Lottio. Stuart was involved in sports from an early age. His father had been a good <a href="curling">curler</a> and was once point <a href="skip%20%28curling%29">skip</a> of the <a href="Ottawa%20Curling%20Club">Ottawa Curling Club</a>, and both Hod and Bruce played hockey from a young age, often for the same teams. Stuart also played <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a> and <a href="Canadian%20football">football</a>, and played for the local professional football team, the <a href="Ottawa%20Rough%20Riders">Ottawa Rough Riders</a>.

Outside of hockey Stuart worked as a bricklayer, and later in his life he also worked with his father in construction. He was said to have been a quiet person, and unlike other athletes of his era was not one to talk about his exploits, except with close friends. Loughlin, his wife, came from Quebec; around 1903 they were married and had two children together.

Stuart first joined a senior hockey team when he spent the winter of 1895–1896 with the <a href="Kenora%20Thistles">Rat Portage Thistles</a>, a team in northwestern Ontario. Along with his brother Bruce, Stuart joined the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators%20%28original%29">Ottawa Hockey Club</a> of the <a href="Canadian%20Amateur%20Hockey%20League">Canadian Amateur Hockey League</a> (CAHL) for the <a href="1899%20CAHL%20season">1899 season</a>. He played the <a href="1900%20CAHL%20season">1900 season</a> for Ottawa, captaining the team. Through his father's business contacts, Stuart got a job in Quebec and moved there in 1900; upon arriving there he joined the <a href="Quebec%20Bulldogs">Quebec Bulldogs</a>, also of the CAHL. He scored seven goals in fifteen games with the team over the next two seasons.
In 1902, the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Bankers">Pittsburgh Bankers</a> of the <a href="Western%20Pennsylvania%20Hockey%20League">Western Pennsylvania Hockey League</a> signed Stuart to a professional contract; this was disputed between the Bankers and the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Victorias">Pittsburgh Victorias</a>, who also claimed him. Eventually the Bankers won the dispute and kept Stuart; the following year they would also sign Bruce. Stuart was offered a salary of US$15–20 per week, plus steady income from a day job in Pittsburgh. Stuart scored seven goals and had eight assists and was named the best cover-point in the league in <a href="1903%20WPHL%20season">1903</a>.

After one season in Pittsburgh, Stuart moved to the <a href="Portage%20Lakes%20Hockey%20Club">Portage Lakes Hockey Club</a>, a team in northern Michigan, for the 1903–1904 season and played in fourteen exhibition games, finishing fourth on the team with thirteen goals scored. With the formation of the <a href="International%20Professional%20Hockey%20League">International Professional Hockey League</a>, Stuart left Portage Lake for the <a href="Calumet%20Miners">Calumet Miners</a>, where he accepted the positions of coach and manager, in addition to playing cover-point, for $1,800. He scored eighteen goals for Calumet in <a href="1904%E2%80%9305%20IPHL%20season">1904–1905</a>, helped the team with the league championship and was named to the end of season all-star team as the best cover-point in the league.
On December 11, 1905, before the start of the <a href="1905%E2%80%9306%20IPHL%20season">1905–06 season</a>, Stuart was suspended from the league after the western teams complained that he had won too many championships and was too rough for the league. He was reinstated by the league on December 30, and joined the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Professionals">Pittsburgh Professionals</a>. After Pittsburgh finished their season, Stuart joined Calumet for one game so they could try to win the league championship, which they lost to the Portage Lakes Hockey Club. Once again he was named best cover-point in the IPHL as he scored eleven goals. A big man with a fluid skating stride, he was considered the finest defenceman of his era for his outstanding play on both offence and defence.

As the IPHL convinced players to move to the United States and get paid to play, hockey teams in Canada were forced to match the salaries in order to keep their players. Stuart, who was unhappy playing in Pittsburgh because of the violence involved in games, heard from <a href="Dickie%20Boon">Dickie Boon</a> that the <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Montreal Wanderers</a>, defending <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> winners, of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) were willing to make Stuart the highest paid player in hockey if he were to join the team. On December 13, 1906, Stuart had a letter published in the "Montreal Star" that detailed his problems with the IPHL. Stuart's chief concern was the officiating; he said they "don't know how to run hockey over here, the rink people appoint the most dumb and incompetent referees that could be found." In December 1906 Pittsburgh refused to play a game against <a href="Michigan%20Soo%20Indians">Michigan Soo</a>, claiming they did not like the choice of referee. While a common problem in the IPHL, Pittsburgh's management believed Stuart was behind the action, and released him from the team. No longer bound to any team, Stuart joined the Wanderers; his first game with the team was watched by 6,069 fans. He took part in the Wanderers' Stanley Cup challenge against the <a href="New%20Glasgow%20Cubs">New Glasgow Cubs</a>, a team from Nova Scotia, on December 27 and 29, 1906, and along with teammates <a href="Riley%20Hern">Riley Hern</a>, <a href="Frank%20Glass">Frank Glass</a>, <a href="Moose%20Johnson">Moose Johnson</a> and <a href="Jack%20Marshall%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Jack Marshall</a>, became the first professional hockey players to compete for the Stanley Cup.

Stuart did not escape violence in the ECAHA. On January 12, 1907, the Wanderers faced the Ottawa Senators, a game the Wanderers ultimately won 4–2. <a href="Charles%20Spittal">Charles Spittal</a> of Ottawa was described as "attempting to split <a href="Cecil%20Blachford">Cecil Blachford</a>'s skull", <a href="Alf%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Alf Smith</a> hit Stuart "across the temple with his stick, laying him out like a corpse", and <a href="Harry%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Harry Smith</a> cracked his stick across <a href="Ernest%20Johnson%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Ernie "Moose" Johnson</a>'s face, breaking Johnson's nose. Stuart was commended for his actions during the game; it was said that he neither flinched nor retaliated, even after bearing most of the hits. At a league meeting on January 18, the <a href="Montreal%20Victorias">Montreal Victorias</a> proposed suspending Spittal and Alf Smith for the season in response to their actions, but this was voted down and the president of the league, Fred McRobie, resigned. The next time the Senators visited Montreal for a game, the police arrested Spittal, Alf and Harry Smith, leading to $20 fines for Spittal and Alf, and an acquittal for Harry. Even with the persistent violence, Stuart helped the Wanderers to an undefeated season; they then accepted a challenge from the <a href="Kenora%20Thistles">Kenora Thistles</a> for the Stanley Cup. The Thistles won the series, held in January, but lost a rematch between the teams in March, giving the Cup back to the Wanderers. Stuart participated in both challenges, and though did not score a goal in any of the four games, he was said to have played the best game of his career in the first game of the series, even with a broken finger. Regarded as the most important player on the Wanderers, Stuart was said to know how to play every position on the ice, and passed his knowledge of the game onto his teammates.

Tired of the constant violence, Stuart quit hockey after the Stanley Cup championship in 1907 and joined his father in construction. As part of this job, Stuart was sent to Belleville, Ontario, to oversee the building of the Belleville Drill Shed, one of his father's contracts. While in Belleville, he continued to receive offers to join a new hockey team. He was asked if he wanted to manage the Belleville team; a similar offer came from Peterborough, Ontario, while a town outside Toronto was said to have offered a railroad president's salary if Stuart would join them. On the afternoon of June 23, 1907, Stuart went to the Bay of Quinte, near Belleville, to swim with some friends. Stuart swam to the nearby lighthouse, about half a kilometre away from his group, climbed onto a platform and dived into the shallow water. He dived head first onto jagged rocks, gashing his head and breaking his neck. He was killed instantly. His body was brought back to Ottawa, where a service was held at his family's home before he was buried at <a href="Beechwood%20Cemetery%20%28Ottawa%2C%20Ontario%29">Beechwood Cemetery</a>.

To raise money for Stuart's widow and two children, the ECAHA decided to host an all-star game, the first of its kind to be played in any sport. An estimated 3,800 spectators attended the Hod Stuart Memorial Game on January 2, 1908, with tickets selling out days in advance. Described by the "Montreal Herald" as "unique in the history of hockey in Montreal, if not in the whole of Canada," the event featured the <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Montreal Wanderers</a>, Stuart's former team, playing against a squad of top players from the other teams in the ECAHA. The <a href="Westmount%20Arena">Westmount Arena</a> agreed to host the event for no charge, and all proceeds from the game went to Stuart's family, totalling over $2,100. Fans were asked to mail in choices of who should play on the all-star team, with the contest winners given two tickets to the game. The Wanderers, an established team, played better than the All-Stars, who had to learn to play together, and led 7–1 after the first half of the game; though the All-Stars played better in the second half, the Wanderers won by a score of 10–7.

The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (film)

The Revolution Will Not Be Televised (Spanish: ), also known as Chávez: Inside the Coup, is a 2003 documentary focusing on events in <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> leading up to and during the <a href="2002%20Venezuelan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempt">April 2002 coup d'état attempt</a>, which saw President <a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Hugo Chávez</a> removed from office for two days. With particular emphasis on the role played by Venezuela's private media, the film examines several key incidents: the protest march and subsequent violence that provided the impetus for Chávez's ousting; the opposition's formation of an interim government headed by business leader <a href="Pedro%20Carmona">Pedro Carmona</a>; and the Carmona administration's collapse, which paved the way for Chávez's return. "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" was directed by Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha Ó Briain. Given direct access to Chávez, the filmmakers intended to make a <a href="Reality%20television%23Documentary-style">fly-on-the-wall</a> biography of the president. They spent seven months filming in Venezuela, following Chávez and his staff and interviewing ordinary citizens. As the coup unfolded on 11 April, Bartley and Ó Briain filmed on the streets of the capital, <a href="Caracas">Caracas</a>, capturing footage of protesters and the erupting violence. Later, they filmed many of the political upheavals inside <a href="Miraflores%20Palace">Miraflores</a>, the presidential palace.

Bartley and Ó Briain conceived of the film after Bartley returned from documenting the aftermath of the <a href="1999%20Vargas%20mudslides">1999 Vargas mudslides</a> for an Irish charity. Following a visit to Venezuela to determine the feasibility of a film project, the pair formed a production company and applied to Ireland's film board, <a href="Bord%20Scann%C3%A1n%20na%20h%C3%89ireann">Bord Scannán na hÉireann</a> (BSÉ), for a development grant. At BSÉ's request, the filmmakers partnered with a more experienced producer and shot a short pilot to show to potential investors. Funding for the €200,000 production was provided by BSÉ and several European broadcasters. Bartley and Ó Briain shot more than 200 hours of material; editing focused on identifying footage that would make the film entertaining and drive the plot. It was at this stage that the film's coverage narrowed to concentrate more on the coup attempt.

The film was positively received by mainstream film critics and won several awards. Reviewers cited the filmmakers' unprecedented proximity to key events and praised the film for its "riveting narrative"; criticism focused on its lack of context and pro-Chávez bias. First shown on television in Europe and Venezuela in 2003, "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" later appeared at film festivals and secured a limited theatrical release on the art house circuit. Independent activists held unofficial screenings, and Venezuelan government officials encouraged its circulation to build support for Chávez's administration. The film is regularly shown on Venezuelan television, and in the capital it is often broadcast during "contentious political conjunctures". "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" paints Chávez in a favorable light, which has led to disputes over its neutrality and accuracy; particular attention is paid to its framing of the violence of 11–13 April, the filmmakers' editing of the timeline, and the alleged omission of incidents and personnel. The film is variously cited as an accurate portrayal or a misrepresentation of the events of April 2002.

Throughout much of the twentieth century, Venezuela was beset by political, civil and military unrest. After <a href="Juan%20Vicente%20G%C3%B3mez">Juan Vicente Gómez</a>'s long reign as president ended in 1935, a series of military rulers followed, concluding with <a href="Marcos%20P%C3%A9rez%20Jim%C3%A9nez">Marcos Pérez Jiménez</a>'s overthrow by general uprising in 1958. Although the military remained influential, Venezuela's government has since been chosen by civilians through democratic processes. Until 1998, the dominant political parties were <a href="Acci%C3%B3n%20Democr%C3%A1tica">Acción Democrática</a> and <a href="COPEI">COPEI</a>, who shared seven presidencies between them. In 1989, during the second term in office for Acción Democrática's <a href="Carlos%20Andr%C3%A9s%20P%C3%A9rez">Carlos Andrés Pérez</a>, Venezuela was hit by a severe economic crisis. A wave of protests known as the "<a href="Caracazo">Caracazo</a>" engulfed the country and dozens were killed in rioting.
<a href="Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Hugo Chávez</a>, then a <a href="Military%20career%20of%20Hugo%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Lieutenant Colonel in the army</a>, had formed a secret revolutionary group (<a href="MBR-200">MBR-200</a>) in the early 1980s and was planning a "rebellious intervention". He later felt the "Caracazo" was a missed opportunity for his movement. Three years later, Chávez saw another chance; in February 1992, he led an <a href="1992%20Venezuelan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat%20attempts">unsuccessful military coup d'état</a> and was imprisoned. A second coup attempt, without his involvement, also failed. Chávez enjoyed some popular support for his actions. Released from prison in 1994, he recast his revolutionary group as a legitimate <a href="socialism">socialist</a> political party, the <a href="Fifth%20Republic%20Movement">Fifth Republic Movement</a>. The movement adopted former Venezuelan leader <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Simón Bolívar</a> as its "iconic hero" and "reference point"; Bolívar had played a key role in Latin America's successful <a href="Spanish%20American%20wars%20of%20independence">struggle for independence from Spain</a> in the 1820s. In the <a href="Venezuelan%20presidential%20election%2C%201998">1998 presidential election</a>, Chávez won 56.2% of the vote, on a promise to "end the corruption of several decades" and institute a new <a href="Bolivarian%20Revolution">Bolivarian Revolution</a> that he felt would secure Latin America's true independence from the outside world.

Chávez strengthened his support among the poor with a series of social initiatives known as the <a href="Bolivarian%20Missions">Bolivarian Missions</a>, and created a network of grass-roots workers' councils, the <a href="Bolivarian%20Circles">Bolivarian Circles</a>. Nevertheless, by early 2002, Venezuela was "embroiled ... in a severe political crisis" as Chávez sought to bring more of the country's vast oil wealth under state control. Although the state-owned radio and television stations remained staunch advocates of Chávez's stated policies—to redistribute the nation's wealth to the poorest—the private media was more hostile. The crisis reached a head when Chávez attempted to remove the management of the state oil company, <a href="Petr%C3%B3leos%20de%20Venezuela">Petróleos de Venezuela</a> (PDVSA), provoking a showdown. "Oil managers, business leaders, and large segments of organized labor" called a general strike. The strike was backed by a large segment of the population, "particularly the country's increasingly impoverished middle class" and army officers upset at the increasing politicization of the military.

On 11 April 2002, hundreds of thousands of people marched in protest against the government. Abandoning their planned route, the marchers advanced towards the palace, a path that took them close to government supporters who had come out in opposition to the protest. Journalist Phil Gunson wrote, "Shooting broke out on all sides. A score of civilians died and more than 150 suffered gunshot wounds. The military high command called for Chávez to resign, and at 3:20 the next morning they announced he had agreed to do so. The presidency was assumed by a business leader, <a href="Pedro%20Carmona">Pedro Carmona</a> Estanga, but his government collapsed in less than forty-eight hours and Chávez returned to power."

"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" opens in 2001 with footage of Chávez as he tours the country. Met with "popular enthusiasm", he speaks at rallies, decrying <a href="neoliberal">neoliberal</a>ism and the international community's attacks on his character. The film outlines Chávez's rise to power, before covering his day-to-day routine and appearances on his television show, "<a href="Al%C3%B3%20Presidente">Aló Presidente</a>", which includes a phone-in for citizens to speak with the president. Chávez outlines his aspiration to be seen as a modern-day Bolívar. Clips from Venezuelan and United States news reports demonstrate a "relentless campaign" against the president.

Interviews with communities from both sides of the political divide indicate how Chávez is seen by the rich and poor. The latter support his stated aim to redistribute the country's oil wealth; the former fear totalitarianism and are worried Chávez will institute communism. In February 2002, the media war intensifies after Chavez takes control of PDVSA. The film states that the company was previously run as a private interest for the benefit of a minority, despite being state-owned. Business leader Pedro Carmona and union boss <a href="Carlos%20Ortega">Carlos Ortega</a> are the main voices of the opposition. After the pair visit Washington, D.C., the CIA and <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">the State Department</a> express concern about Chávez's rule and stress the importance of Venezuela's oil. A Venezuelan general appears on private television to voice similar disquiet. Carmona appeals for a public protest at the offices of PDVSA.

On 11 April, opposition protesters begin their march outside PDVSA's headquarters in Caracas; Chávez's supporters gather outside the presidential palace. The protest route is changed to take it to the palace; shots ring out and civilians are killed. The private media blames Chávez's supporters, citing footage that shows them shooting at opposition protesters from a bridge. The narration states, "What the TV stations didn't broadcast was [this camera angle], which clearly shows that the streets below were empty. The opposition march had never taken that route." Later, the state television signal is cut; rumors circulate that the opposition has taken over the studio. At the palace, members of the military high command demand Chávez's resignation, threatening to bomb the building. The president refuses to resign, but submits to their custody. He is led away, and Carmona announces on television that a transitional government will be established.

On 12 April, opposition leaders appear on private television, where they disclose their plan to unseat Chávez. Carmona is sworn in as president while images play of unrest on the streets. Defying media censorship, Chávez's supporters disseminate the story that the president did not resign. On 13 April, they gather to protest outside Miraflores, while palace guards plot to retake the building. The guards take up key positions and, at a prearranged signal, take members of the new government prisoner. The state television channel is relaunched and urges the army to back Chávez. "Full military control" is returned to the Chávez administration and the president arrives at the palace amid celebratory scenes. Chávez makes an address in which he says it is fine to oppose him, but not the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Venezuela">Constitution of Venezuela</a>. The closing titles say Carmona fled to Miami while under house arrest, and that Ortega went into hiding, only reappearing to help lead the opposition after Chávez said there would be no repercussions. Most of the dissident generals, after being expelled from the army, fled to the US. Others remained as part of the opposition.

In December 1999, independent Irish filmmaker Kim Bartley visited Venezuela as part of <a href="Concern%20Worldwide">Concern Worldwide</a>'s emergency response team, to document the aftermath of the <a href="1999%20Vargas%20mudslides">1999 Vargas mudslides</a> that had devastated much of <a href="Vargas%20State">Vargas State</a> in the north of the country. Bartley become fascinated with how those affected by the tragedy perceived Chávez, and in late 2000, she and Donnacha Ó Briain—a filmmaker and former colleague who shared her interest in "Latin American politics and issues around globalization"—spent two weeks in Caracas to determine the feasibility of a film project. The pair formed a production company, Runway Films, and in January 2001 applied to Ireland's film board, <a href="Irish%20Film%20Board">Bord Scannán na hÉireann</a> (BSÉ), for a development grant. Bartley and Ó Briain proposed a fly-on-the-wall documentary, a "personal profile and intimate portrait" of Chávez that would be "broadly supportive" of him. During their 2000 visit, the filmmakers had sensed that "something genuinely was happening" in Caracas, and felt an urgency to get the project underway; even so, it wasn't until April 2001 that BSÉ approved the £6000 (€9500) grant.

The project was at this point named "Aló Presidente", a working title taken from Chávez's weekly television and radio program. BSÉ set about exploring avenues of funding; the organization persuaded Bartley and Ó Briain to make a short pilot to show to potential investors, but refused the filmmakers' application for a €60,000 grant towards their €131,000 production budget. BSÉ felt the pair needed to partner with a production company that had experience in the field, and which could help raise the remaining funds. Bartley and Ó Briain approached Power Pictures and, with the addition of David Power as a producer, reapplied for the grant. Even as filming began, the full budget—now at €200,000—had not been secured. David Power pitched the project at several documentary festivals and markets. At Dublin's Stranger Than Fiction festival in September 2001, the <a href="British%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">BBC</a>, <a href="S4C">S4C</a> and <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> declined to invest. <a href="Raidi%C3%B3%20Teilif%C3%ADs%20%C3%89ireann">Raidió Teilifís Éireann</a> (RTÉ) expressed interest in providing development funds; no such deal was made, but RTÉ did offer €10,000 (subsequently €20,000) for the Irish broadcast rights. In October, the Dutch broadcaster <a href="Nederlandse%20Programma%20Stichting">Nederlandse Programma Stichting</a> also committed €10,000. At a November market in Amsterdam, Power once again approached the BBC and was turned down, as the organization believed the film's subject was "too far away to be relevant to [its viewers'] lives". However, RTÉ's Kevin Dawson pushed the film at a <a href="European%20Broadcasting%20Union">European Broadcasting Union</a> pitching session, securing the interest of German television channel <a href="ZDF">ZDF</a>, which subsequently provided funds. In late 2001, BSÉ finally approved a production grant of €63,000.

In 2000, Bartley and Ó Briain had been promised "exclusive access" to Chávez by the government's Minister of Communications. They arrived in Venezuela in September 2001. While filming the pilot they met the president, after which they reconsidered their approach. Bartley explained, "We had ... this notion of investigating Chávez—was he a demagogue? Was the media persona just that? What makes him tick? My sense had changed as we got closer; what we're seeing here is a guy who is motivated, driven, not the demagogue with another side, drinking, carousing. I began to see him as more transparent—what you see is what you get." Bartley and Ó Briain began by attempting to build a relationship with Chávez that would allow them the access they required. At first, the president's staff treated the filmmakers with suspicion and made filming difficult. After numerous delays, Bartley and Ó Briain finally got through to Chávez. They calculated that they needed to "press the right buttons" to gain his support, so they presented him with an old edition of the memoirs of the general <a href="Daniel%20Florence%20O%27Leary">Daniel Florence O'Leary</a>, who had fought alongside <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar">Simón Bolívar</a>. Inside, they had written a quote from the Irish socialist playwright <a href="Se%C3%A1n%20O%27Casey">Seán O'Casey</a>. Slowly, Bartley and Ó Briain gained their subjects' trust, "dissolving any self-consciousness as a result of their cameras".

Although ensconced with Chávez and his entourage, Bartley and Ó Briain felt a disconnect from the events of the outside world. During a "chaotic" road-trip with Chávez, they "knew something was coming", and divined that Chávez's trip was intended to bolster his support and "get people used to being on the streets". Chávez had recently "upped the ante" with the introduction of the Land Law. Increasing tensions further, in February 2002, Chávez took control of PDVSA; the private media stepped up its criticism of Chávez, which for Bartley and Ó Briain "marked the beginning of an exciting phase". By April 2002, Bartley and Ó Briain were in Caracas and spent much of their time filming at <a href="Miraflores%20Palace">the presidential palace</a>, following Chávez and his staff. As the 11 April crisis unfolded, Bartley and Ó Briain filmed outside the palace, first capturing footage of the demonstrations and subsequent violence, then events inside the palace during the afternoon, evening and early hours of 12 April. Through their previous contacts at the palace, Bartley and Ó Briain were able to continue filming without interference: "no one paid any attention to us—we just blended in." Later that day, Bartley and Ó Briain stayed away from the palace through fears for their safety. Unable to leave the country—the <a href="Sim%C3%B3n%20Bol%C3%ADvar%20International%20Airport%20%28Venezuela%29">international airport</a> was closed—the filmmakers instead took to the streets, "to document the repression [they] were witnessing". At the same time, a press office cameraman was in the palace, "reluctant to lose his job despite the change in government". He filmed the formation of the interim government. When Bartley and Ó Briain returned to the palace on 13 April, the cameraman let them have his footage. They remained filming in Venezuela until July 2002, interviewing residents and recording "witness" accounts from those who had been present during the coup—ministers, security guards and journalists.

Using two <a href="digital%20video">digital video</a> (DV) cameras, Bartley and Ó Briain shot over 200 hours of material on 300 DV tapes. They intended that editing take ten weeks; instead, it took six months. Rod Stoneman, BSÉ's CEO at the time, described the amount of footage compared to the film's final length as "exceptional". The 200:1 ratio was far above the norm for most documentaries, which usually have a ratio of 10:1 or 15:1. When the filmmakers returned to Ireland, they decided they needed an editor who spoke Spanish. Bartley remembered a documentary she had seen about baseball in Cuba, "El juego de Cuba", so they hired its editor, Ángel Hernández Zoido. Zoido approached the film as if it were entertainment, feeling that the primary concern was to ensure the audience did not get bored. He tackled each scene the same way. After watching the <a href="Dailies">rushes</a> with Bartley and Ó Briain, Zoido asked them, "What do we want to tell in this scene?" He focused on two factors: how much information would be necessary to drive the plot, and provide an emotional core. Preferring to work alone, Zoido would then send the filmmakers from the edit suite. After Zoido completed the scene, the trio discussed whether those aims had been realized.

The large amount of footage, and the fact that the filmmakers were "in a sense ... looking at it for the first time", meant that the film's concept only became clear during editing. The events of 11–13 April gave it "a new dramatic centre", although Bartley and Ó Briain were keen that the film did not concentrate entirely on the coup. They had intended to include more historical and political context; it wasn't until late in post-production that the focus narrowed to include more emphasis on the media's role in Venezuelan politics. In October 2002, a two-hour "rough cut" was shown to Stoneman and Brendan McCarthy, BSÉ's head of Production and Development. This version included the "witness" accounts that Bartley and Ó Briain had captured after April 2002. Stoneman felt that these sequences reinforced the film's claims, but "diluted its originality". He argued that they be cut, and that to compensate, Bartley and Ó Briain should record a voice-over and place themselves more in the frame as witness-protagonists, ideas that the filmmakers initially resisted.

As editing progressed, budget shortfalls prevented BSÉ from finalizing contracts. The organization also restricted post-production funds to "limit [its] exposure" in the event the project was not completed. Stoneman contacted a former colleague at the BBC, Nick Fraser, who had declined to help finance the film in 2001. Fraser was <a href="commissioning%20editor">commissioning editor</a> for the BBC's "<a href="Storyville%20%28television%20series%29">Storyville</a>" documentaries series. According to Stoneman, Fraser was "still undecided", having been told by the head of <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> that "we've done Chávez". Nevertheless, the BBC pre-purchased the film and in December 2002 received a rough cut. At the BBC's behest, the opening of the television version was made more dramatic. Fraser was unsure about the voice-over; he asked for a more "opinionated" narration that, according to Bartley, would "get the boot in". Although the BBC did not ask outright, Bartley's impression was that the organization wanted the film to be "against Chávez". Fraser later said he had asked for the filmmakers to "include [an interview] with someone not a Chávez supporter". He also suggested that a more experienced director be employed to help edit the film. The filmmakers "made a few minor concessions", but resisted major edits. Ó Briain's voice-over in the final cut was "polished up but not significantly changed".

The filmmakers created two versions of the film. "Chávez: Inside the Coup", intended for television broadcast, lasts 52 minutes. The feature-length "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised"—which takes its name from the <a href="Gil%20Scott-Heron">Gil Scott-Heron</a> song <a href="The%20Revolution%20Will%20Not%20Be%20Televised">of the same name</a>—is 74 minutes long.

"Chávez: Inside the Coup" aired on <a href="RT%C3%89%20One">RTÉ One</a> on 18 February 2003, as an installment of the channel's "True Lives" documentary series. The broadcast prompted a passionate public and critical response, and "lively debate" on radio and in newspapers; RTÉ soon arranged for a repeat broadcast. In the United Kingdom, it aired on BBC Two on 16 October 2003, as part of the channel's "Storyville" documentary strand, and on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> on 18 November 2003. "Chavez: Inside the Coup" also aired in Canada, Japan, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Finland and Denmark. The speed of the television broadcasts left a full theatrical run unlikely—a fact the filmmakers later regretted. The film also failed to be picked up by a television company in the US, although <a href="Home%20Box%20Office">HBO</a> was interested at one point. In Venezuela, "La revolución no será transmitida" premièred on 13 April 2003, on state television channel <a href="Venezolana%20de%20Televisi%C3%B3n">Venezolana de Televisión</a> (VTV). It has since been shown regularly on Venezuelan television; the state-funded community station <a href="Catia%20TVe">Catia TVe</a> often broadcasts the film during "contentious political conjunctures", such as the <a href="Venezuelan%20recall%20referendum%2C%202004">2004 recall referendum</a>, the <a href="Venezuelan%20presidential%20election%2C%202006">2006 presidential election</a>, and in 2007 to "help build support" for the government's controversial attempt to not renew the license of private television network <a href="RCTV">RCTV</a>.

"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" screened at several film festivals in 2003, winning numerous awards. Beginning with the <a href="South%20by%20Southwest">South by Southwest</a> festival on 7 March, its festival appearances included the <a href="Banff%20World%20Television%20Festival">Banff World Television Festival</a>, the <a href="Seattle%20International%20Film%20Festival">Seattle International Film Festival</a>, the <a href="Marseille%20Festival%20of%20Documentary%20Film">Marseille Festival of Documentary Film</a>, the <a href="Three%20Continents%20Film%20Festival">Three Continents Film Festival</a>, the <a href="Chicago%20International%20Film%20Festival">Chicago International Film Festival</a>, the <a href="Monaco%20International%20Film%20Festival">Monaco International Film Festival</a>, the Galway Film Fleadh and the Los Angeles Wine & Country Festival. In March 2003, a VHS copy of the film screened to under 100 people as part of an <a href="American%20Cinematheque">American Cinematheque</a> Irish film festival in Los Angeles. Among the viewers was the president of Vitagraph Films, David Schultz, who bought the rights for theatrical distribution and paid for the film to be converted from video. Schultz initially struggled to secure the support of exhibitors; they were skeptical of the film's commercial prospects, and believed "the environment was not hospitable" for a film critical of the US so close to the start of the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>. They only became receptive a few months later, when political perceptions shifted and the public became more aware of Venezuela because of its oil wealth. One such exhibitor was the <a href="Film%20Forum">Film Forum</a> in New York City. Mike Maggiore, a programmer at the theater, worked to market the film and raise its profile with film critics. He created <a href="press%20kit">press kit</a>s and circulated information to appeal to "a particular audience".

"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" premièred to the public at the Film Forum in November 2003. The showing was accompanied by protests outside the theater from supporters and detractors of the film, both of whom "attempted to influence audience reception". A few weeks previously, the film had been withdrawn from an <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> film festival in Vancouver; staff at the organization's Caracas arm said they "feared for their safety if it were shown". The film's success at the 2003 <a href="Grierson%20Awards">Grierson Awards</a> was also overshadowed by a letter to the Grierson jury from London-based Venezuelan filmmakers, who disputed its version of events. Opposition demonstrators at the Film Forum première attempted to throw doubt on the film's "impartiality, precision, veracity, editorial integrity, and ideological independence", while supporters "encouraged theatergoers to denounce censorship" and sign a petition. Opposition protests also greeted showings in Canada, Australia and France. The run at the Film Forum earned $26,495 (€22,600)—several thousand above Maggiore's expectations. After a limited run in theaters in six cities, the film had earned over $200,000 (€171,000), not quite profitable, but still considered "a significant sum for a documentary".

Bartley and Ó Briain showed the film to Chávez in February 2003. They recalled his response as "quite emotional". BSÉ waived Venezuelan licensing fees for the film; on 13 April, it was screened simultaneously with the television broadcast at a cinema in Caracas, before which Chávez made a speech saying, "Watch this film and you will see the face of the coup." Pro-Chávez activists also distributed the film unofficially. The <a href="Committee%20in%20Solidarity%20with%20the%20People%20of%20El%20Salvador">Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador</a> screened the film in New York City, where <a href="Bolivarian%20Circles">Bolivarian Circle</a> members "accepted donations" for bootleg copies. "<a href="El%20Universal%20%28Caracas%29">El Universal</a>" said the Venezuelan government had 10,000 copies made, and according to "<a href="National%20Review">National Review</a>", the <a href="Venezuela%20Information%20Office">Venezuela Information Office</a> (VIO) "encouraged art-house theaters" to screen the film. Government representatives aided the film's distribution officially and unofficially. Venezuelan filmmaker Wolfgang Schalk said the film counted on the worldwide support of Venezuelan embassies and a public relations effort to show the film free at universities and theaters in cities such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York. Peace Action New York was given permission for a screening during a fund raiser in the <a href="Lincoln%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Lincoln Center</a>, where 250 people paid $35 (€30) each to see the film and take part in a "question-and-answer session" with guests such as Leonor Granado, the Venezuelan Consul General. The consulate office made DVDs of the film available to "anyone who wanted a copy", as Granado said the film was vital to "building support in [the US] for the Venezuelan government".

Journalist Michael McCaughan invited a group of people who held anti-Chávez views to a screening of the film. He said some among the audience changed their opinion of Chávez after seeing it, although many remained hostile. McCaughan said the consensus opinion was that the film was excellent' and reasonably objective", but that "Chávez remained a dictator leading the country to a totalitarian grave". As of 2006, groups such as <a href="Global%20Exchange">Global Exchange</a> were arranging tours to Venezuela that included a screening of the film.

In Venezuela, debate about "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" is "often acrimonious". The film has become key to framing people's understanding of the events of April 2002. The previously accepted international view was that Chávez's ousting came from a "spontaneous popular response" to the repression of his regime; the film "directly contradicts" this position, and since its release it has rapidly become "the prevailing interpretation of [the crisis]". The film's critics charge that it omits or misrepresents important events. Much of the criticism is centered on the filmmakers' "use of stock [documentary] devices", such as compositing clips from several events to present them as one incident. Parallel editing also depicts sequences as if they occurred at the same time, when some of the footage was captured on different days. Bartley and Ó Briain justify these methods as standard practice in the construction of documentary realist films. Caracas-based journalist Phil Gunson, writing in "<a href="Columbia%20Journalism%20Review">Columbia Journalism Review</a>", says that most of the film critics who embraced the film ignored "the complex, messy reality" of the situation. He charges that the filmmakers "omit key facts, invent others, twist the sequence of events to support their case, and replace inconvenient images with others dredged from archives". Bartley and Ó Briain argue that Gunson's points are "issues of dispute" that "continue to divide opinion" in Venezuela. Author Brian A. Nelson says that Bartley and Ó Briain—in their initial meeting with Chávez—did more than merely invoke the Irish general <a href="Daniel%20Florence%20O%27Leary">Daniel O'Leary</a> to gain the president's support for filming; Nelson alleges that they offered to portray the president positively in return for open access, with a "you scratch my back if I scratch yours" understanding that he says was ultimately reflected in the film's "unabashed pro-Chavismo."

Soon after the film's October 2003 broadcast on BBC Two, Venezuelan engineer and filmmaker <a href="Wolfgang%20Schalk">Wolfgang Schalk</a> began a campaign against "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised", representing "El Gusano de Luz" ("The Worm of Light"), an organization associated with the Venezuelan opposition. In July, Schalk had complained to RTÉ about its broadcast of the film. On 21 October, "El Gusano de Luz" published a "detailed critique" as part of an internet petition that attracted 11,000 signatories, 85% of whom self-identified as Venezuelan. Directed at the European broadcasters that financed and aired the film, the petition said in part, ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" is being presented as an author's film, as an objective journalistic research film, while it is really a very well plotted and accomplished propaganda operation, supported logistically by the Venezuelan government, with the aim of misleading unprepared spectators of countries who do not know the totality of events." The petition submitted 18 specific points of contention with the film. Venezuelan private television soon aired two programs "dissecting and denouncing" the film, and similar newspaper articles followed.

Much of the anger about the film stemmed from its high-profile internationally; that it had been "blessed with the imprimatur of the BBC ... with its connotations of fair and authoritative reporting" only made matters worse. John Burns, writing in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>", restated many of Gunson's arguments, and the BBC received 4,000 e-mails demanding that "Storyville"s commissioning editor, Nick Fraser, be sacked. Toward the end of 2003, the weight of criticism forced the BBC to act. The corporation's complaints unit opened an investigation, and Fraser said the BBC would not show the film again until it had concluded. He wrote to David Power expressing particular concern over an error with the end titles and the use of out-of-chronology footage, saying the latter was "a real problem—particularly ... since it has been used in a film dedicated to exposing the frauds of Venezuelan TV". The furor came at a difficult time for the corporation, which was under the spotlight of the <a href="Hutton%20Inquiry">Hutton Inquiry</a>, the official investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of <a href="David%20Kelly%20%28weapons%20expert%29">David Kelly</a>; the BBC had been criticized for reporting that intelligence dossiers had been "sexed up" by the UK government to justify the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 invasion of Iraq</a>.

The petition's claims were also taken up by the UK's independent telecommunications regulator, <a href="Ofcom">Ofcom</a>. The body investigated official protests made by several Caracas residents. The concerns largely focused on footage of the residents' attending a neighborhood meeting in June 2002, which was positioned in the film as a prelude to the April coup attempt. The residents said that the filmmakers had used footage of them without consent and that the film had misrepresented their views. In September 2005, Ofcom provisionally ruled that it had not upheld the complaints, citing the BBC's internal review and rebuttal as grounds. A subsequent appeal by the residents was unsuccessful. Two weeks after Ofcom's initial ruling, the BBC announced it had closed the complaint and that no further investigations would take place. Stoneman believed the BBC had overreacted, saying its guardedness was merely a product of being a frequent victim of press attacks on its ethos. Fraser said, "The film was very good in many respects, but also misleading." He believed the filmmakers considered Chávez honorable, but having written a book on <a href="Peronism">Peronism</a> was more skeptical himself. Fraser concluded, "I still think it's a good film, because of the coup sequence. It should be seen as a Venezuelan "<a href="The%20West%20Wing">West Wing</a>"—biased, of course, but highly entertaining."

One of the film's key contentions is that the private media aired footage selectively to make it look like the violence of 11 April was caused by Chávez's supporters, portraying them as an "irrational and uncivilized mob". Private television repeatedly showed Chávez's supporters on <a href="Puente%20Llaguno">Puente Llaguno</a> as they shot at Baralt Avenue below, an area purportedly full of opposition marchers. The film says this footage was edited to show the gunmen but not the people near them who were ducking to avoid being shot. It follows with images taken from above the bridge showing an empty Baralt Avenue, claiming that "the opposition march had never taken that route" and that Chávez's supporters were only returning fire. Gunson charges that this edit is itself a misrepresentation, stating that the film does not mention that both sets of marchers were fired upon, and taking issue with the implication that "coup plotters" were the shooters. In response, the filmmakers say, "Nowhere in the film did we say that only [Chávez's supporters] were shot ... Nobody can say with certainty who orchestrated the shootings." Gunson also asserts that the footage of the empty street was taken earlier that day, citing an "analysis of the shadows" by Schalk, who created a counter-documentary, "<a href="X-Ray%20of%20a%20Lie">X-Ray of a Lie</a>", to examine "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" "scene by scene to uncover [its] narrative strategies and use of artifice". Brian A. Nelson agreed with the analysis, claiming that Baralt Avenue was not as empty as the film portrays and that the filmmakers "put a black bar at the top of the frame to hide the Metropolitan Police trucks that were still there". Bartley and Ó Briain reaffirmed their claim that the opposition did not pass below the Puente Llaguno bridge, citing eyewitness statements—including one from "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde Diplomatique</a>"s deputy editor—and an Australian documentary, "Anatomy of a Coup", that "came to conclusions similar to our own". A Venezuelan documentary, "", also supported Bartley and Ó Briain's view.

Other issues of contention include the lack of historical context; the film does not cover some of the events leading up to Chávez's ousting, including the long-running political crisis and the general strike. Gunson also criticizes the filmmakers for showing events out of order. In June 2002, they filmed an opposition community group as its members considered "how to defend themselves against possible ... attacks" from Chávez's supporters. In the film, this sequence is placed before the march. Bartley justified the action, saying that the residents' opinions were representative of those held "long before" the events of April 2002. Responding to the critique, the BBC added a date stamp to the sequence for the film's repeat broadcast. Gunson also cites footage of Caracas mayor <a href="Freddy%20Bernal">Freddy Bernal</a> as he sings to a happy group of Chávez supporters in front of the palace. Later images of a "differently dressed Bernal" reveal that the footage was from another day. Similarly, Gunson says that until shot at, "The opposition march was entirely peaceful." The film presents footage of its "violent finale"—including an image from another day—as if it occurred during the protest's approach to the palace, accompanied by the narrated claim that "some in the vanguard looked ready for a fight". Bartley and Ó Briain admit that they included a "limited" amount of archive footage, but say it was a "legitimate reconstruction" to build context "before the core narrative of the coup [took] off" as they "could not be everywhere filming at all times".

"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" claims that state television was "the only channel to which [Chávez] had access", but does not mention that during the violence he requisitioned "all radio and TV frequencies" to broadcast his two-hour address. Private television circumvented the rules allowing this action by splitting the screen, showing Chávez's address on one side and footage of the violence on the other. Chávez subsequently took television stations <a href="RCTV">RCTV</a> and <a href="Venevisi%C3%B3n">Venevisión</a> off the air. The film's assertion that VTV was taken over by opposition "plotters" is also disputed; according to "X-Ray of a Lie" and Gunson, staff left willingly. Gunson further alleges that footage of VTV's signal being cut—mid-interview with a government legislator—was fabricated. Bartley and Ó Briain say they witnessed ministers' being unable to broadcast and that the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20Journalists">International Federation of Journalists</a> corroborated their claim that opposition forces took over VTV. The film also presents footage of armored vehicles around the palace, which Gunson says were there at the request of the president, not the opposition. He also challenges the film for presenting Chávez's supporters as "invariably poor, brown-skinned, and cheerful" and the opposition as "rich, white, racist, and violent". He says that the opposition protests were multiracial and that armed government supporters "made the center of Caracas a no-go area". Bartley and Ó Briain cite several commentators who uphold the claim that Chávez's supporters "were broadly poor and dark-skinned and the opposition broadly white and middle class", including Gunson himself in an April 2002 article in "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>". Gunson does agree that the film was right to point out that the private media "behaved disgracefully" by "systematically [excluding the pro-Chávez] viewpoint from print, radio, and TV" during the period of the coup.

Of greater concern, Gunson says, is the "deliberate blurring of responsibility for the coup". The film presents the idea that the military commanders dispersed, "leaving a total power vacuum". However, the high command's senior figure, General <a href="Lucas%20Rinc%C3%B3n%20Romero">Lucas Rincón</a> (who announced Chávez's resignation on television), was not part of the coup and remained in the government after April 2002. The petition draws the conclusion, "(1) either General Rincón stated a truth that was accepted throughout the whole country ... or (2) General Rincón lied, because he was an accomplice ... that seems not to be the truth because he [remained in Chávez's administration]." Only one of the high command joined Carmona's interim administration before contributing to its downfall by withdrawing his support. The military leaders shown withdrawing their support for Chávez were not the high command, and Vice-Admiral Hector Ramirez Perez was not the head of the navy, as the film claims. Gunson says, "With one solitary exception, these generals and admirals had not 'fled abroad' after the Carmona government collapsed." Although Bartley and Ó Briain accept that Rincón said Chávez "had agreed to resign", they reiterate that "elements in the military [threatened] force in the effort to make Chávez resign"; the filmmakers say it is "irrelevant" that the whole military did not join the coup, as this "is the case with most coups". General Rincón's announcement was omitted because they felt it was "supplementary to the main, key fact of the story", that no documentary evidence of the resignation exists.

Schalk investigated "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" for five months. In 2004, he and producer <a href="Thaelman%20Urguelles">Thaelman Urguelles</a> responded to the film with their own documentary, "<a href="X-Ray%20of%20a%20Lie">X-Ray of a Lie</a>", which set out to expose its "manipulation". Schalk said the film "presented a distorted version of events ... to fit a story that appeals to audiences". Schalk is associated with the Venezuelan opposition; Bartley and Ó Briain say that it is "not insignificant that Schalk has led the well-resourced campaign, linked to [the opposition], to discredit and suppress [the film]".

In 2008, Stoneman published "Chavez: The Revolution Will Not Be Televised – A Case Study of Politics and the Media". A book "of film studies rather than politics", it nevertheless looks in detail at the petition's arguments. Stoneman "broadly absolves" the filmmakers; he concludes, "There were some relatively small examples of slippage in the grammar of the piece, but overall the film was made with honesty and integrity. Of the 18 objections made, 15, if not 17, were wrong. The filmmakers spent a long time assembling evidence to show why they'd done what they'd done in the film and mostly it's true." Stoneman conceded that the filmmakers' "<a href="cin%C3%A9ma%20v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9">cinéma vérité</a>" approach meant that for wider historical and political context, viewers should look elsewhere. Stoneman received an "Executive Producer" credit on the film, which he explains as an unasked-for gratuity that came by virtue of his position as head of BSÉ.

Among mainstream critics in the US and UK, the film received almost exclusively positive reviews. <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reported that 98% of 48 sampled critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 7.9 out of 10. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="weighted%20mean">weighted average</a> out of 100 to critics' reviews, the film received a score of 82 based on 24 reviews. Almost all local and national film critics in the United States said the film presented a "riveting narrative", but conceded that it was a biased account of the events.
Frank Scheck, writing in "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>", said the film presented an enthralling story that "resembles a taut ... political thriller", and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> in the "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" called it a "remarkable documentary" full of "astonishing shots". Both critics said the film was made so through the filmmakers' unique inside access to the events at the palace with Ebert calling that aspect "unique in film history". Although Ebert was generally very praising of the film, he criticised the way in which Chávez's opponents were portrayed, while Shenk faulted the lack of historical context; however, he said this was balanced by the film's "brevity and succinctness". In "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", Scott Foundas wrote that the film was a "superior example of fearless filmmakers in exactly the right place at the right time", and likely the best of a string of documentaries that have shone the light on US involvement in South America. He had praise for the camera work and editing, and said the film was a "startling record" that reached "another level" when events shifted to the presidential palace. He cited these scenes—along with those of the protesters' clashing—as ones that "spark with a vibrant tension and uncertainty".

<a href="J.%20Hoberman">J. Hoberman</a> of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" said the film was a "gripping" account that did "an excellent job in deconstructing the Venezuelan TV news footage of blood, chaos, and rival crowds", and said it was "nearly a textbook on <a href="media%20manipulation">media manipulation</a>". Writing for "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Stephen%20Holden">Stephen Holden</a> said the film was "a riveting documentary" that delivered "the suspense of a smaller-scale "<a href="Seven%20Days%20in%20May">Seven Days in May</a>"", citing the way in which it examined how television can be used to "deceive and manipulate the public". He reproached the film's uncritical depiction of Chávez, and how it hinted at CIA involvement without presenting any proof. <a href="Ty%20Burr">Ty Burr</a> in "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" called the film "our best chance" to find out what really happened on 11–13 April, but cautioned that the filmmakers' "pro-Chávez stance" meant that for wider context audiences should look elsewhere, as it left out too much of Chávez's record. Burr also said the film's attempt to make the US into a villain was ineffective. He said, "because [the filmmakers] view the chasm that divides Venezuela purely in the context of the Cold War and Latin American political instability, they downplay the class warfare that's exploding right in front of them." Nevertheless, Burr concluded that the film's narrow focus remained engrossing.

Desson Thomson of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" stated that the film successfully reproduced the "panic and fear" at the palace as events unfolded, saying it came across like a "raw, <a href="Costa-Gavras">Costa-Gavras</a>-style thriller" that was "worth watching down to the last thrilling minute". He said that knowing how uncertain Venezuela's future was made the film even more powerful. Thomson believed the handheld video was put to good use, calling its "news-breaking immediacy ... intoxicating". He concluded, ""The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" is an extraordinary piece of electronic history. And a riveting movie." In the "<a href="Miami%20New%20Times">Miami New Times</a>", Brett Sokol agreed that the film was "never less than thrilling", but said that as history, it was "strictly agitprop". Similarly, Mark Jenkins wrote in the "<a href="Washington%20City%20Paper">Washington City Paper</a>" that the film was "unapologetically polemical", but "notable foremost as a gripping you-are-there account".

The film won several awards in 2003–04. It was also nominated for Best Documentary and Best Irish Film at the <a href="Irish%20Film%20and%20Television%20Awards">Irish Film and Television Awards</a>. The annual <a href="International%20Documentary%20Film%20Festival%20Amsterdam">International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam</a> gives an acclaimed filmmaker the chance to screen his or her Top 10 films. In 2007, Iranian filmmaker <a href="Maziar%20Bahari">Maziar Bahari</a> selected "The Revolution will not be Televised" for his top ten classics from the history of films.

The Time Traveler's Wife

The Time Traveler's Wife is the <a href="debut%20novel">debut novel</a> of American author <a href="Audrey%20Niffenegger">Audrey Niffenegger</a>, published in 2003. It is a love story about a man with a <a href="genetic%20disorder">genetic disorder</a> that causes him to <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a> unpredictably, and about his wife, an artist, who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences. Niffenegger, frustrated in love when she began the work, wrote the story as a <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a> for her failed relationships. The tale's central relationship came to her suddenly and subsequently supplied the novel's title. The novel, which has been classified as both <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and <a href="Romance%20novel">romance</a>, examines issues of love, loss, and <a href="free%20will">free will</a>. In particular, it uses time travel to explore miscommunication and distance in relationships, while also investigating deeper <a href="Existentialism">existential</a> questions.

As a first-time novelist, Niffenegger had trouble finding a <a href="literary%20agent">literary agent</a>. She eventually sent the novel to <a href="MacAdam/Cage">MacAdam/Cage</a> unsolicited and, after an auction took place for the rights, Niffenegger selected them as her publishers. The book became a bestseller after an endorsement from author and family friend <a href="Scott%20Turow">Scott Turow</a> on "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">The Today Show</a>", and as of March 2009 had sold nearly 2.5 million copies in the United States and the United Kingdom. Many reviewers were impressed with Niffenegger's unique perspectives on time travel. Some praised her characterization of the couple, applauding their emotional depth; others criticized her writing style as melodramatic and the plot as emotionally trite. The novel won the <a href="Exclusive%20Books%20Boeke%20Prize">Exclusive Books Boeke Prize</a> and a <a href="British%20Book%20Award">British Book Award</a>. <a href="The%20Time%20Traveler%27s%20Wife%20%28film%29">A film version</a> was released in August 2009.

Using alternating <a href="First-person%20narration">first-person perspectives</a>, the novel tells the stories of Henry DeTamble (born 1963), a librarian at the <a href="Newberry%20Library">Newberry Library</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, and his wife, Clare Anne Abshire (born 1971), an artist who makes paper sculptures. Henry has a rare genetic disorder, which comes to be known as Chrono-Impairment, that causes him to involuntarily travel through time. When 20-year-old Clare meets 28-year-old Henry at the Newberry Library in 1991 at the opening of the novel, he has never seen her before, although she has known him most of her life.

Henry begins time traveling at the age of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as <a href="stress%20%28biological%29">stress</a> can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.

Once their timelines converge "naturally" at the library—their first meeting in his chronology—Henry starts to travel to Clare's childhood and adolescence in <a href="South%20Haven%2C%20Michigan">South Haven, Michigan</a>, beginning in 1977 when she is six years old. On one of his early visits (from her perspective), Henry gives her a list of the dates he will appear and she writes them in a diary so she will remember to provide him with clothes and food when he arrives. During another visit, he inadvertently reveals that they will be married in the future. Over time they develop a close relationship. At one point, Henry helps Clare frighten and humiliate a boy who abused her. Clare is last visited in her youth by Henry in 1989, on her eighteenth birthday, during which they make love for the first time. They are then separated for two years until their meeting at the library.

Clare and Henry marry, but Clare has trouble bringing a pregnancy to term because of the genetic anomaly Henry may presumably be passing on to the fetus. After six <a href="miscarriage">miscarriage</a>s, Henry wishes to save Clare further pain and has a <a href="vasectomy">vasectomy</a>. However a version of Henry from the past visits Clare one night and they make love; she subsequently gives birth to a daughter, Alba. Alba is diagnosed with Chrono-Impairment as well but, unlike Henry, she has some control over her destinations when she time travels. Before she is born, Henry travels to the future and meets his ten-year-old daughter on a school field trip and learns that he dies when she is five years old.

When he is 43, during what is to be his last year of life, Henry time travels to a Chicago parking garage on a frigid winter night where he is unable to find shelter. As a result of the <a href="hypothermia">hypothermia</a> and <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a> he suffers, his feet are amputated when he returns to the present. Henry and Clare both know that without the ability to escape when he time travels, Henry will certainly die within his next few jumps. On New Year's Eve 2006 Henry time travels into the middle of the <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> woods in 1984 and is accidentally shot by Clare's brother, a scene <a href="Foreshadowing">foreshadowed</a> earlier in the novel. Henry returns to the present and dies in Clare's arms.

Clare is devastated by Henry's death. She later finds a letter from Henry asking her to "stop waiting" for him, but which describes a moment in her future when she will see him again. The last scene in the book takes place when Clare is 82 years old and Henry is 43. She is waiting for Henry, as she has done most of her life.

Niffenegger is an artist who teaches at the <a href="Center%20for%20Book%20and%20Paper%20Arts%20%28Columbia%20College%20Chicago%29">Center for Book and Paper Arts</a> at <a href="Columbia%20College%20Chicago">Columbia College Chicago</a>, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She produced some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that "The Time Traveler's Wife" would have to be a novel: "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." She was intrigued by the title because "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an <a href="epigraph%20%28literature%29">epigraph</a> to <a href="J.%20B.%20Priestley">J. B. Priestley</a>'s 1964 novel "<a href="Man%20and%20Time">Man and Time</a>": "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." Drawing her central theme from this image, she says, "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include <a href="Richard%20Powers">Richard Powers</a>, <a href="David%20Foster%20Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a>, <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>, and <a href="Dorothy%20Sayers">Dorothy Sayers</a>.

She has said the story is a <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a> for her own failed love affairs and that "I had kind of got the idea that there's not going to be some fabulous perfect soulmate out there for me, so I'll just make him up." She also drew on her parents' marriage for inspiration—her father spent the bulk of each week traveling. Despite the story's analogies to her own life, Niffenegger has forcefully stated that Clare is not a self-portrait; "She's radically different. I am much more willful and don't think I could go through a lifetime waiting for someone to appear, no matter how fascinating he was."

Niffenegger began writing the novel in 1997; the last scene, in which an aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, because it is the story's focal point. The narrative was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested <a href="literary%20agents">literary agents</a>—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher <a href="MacAdam/Cage">MacAdam/Cage</a>, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, "thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that this is someone who has a story to tell and who knows how to tell it." She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation."

Reviewers have found "The Time Traveler's Wife" difficult to classify <a href="Genre">generically</a>: some categorize it as <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, others as a <a href="Romance%20novel">romance</a>. Niffenegger herself is reluctant to label the novel, saying she "never thought of it as science fiction, even though it has a science-fiction premise". In Niffenegger's view, the story is primarily about Henry and Clare's relationship and the struggles they endure. She has said that she based Clare and Henry's romance on the "cerebral coupling" of <a href="Dorothy%20Sayers">Dorothy Sayers</a>'s characters <a href="Lord%20Peter%20Wimsey">Lord Peter Wimsey</a> and <a href="Harriet%20Vane">Harriet Vane</a>.

<a href="Time%20travel%20in%20fiction">Time travel stories</a> to which the novel has been compared include <a href="Jack%20Finney">Jack Finney's</a> "<a href="Time%20and%20Again%20%28novel%29">Time and Again</a>" (1970) <a href="F.M.%20Busby">F.M. Busby</a>'s short story "If This Is Winnetka, You Must Be Judy" and the film "<a href="Somewhere%20in%20Time%20%28film%29">Somewhere in Time</a>" (1980). Henry has been compared to <a href="Billy%20Pilgrim">Billy Pilgrim</a> of <a href="Kurt%20Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut's</a> "<a href="Slaughterhouse-Five">Slaughterhouse-Five</a>" (1969). Science fiction writer <a href="Terence%20M.%20Green">Terence M. Green</a> calls the novel a "timeslip romance". "The Time Traveler's Wife" is not as concerned with the paradoxes of time travel as is traditional science fiction. Instead, as critic Marc Mohan describes, the novel "uses time travel as a metaphor to explain how two people can feel as if they've known each other their entire lives".
Robert Nathan's "<a href="Portrait%20of%20Jennie">Portrait of Jennie</a>", as novel, or film, is another obvious comparison, although Jennie, as a ghost, travels time in one direction, not randomly.

Elements of the plot, particularly the list, bear comparison with Heinlein's 1941 <a href="By%20His%20Bootstraps">By His Bootstraps</a>, and in turn, with River Song's diary in the long-running, British sci-fi show <a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>.

Niffenegger identifies the themes of the novel as "mutants, love, death, amputation, sex, and time". Reviewers have focused on love, loss, and time. As Charlie Lee-Potter writes in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>", the novel is "an elegy to love and loss". The love between Henry and Clare is expressed in a variety of ways, including through an analysis and history of the couple's sex life.

While much of the novel shows Henry and Clare falling in love, the end is darker and "time travel becomes a means for representing arbitrariness, transience, [and] plain bad luck", according to "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>"s Judith Maas. As Andrew Billen argues in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", "The book may even serve as a feminist analysis of marriage as a partnership in which only the male is conceded the privilege of absence." Several reviewers noted that time travel represents relationships in which couples cannot quite communicate with each other. Natasha Walter of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" describes the story's attention to "the sense of slippage that you get in any relationship—that you could be living through a slightly different love story from the one your partner is experiencing." She points, for example, to the section of the book which describes the first time Clare and Henry make love. She is 18 and he is 41, already married to her in his present. After this interlude, he returns to his own time and his own Clare, who says,
The novel raises questions about <a href="determinism">determinism</a> and <a href="free%20will">free will</a>. For example, critic Dan Falk asks, "Given that [Henry's] journey has 'already happened,' should he not simply be "compelled" to act precisely as he remembers seeing himself act? (Or perhaps he "is" compelled, and merely "feels" he has a choice...?)." Although Henry seemingly cannot alter the future, the characters do not become "cynical" and, according to Lee-Potter, the novel demonstrates that people can be changed through love. Walter notes that there is a "quasi-religious sense" to the inevitability of Henry's and Clare's lives and deaths. Niffenegger, however, believes that the novel does not depict destiny but rather "randomness and meaninglessness".

The hardback edition of "The Time Traveler's Wife" was published in the United States in September 2003 by MacAdam/Cage and in the United Kingdom by <a href="Random%20House">Random House</a> on 1 January 2004. MacAdam/Cage initiated an "extensive marketing drive", including advertising in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" and a promotional book tour by Niffenegger. As a result, the novel debuted at number nine on the <a href="New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"New York Times" bestseller list</a>. After popular crime writer <a href="Scott%20Turow">Scott Turow</a>, whose wife is a friend of Niffenegger, endorsed it on "<a href="Today%20%28NBC%20program%29">The Today Show</a>", the first print run of 15,000 sold out and 100,000 more copies were printed. In Britain, the book received a boost from its choice as a <a href="Richard%20%26amp%3B%20Judy%23Richard%20%26amp%3B%20Judy%20Book%20Club">"Richard & Judy" book club</a> recommendation—nearly 45,000 copies were sold in one week. It was named the 2003 <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> Book of the Year. A December 2003 article in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" reported that although "a tiny minority of American reviewers" felt that the novel was "gimmicky", it was still "a publishing sensation". At that point, the novel had been sold to publishers in 15 countries. As of March 2009, it had sold almost 1.5 million copies in the United States and 1 million in the United Kingdom. The success of "The Time Traveler's Wife" prompted almost every major publishing firm to attempt to acquire Niffenegger's second novel, "<a href="Her%20Fearful%20Symmetry">Her Fearful Symmetry</a>", which has been called "one of the most eagerly sought-after works in recent publishing history". It garnered her an advance of US$5 million from <a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Scribner's</a>.

Reviewers praised Niffenegger's characterization of Henry and Clare, particularly their emotional depth. Michelle Griffin of "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" noted that although Henry "is custom-designed for the fantasy lives of bookish ladies", his flaws, particularly his "violent, argumentative, depressive" nature, make him a strong, well-rounded character. Charles DeLint wrote in "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20and%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</a>" that one of Niffenegger's "greatest accomplishments" in the novel was her ability to convey the emotional growth of Clare and Henry in character arcs while at the same time alternating their perspectives. <a href="Stephen%20Amidon">Stephen Amidon</a> of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", however, questioned the selfishness of the central characters.

Most reviewers were impressed with the premise of the novel, but critical of its melodramatic style. While Griffin praised the plot and concept as "clever", she argued that Niffenegger's writing is usually "pedestrian" and the story at times contrived. Heidi Darroch of the "<a href="National%20Post">National Post</a>" agreed, contending that the story has an excess of overwrought emotional moments "which never quite add up to a fully developed plot". Writing in "<a href="The%20Chicago%20Tribune">The Chicago Tribune</a>", Carey Harrison praised the originality of the novel, specifically the intersection of child-bearing and time travel. Despite appreciating the novel's premise, Amidon complained that the implications of Henry's time-traveling were poorly thought out. For example, Henry has foreknowledge of the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> but does nothing to try to prevent them. Instead, on 11 September 2001, he gets up early "to listen to the world being normal for a little while longer". Amidon also criticized the novel's "overall clumsiness", writing that Niffenegger is "a ham-fisted stylist, long-winded and given to sudden eruptions of cliche". Miriam Shaviv agreed to an extent, writing in "<a href="The%20Jerusalem%20Post">The Jerusalem Post</a>", "There are no original or even non-cliched messages here. True love, Niffenegger seems to be telling us, is timeless, and can survive even the worst yet, the book is a page-turner, delicately crafted and psychologically sound." The "<a href="Library%20Journal">Library Journal</a>" described the novel as "skillfully written with a blend of distinct characters and heartfelt emotions"; it recommended that public libraries purchase multiple copies of the book.

On September 23, 2013 it was announced that a sequel to the novel is in the works. The sequel will focus on Henry and Clare's daughter Alba as an adult. She finds herself in love with two different men: Zach, a normal man, and Oliver, a musician and fellow time-traveler. The first 25 pages are currently available with the purchase of "The Time Traveler's Wife" eBook. In February 2014, Niffenegger estimated that the book "should be ready in 2018 or so".
In March 2017, Niffenegger stated on Twitter that the sequel would be called "The Other Husband" but didn't expect it to be released before 2019.

<a href="BBC%20Worldwide">BBC Audio</a> published an audio book of "The Time Traveler's Wife" that was narrated by William Hope and Laurel Lefkow, described as "feisty readers" in one review.

HighBridge also produced an unabridged version in 2003, which is twelve hours long and narrated by Maggi-Meg Reed and Christopher Burns; their performance has been described as "sincere and passionate".

The 2006 <a href="Audible.com">Audible</a>/HighBridge version is narrated by Fred Berman and Phoebe Strole and is 17:43 in length.

Audible.co.uk produced an unabridged version in 2008, also narrated by Hope and Lefkow.

The film rights for "The Time Traveler's Wife" were optioned by <a href="Brad%20Pitt">Brad Pitt</a>'s production company <a href="Plan%20B%20Entertainment">Plan B Entertainment</a>, in association with <a href="New%20Line%20Cinema">New Line Cinema</a>, before the novel was even published. The adaptation was written by <a href="Bruce%20Joel%20Rubin">Bruce Joel Rubin</a> and directed by <a href="Robert%20Schwentke">Robert Schwentke</a>, and stars <a href="Rachel%20McAdams">Rachel McAdams</a> and <a href="Eric%20Bana">Eric Bana</a>. Filming began in September 2007 and the movie was released by <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> on 14 August 2009. When asked about the prospect of her novel being turned into a film, Niffenegger said, "I've got my little movie that runs in my head. And I'm kind of afraid that will be changed or wiped out by what somebody else might do with it. And it is sort of thrilling and creepy, because now the characters have an existence apart from me." In general, the film received mixed-to-negative reviews. For example, "The New York Times" wrote that the film was an "often ridiculous, awkward, unsatisfying and dour melodramatic adaptation".

In July 2018, <a href="HBO">HBO</a> secured the rights to adapt the novel into a television series to be written by <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven Moffat</a>.

Lions (album)

Lions is the sixth studio album by American <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="The%20Black%20Crowes">The Black Crowes</a>. It was released in 2001 as their first album on <a href="V2%20Records">V2 Records</a> following their departure from <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia</a>, and is their only studio album to feature guitarist <a href="Audley%20Freed">Audley Freed</a>. "Lions" was recorded in New York City in January and February of that year, and was produced by <a href="Don%20Was">Don Was</a>. Bass guitar duties were shared by <a href="Rich%20Robinson">Rich Robinson</a> and Was, as <a href="Greg%20Rzab">Greg Rzab</a> had left the band and was not replaced until the tour that followed the release of the album.

The album debuted on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> at its peak position of 20, selling more than 53,000 copies in its first week. "Lions" received mixed reviews; although the overall sound of the album generally garnered praise, a frequent complaint was the lack of "memorable" songs. The critics who rated "Lions" lowest considered it a poor imitation of the band's influences, such as <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>.

The band supported "Lions" with two North American tours (one with <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a> co-headlining), and a short tour of Europe and Japan in between. <a href="Soundboard%20recordings">Soundboard recordings</a> of several concerts were available for download to those who owned the album. Following the tour, the band went on hiatus until 2005.

The Black Crowes began writing songs for the follow-up to their 1999 album "<a href="By%20Your%20Side%20%28Black%20Crowes%20album%29">By Your Side</a>" as free agents, having left <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a> through a loophole in their contract. The decision to leave was driven by Columbia's promotion of "By Your Side". According to band member Rich Robinson, "That record was destined to fail because ... [Columbia executives] just said, 'It's not going to do well ... It's no use wasting time or money.' " The band also was frustrated by the label's request for albums sounding similar to their first, 1990's "<a href="Shake%20Your%20Money%20Maker%20%28album%29">Shake Your Money Maker</a>".

In late 1999, lead vocalist <a href="Chris%20Robinson%20%28singer%29">Chris Robinson</a> began a relationship with <a href="Kate%20Hudson">Kate Hudson</a>, which would influence subtly the lyrics on "Lions". The pair met at a Friday night party in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, which led to a Saturday stroll through <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a> and a Sunday move-in. Their wedding at the <a href="Aspen%2C%20Colorado">Aspen, Colorado</a>, ranch of <a href="Kurt%20Russell">Kurt Russell</a> and Kate's mother, <a href="Goldie%20Hawn">Goldie Hawn</a>, followed on , 2000.

Before the 2000 tour with <a href="Jimmy%20Page">Jimmy Page</a>, bassist <a href="Sven%20Pipien">Sven Pipien</a> was fired after arriving late for a performance and missing the return flight. Rich said it was not enough to warrant termination, but Pipien's defensiveness when confronted about the incident was too much to handle. <a href="Greg%20Rzab">Greg Rzab</a> and <a href="Andy%20Hess">Andy Hess</a> were considered as replacements; the band chose Rzab because he had more touring experience than Hess. Rzab, however, departed before the recording of "Lions".

In mid-2000, the band signed with <a href="Richard%20Branson">Richard Branson</a>'s <a href="V2%20Records">V2 Records</a>. Rich explained, "The cool thing about V2, the reason that we chose them, is that they told us, 'You guys go make the record you want to make. Then give it to us and we'll sell it.' That's what we needed to hear." The freedom V2 afforded through its hands-off approach influenced not only the music, but the album title as well. According to Chris, ""Lions" is a symbol that stands for the fierce feeling and freedom that music allows you."

Chris Robinson granted that the experience of playing <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> songs with Jimmy Page influenced "Lions", but not on a song-by-song basis. "Led Zeppelin's music is very dramatic and very dynamic. That's something we've attempted to do with our style also. I think it definitely affected how we make our music." <a href="Funk">Funk</a> and <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> were bigger influences than on past albums, and "Miracle to Me" was influenced by <a href="Nick%20Drake">Nick Drake</a>.

Chris claimed Kate Hudson's influence on his lyrics was subtle: "More so than a literal reference to her, it's the vantage point from where I'm writing. It's the reasons that I'm singing and it's the feeling. That is an influence far greater than the literal influence." He did grant, however, that "Soul Singing" and "Miracle to Me" were written with Hudson in mind, and explained that the album's track order roughly follows a path from confusion to clarity that mirrored his own. Producer <a href="Don%20Was">Don Was</a> said of Chris, "I realized he was taking on something that was significant. He was writing about becoming a man ... There's a lot of old man/young man symbolism that's a self-conversation ... I don't know that anyone has actually chronicled being 33 [years old] as well as this album."

Heated discussions during the writing of "Lions" were rare, owing to the Robinson brothers' usual method in which Rich writes the music and Chris writes the lyrics. "<a href="Soul%20Singing">Soul Singing</a>" was the only song to cause disagreement; "I'd written this part where although the vocals changed the music stayed the same throughout. I thought we should add something or just not finish it, but Chris thought it was already a song, and a good one. So we talked about that one for a while", Rich recalled.

The Black Crowes had previously sent Was demos to interest him in producing "By Your Side", but Was believed the demos were good enough to be the album. Columbia Records disagreed with Was' assessment, however, leading to <a href="Kevin%20Shirley">Kevin Shirley</a>'s hiring. With complete artistic control under V2 Records, the band was free to hire Was for "Lions". Recording took place in January and at Montana Rehearsal Studios and Theater 99 Recording in New York City. The recording sessions progressed as smoothly as the writing; only "Come On" caused conflict between the band and Was. Rich acknowledged, "We must have recorded 'Come On' about five times in different ways ... Then [Was] just took it away with him and came back with this different mix", which impressed the band, leading to its inclusion on the album. The band ultimately was satisfied by the recording experience, finding that Was was devoted to helping realize their vision for the album rather than imposing his own.

The sessions were recorded on tape and <a href="Pro-Tools">Pro-Tools</a> simultaneously; the band ultimately chose to use the tape version, as they preferred its sound quality. Most songs were recorded live with the band members playing together in one room, and microphones set up to capture the overall sound rather than that of individual instruments. Was felt this approach best approximated the feel of a Black Crowes concert, later noting that the "Lions" songs debuted at a private show in "sounded exactly like the record." Most of the recordings that comprise the album were recorded during preproduction, the purpose of which was to test arrangements. "[W]e didn't think we were recording the record. And it turned out to be great" said Rich. Audley Freed played guitar on only three tracks because Rich did not want "the meat of the song, which is the riff", to get lost in a "wall of sound". Though Rich brought his entire collection of guitars and a number of <a href="guitar%20amplifier">amplifiers</a>, he mostly recorded with a 1954 <a href="Fender%20Esquire">Fender Esquire</a> through a Harry Joyce amp. To achieve a <a href="resonator%20guitar">resonator</a>-like tone on "Soul Singing", he used a James Trussart metal-bodied electric. Since Andy Hess did not join The Black Crowes until the above private show, the band did not have a <a href="bass%20guitar">bassist</a> during the recording sessions; Rich thus played bass on most tracks. On "Lay It All on Me", however, Rich played piano, leaving the bass guitar duties to Don Was.

A total of twenty songs were recorded during the "Lions" sessions. Of the seven cut from the album, four were mixed and mastered for potential release; three ("Last Time Again", "Love Is Now" and "Sleepyheads") appeared as <a href="B-side">B-side</a>s, and the other ("The Pretty Gurl Song") circulates on a <a href="bootleg%20recording">bootleg recording</a>.

Soon after the "Lions" sessions, V2 Records threw a "completion party" at The Bank in New York City, at which The Black Crowes performed four songs from the new album, five songs from their catalog and a cover of <a href="Fleetwood%20Mac">Fleetwood Mac</a>'s "Oh Well". The band then played scattered dates in the U.S. and UK, including an appearance on "<a href="Later...%20with%20Jools%20Holland">Later... with Jools Holland</a>", ahead of "Lions"' release. During this sequence of concerts, every song from the album was performed except "Losing My Mind" and "Ozone Mama"; the remaining two would be played on the album-supporting tour.

"Lions" was released on , 2001, in the UK and a day later in the U.S.; it subsequently debuted at its peak position of number 20 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart, and sold over 53,000 copies in its first week. As of , the album had sold 192,000 copies in the U.S.

Around the album's release, band members made numerous promotional appearances. Chris Robinson guested on "<a href="The%20Daily%20Show%20with%20Jon%20Stewart">The Daily Show with Jon Stewart</a>" the day before the album was released in the U.S., and Chris and Steve Gorman appeared on "<a href="The%20Howard%20Stern%20Show">The Howard Stern Show</a>" the following day. The band performed "Soul Singing" on "<a href="The%20Tonight%20Show%20with%20Jay%20Leno">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a>" on , and was inducted into <a href="Guitar%20Center%23Hollywood%27s%20RockWalk">Hollywood's RockWalk</a> four days later. A second <a href="late%20night%20television">late night television</a> performance of "Soul Singing" took place on , this time on the "<a href="Late%20Show%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Show with David Letterman</a>".

"Lickin'" was the first single from the album; it peaked at number 9 on "Billboard"'s <a href="Mainstream%20Rock%20Tracks">Mainstream Rock Tracks</a> on . The song's <a href="music%20video">promotional video</a> was a compilation of various takes of a static, <a href="low-angle%20shot">low-angle shot</a> of the band performing the song on a tiny stage. Second single "Soul Singing" peaked at number 12 on the same chart on ; its promotional video featured the band playing in a grassy field as the sun rises in the sky. A third single, "Miracle to Me", was canceled, but not before a promotional video was shot of the band ostensibly recording the song in a studio. Videos also were filmed for "Come On", "Greasy Grass River" and "Cypress Tree". Despite not playing on the album, Andy Hess appears in some of these videos, all of which are available as <a href="streaming%20media">streaming media</a> on the band's official website.

Media reviews of "Lions" were mixed. Numerous writers detected a Led Zeppelin influence (which was praised by some, but panned by others) and attributed it to The Black Crowes' recent tour with Jimmy Page. Dave McKenna, writing for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", compared <a href="Steve%20Gorman">Steve Gorman</a>'s drumming to that of <a href="John%20Bonham">John Bonham</a> and found analogs to specific guitar and keyboard tones in Led Zeppelin albums. Nigel Williamson of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" found similarities in Chris Robinson's voice on "Come On" to that of <a href="Robert%20Plant">Robert Plant</a>, and wrote that the song "could almost be a "<a href="Led%20Zeppelin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">Led Zeppelin II</a>" cast off." Other reviewers noted similarities to <a href="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>; Howard Cohen of "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>" called "Lickin'" "the best Aerosmith single that band hasn't recorded in years." The perceived lack of originality, though, turned off some critics. The "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>"'s Andrew McUtchen inferred "The Black Crowes are unaware it's no longer the '70s and after one listen to "Lions" ... it's clear someone should tell them." Everett True of <a href="Playlouder">Playlouder</a> concurred, writing "It's blindingly obvious the Crowes are imitators, and always will be", though Elysa Gardner, writing for "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>", recognized the band "exhibit an energy and dexterity that compensate—at least somewhat—for their lack of invention."

Many reviewers praised the sound of "Lions" but felt the songs were weak. Writing for <a href="dotmusic">dotmusic</a>, John Mulvey highlighted the "gutsy, no-messing sound", but appreciated "Cosmic Friend" for being "as impressively mad as you'd hope, too, beginning like <a href="Beatles">Beatles</a> psychedelia, taking in massive Brazilian drumming and a touch of <a href="pedal%20steel">pedal steel</a>, before coalescing into furious heavy rock." <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> described "Lions" as a "powerful, textured hard rock record that covers a lot of ground, surging from powerful riffs to gospel choruses and funkier-than-expected riffs", though he also complained that "the songs can seem incomplete." Critics disagreed on which songs were lacking, though. "Losing My Mind" and "Young Man, Old Man" were called "highlights" by Jane Stevenson of the "<a href="Toronto%20Sun">Toronto Sun</a>", though elsewhere the former was called "woeful" and the latter a "'<a href="Freddie%27s%20Dead">Freddie's Dead</a>' vamp" that should have been skipped.

The lyrics of "Lions" were another target for the critics. Mark Beaumont of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" stated that the eloquence ends at the "Come awn come awn!/Everyone!" chorus of "Come On", and Stephen Thompson of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" bemoaned that "hoary tropes abound". 

Shortly after the release of "Lions", The Black Crowes and <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a>, with opening band <a href="Spacehog">Spacehog</a>, embarked on a co-headlining tour of North American theaters and amphitheaters. The Black Crowes had previously met <a href="Liam%20Gallagher">Liam</a> and <a href="Noel%20Gallagher">Noel Gallagher</a> and hit it off; "... so we called them and asked them if they were interested [in touring together]. And so they were like, 'Yeah, we'd love to!'" said Rich. The Black Crowes performed last each night, and their seventy-five-minute set always included numerous songs from "Lions". Members of Oasis typically would join them for an encore cover such as "<a href="Lucifer%20Sam">Lucifer Sam</a>", "<a href="Can%27t%20You%20Hear%20Me%20Knocking">Can't You Hear Me Knocking</a>" or "<a href="Road%20Runner%20%28Bo%20Diddley%20song%29">Road Runner</a>".

The Black Crowes followed the tour with one-off dates and festivals across Europe and Japan, including shows opening for <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a>. Most of these shows, as well as most of the dates with Oasis, were made available by V2 Records as soundboard recordings. With "Lions" loaded in a <a href="CD-ROM">CD-ROM</a> drive, one could stream each show, as well as download one live track per week and one show in its entirety.

Following a month-long break, the group returned to the road in late August for their <a href="Listen%20Massive%20Tour">Listen Massive Tour</a>, with <a href="Beachwood%20Sparks">Beachwood Sparks</a> as the opening band. The tour was billed as a return to two-hour shows featuring a rotating set list. The show at the <a href="Greek%20Theatre%20%28Los%20Angeles%29">Greek Theatre</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> was canceled, but the band performed the next evening in <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson, Arizona</a>, as scheduled. All profits and merchandise sales from the following week's three shows at the <a href="Beacon%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Beacon Theatre</a> in New York City were donated to the New York State World Trade Center Relief Fund and the New York City Public/Private Initiative. While in New York City, Chris and Rich performed "<a href="By%20Your%20Side%20%28The%20Black%20Crowes%20song%29">By Your Side</a>" on "<a href="Late%20Night%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien">Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a>". The Listen Massive Tour concluded with a 140-minute show at the <a href="Orpheum%20Theatre%20%28Boston%29">Orpheum Theatre</a> in <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston, Massachusetts</a>, on . This would be Andy Hess and Audley Freed's last show as band members, as The Black Crowes went on hiatus shortly thereafter.

Percy Fender

Percy George Herbert Fender (22 August 1892 – 15 June 1985) was an English <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played 13 <a href="Test%20cricket">Tests</a> and was captain of <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> between 1921 and 1931. An <a href="all-rounder">all-rounder</a>, he was a middle-order batsman who bowled mainly <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a>, and completed the cricketer's <a href="Double%20%28cricket%29">double</a> seven times. Noted as a belligerent batsman, in 1920 he hit the fastest recorded first-class <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">century</a>, reaching three figures in 35 minutes which remains a record in 2016. On the basis of his Surrey captaincy, contemporaries judged him the best captain in England.

As early as 1914 Fender was named one of <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">"Wisden's"</a> <a href="Wisden%20Cricketer%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>. After <a href="First%20World%20War">war service</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> he re-established himself in the Surrey team and became captain in 1921. His captaincy inspired the team to challenge strongly for the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> over the course of several seasons, despite a shortage of effective bowlers. Alongside his forceful though sometimes controversial leadership, Fender was an effective performer with bat and ball, although he lacked support as a bowler. From 1921, he played occasionally in Tests for <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a> but was never particularly successful. Despite press promptings, he was never appointed Test captain, and following a clash with the highly influential <a href="George%20Harris%2C%204th%20Baron%20Harris">Lord Harris</a> in 1924, his England career was effectively ended. Further disagreements between Fender and the Surrey committee over his approach and tactics led the county to replace him as captain in 1932 and to end his career in 1935.

A very recognisable figure, Fender was popular with his team and with supporters. Cartoonists enjoyed caricaturing his distinctive appearance, but he was also well known outside cricket for his presence in <a href="High%20society%20%28group%29">society</a>. In addition to his cricket career, Fender worked in the wine trade, had a successful career in journalism, and wrote several well-received books on cricket tours. He worked well into the 1970s, even after going blind. He died in 1985.

Fender was the elder son of Percy Robert Fender, the director of a firm of <a href="Stationery">stationers</a>, and Lily, "née" Herbert. Born in <a href="Balham">Balham</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>, in 1892, he was encouraged to play cricket by his mother's family who were involved in <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a> club cricket, and from the age of eight he attended cricket matches to watch <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a> when visiting them. First educated at <a href="St%20George%27s%20College%2C%20Weybridge">St George's College, Weybridge</a>, then at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20School%2C%20London">St Paul's School, London</a>, Fender did not excel academically, but was proficient in many sports.

At St Paul's, Fender began to attract attention as a cricketer. Awarded his <a href="school%20colours">school colours</a> in 1908, he remained in the school team for three years. In 1909, he topped the school's <a href="Batting%20average%20%28cricket%29">batting averages</a>, scoring a century in one match against <a href="Bedford%20School">Bedford School</a>. In the same game, he was criticised by his schoolmaster for bowling <a href="Lob%20bowling">lobs</a>. Fender's success led to his selection for a representing <a href="Public%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Public Schools</a> XI against the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a>. His success for St Paul's continued in 1910, but his school career came to an abrupt end following an argument between his father and the <a href="High%20Master%20%28academic%29">High Master</a> of the school. The dispute concerned a cricket match which Fender had played without parental permission, and his father was unhappy that cricket was taking precedence over academic studies. Fender was removed from the school immediately; he still came top of the batting averages for 1910 but although selected, he was not allowed to play at Lord's that summer as he was no longer a schoolboy. Despite his successes, St Paul's cricket masters did not consider him a reliable cricketer; he was criticised for taking too many risks when batting and for experimenting with too many different styles while bowling. Fender's biographer, Richard Streeton, observes that "Fender's experiments were frowned upon from his earliest days but ... already there was never any shortage of ideas in his cricket thinking."

While at school, Fender spent his summers with his grandparents in Brighton, which qualified him to play County Cricket for Sussex. When he left school in 1910, he attracted the interest of the club and, after success in both local cricket and second-team matches, he made his first-class debut on 21 July as an <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a> in Sussex's <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a> match against <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a>. He played one other game that season, against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>, where he was shaken by the pace of two opposing bowlers. In the two games, Fender scored 19 runs and took one wicket.

After the 1910 cricket season, Fender worked in a paper mill in <a href="Horwich">Horwich</a>, Lancashire, to experience paper manufacturing—his father's line of business—at first hand. While feeding paper into a machine, his left hand was trapped in the mechanism and injured. Three of his fingers were crushed at the tips; upon healing, they remained stiff and numb for the rest of his life. Fender remained in Horwich at the start of the 1911 cricket season and played several times for <a href="Manchester%20Cricket%20Club">Manchester Cricket Club</a>. He was on the verge of selection for <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> when he had to return to Brighton. That season he played twice for Sussex; the following year, in his second match for the county, he scored his maiden first-class century, against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>. He followed this by taking five for 42 (five wickets taken and 42 runs conceded) against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>. After these successes, Fender played regularly for the remainder of the 1912 season. In total, he scored 606 runs at an <a href="Batting%20average%20%28cricket%29">average</a> of 24.24, and, bowling <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium pace</a>, took 16 wickets at an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 25.50.

In 1913, Fender was a regular member of the Sussex county side. In the first two months of the season, he made a considerable impact; in 21 innings with the bat, he scored six fifties and one century. His reputation as an exciting, big-hitting batsman grew quickly, and he was chosen in the representative <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen v Players</a> matches at Lord's and <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>. His performances for the Gentlemen, a team of amateurs, were unsuccessful, and the failure affected his form for the rest of the season. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" commented that he was not worth his place in the team in these latter months. Even so, he reached 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the first time: 1,163 runs at an average of 23.73. He also took 34 wickets at 35.08.

Fender initially wanted to be a barrister, but his family could not afford the costs. By 1914, he was working for the firm of paper manufacturers and stationers of which his father was managing director. Although he permitted Fender to play cricket, his father believed that sport and a business career were incompatible. Fender disagreed, suggesting that the contacts made in county cricket offset the lost working time. To aid his business career, Fender moved to London during the winter of 1913–14. Fender was qualified by his birthplace to play for Surrey, and the county was happy to register him for the County Championship. Fender attended to business matters before and after each day's play, and often combined Surrey's trips to away matches with business meetings. Socially, Fender became a familiar figure in <a href="Gentlemen%27s%20club">clubs</a> and the theatre. He became friends with the actor <a href="Jack%20Hulbert">Jack Hulbert</a> and developed an interest in musical theatre, for which he provided financial support; he also wrote lyrics for some songs. By the end of the 1914 season, Fender had convinced his father that he could successfully combine cricket and business. His improvement as a cricketer was recognised when was chosen as one of "Wisden's" <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a> for 1914.

As a player, Fender quickly made an impact for Surrey. He took a <a href="Hat%20trick%23Cricket">hat-trick</a> in his second game, and scored a century in his fifth, to establish his popularity with the Surrey crowds. During the season Fender scored 820 runs, often very quickly, and took 83 wickets including some through experimenting with <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> bowling. According to "Wisden" his worth was measured by more than figures: "As a match winning factor he is a far greater force on a side than his records would suggest." In a powerful Surrey side he batted aggressively, bowled more frequently than at Sussex—mainly as a support bowler to the main attack—and established a reputation as a <a href="Slip%20%28cricket%29">slip fielder</a>. A teammate judged that Fender was the "making" of the team, and "Wisden" commented that "he always seemed the right man in the right place". A late replacement in the Gentlemen v Players game at Lord's, Fender was not particularly successful but made a good impression on critics. The season ended prematurely because of the outbreak of war in August 1914. Surrey had established a commanding lead in the County Championship table; as their nearest challengers had no objection, the MCC declared them as county champions.

Immediately following the cancellation of county cricket in 1914, Fender enlisted in the army, joining the <a href="Inns%20of%20Court%20Regiment">Inns of Court Regiment</a>. Commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Fusiliers">Royal Fusiliers</a>, Fender disliked the routine of army life. With the help of the cricketer <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a>, who worked in the War Office, he was transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> in 1915. Fender was initially stationed in London, where he was involved in work repelling <a href="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> attacks, before being sent to India in 1916. Soon after his arrival, he became ill with <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, possibly <a href="cholera">cholera</a> and several other diseases. He returned to England to recover but was left weak for much of the following two years. Army doctors were unsure what exactly was wrong with Fender and he remained in their care until 1918. He played some charity cricket in 1917 and 1918, but did not return to light duties with the Royal Flying Corps until the latter year. Just as he seemed to have recovered fully, he fractured his left leg in five places playing <a href="Association%20football">football</a> at the end of 1918. He remained on crutches throughout the remainder of 1918 and 1919, missing the resumption of county cricket in 1919. While incapacitated, Fender attempted to gain a place at <a href="Caius%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Caius College, Cambridge</a>, but was turned down owing to the restriction his injury placed upon his cricket, and his desire to concentrate on academic interests to further his business career—the interviewing panel only wanted him as a cricketer. Although he recovered in time to play in the 1920 season, his leg troubled him for the remainder of his career; he was left with a minor limp, and long spells of fielding left him in pain.

Surrey's official captain for 1920, <a href="Cyril%20Wilkinson">Cyril Wilkinson</a>, missed much of the 1920 season and was unavailable for the opening matches. As the only amateur in the team who was expected to play regularly, Fender was appointed as captain in Wilkinson's absence. He led the team to victory in his first two matches in charge, and ten of his first twelve games. Wilkinson resumed the leadership at several points during the season, but his return in the final weeks coincided with a poor run of results. He consequently withdrew for two crucial games, and allowed Fender to captain the side. That year Surrey had few effective bowlers; Fender was the leading wicket-taker with 109 wickets in County Championship games. In all first-class matches he took 124 wickets at an average of 21.40 to reach 100 wickets in a season for the first time. Inconsistent with the bat, particularly in the latter half of the season, he scored 841 runs at 20.51. In almost every match Fender contributed, either with bat, ball or in the field. His captaincy was very effective; his flair and willingness to use unconventional tactics were unusual at the time. This was quickly noticed by the public, who appreciated Surrey's entertaining brand of cricket. Several games were won by Surrey after Fender used unorthodox methods to force the pace. In addition, Fender's batting and bowling swayed several games in Surrey's favour. Surrey finished third in the County Championship, but lost their final match, against Middlesex, when victory would have made them champions. Surrey needed 244 to win but Fender's instruction to his batsmen to attempt to score faster had an adverse effect, and he later blamed himself for the defeat. Nevertheless, he was appointed permanent captain for the following season.

Against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> in one of the last games of the 1920 season, Surrey had passed Northamptonshire's score and were in a dominant position when Fender batted. He was dropped early on but batting in a carefree, aggressive style, reached 100 runs in 35 minutes, as of 2016 still the fastest individual century on record in first-class cricket. In total, he scored 113 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> and shared a partnership of 171 runs in 42 minutes with <a href="Alan%20Peach">Alan Peach</a>. Although acknowledged to be a fast innings, Fender's century was not recognised as a record at the time; cricket records were not widely kept or studied, and other innings were believed to have been quicker. Surrey went on to win the match.

Chosen for the Gentlemen v Players, Fender had his first success in the fixture, hitting 50 in 40 minutes, the highest score for the Gentlemen in the match; it may have influenced his selection for the MCC team to tour Australia. Some sections of the press suggested Fender should captain that team, but <a href="Reggie%20Spooner">Reginald Spooner</a> was initially appointed by the MCC; when he was unavailable, <a href="Johnny%20Douglas">J. W. H. T. Douglas</a> became captain. Fender was included in the team, and the press regarded his selection as a formality.

During the MCC tour of Australia, England lost every game of the five-match Test series. Fender played infrequently and with little success during the early part of the tour. Douglas rarely used him as a bowler, and for the first Test, he was omitted from the team at the last minute and was <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23T">twelfth man</a>. He was eventually selected for the third Test; <a href="J.%20W.%20Hearne">Jack Hearne</a> was unavailable owing to illness, and Fender had recently been successful in a tour game. The tour manager <a href="Frederick%20Toone">Frederick Toone</a> had suggested that Fender should replace Douglas as captain, an idea which had the support of two of the team's leading professionals, but Douglas refused. Fender made his Test debut on 14 January 1921 but achieved little with bat or ball, partly owing to his lack of match practice in the preceding weeks. He dropped a catch from <a href="Charles%20Kelleway">Charles Kelleway</a>, who went on to score 147 runs. Nevertheless, Fender retained his place in the team for the remainder of the series. In the fourth Test, he took five for 122, and achieved five for 90 in the fifth and final game. He led the English Test bowling averages with 12 wickets at an average of 34.16, and was the only England spin bowler to make the ball turn on the hard Australian pitches, though he was not particularly <a href="Good%20length%20ball">accurate</a>. With the bat, he scored 59 in the fourth Test and passed 40 in two other innings. In the last game of the tour, against <a href="South%20Australia%20cricket%20team">South Australia</a>, Fender took 12 wickets, including seven for 75 in the first innings. In general, he withstood the hot weather better than his teammates, but his weak leg made fielding painful on the hard ground. In all first-class games on the tour, he scored 325 runs at 27.08 and took 32 wickets at 32.71.

As an amateur, Fender was not paid for the tour, but some of his expenses were paid by the MCC. However, tours at the time often left many amateurs out of pocket. To offset their costs, Fender and his teammate <a href="Rockley%20Wilson">Rockley Wilson</a> wrote for several newspapers and magazines during the tour. Their comments were unpopular in Australia, particularly in the final Test when Wilson criticised the behaviour of the Australian spectators. Fender was barracked several times by the crowds when reports reached Australia of his newspaper columns; occasionally, the crowds chanted "Please Go Home Fender", making a play on his initials. Fender made light of this, joining in by conducting the barrackers. In subsequent tours, the MCC forbade cricketers from writing about matches in which they were playing. On his way home, Fender wrote an account of the tour which was published as "Defending the Ashes". However, he did not elaborate on his own opinions, and left out any controversy.

The Australian team joined the MCC cricketers on the journey to England, to play a further five Tests in 1921. Once again, some newspapers suggested Fender should captain the England team, but Douglas was initially retained; as the series progressed, several writers lamented the fact that Fender was overlooked. Fender began the season poorly and was not picked for the first three Tests, all of which were won by Australia. The England selectors tried 30 players in the course of the summer, many of whom critics did not consider to be of suitable quality. Fender began to take wickets consistently in the middle of the season, and scored a century in the Gentlemen v Players match, so he was chosen for the fourth Test. The game was drawn, affected by rain. Fender scored 44 not out and took two for 30 in the game. The final match was also a rain-ruined draw; Fender retained his place but had little success. He later said that he learned a great deal from <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a>'s captaincy of the Australians.

Fender had greater success for Surrey in 1921. For the second year in succession Surrey played Middlesex in the final game of the season, to decide the County Championship, and again they lost. They finished second in the table, but were hampered by a lack of quality bowling. "Wisden" praised Fender's handling of his modest bowling resources, and stated that much of Surrey's success came from his captaincy. Several of Surrey's wins were very close, and came after Fender <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a>. Fender included a <a href="Lob%20bowling">lob bowler</a>, <a href="Trevor%20Molony">Trevor Molony</a>, in three games; lob bowling had practically died out from first-class cricket, and Molony was the last specialist underarm bowler selected in county cricket. But Molony met with limited success and faded out of cricket. Owing to the lack of alternatives, Fender had to use his own bowling frequently, and often conceded many runs. "Wisden" said he was generally effective with the ball and described his fielding as "dazzling", but suggested that his best batting came for teams other than Surrey. In all first-class matches Fender completed the <a href="Double%20%28cricket%29">double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets</a> for the first time; he scored 1,152 runs at 21.33 and took 134 wickets at 26.58. He also took 53 catches to become the first cricketer to pass 50 catches while completing the double; as of 2016, only <a href="Peter%20Walker%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201936%29">Peter Walker</a> has also done so.

Fender completed the double in 1922 with 1,169 runs and 157 wickets, Surrey finished third in the Championship, and once again the lack of effective bowling hindered the team. "Wisden" described the team's success as "nothing less than a triumph for Mr Fender". Despite damp weather which did not suit his style, he bowled more than his share of overs, often because there were few alternative bowlers. "Wisden" said: "Essentially a change bowler [one who bowls while the main bowlers are rested]—the best in England, as he has been aptly described—he became by force of circumstances the chief attacking force". He bowled mainly leg spin, but often bowled successfully at medium pace. "Wisden" praised his inspirational captaincy, and concluded: "Over and above all this he was, by general consent, by far the best of the county captains, never losing his grip of the game and managing his side with a judgement that was seldom at fault." During the season, Fender began to wear glasses in an attempt to cure headaches; the remedy worked, although he later discovered there was nothing wrong with his eyesight, and the lenses he wore were little more than plain glass. The first time he wore glasses, Fender scored 185 in 130 minutes against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>. Other rapid scoring feats included 91 in 50 minutes against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a> and 137 in 90 minutes against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a>. There were no Tests in 1922, but <a href="Sydney%20Pardon">Sydney Pardon</a> wrote that Fender was the only amateur who could be guaranteed a place on ability alone in an England team. Late in the season, Fender was involved in a public dispute with <a href="George%20Harris%2C%204th%20Baron%20Harris">Lord Harris</a> over the qualification of <a href="Alfred%20Jeacocke">Alfred Jeacocke</a> to play for Surrey. Harris, the influential treasurer of the MCC and chairman of Kent, had noticed that Jeacocke's qualification had lapsed when he moved across the border from Surrey to Kent, albeit living on the same road. Fender, privately furious with Harris, publicly defended Jeacocke, and the press supported him; the rules were altered the following season to allow Jeacocke to continue to play for Surrey.

Fender was chosen in the MCC team to tour South Africa in 1922–23, but despite support from journalists, he was not chosen as captain. <a href="Frank%20Mann%20%28cricketer%29">Frank Mann</a> led the team; his appointment was criticised in the press, which judged him to lack playing ability and suggested that the selectors favoured those associated with Lord's—Mann was Middlesex captain. Mann appointed Fender his vice-captain on the journey to South Africa, but played every match on the tour to leave Fender with no opportunity to lead the side. England won the Test series 2–1, but Fender had some difficulties playing on the matting pitches used in South Africa, on which the ball bounced and turned in a different fashion from the turf on which cricket was played in England. He began in good batting form, scoring 96 in the first match, and he passed fifty on two other occasions, including an uncharacteristically defensive innings of 60 in the third Test, but his batting faded as the tour progressed. He was generally successful as a bowler, but proved expensive in the Tests. However, his best bowling performance according to his teammates came in the second Test, when he took four for 29 on the first day; all the South Africans found it difficult to bat against him, and he later described it as one of the best bowling spells of his career. He played in all five Tests, scoring 128 runs at an average of 14.22 and taking 10 wickets at 41.80, while in all first-class games, he scored 459 runs at 22.95 and took 58 wickets at 19.58.

In 1923 Fender enjoyed his best all-round season, scoring 1,427 runs and taking 178 wickets. The former was the second best aggregate of his career, the latter his highest total of wickets. Again, there were no Test matches, but Fender played in two Test trials. He was successful in the first match, taking six for 44 and scoring 49 runs, but his performance was overshadowed by continued controversy over the captaincy; Fender was not asked to captain a side in either match. The press questioned why the selectors ignored Fender's captaincy claims even though, in the view of journalists, he was the most deserving candidate. One writer suggested that Lord's "resented" Fender's success, and that politics prevented his appointment. At that time it was usual for amateurs and professionals to enter the field of play from different gates; Fender's habit was to use the same gate as his professionals. This brought a rebuke for Fender from Lord Harris, who said: "We do not want that sort of thing at Lord's, Fender". Surrey finished fourth in the Championship, hampered once again by their lack of bowlers; their batsmen frequently made large scores but the team could not bowl out the opposition and many games were drawn. Fender's batting continued to be effective, but he demonstrated a more restrained approach and improved his defence. Again, he had a heavy bowling workload given the lack of support, and "Wisden" said that he bowled with "pronounced spin and variety of device".

Fender's form dipped in 1924 after a good start with bat and ball; thereafter, despite occasional successes, he lacked consistency. Surrey finished third in the Championship, and Fender contributed 1,004 runs and 84 wickets in all first-class matches. Once again, Fender was a candidate for the England captaincy—South Africa played a Test series that season, and the MCC were to tour Australia in 1924–25. The eventual appointment of <a href="Arthur%20Gilligan">Arthur Gilligan</a> was criticised in the press, which again speculated why Fender was not chosen. Fender's prospects of leading England receded further when he clashed once more with Lord Harris. The MCC had rebuked two county committees for covering their pitches prior to matches against the South Africans during a spell of wet weather. Fender pointed out in a letter published by the press that Lord Harris and the MCC were aware that this was common practice at the <a href="Scarborough%20Festival">Scarborough Festival</a>, despite their claims to the contrary. When Fender next played at Lord's, the furious Lord Harris summoned Fender to admonish him. Fender always regretted his indiscretion and believed it finished any chance he had of the England captaincy. Fender played in the first two Tests, without much success, and was dropped; he played only one more Test in his career. Gilligan was injured during the series, but the selectors recalled Douglas as captain rather than select Fender. When the team to tour Australia that winter was chosen, Fender was not selected, a decision which upset him deeply. Fender was married at the end of the 1924 cricket season, and in the off-season wrote about the MCC tour of Australia for the "<a href="Daily%20Express">Daily Express</a>".

In 1925, Fender returned to his best form, completing the double with 1,042 runs and 137 wickets. Surrey finished second in the table and by the end of the season had not lost a Championship match at the Oval for five years. However, they never challenged the champions, Yorkshire, and this proved to be the last time under Fender's leadership that the team finished near the top of the Championship table. In the view of the press, Fender remained a potential England captain for <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> series in 1926, but <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a> was chosen. In his survey of England cricket captains, <a href="Alan%20Gibson">Alan Gibson</a> suggests that Fender and Carr were the only two realistic candidates by that time—other county captains either lacked the skill to play Tests or had already been tried and discarded. When Carr was dropped before the final Test, the journalist <a href="Sir%20Home%20Gordon%2C%2012th%20Baronet">Home Gordon</a> reported that a "certain amateur"—Gibson suggests this must have been Fender—was waiting by the phone for news that he was to captain England. In the event, <a href="Percy%20Chapman">Percy Chapman</a> took over for the final match and England regained the Ashes. However, Streeton believes that by this stage, Fender was never likely to be chosen; he played in a Test trial match and for the Gentlemen against the Players, but <a href="Greville%20Stevens">Greville Stevens</a> was preferred in the England team. In all first-class matches, Fender completed the double again with 1,043 runs and 112 wickets. After the season, he joined a short tour of Jamaica led by <a href="Lionel%20Tennyson%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Tennyson">Lord Tennyson</a>, playing three first-class matches.

In the following seasons, Surrey dropped steadily down the Championship table. Fender failed to reach 1,000 runs in 1927, although his average of 31.96 was his best for five seasons; he also took 89 wickets at 25.75. That season, he achieved one of the best bowling performances of his career when he took six wickets in 11 balls against Middlesex, to become the first player in first-class cricket to take six wickets in so few deliveries. This remained a record until 1972 when <a href="Pat%20Pocock">Pat Pocock</a> took seven wickets in 11 balls. Fender went on to take seven wickets in 19 balls; his final analysis was seven for 10. The following two seasons were his best with the bat; in 1928, he scored 1,376 runs at 37.18, his highest average in a season, and in 1929 he scored 1,625 runs, his highest run aggregate. He was less successful with the ball: in 1928 he took 110 wickets but his bowling average rose to 28, and took 88 wickets at an average of over 30 in 1929. His good form at the start of 1929 led to his recall to the England team, and he played one Test against South Africa. This was his final Test; overall, in 13 Tests, he scored 380 runs at an average of 19.00 and took 29 wickets at 40.86. By that season, Surrey had fallen to tenth in the table.

During the MCC tour to Australia in 1928–29, the Australian batsman <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a> made his Test debut. Covering the tour as a journalist, Fender judged that Bradman "was one of the most curious mixtures of good and bad batting I have ever seen", but was not convinced by his ability at the time. Bradman came to England with the Australian touring team in 1930, and was extremely successful; during the course of the season, Fender completely changed his mind—not least when Bradman, particularly determined to succeed against Fender following his criticism, scored 252 against Surrey. Fender played fewer matches than in previous seasons, as he was writing on the Tests for a newspaper; in the 1930 season, he scored 700 runs and took 65 wickets. Meanwhile, the Australian victory in the Test series owed much to Bradman, who scored 974 runs in seven innings, breaking several records in the process. His success, and the manner of it, concerned the English authorities, and Fender among others believed that success against Bradman was to be found in adopting new tactics. In his newspaper reports that summer, Fender was critical of Bradman during one spell in the final Test when he batted unconvincingly against fast bowler <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> on a pitch affected by rain. Fender passed this information on to his Surrey colleague <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a>, who was later named England captain for the MCC tour of 1932–33. Over the following months, Australian journalists kept Fender informed of developments in batting in that country, information which he passed on to Jardine. Jardine later conceived the strategy of <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>, where fast bowlers bowled at the batsmen's <a href="leg%20stump">leg stump</a>, frequently pitching the ball short and hitting him. The tactic was contentious, and created much ill-feeling between the players. Fender did not cover the tour as a journalist, as his newspaper sent <a href="Jack%20Hobbs">Jack Hobbs</a> instead. However, during the tour Jardine wrote to inform Fender that much of his information had been correct and that he was adapting his tactics accordingly.
Fender later insisted that his role was minor in creating the strategy, but he was close to both Jardine and Arthur Carr, who discussed the plans before the tour began; some writers suggested that the original idea was Fender's.

Early in 1931 Fender offered to resign as Surrey's captain, to give Jardine more experience of leadership before he assumed the England captaincy, but Surrey declined. Fender scored 916 runs and took 84 wickets that season. However, the Surrey committee were becoming disillusioned with Fender as captain after he had missed matches in 1930 to work as a journalist. Another point of contention was that Fender, against the wishes of the committee, preferred to keep in-form professional players in the team instead of playing amateurs when they were available. There were disagreements over expenses, and the committee disapproved when Fender declared Surrey's innings closed after one ball, to make up time in a rain-affected match. A series of other controversial incidents further antagonised the committee. As a result, Fender was dismissed in January 1932, a move rumoured in the press for some time and which was quickly leaked. The club released a statement which said Fender would only stand down if a suitable replacement could be found, before Jardine was officially appointed in March. It is likely that the uncertainty arose because Jardine took his time in accepting the position. Fender supported Jardine's appointment, and pledged to continue playing under his captaincy.

Fender played less frequently in the following seasons, as his appearances were restricted by journalistic and business requirements. He scored over 400 runs in each season between 1932 and 1935 and scored two centuries in that time, both in 1933. With the ball, he took over 60 wickets in each season, although with higher bowling averages than earlier in his career. Having played regularly for the Gentlemen against the Players throughout his career, he made his last appearance in the match in 1934. He continued to be an effective member of the county team, which he occasionally led when the regular captain—initially Jardine, later, <a href="Errol%20Holmes">Errol Holmes</a>—was absent. Prior to the 1936 season Holmes suggested to Fender that he should play fewer games for Surrey that year. Rather than do so, Fender preferred not to play at all, and he informed the committee that he would no longer represent the county. The committee publicly thanked Fender, but the reasons for the sudden termination of his county career are unclear; rumours suggested that some factions at Surrey wanted Fender out of the club. In the event, Fender played two first-class matches in 1936, captaining MCC teams against Oxford and <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge</a> universities; these were his final appearances in first-class cricket. In all first-class matches, he scored 19,034 runs at an average of 26.65, and took 1,894 wickets at 25.05. He continued to play minor cricket for some time, and maintained his association with the sport for many years. His most notable appearance came after the war, when he captained an "Old England XI", featuring many former England players, against Surrey in 1946 in a match to celebrate Surrey's centenary.

During the Second World War, Fender joined the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>, reaching the rank of Wing Commander. He worked in southern England with a responsibility for moving men and equipment, and was mentioned in dispatches for his role in preparations for <a href="Operation%20Overlord">the Allied invasion of Europe</a>. Later, he was posted to various parts of the world in his role in movements.

In the 1920s, Fender was approached four times to stand for <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> as a <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party candidate</a> and declined each time. Between 1952 and 1958, he served as a Conservative member on the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> and later was appointed <a href="Deputy%20Lieutenant">Deputy Lieutenant</a> of London. In the late 1970s, Fender became blind, and moved in with his daughter, although continuing to run his business. He travelled to Australia in 1977 to attend celebrations that marked 100 years of Test cricket and was the oldest man there. In his final years, he moved into a nursing home and died there on 15 June 1985.

As a batsman, Fender's approach was aggressive; whatever the circumstances he hit the ball very hard, and his ability to play a variety of strokes made it difficult for captains to place fielders effectively. He batted with his weight mainly on his front foot and used powerful wrist-work to send the ball in different directions while playing the same stroke. Among his favoured shots were the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Orthodox%20technique%20and%20strokeplay">drive, pull and cut</a>. Other than his 35-minute century, he played many innings in which he scored quickly, and the cricket historian <a href="Gerald%20Brodribb">Gerald Brodribb</a> has calculated that Fender was among first-class cricket's fastest scorers, with an average rate of 62 runs an hour. He also recorded several notably powerful hits, including one which sent the ball 132 yards. Fender's aggressive approach made him an inconsistent scorer, but Surrey had a strong batting side and his hitting power was more valuable to the team than if he had played in more orthodox fashion. The side's batting strength meant that Fender rarely had to play defensively, although he could do so if the situation demanded.

Originally a fast-medium bowler—a style to which he sometimes reverted when Surrey were short of bowlers—Fender's main bowling style was wrist spin, and he could spin the ball effectively. He gripped the ball differently from most wrist spinners, using his thumb and first two fingers, and would attempt any kind of unorthodox delivery if he thought it might be effective. To deceive the batsman he varied the position from which he bowled and the height of his arm, and occasionally bowled deliberate <a href="full%20toss">full toss</a>es or <a href="long%20hop">long hop</a>s to surprise them. Fender hoped that, in his eagerness to score from an apparently innocuous ball, the batsman would mis-hit, a tactic he would often try when the batsman was playing defensively. Fender's love of experimentation and his surprise variations made him difficult for batsmen to face, but produced inconsistent results and he sometimes conceded many runs. His "Wisden" obituary suggests that Fender would have been better employed as a "fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side", but Surrey's weakness in bowling meant that he had to do far more work than was ideal for his style and approach. Despite his experimentation, critics regarded him as a reliable bowler using his primary method, and "The Times" described him as "subtle in flight and with artful variations".

Fender fielded mainly at <a href="Slip%20%28cricket%29">slip</a>. He possessed quick reactions and could move quickly to catch balls hit some distance from him. His technique was unorthodox; he crouched low when waiting for the ball with one leg stretched behind him, like a sprinter ready to begin a race. Good catching was vital in a Surrey side which possessed weak bowling, making his contributions even more important, and critics regarded him as one of the best slip fielders in England.

The journalist and cricket writer <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> wrote of Fender: "Unmistakable on the field, lanky, bespectacled, curly-haired, slouching along, hands deep in pockets and wearing a grotesquely long sweater, he was immortalised by cartoonist <a href="Tom%20Webster%20%28cartoonist%29">Tom Webster</a>". This appearance made him a favourite of cartoonists generally, and Fender enjoyed this fame, particularly the cartoons of Webster who drew Fender in a long sweater before he ever wore one; Fender then adopted them to match his image. Similarly, he continued to wear glasses on the field after discovering that he did not need them.

Contemporary critics believed that Fender's handling of a limited bowling side while Surrey captain in the 1920s, and his achievements in taking the county to high positions in the County Championship, made him the best captain in England. Teammates and opponents praised his captaincy skills, and described him as the best they had known. His "Times" obituary stated: "[Fender] was a sharp captain, quick to observe the slightest opportunity of advantage and ready to gamble on his ability to exploit it. His keen eye for weakness in an opponent and ability to extract and employ the best powers of his own players caused him often, and with reason, to be described as the best county captain who never captained England. No more flexible thinker on cricket ever lived." Always willing to take risks in order to win, Fender's main objective was to surprise the opposition; legends grew of his successful ploys. Prior to Fender, few county captains displayed tactical imagination; Fender inspired his teams to play forceful, entertaining cricket which made him and his Surrey team very popular. His leadership was often specifically commented on by the press, an unusual occurrence in county cricket reports. In particular, his declarations often were the subject of attention and controversy—he often declared, contrary to orthodox tactics at the time, before his side had built up a big lead or even before they reached the opposition's first innings total. One of his favoured approaches was for the batsmen in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Middle%20order">lower middle-order</a> to hit out at the bowling, no matter the state of the match; if successful, the team either quickly consolidated a position of strength or regained the initiative if earlier batsmen had failed. Fender also used non-regular bowlers in an attempt to unsettle batsmen. His innovative approach included the introduction of caps with larger peaks to shade his players' eyes from the sun, and he recruited a baseball coach to improve their throwing.

Although often a candidate in the press to captain England, Fender was never chosen to do so. Rumours circulated at the time about the reasons. One suggestion was that he was overlooked because he was Jewish, but Fender said he was not Jewish and in any case did not believe this would have been a problem. Other purported reasons included that he had not been to Oxford or Cambridge, and that he was in the wine trade, which was considered an unsuitable career for a gentleman, but in later life Fender dismissed these as potential factors. In fact, not everyone approved of Fender's captaincy. He was sometimes accused of gamesmanship, for example by persuading umpires that conditions were unfit for play until they favoured his team. He occasionally used negative tactics when he was unhappy with the approach of the opposition—in one game where the opposition had not declared, he slowed down play to the extent that one over took 12 minutes to bowl. Opponents recalled other uses of time-wasting tactics, deliberate damaging of the pitch by Surrey players to assist their bowlers, and intimidation of both the opposition and umpires. The cricket writer Martin Williamson suggests that "in an era where gentlemen played by the rules, Fender was adroit at stretching the Laws to snapping point." Fender's attitude towards amateurs also brought him into opposition with others. His disinclination to play amateurs in the Surrey team unless they were talented enough was opposed by the Surrey committee—the Surrey president, <a href="H.%20D.%20G.%20Leveson%20Gower">H. D. G. Leveson Gower</a>, wished Fender to include friends and contacts whom Fender did not consider worth a place in the team. According to <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a>: "While always highly popular with the teams he led, his relations with the Surrey authorities were also apt to be difficult." Fender attempted to unite the amateurs and professionals in the team through using one gate to enter the field, and stopped the practice of separate lunches and teas. He planned to end the tradition of using separate changing rooms, until stopped by the professional Hobbs. Fender's proposals shocked senior cricket figures, and caused another clash with the influential Lord Harris; allied to other disagreements between the pair, it may have ended his England career. The deeply conservative cricket establishment may also have resented Fender's unorthodoxy on the cricket pitch. Fender made himself more unacceptable by mocking establishment figures such as Leveson Gower; a teammate later remarked that Fender "was often his own worst enemy". Fender also believed that the controversy over his journalism in 1921 counted against him with the MCC committee. According to "Wisden", Fender's limited success at Test level "may have saved the selectors, who were thought never to favour him as a captain of England, an embarrassing problem". His "Wisden" obituary concluded: "He was one of the most colourful figures in the cricket world for many years ... and was widely regarded as the shrewdest county captain of his generation".

While still a cricketer, Fender wrote for several London newspapers and magazines, and also broadcast on the radio. Although remaining in England, he commented on the 1924–25 Ashes series for the "<a href="Sunday%20Express">Sunday Express</a>" and became involved in an argument which arose during the tour over the merits of professional captaincy; Fender believed professionals would make good captains. He also wrote about the 1926 series, and drew criticism from Australians when he called their sportsmanship into question. He later wrote regularly for the <a href="The%20Evening%20News%20%28London%20newspaper%29">"Evening News"</a> and <a href="The%20Star%20%28London%29">"The Star"</a>; to the irritation of other journalists, he became the first man to use a typewriter in the press box.

Fender wrote four books on cricket tours: his 1920–21 account "Defending the Ashes", an account of the 1928–29 tour which he covered as a journalist, and books about the 1930 and 1934 Australian tours of England. A fifth book, more autobiographical in nature, followed later. "The Times" described Fender as "an astute critic of the game" whose accounts were "well-observed and analytical". "Wisden" found his writing outspoken at times, but rated his four tour books as among the best available. In 2012, the cricket journalist Steven Lynch wrote that Fender "can probably be credited with revolutionising the [cricket] tour book. Previously they were often travelogues, but Fender included serious in-depth analysis of the play, backed up with copious statistics".

Fender worked for his father, including periods spent in France and Belgium, up until the outbreak of war in 1914, but when he returned from active service found the business frustrating. With his father's approval, he left the firm to start his own wine business with his brother Robert. The business thrived, in part owing to Fender's wide range of connections, and he remained chairman and managing director until 1976. For a time, Fender produced his own whiskey brand, which he tried to sell when touring South Africa with the MCC in 1922–23, but competition from the larger distilling companies meant that it was a short-lived success. After the Second World War, he had to rebuild his wine firm, which had suffered from wartime restrictions and hardships, this time assisted by his son. He and Robert also established a paper merchants called Fender Brothers, although he later relinquished his shares in the company. Meanwhile, he maintained his connections with Crescens Robinson and followed his father as chairman of the company from 1943 to 1968.

The press closely followed Fender's activities in his personal life, reporting his activities at dances, races and <a href="Hunting%23Shooting">shooting</a>. As such, he had a high profile, and was easily recognisable to the general public. In September 1924, he married Ruth Clapham, a well-known figure in <a href="High%20society%20%28group%29">society</a> and the daughter of a Manchester jeweller, whom he met in Monte Carlo in 1923. The couple had two children; Ruth died suddenly in 1937 from <a href="Bright%27s%20disease">Bright's disease</a>. Fender remarried in 1962, but his second wife, Susan Gordon, died in 1968.

These are the books of which Fender was the main author.
