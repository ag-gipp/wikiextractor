Ram Narayan

Ram Narayan (; born 25 December 1927), often referred to with the title <a href="Pandit">Pandit</a>, is an Indian musician who popularised the bowed instrument "<a href="sarangi">sarangi</a>" as a solo concert instrument in <a href="Hindustani%20classical%20music">Hindustani classical music</a> and became the first internationally successful "sarangi" player.

Narayan was born near <a href="Udaipur">Udaipur</a> and learned to play the "sarangi" at an early age. He studied under "sarangi" players and singers and, as a teenager, worked as a music teacher and travelling musician. <a href="All%20India%20Radio">All India Radio</a>, <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>, hired Narayan as an accompanist for vocalists in 1944. He moved to <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> following the <a href="partition%20of%20India">partition of India</a> in 1947, but wishing to go beyond accompaniment and frustrated with his supporting role, Narayan moved to <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> in 1949 to work in <a href="Cinema%20of%20India">Indian cinema</a>.

Narayan became a concert solo artist in 1956 and has since performed at the major music festivals of India. After "<a href="sitar">sitar</a>" player <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a> successfully performed in Western countries, Narayan followed his example. He recorded solo albums and made his first international tour in 1964 to America and Europe with his older brother <a href="Chatur%20Lal">Chatur Lal</a>, a "<a href="tabla">tabla</a>" player who had toured with Shankar in the 1950s. Narayan taught Indian and foreign students and performed, frequently outside India, into the 2000s. He was awarded India's second highest civilian honour, the <a href="Padma%20Vibhushan">Padma Vibhushan</a>, in 2005.

Ram Narayan was born on 25 December 1927 in Amber village, near <a href="Udaipur">Udaipur</a> in northwestern India. His great-great-grandfather, Bagaji Biyavat, was a singer from Amber, and he and Narayan's great-grandfather, Sagad Danji Biyavat, sang at the court of the <a href="Maharana">Maharana</a> of Udaipur. Narayan's grandfather, Har Lalji Biyavat, and father, Nathuji Biyavat, were farmers and singers, Nathuji played the bowed instrument "<a href="dilruba">dilruba</a>", and Narayan's mother was a music lover. Narayan's first language was <a href="Rajasthani%20language">Rajasthani</a> and he learned <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> and, later, English. At an age of about six, he found a small "sarangi" left by the family's "Ganga guru", a genealogist, and was taught a <a href="fingering%20%28music%29">fingering</a> technique developed by his father. Narayan's father taught him, but was worried about the difficulty of playing the "sarangi" and its association with <a href="courtesan">courtesan</a> music, which gave the instrument a low social status. After a year, Biyavat sought lessons for his son from "sarangi" player Mehboob Khan of <a href="Jaipur">Jaipur</a>, but changed his mind when Khan told him Narayan would have to change his fingering technique. Narayan's father later encouraged him to leave school and devote himself to playing the "sarangi".

At about ten years of age, Narayan learned the basics of "<a href="dhrupad">dhrupad</a>", the oldest genre of <a href="Hindustani%20classical%20music">Hindustani classical music</a>, by studying and imitating the practice of "sarangi" player Uday Lal of Udaipur, a student of "dhrupad" singers Allabande and Zakiruddin Dagar. After Uday Lal died of old age, Narayan met travelling singer Madhav Prasad, originally of <a href="Lucknow">Lucknow</a>, who had performed at the court of <a href="Maihar">Maihar</a>. With Prasad, Narayan enacted the "ganda bandhan", a traditional ceremony of acceptance between a teacher and his pupil, in which Narayan swore obedience in exchange for being maintained by Prasad. He served Prasad and was taught in "<a href="khyal">khyal</a>", the predominate genre of Hindustani classical music, but returned to Udaipur after four years to teach music school. Prasad later visited Narayan and convinced him to resign his position and dedicate his time to improvement as a musician, although the idea of giving up a steady life was not well received by Narayan's family. He stayed with Prasad and travelled to several Indian states until Prasad fell ill and advised him to learn from singer <a href="Abdul%20Wahid%20Khan">Abdul Wahid Khan</a> in <a href="Lahore">Lahore</a>. Following Prasad's death in Lucknow, Narayan enacted the "ganda bandhan" with another teacher who gave him lessons, but soon left for Lahore and never performed the ritual again.

Narayan travelled to Lahore in 1943 and auditioned for the local <a href="All%20India%20Radio">All India Radio</a> (AIR) station as a singer, but the station's music producer, Jivan Lal Mattoo, noticed grooves in Narayan's fingernails: "sarangis" are played by pressing the fingernails sideways against three playing strings, which strains the nails. Mattoo instead employed Narayan as a "sarangi" player. Traditionally, the "sarangi" is supposed to play after the singer and imitate the vocal performance, and play in the space between phrases. Mattoo advised Narayan and helped him contact "khyal" singer <a href="Abdul%20Wahid%20Khan">Abdul Wahid Khan</a>, a rigorous teacher under whom Narayan learned four "<a href="raga">raga</a>s" through singing lessons. Narayan was allowed sporadic solo performances on AIR and began to consider a solo career.

After the <a href="partition%20of%20India">partition of India</a> in 1947, Narayan moved to <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> and played at the local AIR station. His work for popular singers increased his repertoire and knowledge of styles. Narayan played with the classical singers <a href="Omkarnath%20Thakur">Omkarnath Thakur</a>, <a href="Bade%20Ghulam%20Ali%20Khan">Bade Ghulam Ali Khan</a>, <a href="Hirabai%20Badodekar">Hirabai Badodekar</a>, and <a href="Krishnarao%20Shankar%20Pandit">Krishnarao Shankar Pandit</a>, and he accompanied singer <a href="Amir%20Khan%20%28singer%29">Amir Khan</a> in 1948, when Khan sang for the first time at AIR Delhi following the partition. As an accompanist for vocalists, Narayan showed his own talent and came to the foreground. Singers of the city complained that he was not a dependable accompanist and too assertive, but he maintained he wanted to keep vocalists in tune and inspire them in a cordial contest. Other "<a href="tabla">tabla</a>" (percussion) players and singers, including Omkarnath Thakur and Krishnarao Shankar Pandit, expressed admiration for Narayan's playing.

Narayan became frustrated with his supporting role for vocalists and moved to <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> in 1949 to work independently in film music and recording. He recorded three solo 78 rpm <a href="gramophone%20record">gramophone record</a>s for the British <a href="HMV%20Group">HMV Group</a> in 1950 and an early ten-inch <a href="LP%20album">LP album</a> in Mumbai in 1951, but the album was not in demand. The Mumbai film industry offered a good salary and obscurity for work that would have lowered his stature among classical musicians. For the next 15 years he played and composed songs for films, including <a href="Adalat%20%281958%20film%29">"Adalat"</a>, "<a href="Gunga%20Jumna">Gunga Jumna</a>", "<a href="Humdard">Humdard</a>", "<a href="Kashmir%20Ki%20Kali">Kashmir Ki Kali</a>", "<a href="Madhumati">Madhumati</a>", <a href="Milan%20%281958%20film%29">"Milan"</a>, "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>", and "Noorjehan". He was considered a desired choice of film music director <a href="O.%20P.%20Nayyar">O. P. Nayyar</a>.

Narayan performed in Afghanistan in 1952 and in China in 1954 and was well received in both countries. His first solo concert at a 1954 music festival in the <a href="Cowasji%20Jehangir%20Hall">Cowasji Jehangir Hall</a>, Mumbai, was cut short when an impatient audience, waiting for performances by famous artists, drove him from the stage. Narayan pondered giving up the "sarangi" and becoming a singer. He later regained confidence, performed solo for smaller crowds, and was favourably received in his second attempt to play solo for a Mumbai music festival in 1956. He has since performed at the major music festivals of India. Narayan later gave up accompaniment; this decision carried a financial risk because interest in solo "sarangi" was not yet substantial.

After "<a href="sitar">sitar</a>" player <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a> successfully performed in Western countries, Narayan followed his example. He recorded solo albums and made his first international tour in 1964 to America and Europe with his older brother <a href="Chatur%20Lal">Chatur Lal</a>, a "tabla" player who had toured with Shankar in the 1950s. The European tour included performances in France, Germany, sponsored by the <a href="Goethe-Institut">Goethe-Institut</a>, and at the <a href="City%20of%20London%20Festival">City of London Festival</a>, England. Beginning in the 1960s, Narayan often taught and gave concerts outside of India. On his Western tours he encountered interest in the "sarangi" because of its similarity to the cello and violin. The "tabla" player <a href="Suresh%20Talwalkar">Suresh Talwalkar</a> became a frequent accompanist for Narayan in the late 1960s. Narayan continued to perform and record in India and abroad for the next decades and his recordings appeared on Indian, American, and European labels. During the early 1980s he typically spent months each year visiting Western nations. Narayan performed less frequently in the 2000s and rarely in the 2010s.

Narayan's style is characteristic of <a href="Hindustani%20classical%20music">Hindustani classical music</a>, but his choice of solo instrument and his background of learning from teachers outside his community are not common for the genre. He has stated that he aims to please the audience and create a feeling of harmony, and expects the audience to reciprocate by reacting to his playing.

Narayan's performances are strung together from the meditative and measured "<a href="alap">alap</a>" (non-metrical introduction) and "<a href="jor%20%28music%29">jor</a>" (performance with pulse) in "<a href="dhrupad">dhrupad</a>" style, followed by a faster and less reserved "<a href="gat%20%28music%29">gat</a>" section (composition with rhythmic pattern provided by the "<a href="tabla">tabla</a>") in "<a href="khyal">khyal</a>" style. He experimented with a style of "<a href="jhala">jhala</a>" (performance with rapid pulse) developed by <a href="Bundu%20Khan">Bundu Khan</a>, but considered it more appropriate for plucked instruments and stopped performing it. The "gat" section includes one or two parts with compositions. When two "gats" are used, the first one tends to be at a slow or medium tempo, and the second one is faster; the "gats" are usually performed in the 16-beat rhythmic cycle "<a href="tintal">tintal</a>". Narayan often completes performances with "ragas" associated with "<a href="thumri">thumri</a>" (a popular light classical genre), which are referred to as "mishra" (<a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>: mixed) because they allow for additional notes, or with a "<a href="dhun">dhun</a>" (song based on folk music).

Narayan practices and teaches using a limited number of "paltas", exercises in a small scale range that are used to prepare playing different numbers of notes per bow. Derived from "paltas" are lengthy note patterns called "tans", which contain characteristic "melodic shapes" and are used by Narayan for fast playing. He uses his left (fingering) hand for runs and to play an extended melodic range, and his right (bowing) hand for rhythmic accentuations. Narayan's fingering technique, his low right hand position, keeping the bow in a close to right angle to the string, and his use of the full bow length are unusual among "sarangi" players.

Narayan is associated with the <a href="Kirana%20gharana">Kirana "gharana"</a> (stylistic school of Kirana) through <a href="Abdul%20Wahid%20Khan">Abdul Wahid Khan</a>, but his performance style is not strongly connected to it. Most of Narayan's compositions are from the singing repertoire of his teachers and were modified and adapted to the "sarangi". He has created original compositions and in performance varies those he was taught. Narayan disfavors the creation of new "ragas", but developed compound "ragas", including those of <a href="Nand%20%28raga%29">"Nand"</a> with <a href="Kedar%20%28raga%29">"Kedar"</a> and <a href="Kafi%20%28raga%29">"Kafi"</a> with <a href="Malhar%20%28raga%29">"Malhar"</a>.

Narayan uses a "sarangi" obtained from Uday Lal and built in <a href="Meerut">Meerut</a> in the 1920s or 1930s in his concerts and recordings. He plays on foreign harp strings to produce a clearer tone. Narayan experimented with modifications to his instrument and added a fourth string, but removed it because it hindered playing. In the 1940s, he exchanged <a href="catgut">gut</a> with steel for the first string and found it easier to play, but reverted to using only gut strings because the steel string altered the sound.

Narayan increased the status of the "sarangi" to that of a modern concert solo instrument, made it known outside of India, and was the first "sarangi" player with international success, an example later followed by <a href="Sultan%20Khan%20%28musician%29">Sultan Khan</a>. Narayan's simplified fingering technique allows for glide ("<a href="meend">meend</a>") and affected the modern "sarangi" concert style, as aspects of his playing and tone creation were taken up by "sarangi" players from Narayan's recordings.

Narayan taught at the <a href="American%20Society%20for%20Eastern%20Arts">American Society for Eastern Arts</a> and the <a href="National%20Centre%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts%20%28India%29">National Centre for the Performing Arts</a> in Mumbai in the 1970s and 1980s, where he gave the first master class for "sarangi". Narayan privately trained "sarangi" players, including his daughter Aruna Narayan Kalle, his grandson Harsh Narayan, and Vasanti Srikhande. He also taught <a href="sarod">sarod</a> players, including his son <a href="Brij%20Narayan">Brij Narayan</a>, as well as vocalists and a violinist. In 2002, he taught 15 Indian students and more than 500 students in the United States and Europe had studied with him. "Indian music in performance: a practical introduction", released in 1980 by Neil Sorrell in cooperation with Narayan, was described as "one of the best presentations on modern North Indian music practice" by Hans Neuhoff in "<a href="Musik%20in%20Geschichte%20und%20Gegenwart">Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart</a>".

Narayan argued that appreciation of the "sarangi" and him came only after acknowledgment by the Western audience. He attributed the lack of "sarangi" students to a lack of competent teachers and said that the Indian government should assist in preserving the instrument. The Pt (Pandit) Ram Narayan Foundation in Mumbai awards scholarships to "sarangi" students. Narayan has stated he was skeptical the "sarangi" would survive and said he would never give up promoting the instrument.

Narayan received the national awards <a href="Padma%20Shri">Padma Shri</a> in 1976, <a href="Padma%20Bhushan">Padma Bhushan</a> in 1991, and <a href="Padma%20Vibhushan">Padma Vibhushan</a> in 2005. The Padma Vibhushan, India's second highest civilian honor, was presented by <a href="President%20of%20India">Indian President</a> <a href="A.%20P.%20J.%20Abdul%20Kalam">A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</a>. Narayan was awarded the Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Akademi Award for 1974–75 and the national <a href="Sangeet%20Natak%20Akademi%20Award">Sangeet Natak Akademi Award</a> for 1975, and was made a fellow of the Rajasthan Sangeet Natak Akademi for 1988–89. He received the <a href="Kalidas%20Samman">Kalidas Samman</a> from the <a href="Government%20of%20Madhya%20Pradesh">Government of Madhya Pradesh</a> for 1991–92 and was presented with the <a href="Aditya%20Vikram%20Birla">Aditya Vikram Birla</a> Kalashikhar Puraskar in 1999 by <a href="P.%20C.%20Alexander">P. C. Alexander</a>, governor of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>. He received the <a href="Rajasthan%20Ratna">Rajasthan Ratna</a> for 2013, was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Honour – Classical at the 4th Gionne Star Global Indian Music Academy (GiMA) Awards 2014, and was awarded the Pandit Bhimsen Joshi Lifetime Achievement award for 2015–2016 in the field of classical music by the government of Maharashtra. The biographical film "Pandit Ramnarayan – Sarangi Ke Sang" was shown at the 2007 <a href="International%20Film%20Festival%20of%20India">International Film Festival of India</a>.

Narayan shared a close relationship with his older brother, <a href="Chatur%20Lal">Chatur Lal</a>, who learned the "<a href="tabla">tabla</a>" primarily to accompany his brother's "sarangi" playing. Lal studied under "tabla" teachers in his youth, but later turned to farming. Lal visited Narayan 1948 in Delhi after Narayan had become a professional "sarangi" player, and Narayan convinced Lal to work as a "tabla" player at the local AIR station. Lal became an acclaimed musician, toured with instrumentalists <a href="Ravi%20Shankar">Ravi Shankar</a> and <a href="Ali%20Akbar%20Khan">Ali Akbar Khan</a> in the 1950s, and helped popularise the "tabla" in Western countries. When Lal died in October 1965, Narayan had difficulty performing and struggled with alcoholism, but overcame the addiction after two years. Narayan assisted his brother's four children after their father's death. Chatur Lal's son, Charanjit Lal Biyavat, is a "tabla" player and has toured Europe with Narayan.

Narayan's wife Sheela, a homemaker, came to Mumbai in the 1950s and they had four children. She died prior to 2001. His oldest son, <a href="sarod">sarod</a> player <a href="Brij%20Narayan">Brij Narayan</a>, was born on 25 April 1952 in Udaipur, and his daughter Aruna Narayan was born in 1959 in Mumbai. She was the first woman to give a solo "sarangi" concert and immigrated to <a href="Canada">Canada</a> in 1984. Another son, Shiv, who is a year younger than Aruna, has learned to play the "tabla", and toured Australia with his father. Brij Narayan's son, <a href="Harsh%20Narayan">Harsh Narayan</a>, plays the "sarangi". In 2009, Narayan performed at <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s <a href="The%20Proms">The Proms</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>, <a href="London">London</a>, with Aruna, and he played at the 2010 <a href="Sawai%20Gandharva%20Music%20Festival">Sawai Gandharva Music Festival</a>, <a href="Pune">Pune</a>, with Harsh.

Narayan is a <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> and has stated "music is my religion", arguing that there was no better access to divinity than music. He is based in Mumbai.

Sheep

Domestic sheep ("Ovis aries") are <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>al, <a href="ruminant">ruminant</a> <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s typically kept as <a href="livestock">livestock</a>. Like most ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the <a href="even-toed%20ungulate">even-toed ungulate</a>s. Although the name sheep applies to many species in the genus "<a href="Ovis">Ovis</a>", in everyday usage it almost always refers to "Ovis aries". Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a "ewe" (), an intact male as a "ram" or occasionally a "tup", a <a href="castrated">castrated</a> male as a "wether", and a younger sheep as a "lamb".

Sheep are most likely descended from the wild <a href="mouflon">mouflon</a> of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for <a href="agricultural">agricultural</a> purposes, sheep are raised for <a href="fleeces">fleeces</a>, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and <a href="sheep%20milk">milk</a>. A sheep's <a href="wool">wool</a> is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by <a href="sheep%20shearing">shearing</a>. meat is called <a href="lamb%20and%20mutton">lamb</a> when from younger animals and <a href="mutton">mutton</a> when from older ones in Commonwealth countries, and lamb in the United States (including from adults). Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for <a href="Sheepskin%20%28material%29">pelts</a>, as <a href="dairy">dairy</a> animals, or as <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>s for science.

<a href="Sheep%20husbandry">Sheep husbandry</a> is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, the southern and central <a href="South%20America">South America</a>n nations, and the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a> are most closely associated with sheep production.

Sheepraising has a large <a href="glossary%20of%20sheep%20husbandry">lexicon of unique terms</a> which vary considerably by region and <a href="dialect">dialect</a>. Use of the word "sheep" began in <a href="Middle%20English">Middle English</a> as a derivation of the <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> word ""; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, <a href="herd">herd</a> or mob. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.

Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and <a href="symbology">symbology</a>. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with <a href="pastoral">pastoral</a>, <a href="Arcadia%20%28utopia%29">Arcadian</a> imagery. Sheep figure in many <a href="mythologies">mythologies</a>—such as the <a href="Golden%20Fleece">Golden Fleece</a>—and major religions, especially the <a href="Abrahamic">Abrahamic</a> traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as <a href="sacrificial%20animals">sacrificial animals</a>.

The exact line of descent between domestic sheep and their wild ancestors is unclear. The most common hypothesis states that "Ovis aries" is descended from the Asiatic ("O. orientalis") species of <a href="mouflon">mouflon</a>. Sheep were among the first animals to be domesticated by humankind (although the domestication of dogs may be over 20,000 years earlier); the domestication date is estimated to fall between 11,000 and 9,000 B.C in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>. The rearing of sheep for secondary products, and the resulting breed development, began in either southwest Asia or western Europe. Initially, sheep were kept solely for meat, milk and skins. Archaeological evidence from <a href="statuary">statuary</a> found at sites in Iran suggests that selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000 BC, and the earliest woven wool garments have been dated to two to three thousand years later.

Sheep husbandry spread quickly in Europe. Excavations show that in about 6000 BC, during the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> period of prehistory, the Castelnovien people, living around <a href="Ch%C3%A2teauneuf-les-Martigues">Châteauneuf-les-Martigues</a> near present-day <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a> in the south of France, were among the first in Europe to keep domestic sheep. Practically from its inception, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greek civilization</a> relied on sheep as primary livestock, and were even said to name individual animals. <a href="Ancient%20Romans">Ancient Romans</a> kept sheep on a wide scale, and were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising. <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, in his <a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a> ("Naturalis Historia"), speaks at length about sheep and wool. European colonists spread the practice to the <a href="New%20World">New World</a> from 1493 onwards.

Domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a <a href="Crimp%20%28wool%29">crimped</a> hair called wool and often with horns forming a <a href="lateral%20%28anatomy%29">lateral</a> <a href="spiral">spiral</a>. Domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely <a href="Neoteny">neotenic</a> as a result of selective breeding by humans. A few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. Depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all (i.e. <a href="Polled%20livestock">polled</a>), or horns in both sexes, or in males only. Most horned breeds have a single pair, but a few breeds may have several.

Another trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color. Wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. Colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or <a href="piebald">piebald</a>. Selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a <a href="dominant%20trait">dominant trait</a> it spread quickly. However, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a <a href="recessive">recessive</a> trait in white flocks. While white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a <a href="niche%20market">niche market</a> for colored fleeces, mostly for <a href="handspinning">handspinning</a>. The nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike. There is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so <a href="wool%20classing">wool classing</a> is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre.Depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights. Their rate of growth and mature weight is a <a href="heritable">heritable</a> trait that is often selected for in breeding. Ewes typically weigh between , and rams between . When all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth. Mature sheep have 32 teeth. As with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw. These are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed. There are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped <a href="Canine%20tooth">canines</a>. This means that the <a href="Dentition">dental formula</a> for sheep is either or There is a large <a href="diastema%20%28dentistry%29">diastema</a> between the <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and the <a href="molars">molars</a>.

In the first few years of life one can calculate the age of sheep from their front teeth, as a pair of <a href="Deciduous%20teeth">milk teeth</a> is replaced by larger adult teeth each year, the full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age. The front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age, making it harder for them to feed and hindering the health and productivity of the animal. For this reason, domestic sheep on normal <a href="pasture">pasture</a> begin to slowly decline from four years on, and the life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, though some sheep may live as long as 20 years. Sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled. Sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, with excellent <a href="peripheral%20vision">peripheral vision</a>; with visual fields of about 270° to 320°, sheep can see behind themselves without turning their heads. Many breeds have only short hair on the face, and some have facial wool (if any) confined to the poll and or the area of the mandibular angle; the wide angles of peripheral vision apply to these breeds. A few breeds tend to have considerable wool on the face; for some individuals of these breeds, peripheral vision may be greatly reduced by "wool blindness", unless recently shorn about the face. Sheep have poor <a href="depth%20perception">depth perception</a>; shadows and dips in the ground may cause sheep to baulk. In general, sheep have a tendency to move out of the dark and into well-lit areas, and prefer to move uphill when disturbed. Sheep also have an excellent sense of smell, and, like all species of their genus, have scent glands just in front of the eyes, and interdigitally on the feet. The purpose of these glands is uncertain, but those on the face may be used in breeding behaviors. The foot glands might also be related to reproduction, but alternative reasons, such as secretion of a waste product or a scent marker to help lost sheep find their flock, have also been proposed.

Sheep and <a href="goat">goat</a>s are closely related: both are in the subfamily <a href="Caprinae">Caprinae</a>. However, they are separate species, so <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrids</a> rarely occur, and are always infertile. A hybrid of a ewe and a buck (a male goat) is called a <a href="sheep-goat%20hybrid">sheep-goat hybrid</a> (only a single such animal has been confirmed), and is not to be confused with the <a href="sheep-goat%20chimera">sheep-goat chimera</a>, though both are known as "geep". Visual differences between sheep and goats include the beard of goats and divided upper lip of sheep. Sheep tails also hang down, even when short or <a href="Docking%20%28animal%29">docked</a>, while the short tails of goats are held upwards. Also, sheep breeds are often naturally <a href="Polled%20livestock">polled</a> (either in both sexes or just in the female), while naturally polled goats are rare (though many are polled artificially). Males of the two species differ in that buck goats acquire a unique and strong odor during the <a href="Rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rut</a>, whereas rams do not.

The domestic sheep is a multi-purpose animal, and the more than 200 <a href="List%20of%20sheep%20breeds">breeds</a> now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes. Some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds, but these numbers cannot be verified, according to some sources. However, several hundred breeds of sheep have been identified by the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN</a> (FAO), with the estimated number varying somewhat from time to time: e.g. 863 breeds as of 1993, 1314 breeds as of 1995 and 1229 breeds as of 2006. (These numbers exclude extinct breeds, which are also tallied by the FAO.) For the purpose of such tallies, the FAO definition of a breed is "either a subspecific group of domestic livestock with definable and identifiable external characteristics that enable it to be separated by visual appraisal from other similarly defined groups within the same species or a group for which geographical and/or cultural separation from phenotypically similar groups has led to acceptance of its separate identity." Almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed. Other features used when classifying sheep include face color (generally white or black), tail length, presence or lack of horns, and the <a href="topography">topography</a> for which the breed has been developed. This last point is especially stressed in the UK, where breeds are described as either upland (hill or mountain) or lowland breeds. A sheep may also be of a <a href="fat-tailed%20sheep">fat-tailed type</a>, which is a dual-purpose sheep common in Africa and Asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail.
Breeds are often categorized by the type of their wool. Fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. Most of these were derived from <a href="Merino%20%28sheep%29">Merino</a> sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. Downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. Some major medium wool breeds, such as the <a href="Corriedale%20sheep">Corriedale</a>, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. Long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. Long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. For example: the American <a href="Columbia%20%28sheep%29">Columbia</a> breed was developed by crossing <a href="Lincoln%20%28sheep%29">Lincoln</a> rams (a long wool breed) with fine-wooled <a href="Rambouillet%20%28sheep%29">Rambouillet</a> ewes.

Coarse or <a href="carpet">carpet</a> wool sheep are those with a medium to long length wool of characteristic coarseness. Breeds traditionally used for carpet wool show great variability, but the chief requirement is a wool that will not break down under heavy use (as would that of the finer breeds). As the demand for carpet-quality wool declines, some breeders of this type of sheep are attempting to use a few of these traditional breeds for alternative purposes. Others have always been primarily meat-class sheep.

A minor class of sheep are the <a href="dairy">dairy</a> breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.
A last group of sheep breeds is that of fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep are similar to the early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the <a href="Dorper%20%28sheep%29">Dorper</a>, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more resistant to parasites and hot weather.

With the modern rise of corporate <a href="agribusiness">agribusiness</a> and the decline of localized <a href="family%20farm">family farm</a>s, many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction. The <a href="Rare%20Breeds%20Survival%20Trust">Rare Breeds Survival Trust</a> of the UK lists 22 native breeds as having only 3,000 registered animals (each), and <a href="The%20Livestock%20Conservancy">The Livestock Conservancy</a> lists 14 as either "critical" or "threatened". Preferences for breeds with uniform characteristics and fast growth have pushed heritage (or heirloom) breeds to the margins of the sheep industry. Those that remain are maintained through the efforts of conservation organizations, breed registries, and individual farmers dedicated to their preservation.

Sheep are exclusively <a href="herbivorous">herbivorous</a> mammals. Most breeds prefer to graze on <a href="grass">grass</a> and other short <a href="roughage">roughage</a>, avoiding the taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume. Both sheep and goats use their <a href="lip">lip</a>s and <a href="tongue">tongue</a>s to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition. Sheep, however, graze well in <a href="monoculture">monoculture</a> pastures where most goats fare poorly. 

Like all ruminants, sheep have a complex <a href="digestive%20system">digestive system</a> composed of four chambers, allowing them to break down <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a> from stems, leaves, and seed hulls into simpler <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s. When sheep <a href="Grazing">graze</a>, vegetation is chewed into a mass called a <a href="Bolus%20%28digestion%29">bolus</a>, which is then passed into the <a href="rumen">rumen</a>, via the <a href="Reticulum%20%28anatomy%29">reticulum</a>. The rumen is a 19- to 38-liter (5 to 10 gallon) organ in which feed is <a href="Fermentation%20%28food%29">fermented</a>. The fermenting organisms include bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. (Other important rumen organisms include some archaea, which produce methane from carbon dioxide.) The bolus is periodically regurgitated back to the mouth as <a href="cud">cud</a> for additional chewing and <a href="salivation">salivation</a>. After fermentation in the rumen, feed passes into the <a href="Reticulum%20%28anatomy%29">reticulum</a> and the <a href="omasum">omasum</a>; special feeds such as grains may bypass the rumen altogether. After the first three chambers, food moves into the <a href="abomasum">abomasum</a> for final digestion before processing by the <a href="intestine">intestine</a>s. The abomasum is the only one of the four chambers analogous to the human stomach, and is sometimes called the "true stomach".

Other than forage, the other staple feed for sheep is <a href="hay">hay</a>, often during the winter months. The ability to thrive solely on pasture (even without hay) varies with breed, but all sheep can survive on this diet. Also included in some sheep's diets are <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s, either in a trace mix or in <a href="Salt%20lick">licks</a>. Feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of <a href="copper">copper</a> that are lethal to sheep. The same danger applies to mineral supplements such as <a href="salt%20lick">salt lick</a>s.

Sheep follow a <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> pattern of activity, feeding from dawn to dusk, stopping sporadically to rest and chew their <a href="cud">cud</a>. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of <a href="grass">grass</a>es, <a href="legume">legume</a>s and <a href="forb">forb</a>s. Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, <a href="Taxus">yew</a>, rhubarb, potato, and <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>.

Sheep are largely <a href="grazing">grazing</a> herbivores, unlike <a href="Browsing%20%28predation%29">browsing</a> animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants very close to the ground and can <a href="overgraze">overgraze</a> a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use <a href="managed%20intensive%20rotational%20grazing">managed intensive rotational grazing</a>, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of <a href="invasive%20species">invasive plant species</a>. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as <a href="cheatgrass">cheatgrass</a>, <a href="Euphorbia%20virgata">leafy spurge</a>, <a href="kudzu">kudzu</a> and <a href="spotted%20knapweed">spotted knapweed</a> over native species such as <a href="sagebrush">sagebrush</a>, making grazing sheep effective for <a href="conservation%20grazing">conservation grazing</a>. Research conducted in <a href="Imperial%20County%2C%20California">Imperial County, California</a> compared lamb grazing with <a href="herbicides">herbicides</a> for <a href="weed">weed</a> control in seedling <a href="alfalfa">alfalfa</a> fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. <a href="Entomologist">Entomologist</a>s also compared grazing lambs to <a href="insecticides">insecticides</a> for insect control in winter alfalfa. In this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.

Sheep are <a href="Herd%20animal">flock</a> animals and strongly gregarious; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies. The <a href="dominance%20hierarchy">dominance hierarchy</a> of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species. Furthermore, in contrast to the <a href="red%20deer">red deer</a> and <a href="gazelle">gazelle</a> (two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times), sheep do not defend <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territories</a> although they do form <a href="home%20ranges">home ranges</a>. All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock, although this behavior varies with breed, and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members. During flocking, sheep have a strong tendency to follow, and a leader may simply be the first individual to move. Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep: in mixed-breed flocks, subgroups of the same breed tend to form, and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks. Sheep can become <a href="hefted">hefted</a> to one particular local pasture (heft) so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes. Lambs learn the heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals.

Flock behaviour in sheep is generally only exhibited in groups of four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep. Being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their <a href="flight%20zone">flight zone</a> is entered. Cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. This is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.

In regions where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior.

Farmers exploit flocking behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as <a href="hill%20farming">hill farming</a>, and to move them more easily. For this purpose shepherds may use <a href="herding%20dog">herding dog</a>s in this effort, with a highly bred <a href="herding">herding</a> ability. Sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. Those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.

Sheep establish a <a href="Dominance%20%28ethology%29">dominance</a> hierarchy through fighting, threats and competitiveness. Dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep, and usually feed first at <a href="wikt%3Atrough">troughs</a>. Primarily among rams, horn size is a factor in the flock hierarchy. Rams with different size horns may be less inclined to fight to establish the dominance order, while rams with similarly sized horns are more so. <a href="Merino">Merino</a>s have an almost linear hierarchy whereas there is a less rigid structure in Border Leicesters when a competitive feeding situation arises.

In sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definitive study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.

Sheep are frequently thought of as <a href="Animal%20cognition">unintelligent animals</a>. Their flocking behavior and quickness to flee and panic can make shepherding a difficult endeavor for the uninitiated. Despite these perceptions, a <a href="University%20of%20Illinois%20system">University of Illinois</a> <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on sheep reported their intelligence to be just below that of pigs, and on par with that of cattle.
Sheep can recognize individual human and ovine faces, and remember them for years. In addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics. If worked with patiently, sheep may learn their names and many sheep are trained to be led by <a href="halter">halter</a> for showing and other purposes. Sheep have also responded well to <a href="clicker%20training">clicker training</a>. Sheep have been used as pack animals; <a href="Tibetan%20people">Tibetan</a> nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.

It has been reported that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in <a href="West%20Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>, <a href="England">England</a> allegedly found a way to get over <a href="cattle%20grid">cattle grid</a>s by rolling on their backs, although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.

Sounds made by domestic sheep include bleats, grunts, rumbles and snorts. Bleating ("baaing") is used mostly for contact communication, especially between dam and lambs, but also at times between other flock members. The bleats of individual sheep are distinctive, enabling the ewe and her lambs to recognize each other's vocalizations. Vocal communication between lambs and their dam declines to a very low level within several weeks after parturition. A variety of bleats may be heard, depending on sheep age and circumstances. Apart from contact communication, bleating may signal distress, frustration or impatience; however, sheep are usually silent when in pain. Isolation commonly prompts bleating by sheep. Pregnant ewes may grunt when in labor. Rumbling sounds are made by the ram during courting; somewhat similar rumbling sounds may be made by the ewe, especially when with her neonate lambs. A snort (explosive exhalation through the nostrils) may signal aggression or a warning, and is often elicited from startled sheep.

In sheep breeds lacking facial wool, the visual field is wide. In 10 sheep (Cambridge, Lleyn and Welsh Mountain breeds, which lack facial wool), the visual field ranged from 298° to 325°, averaging 313.1°, with binocular overlap ranging from 44.5° to 74°, averaging 61.7°. In some breeds, unshorn facial wool can limit the visual field; in some individuals, this may be enough to cause "wool blindness". In 60 Merinos, visual fields ranged from 219.1° to 303.0°, averaging 269.9°, and the binocular field ranged from 8.9° to 77.7°, averaging 47.5°; 36% of the measurements were limited by wool, although photographs of the experiments indicate that only limited facial wool regrowth had occurred since shearing. In addition to facial wool (in some breeds), visual field limitations can include ears and (in some breeds) horns, so the visual field can be extended by tilting the head. Sheep eyes exhibit very low <a href="hyperopia">hyperopia</a> and little <a href="Astigmatism%20%28eye%29">astigmatism</a>. Such visual characteristics are likely to produce a well-focused retinal image of objects in both the middle and long distance. Because sheep eyes have no <a href="accommodation%20%28eye%29">accommodation</a>, one might expect the image of very near objects to be blurred, but a rather clear near image could be provided by the <a href="Tapetum%20lucidum">tapetum</a> and large retinal image of the sheep's eye, and adequate close vision may occur at muzzle length. Good depth perception, inferred from the sheep's sure-footedness, was confirmed in "visual cliff" experiments; behavioral responses indicating depth perception are seen in lambs at one day old. Sheep are thought to have colour vision, and can distinguish between a variety of colours: black, red, brown, green, yellow and white. Sight is a vital part of sheep communication, and when grazing, they maintain visual contact with each other. Each sheep lifts its head upwards to check the position of other sheep in the flock. This constant monitoring is probably what keeps the sheep in a flock as they move along grazing. Sheep become stressed when isolated; this stress is reduced if they are provided with a mirror, indicating that the sight of other sheep reduces stress.

Taste is the most important sense in sheep, establishing forage preferences, with sweet and sour plants being preferred and bitter plants being more commonly rejected. Touch and sight are also important in relation to specific plant characteristics, such as succulence and growth form.

The ram uses his <a href="vomeronasal">vomeronasal</a> organ (sometimes called the Jacobson's organ) to sense the pheromones of ewes and detect when they are in <a href="estrus">estrus</a>. The ewe uses her vomeronasal organ for early recognition of her neonate lamb.

Sheep follow a similar <a href="Reproduction">reproductive</a> strategy to other herd animals. A group of ewes is generally mated by a single ram, who has either been chosen by a breeder or (in <a href="feral">feral</a> populations) has established dominance through physical contest with other rams. Most sheep are <a href="seasonal%20breeder">seasonal breeder</a>s, although some are able to breed year-round. Ewes generally reach sexual maturity at six to eight months old, and rams generally at four to six months. However, there are exceptions. For example, Finnsheep ewe lambs may reach puberty as early as 3 to 4 months, and Merino ewes sometimes reach puberty at 18 to 20 months. Ewes have <a href="estrus">estrus</a> cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. A minority of rams (8% on average) display a preference for <a href="Homosexual%20behavior%20in%20animals">homosexuality</a> and a small number of the females that were accompanied by a male fetus "in utero" are <a href="freemartin">freemartin</a>s (female animals that are behaviorally masculine and lack functioning <a href="Ovary">ovaries</a>).

In feral sheep, rams may fight during the <a href="Rut%20%28mammalian%20reproduction%29">rut</a> to determine which individuals may mate with ewes. Rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely. During the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.

After mating, sheep have a <a href="gestation">gestation</a> period of about five months, and normal labor takes one to three hours. Although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs. During or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small <a href="Glossary%20of%20sheep%20husbandry">lambing jugs</a>, small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.

Ovine <a href="obstetrics">obstetrics</a> can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. In the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. After the birth, ewes ideally break the <a href="amniotic%20sac">amniotic sac</a> (if it is not broken during labor), and begin licking clean the lamb. Most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. In normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital <a href="colostrum">colostrum</a> milk. Lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.

After lambs are several weeks old, <a href="Glossary%20of%20sheep%20husbandry">lamb marking</a> (<a href="Glossary%20of%20sheep%20husbandry">ear tagging</a>, <a href="Docking%20%28animal%29">docking</a>, and <a href="castrating">castrating</a>) is carried out. Vaccinations are usually carried out at this point as well. Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later identification of sheep. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. However, many would disagree with regard to timing. Docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth, to minimize pain, stress, recovery time and complications. The first course of vaccinations (commonly anti-clostridial) is commonly given at an age of about 10 to 12 weeks; i.e. when the concentration of maternal antibodies passively acquired via colostrum is expected to have fallen low enough to permit development of active immunity. Ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of <a href="flystrike">flystrike</a>. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they solve many practical and veterinary problems, and inflict only temporary pain.

Sheep may fall victim to poisons, <a href="List%20of%20infectious%20sheep%20and%20goat%20diseases">infectious diseases</a>, and physical injuries. As a prey species, a sheep's system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators. However, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless. Throughout history, much of the money and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments. Historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. In some developed countries, including the United States, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use. However, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions. In the US, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) Part 530. In the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as <a href="homeopathy">homeopathy</a>, <a href="herbalism">herbalism</a> and even <a href="traditional%20Chinese%20medicine">traditional Chinese medicine</a> to treat sheep veterinary problems. Despite some favorable <a href="anecdotal%20evidence">anecdotal evidence</a>, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in <a href="scientific%20journal">scientific journal</a>s. The need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified <a href="organic%20farming">organic farming</a> with sheep.

Many breeders take a variety of <a href="Preventive%20medicine">preventive measures</a> to ward off problems. The first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased. Many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior. This can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and <a href="Quarantine">quarantining</a> new sheep for a month. Two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep. Restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems. Excessive stress can compromise the immune system. "Shipping fever" (pneumonic mannheimiosis, formerly called pasteurellosis) is a disease of particular concern, that can occur as a result of stress, notably during transport and (or) handling. Pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline). Considerable epinephrine secretion in the final days before slaughter can adversely affect meat quality (by causing glycogenolysis, removing the substrate for normal post-slaughter acidification of meat) and result in meat becoming more susceptible to colonization by spoilage bacteria. Because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management. Avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a> sprays, inorganic <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>, <a href="motor%20oil">motor oil</a>, as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.

Common forms of preventive medication for sheep are <a href="vaccination">vaccination</a>s and treatments for <a href="parasites">parasites</a>. Both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks. <a href="Worm">Worm</a>s are the most common internal parasites. They are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system (beginning the cycle again). Oral anti-parasitic medicines, known as <a href="Deworming">drenches</a>, are given to a flock to treat worms, sometimes after worm eggs in the feces has been counted to assess infestation levels. Afterwards, sheep may be moved to a new pasture to avoid ingesting the same parasites. External sheep parasites include: lice (for different parts of the body), sheep <a href="Hippoboscidae">keds</a>, <a href="nose%20bot">nose bot</a>s, <a href="Psorergates%20ovis">sheep itch mites</a>, and <a href="maggot">maggot</a>s. Keds are blood-sucking parasites that cause general malnutrition and decreased productivity, but are not fatal. Maggots are those of the <a href="bot%20fly">bot fly</a> and the <a href="blow-fly">blow-fly</a>. Fly maggots cause the extremely destructive condition of <a href="flystrike">flystrike</a>. Flies lay their eggs in wounds or wet, manure-soiled wool; when the maggots hatch they burrow into a sheep's flesh, eventually causing death if untreated. In addition to other treatments, <a href="crutching">crutching</a> (shearing wool from a sheep's rump) is a common preventive method. Some countries allow <a href="mulesing">mulesing</a>, a practice that involves stripping away the skin on the rump to prevent fly-strike, normally performed when the sheep is a lamb. Nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheep's <a href="Paranasal%20sinus">sinuses</a>, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. Common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. External parasites may be controlled through the use of <a href="Glossary%20of%20sheep%20husbandry">backliners</a>, sprays or immersive <a href="sheep%20dip">sheep dip</a>s.

A wide array of bacterial and viral diseases affect sheep. Diseases of the hoof, such as <a href="foot%20rot">foot rot</a> and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. These painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. Ovine <a href="Johne%27s%20disease">Johne's disease</a> is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. <a href="Bluetongue%20disease">Bluetongue disease</a> is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous membrane</a>s. <a href="Ovine%20rinderpest">Ovine rinderpest</a> (or "peste des petits ruminants") is a highly contagious and often fatal <a href="virus">viral</a> disease affecting sheep and goats. Sheep may also be affected by primary or secondary photosensitization.

A few sheep conditions are transmissible to humans. <a href="Orf%20%28animal%20disease%29">Orf</a> (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous <a href="anthrax">anthrax</a> is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores can be transmitted in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous enzootic <a href="abortion">abortion</a> in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the <a href="prion">prion</a> disease <a href="scrapie">scrapie</a> and the <a href="virus">virus</a> that causes <a href="foot-and-mouth%20disease">foot-and-mouth disease</a> (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.

Of the 600,300 sheep lost to the US economy in 2004, 37.3% were lost to predators, while 26.5% were lost to some form of disease. Poisoning accounted for 1.7% of non-productive deaths.

Other than parasites and disease, <a href="predation">predation</a> is a threat to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. Sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. Even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic. However, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. In Africa, Australia, the Americas, and parts of Europe and Asia predators are a serious problem. In the United States, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. In contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry. Worldwide, <a href="Canidae">canids</a>—including the domestic dog—are responsible for most sheep deaths. Other animals that occasionally prey on sheep include: felines, bears, birds of prey, ravens and <a href="Razorback">feral hogs</a>.

Sheep producers have used a wide variety of measures to combat predation. Pre-modern shepherds used their own presence, <a href="livestock%20guardian%20dog">livestock guardian dog</a>s, and protective structures such as barns and fencing. Fencing (both regular and <a href="Electric%20fence">electric</a>), penning sheep at night and lambing indoors all continue to be widely used. More modern shepherds used guns, <a href="Animal%20trapping">traps</a>, and poisons to kill predators, causing significant decreases in predator populations. In the wake of the environmental and conservation movements, the use of these methods now usually falls under the purview of specially designated government agencies in most developed countries.

The 1970s saw a resurgence in the use of livestock guardian dogs and the development of new methods of predator control by sheep producers, many of them non-lethal. Donkeys and <a href="guard%20llama">guard llama</a>s have been used since the 1980s in sheep operations, using the same basic principle as livestock guardian dogs. Interspecific pasturing, usually with larger livestock such as cattle or horses, may help to deter predators, even if such species do not actively guard sheep. In addition to animal guardians, contemporary sheep operations may use non-lethal predator deterrents such as motion-activated lights and noisy alarms.

Sheep are an important part of the global agricultural economy. However, their once vital status has been largely replaced by other livestock species, especially the pig, chicken, and cow. <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">China</a>, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, and <a href="Iran">Iran</a> have the largest modern flocks, and serve both local and exportation needs for wool and mutton. Other countries such as New Zealand have smaller flocks but retain a large international economic impact due to their export of sheep products. Sheep also play a major role in many local economies, which may be niche markets focused on organic or <a href="sustainable%20agriculture">sustainable agriculture</a> and <a href="Locavore">local food</a> customers. Especially in <a href="developing%20country">developing countries</a>, such flocks may be a part of <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a> rather than a system of trade. Sheep themselves may be a medium of trade in <a href="Barter">barter economies</a>.
Domestic sheep provide a wide array of raw materials. Wool was one of the first textiles, although in the late 20th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for <a href="synthetic%20fabric">synthetic fabric</a>s. For many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without <a href="farm%20subsidies">farm subsidies</a>. Fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as <a href="wool%20insulation">wool insulation</a>. In the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.

<a href="Sheepskin">Sheepskin</a> is likewise used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. Byproducts from the slaughter of sheep are also of value: sheep <a href="tallow">tallow</a> can be used in candle and soap making, sheep bone and <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and <a href="gelatin">gelatin</a>. Sheep <a href="intestine">intestine</a> can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into <a href="surgical%20suture">surgical suture</a>s, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. Sheep droppings, which are high in <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional <a href="Wood%20pulp">pulp</a> materials to make paper. Of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is <a href="lanolin">lanolin</a>: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheep's wool and used as a base for innumerable <a href="cosmetics">cosmetics</a> and other products.

Some farmers who keep sheep also make a profit from live sheep. Providing lambs for youth programs such as <a href="4-H">4-H</a> and competition at <a href="agricultural%20show">agricultural show</a>s is often a dependable avenue for the sale of sheep. Farmers may also choose to focus on a particular breed of sheep in order to sell registered <a href="purebred">purebred</a> animals, as well as provide a ram rental service for breeding. A new option for deriving profit from live sheep is the rental of flocks for grazing; these "<a href="Lawn%20mower">mowing</a> services" are hired in order to keep unwanted vegetation down in public spaces and to lessen <a href="fire%20hazard">fire hazard</a>.

Despite the falling demand and price for sheep products in many markets, sheep have distinct economic advantages when compared with other livestock. They do not require expensive housing, such as that used in the <a href="intensive%20farming">intensive farming</a> of chickens or pigs. They are an efficient use of land; roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse. Sheep can also consume plants, such as noxious weeds, that most other animals will not touch, and produce more young at a faster rate. Also, in contrast to most livestock species, the cost of raising sheep is not necessarily tied to the price of feed crops such as grain, soybeans and corn. Combined with the lower cost of quality sheep, all these factors combine to equal a lower <a href="overhead%20%28business%29">overhead</a> for sheep producers, thus entailing a higher profitability potential for the small farmer. Sheep are especially beneficial for independent producers, including family farms with limited resources, as the sheep industry is one of the few types of animal agriculture that has not been <a href="vertically%20integrated">vertically integrated</a> by <a href="agribusiness">agribusiness</a>.

Sheep meat and milk were one of the earliest staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from <a href="Hunter-gatherer">hunting and gathering</a> to agriculture. Sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb. "Mutton" is derived from the <a href="Old%20French">Old French</a> "moton", which was the word for sheep used by the <a href="Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> rulers of much of the British Isles in the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>. This became the name for sheep meat in English, while the <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> word "sceap" was kept for the live animal. Throughout modern history, "mutton" has been limited to the meat of mature sheep usually at least two years of age; "lamb" is used for that of immature sheep less than a year.

In the 21st century, the nations with the highest consumption of sheep meat are the <a href="Arab%20States%20of%20the%20Persian%20Gulf">Arab States of the Persian Gulf</a>, New Zealand, Australia, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>, the United Kingdom and Ireland. These countries eat 14–40 lbs (3–18 kg) of sheep meat <a href="per%20capita">per capita</a>, <a href="per%20annum">per annum</a>. Sheep meat is also popular in <a href="France">France</a>, Africa (especially the <a href="Arab%20World">Arab World</a>), the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, the rest of the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>, <a href="India">India</a>, and parts of <a href="China">China</a>. This often reflects a history of sheep production. In these countries in particular, dishes comprising alternative cuts and <a href="offal">offal</a> may be popular or traditional. Sheep <a href="testicle">testicle</a>s—called <a href="animelles">animelles</a> or <a href="lamb%20fries">lamb fries</a>—are considered a delicacy in many parts of the world. Perhaps the most unusual dish of sheep meat is the Scottish <a href="haggis">haggis</a>, composed of various sheep <a href="offal">innards</a> cooked along with oatmeal and chopped onions inside its stomach. In comparison, countries such as the U.S. consume only a pound or less (under 0.5 kg), with Americans eating 50 pounds (22 kg) of pork and 65 pounds (29 kg) of beef. In addition, such countries rarely eat mutton, and may favor the more expensive cuts of lamb: mostly <a href="Meat%20chop">lamb chops</a> and <a href="leg%20of%20lamb">leg of lamb</a>.

Though sheep's milk may be drunk rarely in fresh form, today it is used predominantly in cheese and yogurt making. Sheep have only two <a href="teat">teat</a>s, and produce a far smaller volume of milk than cows. However, as sheep's milk contains far more fat, <a href="Milk%20solids">solids</a>, and minerals than cow's milk, it is ideal for the cheese-making process. It also resists contamination during cooling better because of its much higher <a href="calcium">calcium</a> content. Well-known cheeses made from sheep milk include the <a href="Feta">Feta</a> of <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> and <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Roquefort">Roquefort</a> of France, <a href="Manchego">Manchego</a> from Spain, the <a href="Pecorino%20Romano%20cheese">Pecorino Romano</a> (the <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> word for sheep is "pecore") and <a href="Ricotta">Ricotta</a> of <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. Yogurts, especially some forms of <a href="strained%20yogurt">strained yogurt</a>, may also be made from sheep milk. Many of these products are now often made with cow's milk, especially when produced outside their country of origin. Sheep milk contains 4.8% <a href="lactose">lactose</a>, which may affect those who are <a href="lactose%20intolerance">intolerant</a>.

As with other domestic animals, the meat of uncastrated males is inferior in quality, especially as they grow. A "bucky" lamb is a lamb which was not castrated early enough, or which was castrated improperly (resulting in one testicle being retained). These lambs are worth less at market.

Sheep are generally too large and reproduce too slowly to make ideal research subjects, and thus are not a common <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a>. They have, however, played an influential role in some fields of science. In particular, the <a href="Roslin%20Institute">Roslin Institute</a> of <a href="Edinburgh%2C%20Scotland">Edinburgh, Scotland</a> used sheep for <a href="genetics">genetics</a> research that produced groundbreaking results. In 1995, two ewes named <a href="Megan%20and%20Morag%20%28cloned%20sheep%29">Megan and Morag</a> were the first mammals <a href="Cloning">cloned</a> from <a href="Cellular%20differentiation">differentiated cells</a>. A year later, a <a href="Finnish%20Dorset">Finnish Dorset</a> sheep named <a href="Dolly%20%28sheep%29">Dolly</a>, dubbed "the world's most famous sheep" in "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>", was the first mammal to be <a href="cloned">cloned</a> from an adult <a href="somatic%20cell">somatic cell</a>. Following this, <a href="Polly%20and%20Molly">Polly and Molly</a> were the first mammals to be simultaneously cloned and <a href="transgenic">transgenic</a>.

As of 2008, the sheep <a href="genome">genome</a> has not been fully sequenced, although a detailed <a href="genetic%20linkage">genetic map</a> has been published, and a draft version of the complete genome produced by assembling sheep DNA sequences using information given by the genomes of other mammals. In 2012, a <a href="transgenic">transgenic</a> sheep named "Peng Peng" was cloned by Chinese scientists, who spliced his genes with that of a roundworm (<a href="Caenorhabditis%20elegans">C. elegans</a>) in order to increase production of fats healthier for human consumption.

In the study of <a href="natural%20selection">natural selection</a>, the population of <a href="Soay%20sheep">Soay sheep</a> that remain on the island of <a href="Hirta">Hirta</a> have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success. Soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively. The feral Soays on Hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.

Sheep are one of the few animals where the molecular basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined. However, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the <a href="Oregon%20Health%20and%20Science%20University">Oregon Health and Science University</a> that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams. Organizations such as PETA campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep. OHSU and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.

Domestic sheep are sometimes used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, in areas such as <a href="hypertension">hypertension</a> and <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>. Pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a> and <a href="Hypoxia%20%28medical%29">hypoxia</a>. In <a href="behavioral%20sciences">behavioral sciences</a>, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of <a href="Face%20perception">facial recognition</a>, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.

Sheep have had a strong presence in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock. In the English language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led. In contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Rams">Los Angeles Rams</a> football team and the <a href="Dodge%20Ram">Dodge Ram</a> pickup truck allude to males of the <a href="bighorn%20sheep">bighorn sheep</a>, "Ovis canadensis".

<a href="Counting%20sheep">Counting sheep</a> is popularly said to be an aid to sleep, and some <a href="Yan%20Tan%20Tethera">ancient systems of counting sheep</a> persist today. Sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and <a href="idiom">idiom</a> frequently with such phrases as "<a href="black%20sheep">black sheep</a>". To call an individual a black sheep implies that they are an odd or disreputable member of a group. This usage derives from the recessive trait that causes an occasional black lamb to be born into an entirely white flock. These black sheep were considered undesirable by shepherds, as black wool is not as commercially viable as white wool. Citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the <a href="Portmanteau%20word">Portmanteau</a> <a href="neologism">neologism</a> of <a href="sheeple">sheeple</a>. Somewhat differently, the adjective "sheepish" is also used to describe embarrassment.

In antiquity, symbolism involving sheep cropped up in religions in the <a href="ancient%20Near%20East">ancient Near East</a>, the <a href="Mideast">Mideast</a>, and the <a href="Mediterranean">Mediterranean</a> area: <a href="%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Çatalhöyük</a>, ancient Egyptian religion, the Cana'anite and Phoenician tradition, <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek religion</a>, and others. Religious symbolism and ritual involving sheep began with some of the first known faiths: Skulls of rams (along with bulls) occupied central placement in shrines at the Çatalhöyük settlement in 8,000 BCE. In <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">Ancient Egyptian religion</a>, the ram was the symbol of several gods: <a href="Khnum">Khnum</a>, <a href="Heryshaf">Heryshaf</a> and <a href="Amun">Amun</a> (in his incarnation as a god of <a href="fertility">fertility</a>). Other deities occasionally shown with ram features include the goddess <a href="Ishtar">Ishtar</a>, the <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n god Baal-Hamon, and the Babylonian god Ea-Oannes. In Madagascar, sheep were not eaten as they were believed to be incarnations of the souls of ancestors.

There are many ancient Greek references to sheep: that of <a href="Chrysomallos">Chrysomallos</a>, the golden-fleeced ram, continuing to be told through into the modern era. <a href="Astrology">Astrologically</a>, <a href="Aries%20%28astrology%29">Aries</a>, the ram, is the first sign of the classical Greek <a href="zodiac">zodiac</a>, and the sheep is the eighth of the twelve animals associated with the 12-year cycle of in the <a href="Chinese%20zodiac">Chinese zodiac</a>, related to the <a href="Chinese%20calendar">Chinese calendar</a>. In <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a>, <a href="shagai">shagai</a> are an ancient form of dice made from the <a href="cuboid%20bone">cuboid bone</a>s of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes.

Sheep play an important role in all the Abrahamic faiths; <a href="Abraham">Abraham</a>, <a href="Isaac">Isaac</a>, <a href="Jacob">Jacob</a>, <a href="Moses">Moses</a>, <a href="King%20David">King David</a> and the <a href="Islamic%20prophet">Islamic prophet</a> <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> were all shepherds. According to the Biblical story of the <a href="Binding%20of%20Isaac">Binding of Isaac</a>, a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for Isaac after an angel stays Abraham's hand (in the Islamic tradition, Abraham was about to sacrifice Ishmael). <a href="Eid%20al-Adha">Eid al-Adha</a> is a major annual festival in <a href="Islam">Islam</a> in which sheep (or other animals) are sacrificed in remembrance of this act. Sheep are occasionally sacrificed to commemorate important <a href="secular">secular</a> events in Islamic cultures. Greeks and Romans sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a> once sacrificed sheep as a <a href="Korban">Korban</a> (sacrifice), such as the <a href="Korban%20Pesach">Passover lamb</a> . Ovine symbols—such as the ceremonial blowing of a <a href="shofar">shofar</a>—still find a presence in modern Judaic traditions. Followers of <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> are collectively often referred to as a flock, with Christ as the <a href="The%20Good%20Shepherd%20%28Christianity%29">Good Shepherd</a>, and sheep are an element in the Christian <a href="iconography">iconography</a> of the <a href="Nativity%20of%20Jesus%20in%20art">birth of Jesus</a>. Some Christian <a href="saint">saint</a>s are considered <a href="Patron%20saints%20of%20occupations%20and%20activities">patrons of shepherds</a>, and even of sheep themselves. Christ is also portrayed as the <a href="Sacrificial%20lamb">Sacrificial lamb</a> of God ("<a href="Agnus%20Dei">Agnus Dei</a>") and Easter celebrations in <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and <a href="Romania">Romania</a> traditionally feature a meal of Paschal lamb. In many Christian traditions, a church leader is called the <a href="pastor">pastor</a>, which is derived from the Latin word for shepherd.

Sheep are key symbols in <a href="fable">fable</a>s and <a href="nursery%20rhyme">nursery rhyme</a>s like "<a href="The%20Wolf%20in%20Sheep%27s%20Clothing">The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing</a>", "<a href="Little%20Bo%20Peep">Little Bo Peep</a>", "<a href="Baa%2C%20Baa%2C%20Black%20Sheep">Baa, Baa, Black Sheep</a>", and "<a href="Mary%20Had%20a%20Little%20Lamb">Mary Had a Little Lamb</a>"; novels such as <a href="George%20Orwell">George Orwell</a>'s "<a href="Animal%20Farm">Animal Farm</a>" and <a href="Haruki%20Murakami">Haruki Murakami</a>'s "<a href="A%20Wild%20Sheep%20Chase">A Wild Sheep Chase</a>"; songs such as <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach's</a> "<a href="Sheep%20may%20safely%20graze">Sheep may safely graze</a>" ("Schafe können sicher weiden") and <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "<a href="Sheep%20%28song%29">Sheep</a>", and poems like <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lamb%20%28poem%29">The Lamb</a>".

Baltimore Steam Packet Company

The Baltimore Steam Packet Company, nicknamed the , was an <a href="United%20States">American</a> steamship line from 1840 to 1962 that provided overnight <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a> service on the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, primarily between <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, and <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>. Called a "<a href="Packet%20%28sea%20transport%29">packet</a>" for the mail packets carried on government mail contracts, the term in the 19th century came to mean a steamer line operating on a regular, fixed daily schedule between two or more cities. When it closed in 1962 after 122 years of existence, it was the last surviving overnight steamship passenger service in the United States.

In addition to regularly calling on Baltimore and Norfolk, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company at various times provided freight, passenger and vehicle transport to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, <a href="Old%20Point%20Comfort">Old Point Comfort</a>, and <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>. The Old Bay Line, as it came to be known by the 1860s, was acclaimed for its genteel service and fine dining, serving Chesapeake Bay specialties. <a href="Walter%20Lord">Walter Lord</a>, famed author of "<a href="A%20Night%20to%20Remember%20%28book%29">A Night to Remember</a>" (and whose grandfather had been the packet line's president from 1893 to 1899), mused that its reputation for excellent service was attributable to "some magical blending of the best in the North and the South, made possible by the Company's unique role in 'bridging' the two sections ... the North contributed its tradition of mechanical proficiency, making the ships so reliable; while the South contributed its gracious ease".

One of the Old Bay Line's steamers, the former "<a href="SS%20Exodus">President Warfield</a>", later became famous as the <a href="Exodus%20%28ship%29">"Exodus"</a> ship of <a href="Exodus%20%28Uris%20novel%29">book</a> and <a href="Exodus%20%281960%20film%29">movie</a> fame, when <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish refugees from war-torn Europe sailed aboard her in 1947 in an unsuccessful attempt to emigrate to <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>.
Just seven years after <a href="Robert%20Fulton">Robert Fulton</a> proved the commercial viability of steam-powered ships with his "<a href="North%20River%20Steamboat">North River Steamboat</a>" (more commonly known today as "Clermont") in 1807, small wood-burning steamers began to ply the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>. Before the arrival of railroads and river steamboats in the early 19th century, overland travel was exceedingly slow and tedious. Rivers were the main means of transportation and most cities were founded on them. This was especially so in North America, where journeys over vast distances of hundreds or even thousands of miles required months of hazardous, uncomfortable travel by <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a> or wagon on rutted, unpaved trails. In the 1830s, <a href="railroads">railroads</a> were being built, but the technology was crude and average passenger train speed was only . Perhaps more importantly, most early railroads did not connect. It would be many years before the various lines were knitted together to make intercity rail travel in the U.S. a reality. Not until 1863, for example, was it possible to travel between <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and Washington, D. C., without changing trains en route.

In this period, steamships on rivers such as the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio</a> and <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> or large inland bodies of water such as the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and the Chesapeake Bay offered a comfortable and relatively fast mode of transportation. The first steamboat to serve <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> was the locally built "Chesapeake", constructed in 1813 to link Baltimore with <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>. Operated by the Union Line, the boat connected with a stagecoach for the overland portion of the journey. Two years later, the Briscoe-Partridge Line's "Eagle" was the first steamboat to sail the length of Chesapeake Bay.

The direct ancestor of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company was the Maryland & Virginia Steam Boat Company formed in 1828 to link Baltimore, Richmond, and Norfolk, traversing the Chesapeake Bay and the James River. By 1839, the Maryland & Virginia was heavily in debt from the purchase of two new, large ships the year before: the long "Alabama" and the "Jewess". The "Alabama" was expensive to operate and proved impractical for Chesapeake Bay operations, causing the bankruptcy of the Maryland & Virginia later that year.

When the Maryland & Virginia collapsed in late 1839, the Maryland legislature convened to grant a charter to the Baltimore Steam Packet Company, organized in Baltimore to provide overnight steamship service on the Chesapeake Bay. The company's incorporators were Benjamin Bush, Andrew F. Henderson (who became the line's first president), John B. Howell, <a href="Thomas%20Kelso">Thomas Kelso</a> (who would become a director of the line), John S. McKim, Samuel McDonald, Gen. William McDonald, Robert A. Taylor, and Joel Vickers, all of Baltimore.

The company was granted a 20-year charter on March 18, 1840, by the Maryland legislature and then acquired three of the former Maryland & Virginia's steamboats: "Pocahontas", "Georgia", and "Jewess". The company began overnight <a href="Paddle%20steamer">paddlewheel steamship</a> passenger and freight service daily except Sundays between Baltimore and Norfolk. By 1848, the company's steamship "Herald" was making the trip in less than 12 hours, a time which the line would maintain until the end in 1962. An affiliate, the Powhatan Line, started service between Norfolk and Richmond in 1845, interchanging freight and passengers with the Old Bay Line.

By the 1850s, competition was keen as steamships grew in size and efficiency to serve the fast-growing nation. The Old Bay Line, in particular, served as a link between the antebellum South and northern markets, hauling large quantities of cotton north and manufactured goods south, along with a thriving passenger business between Baltimore and Norfolk. Railroads also began acquiring steamship lines in the 1850s, and the Seaboard & Roanoke Railroad, a predecessor of the <a href="Richmond%2C%20Fredericksburg%20and%20Potomac%20Railroad">Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad</a> (RF&P), acquired a controlling interest in the Baltimore Steam Packet Company in 1851. As competitors entered the field, each line vied to outdo its competitors in the luxurious appointments of their ships' staterooms and dining service. The company acquired newer and larger ships in the 1850s, such as the "North Carolina" in 1852 and the "Louisiana" in 1854, the latter at in length being the largest wooden vessel the company would own. A passenger on the Baltimore Steam Packet Company's "Georgia", carried away by delight over his travel experience in 1853, was effusive in his description of an overnight trip:

The "North Carolina" similarly impressed a Baltimore "Patriot" reporter in 1852, who described the ship's dining saloon as "having imported Belgian carpets, velvet chairs with marble-topped tables, and white panelling with gilded mouldings".

On February 20, 1858, the northbound steamer "Louisiana" collided with a sailing vessel, the "William K. Perrin", causing the sailboat to founder near the mouth of the <a href="Rappahannock%20River">Rappahannock River</a>. In a case that reached all the way to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a>, "Haney et al. v Baltimore Steam Packet Company", the "Louisiana" was found to be at fault. The high court considered the rules of the sea pertaining to steamers and <a href="sailing%20ships">sailing ships</a> approaching one another and concluded (with <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Roger%20B.%20Taney">Roger B. Taney</a> dissenting) that "entire disregard of these rules of navigation by the steamer" caused the collision, reversing a Circuit Court ruling.

The "North Carolina" burned on January 29, 1859, when a fire started in a passenger stateroom. She sank the following day with the loss of two lives. The following month, the line acquired the <a href="USS%20Adelaide%20%281854%29">"Adelaide"</a> to replace the lost steamer.

The outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> in April 1861 immediately affected the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. On April 19, two days after Virginia's secession, a violently pro-Southern mob in Baltimore attacked Union soldiers en route to Washington, D.C. as the troops marched through the city's streets between railroad stations. Thereafter known as the <a href="Baltimore%20riot%20of%201861">Baltimore riot of 1861</a>, the resulting loss of life and local unrest also threatened the , a U.S. Navy ship in Baltimore at the time. Later that same day, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company declined to transport Union forces from Baltimore to the beleaguered Union naval yard facility at <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20Virginia">Portsmouth, Virginia</a>.

Two weeks later, on May 7, the "Adelaide" was chartered by the U.S. Navy and attached to the <a href="Atlantic%20Blockading%20Squadron">Atlantic Blockading Squadron</a>. In that role, she was used to transport Federal troops in support of operations in North Carolina's <a href="Outer%20Banks">Outer Banks</a>, directed against the Confederate-held forts guarding <a href="Hatteras%20Inlet">Hatteras Inlet</a>. Later that year, the "Adelaide" was returned to the Baltimore Steam Packet Company.

As a steamship line connecting northern cities and the south, the Old Bay Line hauled a considerable volume of freight between the two regions and their ships' cargo holds were filled with bales of cotton, produce, and other goods. When hostilities commenced, Southern ports were <a href="Union%20blockade">blockaded</a> by the Federal Navy and the Old Bay Line was unable to serve Norfolk for the duration of the war, going no further south than Old Point Comfort. Passenger traffic as well as cargo shipping declined significantly. The Powhatan Line discontinued operations altogether between Norfolk and Richmond until the war's end.
As soon as the war ended in 1865, the Leary Line of New York briefly challenged the Baltimore Steam Packet Company on the Chesapeake, starting its own Baltimore-Norfolk steamship service. A fare war ensued, with one-way prices reduced to $3.00. Emphasizing the longevity of its service compared to their upstart rival, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company began referring to itself as the "Old Established Bay Line" in advertising, a moniker that would soon become simply the Old Bay Line for the next century.

The Leary Line withdrew in January 1867, selling its "George Leary" to the Old Bay Line. Two years later, the "Norfolk Journal" of August 2, 1869, described the vessel as having a "gorgeous style of furniture and elegant fittings ... magnificently furnished with upholstered sofas and lounges of rich red velvet ...". Another competitor, the Chesapeake Steamship Company, began directly competing on the Baltimore-Norfolk route in 1874. Controlled by the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28U.S.%29">Southern Railway</a>, a rival of the RF&P, it would be a formidable competitor until 1941, when the two steamship lines merged. Cargo traffic was also booming in the 1870s as the South recovered from the Civil War, resulting in the Old Bay Line's freight revenue surpassing passenger revenue by the end of the decade.

By the time of John Moncure Robinson's retirement as president of the company in 1893, the Old Bay Line had upgraded its fleet with <a href="propeller">propeller</a>-driven, steel-hulled steamers equipped with modern conveniences such as electric lighting and staterooms with private baths. The "Georgia" introduced in 1887 was the first Old Bay Line boat to have a modern screw propeller instead of old-fashioned side <a href="Paddle%20steamer">paddlewheels</a> and the "Alabama" launched in 1893 was the company's first steel-hulled vessel. Robinson served the Old Bay Line as president for 26 years (1867–1893), longer than any other person in the company's history.

The halcyon days of the 1890s were the company's heyday, under president Richard Curzon Hoffman (the grandfather of noted author <a href="Walter%20Lord">Walter Lord</a>), when the prosperous line's gleaming steamships were heavily patronized by passengers enjoying the well-appointed staterooms and Chesapeake Bay culinary delights while dining to the accompaniment of live music. The nightly menu on board included oyster fritters, diamondback terrapin, duck, and turkey.

The company built a new terminal and headquarters in Baltimore on <a href="St.%20Paul%20Street-Calvert%20Street">Light Street</a> in 1898 to accommodate the increasing traffic. Rebuilt after the <a href="Great%20Baltimore%20Fire">Great Baltimore Fire of 1904</a>, the building with its four-sided clocktower would be a landmark for decades on Baltimore's <a href="Inner%20Harbor">Inner Harbor</a> waterfront. (The location of the now-demolished terminal is between the present <a href="Harborplace">Harborplace</a> and <a href="Maryland%20Science%20Center">Maryland Science Center</a>.)

The <a href="Richmond%2C%20Fredericksburg%20and%20Potomac%20Railroad">Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad</a>, which had first acquired a controlling interest in the Baltimore Steam Packet Company in 1851, gained total control of the company's stock on September 5, 1901. The Old Bay Line continued to be managed separately from the RF&P, however.

In contrast to the Civil War, when hostilities sharply curtailed business on the Old Bay Line, <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> doubled freight and passenger business on the line to the busy ports of Norfolk and the <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a> area, with 107,664 passengers using the line in 1917. As a result of congestion on the nation's railroads and ports when the U.S. entered the war in April 1917, the Federal government established the wartime <a href="United%20States%20Railroad%20Administration">U.S. Railroad Administration</a> (USRA) to take charge of railroads and steamship companies, including the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. The USRA directed the operations of the Old Bay Line and the rival Chesapeake line for the duration of the war and more than a year thereafter, until March 1, 1920.

Baltimore-native John Roberts Sherwood, who had joined the Old Bay Line as a 22-year-old engineer in 1868 and became president in 1907, retired in October 1918 after 49 years with the company. "<a href="The%20Baltimore%20Sun">The Baltimore Sun</a>" extolled Sherwood's distinguished half-century of service to the steamer line when he retired, noting approvingly that his oft-expressed philosophy was, "Stand up for your home city wherever you may go." (His son, John W. Sherwood, founded Baltimore's celebrated <a href="Sherwood%20Gardens">Sherwood Gardens</a> in the mid-1920s.) Sherwood was succeeded by <a href="S.%20Davies%20Warfield">S. Davies Warfield</a> as president (1918–1927).

Catastrophe struck the Old Bay Line on May 24, 1919, when the "Virginia II" caught fire shortly after midnight in the middle of Chesapeake Bay with 156 passengers and a crew of 82 on board. The ship burned completely as many passengers jumped overboard and a lifeboat capsized. The Chesapeake Line's "City of Norfolk" and other vessels came to the rescue and pulled people from the water to safety. The "Virginia's" captain, Walter Lane, remained with his ship to the end and suffered burns.

The corporate ownership of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company changed again in 1922, when the <a href="Seaboard%20Air%20Line%20Railroad">Seaboard Air Line Railroad</a> (SAL) formed the Seaboard–Bay Line Company, which owned all of the outstanding shares of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company, making the steamship company a wholly owned subsidiary of the SAL on February 6, 1922. In addition to the infusion of capital from the SAL, the Old Bay Line also obtained a $4.4 million Federal loan to build two new steamers for the Old Bay Line: the "State of Maryland" and the "State of Virginia". The Old Bay Line's president, <a href="S.%20Davies%20Warfield">S. Davies Warfield</a>, was named president of SAL railroad as well as the Old Bay Line in 1922.
In 1928, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company took delivery of two more new ships – the "President Warfield" and the "Yorktown". The "President Warfield", built by <a href="Pusey%20and%20Jones">Pusey and Jones</a> Corp. in <a href="Wilmington%2C%20Delaware">Wilmington, Delaware</a>, was named for the Old Bay Line's president of the time, <a href="S.%20Davies%20Warfield">S. Davies Warfield</a>. She would be the last new ship built for the Old Bay Line.

As the new-fangled <a href="Ford%20Model%20T">Ford Model T</a>s and other early automobiles increasingly took to the roads in the 1920s, inland steamship lines in the U.S. initially resisted carrying automobiles on their boats. By the <a href="Great%20Depression">Depression</a>-ravaged 1930s, however, the Old Bay Line became one of the first inland steamship companies to promote the carriage of automobiles as a means of filling its ships' empty cargo holds. The Depression and loss of business to improved highways took an increasing toll of many U.S. steamship lines in the 1930s, as historic companies such as the <a href="Fall%20River%20Line">Fall River Line</a> ceased operation in 1937, preceded by the Lake Champlain company, which was the oldest steamboat line in the U.S. at its demise in 1932.

Fortunately for the Old Bay Line, its freight and passenger traffic remained relatively strong in the 1930s and the company embarked on a modernization program for its main boats of the line. The "President Warfield" and "State of Maryland" were converted from coal to oil burning in 1933 and had <a href="Fire%20sprinkler%20system">sprinkler systems</a> installed in 1938. In 1939, the "State of Virginia" was converted to oil burning and all three ships were equipped with <a href="radio%20direction%20finder">radio direction finder</a>s and ship-to-shore telephones.

As the Old Bay Line celebrated its centennial in 1940 with parades and other events in Baltimore, the company's future seemed bright. Business was steady and the company's facilities were in sound condition. Commemorative dinner plates in blue and pink decorated with a map of the Chesapeake Bay were introduced.

On June 14, 1941, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company's owner, the Seaboard Air Line Railroad, entered into an agreement with a consortium of railroads and steamship companies to merge the Chesapeake Steamship Company into the Old Bay Line. The railroad group, consisting of the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Line%20Railroad">Atlantic Coast Line Railroad</a>, <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28U.S.%29">Southern Railway</a>, and the SAL, together controlled the Baltimore Steam Packet Company and the Chesapeake Steamship Company. As a result, the Old Bay Line took over the Chesapeake Line's business and assets and became the sole operator of passenger and freight steamship transportation between the important ports of Baltimore and Norfolk. As part of this agreement, half of the outstanding shares of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company was assigned to Chesapeake Steamship Company, which was one-third owned by Southern Railway and two-thirds owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. With the amalgamation, two of the Chesapeake Line's steamboats, the "City of Norfolk" and "City of Richmond", were transferred to the Old Bay Line. As it turned out, these would be the last two vessels operated by the Old Bay Line when it went out of business in 1962. Robert E. Dunn was named president of the Old Bay Line in 1941, remaining at the helm of the company to the end of service in 1962.

After the United States entered <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> on December 7, 1941, the Federal government set up the <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a> to manage the vitally important maritime shipping and Naval support needs of the U.S. and its Allies, including the power to <a href="Nationalization">expropriate</a> civilian-owned boats. On April 1, 1942, the government acquired the Old Bay Line's "State of Virginia" and "State of Maryland". On July 13, the "President Warfield" and "Yorktown" were also taken over. Thus, by mid-1942, four of the Old Bay Line's six ships had become government property, leaving the company only the two oldest and smallest ships in its fleet for the duration of the war, the "City of Norfolk" and "City of Richmond".

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the line promoted its automobile service to Florida-bound motorists, advertising the elimination of of driving by taking the family car on an overnight cruise down the Chesapeake to Virginia, while enjoying a sumptuous dinner and relaxing stateroom aboard an Old Bay Line steamer instead of a roadside motel. In March 1946, the Old Bay Line installed <a href="radar">radar</a> on the "City of Richmond" and "City of Norfolk", the first commercial passenger ships to be equipped with radar.
After the "President Warfield" was expropriated in 1942 by the War Shipping Administration for national defense as a transport during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, it was transferred to the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> on September 21, 1942. Later in the war, it was returned to the U.S. Navy and commissioned as the on May 21, 1944. Following the end of World War II, the "President Warfield" was decommissioned and returned to the War Shipping Administration for disposal as surplus. After inspecting the "President Warfield", Old Bay Line officials decided that the expense for reconditioning the badly deteriorated ship was excessive, and accepted a cash settlement from the War Shipping Administration instead of taking back the war surplus vessel.

The old "President Warfield" was eventually acquired in early 1947 by <a href="Mossad%20Le%27aliyah%20Bet">Mossad Le'aliyah Bet</a>, a Jewish organization helping <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivors illegally reach <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>, then under <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">British mandate</a>. The former Baltimore Steam Packet and U.S. Navy steamship was renamed "<a href="Exodus%20%28ship%29">Exodus</a>" when she embarked from France for Palestine on July 11, 1947, carrying 4,515 passengers. Two <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> destroyers rammed the "Exodus" as she entered Palestinian waters near <a href="Haifa">Haifa</a> on July 18. British forces boarded the damaged ship and eventually deported the passengers. The "Exodus" remained in Haifa harbor until 1952, when the derelict caught fire and burned completely. The 1960 film <a href="Exodus%20%281960%20film%29">"Exodus"</a> depicted the refugees' odyssey aboard the former "President Warfield".

The Bay Line's Light Street terminal and headquarters building in Baltimore, where it had been located since 1898, were sold to the city in October 1950 for the widening of Light Street and later development as the acclaimed <a href="Inner%20Harbor">Inner Harbor</a> waterfront <a href="festival%20marketplace">festival marketplace</a>. The company relocated to a pier on <a href="Pratt%20Street-Lombard%20Street">Pratt Street</a> at the foot of <a href="Gay%20Street%20%28Baltimore%29">Gay Street</a>, where it remained until it went out of business in 1962.

Various travel writers in the 1950s extolled the pleasures of the nightly cruises and meals on the Old Bay Line's antique steamers. By the mid-1950s, however, improved highways and the increase in air travel meant that the Old Bay Line's 12-hour transit time between Baltimore and Norfolk was a comparatively slow means of transportation. Old Bay Line officials hoped that the steamship line's unique service might continue to appeal to travellers seeking the pleasures of a cruise on the scenic Chesapeake with fine dining en route and a well-furnished, private stateroom. The Sunday travel section of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" in 1954 featured the "long established, more leisurely water route across Chesapeake Bay", as the writer described the Old Bay Line, recommending "the boat trip can be made comfortably and comparatively inexpensively every night between Baltimore, Old Point Comfort and Norfolk, and on alternate nights between Washington, D. C., and the Virginia communities".

In the end too few people opted for this leisurely form of travel and passenger volume steadily declined. As deficits rose during the 1950s, the Old Bay Line began cutting back. On September 30, 1957, it abandoned service to Washington, D.C., discontinuing its Washington–Norfolk overnight service on the Potomac River. By 1960, the Old Bay Line reduced operation of its mainstay Baltimore–Norfolk route to freight service only during the lightly travelled winter months of October–April, eliminating all passenger service on the Chesapeake Bay during those months. In October 1961, the company announced that its passenger service was "temporarily suspended until further notice", indicating that resumption of passenger service was expected the following summer season beginning in April 1962. Finally, on April 14, 1962, the venerable Old Bay Line discontinued all operations entirely, ending one of the very last remaining overnight steamship passenger services in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> (The <a href="Georgian%20Bay%20Line">Georgian Bay Line</a> still operated out of <a href="Georgian%20Bay">Georgian Bay</a> along with <a href="Canadian%20Pacific">Canadian Pacific</a> and <a href="Canada%20Steamship%20Lines">Canada Steamship Lines</a> but those companies engaged in purely cruising and all were out of service by 1967). The following month, the stockholders of the Baltimore Steam Packet Company formally voted on May 25, 1962 to liquidate the 122-year-old corporation, ending forever the melodious whistles of Old Bay Line steamboats on the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.

The routes over which the Baltimore Steam Packet Company operated passenger, mail, and freight service on a scheduled basis were:

The company owned 54 ships during its 122 years of existence, many being small cargo vessels. Originally, all of the line's steamboats were of wooden construction with side paddlewheels and used wood logs for fuel. The first boat with an iron hull acquired by the Old Bay Line was the "Georgeanna", in 1860. By the late 1870s, the company had acquired its last paddlewheel steamers: "Florida", "Carolina", and "Virginia". Later, ships would use coal for fuel until the 1930s, when oil began to be used. Beginning with the "Georgia" built in 1887, their ships used the more modern <a href="propeller">propeller</a> or "screw" design. The "Georgia" also was the first Old Bay Line vessel to be equipped with electric lighting and steam heating. Passenger ships of the line provided large, lavishly furnished staterooms to accommodate passengers on the overnight trip. The "Alabama" built in 1892 represented the inception of modern shipbuilding and design for the Old Bay Line: the first vessel to have a steel hull instead of iron or wood and propelled by a four-cylinder triple-expansion <a href="reciprocating%20engine">reciprocating engine</a>, the same type engine that all of the line's later steamers would have. Notable Old Bay Line passenger vessels used in scheduled overnight service, with dates acquired and <a href="gross%20tonnage">gross tonnage</a>s, were:

At the time of the Old Bay Line's dissolution in April 1962, three ships remained docked at the Pratt Street pier: the "District of Columbia", which had been kept as a spare since the Washington–Norfolk service ended in 1957, was scrapped soon afterwards. The "City of Richmond" was sold for use as a floating restaurant in the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>, but sank in the Atlantic Ocean off <a href="Georgetown%2C%20South%20Carolina">Georgetown, South Carolina</a>, while under tow to her new home. The "City of Norfolk" was idled in Norfolk until 1966, when it was towed to <a href="Fieldsboro%2C%20New%20Jersey">Fieldsboro, New Jersey</a> on the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a> and scrapped.

Chastain is the founder of the production company Freckle Films, which was created to promote diversity in film. She is vocal about <a href="mental%20health">mental health</a> issues, as well as gender and racial equality. She is married to the fashion executive Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, with whom she has a daughter.

Jessica Michelle Chastain was born on March 24, 1977, in <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>, to Jerri Renee Hastey (née Chastain) and rock musician Michael Monasterio. Her parents were both teenagers when she was born. Chastain is reluctant to publicly discuss her family background; she was estranged from Monasterio, and has said that no father is listed on her birth certificate. She has two sisters and two brothers. Her sister Juliet died by suicide in 2003 following years of drug abuse. Chastain was raised in Sacramento by her mother and stepfather, Michael Hastey, a fire-fighter. She has said that her stepfather was the first person to make her feel secure. She shares a close bond with her maternal grandmother, Marilyn, whom she credits as someone who "always believed in me".

Chastain first developed an interest in acting at the age of seven, after her grandmother took her to a production of "<a href="Joseph%20and%20the%20Amazing%20Technicolor%20Dreamcoat">Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat</a>". She would regularly put on amateur shows with other children, and considered herself to be their artistic director. As a student at the <a href="El%20Camino%20Fundamental%20High%20School">El Camino Fundamental High School</a> in Sacramento, Chastain struggled academically. She was a loner and considered herself a misfit in school, eventually finding an outlet in the performing arts. She has described how she used to miss school to read <a href="William%20Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>, whose plays she became enamored with after attending the <a href="Oregon%20Shakespeare%20Festival">Oregon Shakespeare Festival</a> with her classmates. With too many absences during her senior year in school, Chastain did not qualify for graduation, but later obtained an <a href="adult%20high%20school">adult diploma</a>. She later attended <a href="Sacramento%20City%20College">Sacramento City College</a> from 1996 to 1997, during which she was a member of the institution's debate team. Speaking about her early childhood, Chastain has said:

I [grew up] with a single mother who worked very hard to put food on our table. We did not have money. There were many nights when we had to go to sleep without eating. It was a very difficult upbringing. Things weren't easy for me growing up.

In 1998, Chastain finished her education at the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Arts">American Academy of Dramatic Arts</a> and made her professional stage debut as <a href="Juliet">Juliet</a> in a production of "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>" staged by <a href="TheatreWorks%20%28Silicon%20Valley%29">TheatreWorks</a>, a company in the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay%20Area">San Francisco Bay Area</a>. The production led her to audition for the <a href="Juilliard%20School">Juilliard School</a> in New York City, where she was soon accepted and granted a scholarship funded by the actor <a href="Robin%20Williams">Robin Williams</a>. In her first year at the school, Chastain suffered from <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a> and was worried about being dropped from the program, spending most of her time reading and watching movies. She later remarked that her participation in a successful production of "<a href="The%20Seagull">The Seagull</a>" during her second year helped build her confidence. She graduated from the school with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Bachelor of Fine Arts</a> degree in 2003.

Shortly before graduating from Juilliard, Chastain attended an event for final-year students in Los Angeles, where she was signed to a <a href="talent%20holding%20deal">talent holding deal</a> by the television producer <a href="John%20Wells%20%28TV%20producer%29">John Wells</a>. She relocated to Los Angeles, and started auditioning for jobs. She initially found the process difficult, which she believed was due to other people finding her difficult to categorize as a redhead with an unconventional look. In her television debut, <a href="The%20WB">The WB</a> network's <a href="Dark%20Shadows%20%282004%20TV%20pilot%29">2004 pilot remake</a> of the 1960s <a href="Gothic%20fiction">gothic</a> soap opera "<a href="Dark%20Shadows">Dark Shadows</a>", she was cast as <a href="Carolyn%20Stoddard">Carolyn Stoddard</a>. The pilot was directed by <a href="P.%20J.%20Hogan">P. J. Hogan</a>, but the series was never picked up for broadcast. Later that year, she appeared as a guest performer on the medical drama series "<a href="ER%20%28TV%20series%29">ER</a>" playing a woman she described as "psychotic", which led to her getting more unusual parts such as accident victims or the mentally ill. She went on to appear in such roles in a few other television series from 2004 to 2007, including "<a href="Veronica%20Mars">Veronica Mars</a>" (2004), "<a href="Close%20to%20Home%20%282005%20TV%20series%29">Close to Home</a>" (2006), and "" (2005–2006).

In 2004, Chastain took on the role of Anya, a virtuous young woman, in a <a href="Williamstown%20Theatre%20Festival">Williamstown Theatre Festival</a> production of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a>'s play "<a href="The%20Cherry%20Orchard">The Cherry Orchard</a>" in Massachusetts, starring with <a href="Michelle%20Williams%20%28actress%29">Michelle Williams</a>. Also that year, she worked with <a href="Playwrights%20Horizons">Playwrights Horizons</a> on a production of <a href="Richard%20Nelson%20%28playwright%29">Richard Nelson</a>'s "Rodney's Wife" as the daughter of a troubled middle-aged film actor. Her performance was not well received by the critic <a href="Ben%20Brantley">Ben Brantley</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", who thought that she "somehow seems to keep losing color as the evening progresses". While working on the play, she was recommended by Nelson to <a href="Al%20Pacino">Al Pacino</a>, who was looking for an actress to star in his production of <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>'s tragedy "<a href="Salome%20%28play%29">Salome</a>". The play tells the tragic story of its titular character's sexual exploration. In the play, Salome is a 16-year-old, but Chastain, who was 29 then, was cast for the part. The play was staged in 2006 at the <a href="Wadsworth%20Theatre">Wadsworth Theatre</a> in Los Angeles, and Chastain later remarked that it helped bring her to the attention of several casting directors. Writing for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>", the critic Steven Oxman criticized her portrayal in the play: "Chastain is so ill-at-ease with Salome, not quite certain whether she's a capable seductress or a whiny, wealthy brat; she doesn't flesh out either choice".

Chastain made her film debut in 2008 as the title character in <a href="Dan%20Ireland">Dan Ireland</a>'s drama "<a href="Jolene%20%28film%29">Jolene</a>", based on a short story by <a href="E.%20L.%20Doctorow">E. L. Doctorow</a> inspired by <a href="Dolly%20Parton">Dolly Parton</a>'s song "<a href="Jolene%20%28song%29">Jolene</a>". It follows the life of a sexually abused teenager over the course of a decade. Chastain's performance was praised by a reviewer for the "<a href="New%20York%20Observer">New York Observer</a>", who considered her as the only notable aspect of the production. She won a Best Actress award at the <a href="Seattle%20International%20Film%20Festival">Seattle International Film Festival</a>. In 2009 she had a minor role in "<a href="Stolen%20%282009%20drama%20film%29">Stolen</a>" (2009), a mystery-thriller film with a limited theatrical release. Also in 2009, she played the part of <a href="Desdemona">Desdemona</a> in <a href="The%20Public%20Theatre">The Public Theatre</a> production of Shakespeare's tragedy "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>", co-starring <a href="John%20Ortiz">John Ortiz</a> as <a href="Othello%20%28character%29">the title character</a> and <a href="Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a> as <a href="Iago">Iago</a>. Writing for "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", Hilton Als commended Chastain for finding "a beautiful maternal depth" in her role.

In 2010, Chastain starred in <a href="John%20Madden%20%28director%29">John Madden</a>'s dramatic thriller "<a href="The%20Debt%20%282010%20film%29">The Debt</a>", portraying a young <a href="Mossad">Mossad</a> agent sent to <a href="East%20Berlin">East Berlin</a> in the 1960s to capture a former <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> doctor who carried out medical experiments in <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>s. She shared her role with <a href="Helen%20Mirren">Helen Mirren</a>, with the two actresses portraying the character at different phases of her life. They worked together before filming to perfect the voice and mannerisms of the character and make them consistent. Chastain took classes in German and <a href="krav%20maga">krav maga</a>, and studied books about the Nazi doctor <a href="Josef%20Mengele">Josef Mengele</a> and Mossad history. William Thomas of "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" termed the film a "smart, tense, well-acted thriller", and noted that Chastain "pulses with strength and vulnerability" in her part. She also appeared as Mary Debenham in an episode of the British television series "<a href="Agatha%20Christie%27s%20Poirot">Agatha Christie's Poirot</a>", based on <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a>'s 1934 novel "<a href="Murder%20on%20the%20Orient%20Express">Murder on the Orient Express</a>".

After struggling for a breakthrough in film, Chastain had six releases in 2011, and received wide recognition for several of them. The first of the roles was as the wife of <a href="Michael%20Shannon">Michael Shannon</a>'s character in <a href="Jeff%20Nichols">Jeff Nichols</a>' "<a href="Take%20Shelter">Take Shelter</a>", a drama about a troubled father who tries to protect his family from what he believes is an impending storm. The film was screened at the 2011 <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a>, and critic Tim Robey of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" noted how much Chastain's supporting part aided the narrative. In "<a href="Coriolanus%20%28film%29">Coriolanus</a>", an adaptation of the Shakespearian <a href="Coriolanus">tragedy</a> from actor-director <a href="Ralph%20Fiennes">Ralph Fiennes</a>, Chastain played <a href="Virgilia">Virgilia</a>. Her next role was opposite <a href="Brad%20Pitt">Brad Pitt</a>, as the loving mother of three children in <a href="Terrence%20Malick">Terrence Malick</a>'s experimental drama "<a href="The%20Tree%20of%20Life%20%28film%29">The Tree of Life</a>", which she had filmed in 2008. Chastain signed on to the film without receiving a traditional screenplay from Malick, and she improvised several scenes and dialogues with Pitt. She considered her part to be "the embodiment of grace and the spirit world"; in preparation, she practiced meditation, studied paintings of the <a href="Madonna%20%28art%29">Madonna</a>, and read poems by <a href="Thomas%20Aquinas">Thomas Aquinas</a>. The film premiered at the <a href="2011%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2011 Cannes Film Festival</a> to a polarized reception from the audience, although it was praised by critics and won the <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a>. <a href="Justin%20Chang">Justin Chang</a> of "Variety" termed the film a "hymn to the glory of creation, an exploratory, often mystifying [...] poem" and credited Chastain for playing her part with "heartrending vulnerability".

Chastain's biggest success of the year came with the drama "<a href="The%20Help%20%28film%29">The Help</a>", co-starring <a href="Viola%20Davis">Viola Davis</a>, <a href="Octavia%20Spencer">Octavia Spencer</a> and <a href="Emma%20Stone">Emma Stone</a>, which was based on <a href="Kathryn%20Stockett">Kathryn Stockett</a>'s novel of the <a href="The%20Help">same name</a>. Chastain played Celia Foote, an aspiring socialite in 1960s <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Jackson, Mississippi</a>, who develops a friendship with her black maid (played by Spencer). Chastain was drawn to her character's anti-racist stand and connected with her energy and enthusiasm; in preparation, she watched the films of <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> and researched the history of <a href="Tunica%2C%20Mississippi">Sugar Ditch, Tennessee</a>, where her character was raised. "The Help" earned $216 million at the box office to become Chastain's most widely seen film to that point. <a href="Manohla%20Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a> of "The New York Times" praised the chemistry between Chastain and Spencer, and <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> commended her for being "unaffected and infectious". The ensemble of "The Help" won the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Cast%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture">Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast</a> and Chastain received her first Oscar nomination in the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> category, in addition to <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">BAFTA</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Golden Globe</a> and <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">SAG</a> nominations in the same category, all of which she lost to Spencer.

Chastain's final two roles of the year were in "<a href="Wilde%20Salom%C3%A9">Wilde Salomé</a>", a documentary based on her 2006 production of "Salome", and the critically panned crime-thriller "<a href="Texas%20Killing%20Fields">Texas Killing Fields</a>". Chastain's work in 2011, especially in "The Help", "Take Shelter" and "The Tree of Life", gained her awards from several critics' organizations. Two of Chastain's films in 2012 premiered at the <a href="2012%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">65th Cannes Film Festival</a>the animated comedy "" and the crime drama "<a href="Lawless%20%28film%29">Lawless</a>". In the former, which marked the third installment of the "<a href="Madagascar%20%28franchise%29">Madagascar</a>" series, Chastain voiced Gia the Jaguar with an Italian accent. With a worldwide gross of $747 million, the film ranks as her highest-grossing release. In "Lawless", based on <a href="Matt%20Bondurant">Matt Bondurant</a>'s <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>-era novel "<a href="The%20Wettest%20County%20in%20the%20World">The Wettest County in the World</a>", Chastain played a dancer who becomes embroiled in a conflict between three <a href="bootleg%20alcohol">bootlegging</a> brothers (played by <a href="Shia%20LaBeouf">Shia LaBeouf</a>, <a href="Tom%20Hardy">Tom Hardy</a>, and <a href="Jason%20Clarke%20%28actor%29">Jason Clarke</a>). The film received generally positive reviews, with <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> finding Chastain to be filled with "poised, seductive gravity". In an experimental biopic of the author <a href="C.%20K.%20Williams">C. K. Williams</a>, entitled "<a href="The%20Color%20of%20Time">The Color of Time</a>" (2012), directed by the <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> students of actor <a href="James%20Franco">James Franco</a>, Chastain played the mother of the young Williams.

A short part that Chastain had filmed in Terrence Malick's "<a href="To%20the%20Wonder">To the Wonder</a>" (2012) was edited out of the final film, and due to scheduling conflicts, she dropped out of the action films "<a href="Oblivion%20%282013%20film%29">Oblivion</a>" and "<a href="Iron%20Man%203">Iron Man 3</a>" (both 2013). She instead made her <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> debut in a revival of the 1947 play "<a href="The%20Heiress%20%281947%20play%29">The Heiress</a>", playing the role of Catherine Sloper, a naive young girl who transforms into a powerful woman. Chastain was initially reluctant to accept the role, fearing the high anxiety she had faced during her early stage performances. She ultimately agreed after finding a connection to Sloper, saying: "she's painfully uncomfortable and I used to be that". The production was staged at the <a href="Walter%20Kerr%20Theatre">Walter Kerr Theatre</a> from November 2012 to February 2013. Brantley was disappointed with Chastain's performance, saying that she was "oversignaling the thoughts within" and that her delivery of dialogue was sometimes flat. At the box office, it emerged as a <a href="sleeper%20hit">sleeper hit</a>.

<a href="Kathryn%20Bigelow">Kathryn Bigelow</a>'s thriller "<a href="Zero%20Dark%20Thirty">Zero Dark Thirty</a>" marked Chastain's final film release of 2012. The film tells a partly fictionalized account of the <a href="Search%20for%20Osama%20bin%20Laden">decade-long manhunt</a> for <a href="Al-Qaeda">Al-Qaeda</a> leader <a href="Osama%20bin%20Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a>. Chastain was cast as Maya, an emotionally hardened CIA intelligence analyst who helped kill bin Laden. The difficult subject matter made it unpleasant for Chastain to film. She suffered from depression while working and once walked off the set in tears because she was unable to continue. Chastain was unable to meet the undercover agent on whom Maya was based and she relied on the screenwriter <a href="Mark%20Boal">Mark Boal</a>'s research. "Zero Dark Thirty" received critical acclaim but was <a href="Zero%20Dark%20Thirty%23Controversy">controversial</a> for scenes of <a href="enhanced%20interrogation">torture</a> that were shown providing useful intelligence in the search for bin Laden. <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" wrote that Chastain played Maya "like a gathering storm in an indelible, implosive performance that cuts so deep we can feel her nerve endings". Roger Ebert made note of Chastain's versatility, and favorably compared her ability and range to that of actress <a href="Meryl%20Streep">Meryl Streep</a>. For her performance, Chastain won the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture%2C%20Drama">Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama</a> and earned <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Academy</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">BAFTA</a> and <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">SAG</a> nominations for Best Actress.

Chastain next took on the lead role of a musician who is forced to care for her boyfriend's troubled nieces in the horror film "<a href="Mama%20%282013%20film%29">Mama</a>" (2013). She was attracted to the idea of playing a woman drastically different from the "perfect mother" roles she had previously played, and she based her character's look on the singer <a href="Alice%20Glass">Alice Glass</a>. The critic <a href="Richard%20Roeper">Richard Roeper</a> considered her performance as proof of her being one of the best actors of her generation. During the film's opening weekend in North America, Chastain became the first performer in 15 years to have leading roles in the top two films ("Mama" and "Zero Dark Thirty") at the box office. She then starred as the titular character of a depressed woman who separates from her husband (played by <a href="James%20McAvoy">James McAvoy</a>) following a tragic incident in the drama "<a href="The%20Disappearance%20of%20Eleanor%20Rigby">The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby</a>" (2013), which she also produced. The writer-director <a href="Ned%20Benson">Ned Benson</a> initially wrote the story from the perspective of Rigby's husband, then wrote a separate version from Rigby's perspective on the insistence of Chastain. Three versions of the film"Him", "Her", and "Them"were released. It did not find a wide audience, but the critic <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> praised Chastain for "short-circuit[ing] conventional distinctions between tough and vulnerable, showing exquisite control even when her character is losing it, and keeping her balance even when the movie pitches and rolls toward melodrama".

Chastain appeared in three films in 2014. She played the eponymous protagonist in "<a href="Miss%20Julie%20%282014%20film%29">Miss Julie</a>", a film adaptation of <a href="August%20Strindberg">August Strindberg</a>'s 1888 play of the <a href="Miss%20Julie">same name</a>, from director <a href="Liv%20Ullmann">Liv Ullmann</a>. It tells the tragic tale of a sexually repressed <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> aristocrat who wishes to sleep with her father's valet (played by <a href="Colin%20Farrell">Colin Farrell</a>). Chastain was attracted to Ullmann's feminist take on the subject. The film only received a limited theatrical release. While filming "Miss Julie" in Ireland, Chastain received the script of <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a>'s science fiction film "<a href="Interstellar%20%28film%29">Interstellar</a>" (2014). With a budget of $165 million, the high-profile production, co-starring <a href="Matthew%20McConaughey">Matthew McConaughey</a> and <a href="Anne%20Hathaway">Anne Hathaway</a>, was filmed mostly using <a href="IMAX">IMAX</a> cameras. Chastain was cast as the adult daughter of McConaughey's character; she was drawn to the project for the emotional heft she found in the father-daughter pair. Drew McWeeny of the entertainment website <a href="HitFix">HitFix</a> took note of how much Chastain stood out in her supporting part. The film earned over $675 million worldwide to become Chastain's highest-grossing live-action film.

Chastain's final release of 2014 was the <a href="J.%20C.%20Chandor">J. C. Chandor</a>-directed crime drama "<a href="A%20Most%20Violent%20Year">A Most Violent Year</a>". Set in New York City in 1981, the year in which the <a href="Crime%20in%20New%20York%20City">city had the highest crime rate</a>, the film tells the story of a heating-oil company owner (played by <a href="Oscar%20Isaac">Oscar Isaac</a>) and his ruthless wife (Chastain). In preparation, Chastain researched the period and worked with a coach to develop a <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> accent. She collaborated with costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone to work on the character's wardrobe, and contacted <a href="Armani">Armani</a> who provided her with clothing of the period. The "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>"s <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> believed Chastain to be "the embodiment of a <a href="nouveau%20riche">nouveau riche</a> New York woman of the era", and <a href="Mark%20Kermode">Mark Kermode</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", found Chastain to be "terrific" in a part inspired by <a href="Lady%20Macbeth">Lady Macbeth</a>'s character. She received a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination for the film. For her work in 2014, the <a href="Broadcast%20Film%20Critics%20Association">Broadcast Film Critics Association</a> honored Chastain with a special achievement award.

In 2015, Chastain took on the part of a <a href="Astronaut%20ranks%20and%20positions">commander</a> in <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s science fiction film "<a href="The%20Martian%20%28film%29">The Martian</a>". Starring <a href="Matt%20Damon">Matt Damon</a> as a botanist who is stranded on Mars by a team of astronauts commanded by Chastain's character, the film is based on <a href="Andy%20Weir">Andy Weir</a>'s novel of the <a href="The%20Martian%20%28Weir%20novel%29">same name</a>. Chastain met with astronauts at the <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> and the <a href="Johnson%20Space%20Center">Johnson Space Center</a>, and based her role on <a href="Tracy%20Caldwell%20Dyson">Tracy Caldwell Dyson</a>, with whom she spent time in Houston. "The Martian" became her second film to earn over $600 million in two consecutive years. Chastain next starred as a countess who plots with her brother (played by <a href="Tom%20Hiddleston">Tom Hiddleston</a>) to terrorize his new bride (played by <a href="Mia%20Wasikowska">Mia Wasikowska</a>) in <a href="Guillermo%20del%20Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a>'s gothic romance "<a href="Crimson%20Peak">Crimson Peak</a>". She approached the villainous part with empathy, and in preparation read <a href="graveyard%20poets">graveyard poetry</a> and watched the films "<a href="Rebecca%20%281940%20film%29">Rebecca</a>" (1940) and "<a href="What%20Ever%20Happened%20to%20Baby%20Jane%3F%20%281962%20film%29">What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?</a>" (1962). Del Toro cast her to lend accessibility to a part he considered "<a href="psychopath">psychopath</a>ic", but Peter Debruge of "Variety" found her "alarmingly miscast" and criticized her for failing to effectively convey her character's insecurity and ruthlessness. Conversely, David Sims of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" praised her for portraying her character's "jealous intensity to the hilt".
After portraying a series of intense roles, Chastain actively looked for a light-hearted part. She found it in the ensemble fantasy film "" (2016), which served as both a sequel and a prequel to the 2012 film "<a href="Snow%20White%20and%20the%20Huntsman">Snow White and the Huntsman</a>". She was drawn to the idea of playing a female warrior whose abilities were on par with those of the lead male character, but the film was poorly received. She then starred as the title character, a lobbyist, in the political thriller "<a href="Miss%20Sloane">Miss Sloane</a>", which re-united her with John Madden. Chastain read the novel <a href="Capitol%20Punishment%20%28book%29">"Capitol Punishment"</a> by <a href="Jack%20Abramoff">Jack Abramoff</a> to research the practice of lobbying in America, and met with female lobbyists to study their mannerisms and sense of style. Hailing her as one of the best actresses on the planet, Peter Travers commended Chastain for successfully drawing the audience into Sloane's life, and writing for "Los Angeles Times", Justin Chang called her performance "a tour de force of rhetorical precision and tightly coiled emotional intensity". Chastain received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Drama for her performance.

Also in 2016, Chastain launched a production company named Freckle Films, headed by a team of female executives. She began 2017 by serving as the executive producer and providing the narration for "<a href="I%20Am%20Jane%20Doe">I Am Jane Doe</a>", a documentary on <a href="sex%20trafficking">sex trafficking</a>. In an effort to work with more female filmmakers, Chastain starred in two projects directed by women<a href="Niki%20Caro">Niki Caro</a>'s "<a href="The%20Zookeeper%27s%20Wife%20%28film%29">The Zookeeper's Wife</a>" and <a href="Susanna%20White">Susanna White</a>'s "<a href="Woman%20Walks%20Ahead">Woman Walks Ahead</a>". In the former, an adaptation of <a href="Diane%20Ackerman">Diane Ackerman</a>'s non-fiction book of the <a href="The%20Zookeeper%27s%20Wife">same name</a>, she co-starred with <a href="Johan%20Heldenbergh">Johan Heldenbergh</a> as the real-life Polish zookeepers <a href="Jan%20and%20Antonina%20%C5%BBabi%C5%84ski">Jan and Antonina Żabiński</a> who saved many human and animal lives during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The film received mixed reviews, although <a href="Stephen%20Holden">Stephen Holden</a> took note of how Chastain's "watchful, layered performance" empowered the film. "Woman Walks Ahead" tells the story of the 19th-century activist <a href="Catherine%20Weldon">Catherine Weldon</a>, who served as an adviser to the <a href="Sioux">Sioux</a> chieftain <a href="Sitting%20Bull">Sitting Bull</a> prior to the <a href="Wounded%20Knee%20Massacre">Wounded Knee Massacre</a>. She was interested in portraying a role that young girls could look up to for inspiration, and provided off-screen inputs to avoid a <a href="white%20savior%20narrative%20in%20film">white savior narrative</a>.

Chastain portrayed <a href="Molly%20Bloom%20%28author%29">Molly Bloom</a>, a former professional skier who ran a high-profile gambling operation that led to her arrest by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a>, in <a href="Aaron%20Sorkin">Aaron Sorkin</a>'s directorial debut, "<a href="Molly%27s%20Game">Molly's Game</a>" (2017). She accepted the part due to her desire to work with Sorkin, whose writing she deeply admired. Instead of relying on Bloom's public persona, Chastain met Bloom to explore her character's flaws and vulnerabilities. She also researched the world of <a href="underground%20poker">underground poker</a> and interviewed some of Bloom's customers. Peter Debruge hailed her role as "one of the screen's great female parts" and credited its success to both Chastain's "stratospheric talent" and Sorkin's script. Chastain received her fifth Golden Globe nomination for the film. In 2018, Chastain hosted an episode of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" and voiced the <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a> production "Spheres: Songs of Spacetime". She had filmed a part in <a href="Xavier%20Dolan">Xavier Dolan</a>'s ensemble drama "<a href="The%20Death%20and%20Life%20of%20John%20F.%20Donovan">The Death and Life of John F. Donovan</a>", but her role was cut during post-production as Dolan found her character to be incompatible to the story.

In 2019, Chastain will join the <a href="X-Men%20%28film%29">"X-Men" film series</a> in the installment entitled "<a href="Dark%20Phoenix%20%28film%29">Dark Phoenix</a>", in which she plays an alien shapeshifter. She will then play the adult Beverly Marsh in a sequel to the 2017 horror film "<a href="It%20%282017%20film%29">It</a>", entitled "<a href="It%20%E2%80%93%20Chapter%20Two">It: Chapter Two</a>", based on <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>'s <a href="It%20%28novel%29">novel</a>, taking over the role from <a href="Sophia%20Lillis">Sophia Lillis</a>. Chastain is set to star and produce the action film "<a href="Eve%20%28upcoming%20film%29">Eve</a>", penned and initially scheduled to be directed by <a href="Matthew%20Newton">Matthew Newton</a>, who has a history of alleged domestic violence. Following criticism against her for choosing to work with him, Newton was replaced by <a href="Tate%20Taylor">Tate Taylor</a>. She will also star as the country singer <a href="Tammy%20Wynette">Tammy Wynette</a> opposite <a href="Josh%20Brolin">Josh Brolin</a>'s <a href="George%20Jones">George Jones</a> in the biopic "George and Tammy", will feature and serve as a producer in the ensemble spy thriller "355", and will also produce and star as the superhero <a href="Painkiller%20Jane">Painkiller Jane</a> in a film of the same name. In addition, Chastain will reunite with Octavia Spencer in an upcoming comedy; as a producer, she negotiated a higher salary for Spencer. She will also star alongside <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> in a film adaption of the 2016 video game "<a href="Tom%20Clancy%27s%20The%20Division">Tom Clancy's The Division</a>".

Despite significant media attention, Chastain remains guarded about her personal life, and chooses not to attend red carpet events with a partner. She considers herself to be a "shy" person, and in 2011 said that she enjoys domestic routines like dog-walking and playing ukulele, rather than partying. She has cited the actress <a href="Isabelle%20Huppert">Isabelle Huppert</a> as an influence, for managing a family, while also playing "out-there roles" in film.

Chastain is an animal lover, and has adopted a <a href="rescue%20dog">rescue dog</a>. She was a <a href="pescatarian">pescatarian</a> for much of her life; following health troubles she began practicing <a href="veganism">veganism</a>. In the 2000s, Chastain was in a long-term relationship with writer-director Ned Benson that ended in 2010. In 2012, she began dating Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, an Italian count of the <a href="Passi%20de%20Preposulo">Passi de Preposulo</a> noble family, who is an executive for the fashion brand <a href="Moncler">Moncler</a>. On June 10, 2017, she married Preposulo at his family's estate in <a href="Carbonera%2C%20Veneto">Carbonera</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. In 2018, the couple had a daughter through surrogacy. They live in New York City.

Chastain is a <a href="feminist">feminist</a>, and has often spoken against the discrimination faced by women and minorities in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>". At the <a href="2017%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2017 Cannes Film Festival</a>, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She has complained about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Chastain advocates for greater gender balance on sets, including more representation of women on film crews and in positions of power. On <a href="social%20media">social media</a>, Chastain aims to "amplify the voices" of victims of <a href="sexual%20harassment">sexual harassment</a> in the industry. In 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the <a href="Time%27s%20Up%20%28movement%29">Time's Up</a> initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination.

Chastain is vocal in her support for <a href="equal%20pay%20for%20equal%20work">equal pay</a> in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. In 2017, Chastain featured alongside several Hollywood celebrities in a theatrical production of "<a href="The%20Children%27s%20Monologues">The Children's Monologues</a>", in which she performed a monologue as a 13-year-old girl who is <a href="rape">rape</a>d by her uncle. The event raised funds for <a href="Dramatic%20Need">Dramatic Need</a>, a charity that helps African children pursue a career in the arts.

Chastain supports charitable organizations that promote mental health, and is involved with the non-profit organization <a href="To%20Write%20Love%20on%20Her%20Arms">To Write Love on Her Arms</a> to help high-school students of alternate <a href="sexual%20identity">sexual</a> and <a href="gender%20identity">gender</a> identities overcome insecurities. She was teased as a child for having red hair and freckles, and now takes a stand against bullying and <a href="body%20shaming">body shaming</a>. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable <a href="reproductive%20health">reproductive health</a> care for women, and in 2017, "Variety" honored her for her work with <a href="Planned%20Parenthood">Planned Parenthood</a>.

Describing Chastain's off-screen persona, Roy Porter of "<a href="InStyle">InStyle</a>" magazine wrote in 2015 that "she's an adult, which isn't always a given in Hollywood. Unconsciously candid with her answers, she retains a sense of perspective uncommon among her peers, and has real opinions"; Porter also credited her for being the rare actress who is "all about the craft". Evgenia Peretz, an editor at "<a href="Vanity%20Fair%20%28magazine%29">Vanity Fair</a>", considers Chastain to be "the most sensitive and empathetic actor" she has interviewed.

Chastain specializes in portraying emotionally grueling roles and is drawn towards parts of strong but flawed women. The journalist <a href="Sanjiv%20Bhattacharya">Sanjiv Bhattacharya</a> has identified a theme of characters who "subvert gender expectations in some way". David Ehrlich of <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a> credits her for being the sole American actress to consistently play roles that "champion feminist ideals". She believes in extensive preparations for a role: "[I] fill myself up with as much history of the character as I can." The film critics Roger Ebert and Richard Roeper have praised Chastain's versatility, and "<a href="W%20%28magazine%29">W</a>" magazine credits her for avoiding <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecasting</a>.

Guillermo del Toro, who directed Chastain in "Crimson Peak", believes that she is "interested in being chameleonic", and that she brings authenticity even to bizarre situations. Sophie Heawood of "The Guardian" believes that Chastain's ability to bring very little ego to her roles renders her unrecognisable to the audience. Sarah Karmali of "<a href="Harper%27s%20Bazaar">Harper's Bazaar</a>" opines that "she goes for total immersion, sinking so deep into character that her face seems to change shape with each one". Lea Goldman of "<a href="Marie%20Claire">Marie Claire</a>" compares her craft to that of actresses Meryl Streep and <a href="Cate%20Blanchett">Cate Blanchett</a>, and writes that she values her craft over her looks. Describing her film career in 2017, the journalist Ben Dickinson of "<a href="Elle%20%28magazine%29">Elle</a>" wrote:

"<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" has described Chastain as being "excessively luscious [with] pale <a href="Sandro%20Botticelli">Botticelli</a> features wrapped around a bone structure that has a touch of the masculine, right down to the cleft in her chin". She was named the sexiest vegetarian actress in a poll conducted by <a href="PETA">PETA</a> in 2012. From 2012 to 2014 she was featured in <a href="AskMen">AskMen</a>'s listing of the most desirable women, and in 2015, "<a href="Glamour%20%28magazine%29">Glamour</a>" magazine ranked her as one of the best-dressed women.

"<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine named Chastain one of the <a href="Time%20100">100 most influential people in the world</a> in 2012. That same year, she was invited to join the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>, and she endorsed an <a href="Yves%20Saint%20Laurent%20%28designer%29">Yves Saint Laurent</a> fragrance called Manifesto. In 2015, she became the global ambassador for the Swiss jewelry and watchmaking company <a href="Piaget%20SA">Piaget SA</a>, and in 2017, she was made the face of <a href="Ralph%20Lauren">Ralph Lauren</a>'s fragrance campaign, named Woman.

According to the review-aggregate site <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and the box office site <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a>, Chastain's highest-grossing and most acclaimed films include "<a href="Take%20Shelter">Take Shelter</a>" (2011), "<a href="The%20Help%20%28film%29">The Help</a>" (2011), "<a href="Coriolanus%20%28film%29">Coriolanus</a>" (2011), "" (2012), "<a href="Zero%20Dark%20Thirty">Zero Dark Thirty</a>" (2012), "<a href="Mama%20%282013%20film%29">Mama</a>" (2013), "<a href="Interstellar%20%28film%29">Interstellar</a>" (2014), "<a href="A%20Most%20Violent%20Year">A Most Violent Year</a>" (2014), "<a href="The%20Martian%20%28film%29">The Martian</a>" (2015), "<a href="Miss%20Sloane">Miss Sloane</a>" (2016), and "<a href="Molly%27s%20Game">Molly's Game</a>" (2017). Among her stage roles, she has appeared in a Broadway revival of "<a href="The%20Heiress%20%281947%20play%29">The Heiress</a>" in 2012.

Chastain has been nominated for two <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards</a>, <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> for "The Help" (2011) and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> for "Zero Dark Thirty" (2012).

Indigenous people of the Everglades region

The indigenous people of the Everglades region arrived in the <a href="Florida">Florida</a> <a href="peninsula">peninsula</a> of what is now the United States approximately 14,000 to 15,000 years ago, probably following large game. The <a href="Paleo-Indian">Paleo-Indian</a>s found an <a href="arid">arid</a> landscape that supported plants and animals adapted to prairie and xeric scrub conditions. Large animals became <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">extinct</a> in Florida around 11,000 years ago. <a href="Holocene%20climatic%20optimum">Climate change</a>s 6,500 years ago brought a wetter landscape. The Paleo-Indians slowly adapted to the new conditions. Archaeologists call the cultures that resulted from the adaptations <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20the%20Americas">Archaic peoples</a>. They were better suited for environmental changes than their ancestors, and created many tools with the resources they had. Approximately 5,000 years ago, the climate shifted again to cause the regular flooding from <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a> that gave rise to the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> ecosystems.

From the Archaic peoples, two major tribes emerged in the area: the <a href="Calusa">Calusa</a> and the <a href="Tequesta">Tequesta</a>. The earliest written descriptions of these people come from Spanish explorers, who sought to convert and conquer them. Although they lived in complex societies, little evidence of their existence remains today. The Calusa were more powerful in number and political structure. Their territory was centered on modern-day <a href="Fort%20Myers%2C%20Florida">Ft. Myers</a>, and extended as far north as <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a>, as far east as Lake Okeechobee, and as far south as the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Keys</a>. The Tequesta lived on the southeastern coast of the Florida peninsula around what is today <a href="Biscayne%20Bay">Biscayne Bay</a> and the <a href="Miami%20River%20%28Florida%29">Miami River</a>. Both societies were well adapted to live in the various ecosystems of the Everglades regions. Their people often traveled through the heart of the Everglades, though they rarely lived within it.

After more than 210 years of relations with the Spanish, both indigenous societies lost cohesiveness. Official records indicate that survivors of war and disease were transported to <a href="Havana">Havana</a> with Spanish colonists in the late 18th century, after Great Britain took over some of the territory. Isolated groups may have been assimilated into the <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a> nation, which formed in northern Florida when a band of <a href="Creek%20people">Creek</a> consolidated surviving members of pre-Columbian societies in Florida into their own group to become a distinct tribe, in a process of <a href="ethnogenesis">ethnogenesis</a>. They also were joined by free blacks and escaped slaves, who became known as <a href="Black%20Seminole">Black Seminole</a>. The Seminole were forced south and into the Everglades by the U.S. military during the <a href="Seminole%20Wars">Seminole Wars</a> from 1835 to 1842. The U.S. military pursued the Seminole into the region, which resulted in some of the first recorded European-American explorations of much of the area. Federally recognized Seminole tribes continue to live in the Everglades region. Since the late 20th century, they have developed <a href="casino">casino</a> gambling on six reservations in the state, which generate revenues for the welfare and education of their tribes. 

Humans first inhabited the peninsula of Florida approximately 14,000 to 15,000 years ago; it looked vastly different at that time and had a different climate. The west coast extended about to the west of its current location. The landscape had large dunes and sweeping winds characteristic of an arid region, and pollen samples show foliage was limited to small stands of oak and scrub bushes. As Earth's <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">glacial ice</a> retreated, winds slowed and vegetation became more prevalent and varied. The <a href="Paleo-Indian">Paleo-Indian</a> diets consisted of small plants and available wild game, which included <a href="saber-toothed%20cat">saber-toothed cat</a>s, <a href="ground%20sloth">ground sloth</a>s, and <a href="Tremarctos%20floridanus">spectacled bear</a>s. The <a href="Pleistocene%20megafauna">Pleistocene megafauna</a> died out around 11,000 years ago. Around 6,500 years ago, the climate of Florida changed again during the <a href="Holocene%20climatic%20optimum">Holocene climatic optimum</a> and became much wetter. Paleo-Indians spent more time in camps and less time traveling between sources of water.

The Paleo-Indians who survived are now known as the <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20the%20Americas">Archaic</a> peoples of the Florida peninsula. They lived on after the extinction of most big game and were primarily <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a>s who depended on smaller game and fish. They relied on plants for food more than their ancestors. They were able to adapt to the shifting climate and the resulting changes in animal and plant populations.

Florida experienced a prolonged <a href="drought">drought</a> at the onset of the Early Archaic era that lasted until the <a href="Middle%20Archaic%20period">Middle Archaic period</a>. Although the population decreased overall on the peninsula, their use of tools increased significantly during this time. Artifacts demonstrate that these people used drills, knives, choppers, <a href="atlatl">atlatl</a>s, and <a href="Bradawl">awls</a> made from stone, <a href="antler">antler</a>s, and bone.

During the Late Archaic period, the climate became wetter again and by approximately 3000 BCE, the rise of <a href="water%20table">water table</a>s allowed an increase in population. Cultural development also took place. Florida Indians formed into three similar but distinct cultures: <a href="Belle%20Glade%20culture">Okeechobee</a>, <a href="Caloosahatchee%20culture">Caloosahatchee</a>, and <a href="Glades%20culture">Glades</a>, named for the bodies of water where they were centered.

The Glades culture is divided into three periods based on evidence found in <a href="midden">midden</a>s. In 1947, <a href="archaeologist">archaeologist</a> John Goggin described the three periods after examining shell mounds. He excavated one on Matecumbe Key, another at Gordon Pass near modern-day <a href="Naples%2C%20Florida">Naples</a>, and a third south of Lake Okeechobee near modern-day <a href="Belle%20Glade%2C%20Florida">Belle Glade</a>. The Glades I culture, lasting from 500 BCE to 800 CE, was apparently focused around Gordon Pass and is considered the least sophisticated due to the lack of artifacts. What has been found—primarily pottery—is gritty and plain. With the advent of a well-established culture in 800 CE, the Glades II period is characterized by more ornate pottery, wide use of tools throughout the South Florida region, and the appearance of religious artifacts at burial sites. By 1200, the Glades III culture exhibited the height of their development. Pottery became ornate enough to be subdivided into types of decoration. More importantly, evidence of an expanding culture is revealed through the development of ceremonial ornaments made from shell, and the construction of large <a href="Earthworks%20%28archaeology%29">earthworks</a> associated with burial rituals. From the Glades III culture developed two distinct tribes that lived in and near the Everglades in the historic period: the Calusa and the Tequesta.

What is known of the inhabitants of Florida after 1566 was recorded by European explorers and settlers. <a href="Juan%20Ponce%20de%20Le%C3%B3n">Juan Ponce de León</a> is credited as the first European to have contact with Florida's indigenous people in 1513. Ponce de León met with hostility from tribes that may have been the <a href="Ais%20%28tribe%29">Ais</a> and the <a href="Tequesta">Tequesta</a> before rounding <a href="Cape%20Sable">Cape Sable</a> to meet the <a href="Calusa">Calusa</a>, the largest and most powerful tribe in South Florida. Ponce de León found at least one of the Calusa fluent in Spanish. The explorer assumed the Spanish-speaker was from <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>, but <a href="anthropologist">anthropologist</a>s have suggested that communication and trade between Calusa and native people in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> and the Florida Keys was common, or that Ponce de León was not the first Spaniard to make contact with the native people of Florida. During his second visit to South Florida, Ponce de León was killed by the Calusa, and the tribe gained a reputation for violence, causing future explorers to avoid them. In the more than 200 years the Calusa had relations with the Spanish, they were able to resist their attempts to missionize them.

The Calusa were referred to as "Carlos" by the Spanish, which may have sounded like "Calos", a variation of the <a href="Muskogean">Muskogean</a> word "kalo" meaning "black" or "powerful". Much of what is known about the Calusa was provided by <a href="Hernando%20de%20Escalante%20Fontaneda">Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda</a>. Fontaneda was a 13-year-old boy who was the only survivor of a shipwreck off the coast of Florida in 1545. For seventeen years he lived with the Calusa until explorer <a href="Pedro%20Men%C3%A9ndez%20de%20Avil%C3%A9s">Pedro Menéndez de Avilés</a> found him in 1566. Menéndez took Fontaneda to Spain where he wrote about his experiences. Menéndez approached the Calusa with the intention of establishing relations with them to ease the settlement of the future Spanish colony. The chief, or "<a href="cacique">cacique</a>", was named Carlos by the Spanish. Positions of importance in Calusa society were given the adopted names Carlos and Philip, <a href="Transliteration">transliterate</a>d from Spanish royal tradition. However, the "cacique" Carlos described by Fontaneda was the most powerful chief during Spanish colonization. Menéndez married his sister in order to facilitate relations between the Spanish and the Calusa. This arrangement was common in societies in South Florida people. Polygamy was a method of solving disputes or settling agreements between rival towns. Menéndez, however, was already married and expressed discomfort with the union. Unable to avoid the marriage, he took Carlos' sister to Havana where she was educated, and where one account reported that she died years later, the marriage never consummated.

Fontaneda explained in his 1571 memoir that Carlos controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a> (which they called "Mayaimi") and on the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a> (which they called "Martires"). Smaller tribes of Ais and <a href="Jaega">Jaega</a> who lived to the east of Lake Okeechobee, paid regular tributes to Carlos. The Spanish suspected the Calusa of harvesting treasures from shipwrecks and distributing the gold and silver between the Ais and Jaega, with Carlos receiving the majority. The main village of the Calusa, and home of Carlos, bordered <a href="Estero%20Bay%20%28Florida%29">Estero Bay</a> at present-day <a href="Mound%20Key">Mound Key</a> where the Caloosahatchee River meets the Gulf of Mexico. Fontaneda described <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a> as a common practice: when the child of a "cacique" died, each resident gave up a child to be sacrificed, and when the "cacique" died, his servants were sacrificed to join him. Each year a Christian was required to be sacrificed to appease a Calusa idol. The building of shell mounds of varying sizes and shapes was also of spiritual significance to the Calusa. In 1895 <a href="Frank%20Hamilton%20Cushing">Frank Hamilton Cushing</a> excavated a massive shell mound on <a href="Key%20Marco">Key Marco</a> that was composed of several constructed terraces hundreds of yards long. Cushing unearthed over a thousand Calusa artifacts. Among them he found tools made of bone and shell, pottery, human bones, masks, and animal carvings made of wood.

The Calusa, like their predecessors, were hunter-gatherers who existed on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Finding little use for the soft limestone of the area, they made most of their tools from bone or teeth, although they also found sharpened reeds effective. Weapons consisted of bows and arrows, "<a href="atlatl">atlatl</a>s", and spears. Most villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands. They used canoes for transportation, as evidenced by shell mounds in and around the Everglades that border canoe trails. South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.

Calusa villages often had more than 200 inhabitants, and their society was organized in a <a href="hierarchy">hierarchy</a>. Apart from the "cacique", other strata included priests and <a href="warrior">warrior</a>s. Family bonds promoted the hierarchy, and marriage between siblings was common among the elite. Fontaneda wrote, "These Indians have no gold, no silver, and less clothing. They go naked except for some breech cloths woven of palms, with which the men cover themselves; the women do the like with certain grass that grows on trees. This grass looks like wool, although it is different from it". Only one instance of structures was described: Carlos met Menéndez in a large house with windows and room for over a thousand people.

The Spanish found Carlos uncontrollable, as their priests and the Calusa fought almost constantly. Carlos was killed when a Spanish soldier shot him with a crossbow. Following the death of "cacique" Carlos, leadership of the society passed to two "caciques" who were captured and killed by the Spanish. Estimated numbers of Calusa at the beginning of the occupation of the Spanish ranged from 4,000 to 7,000. The society endured a decline of power and population after Carlos; by 1697 their number was estimated to be about 1,000. In the early 18th century, the Calusa came under attack from the <a href="Yamasee">Yamasee</a> to the north; many asked to be removed to Cuba, where almost 200 died of illness. Some of these later relocated to Florida, and remnants may have been eventually assimilated into the <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a> culture, which developed during the 18th century.

Second in power and number to the <a href="Calusa">Calusa</a> in South Florida were the <a href="Tequesta">Tequesta</a> (also called Tekesta, Tequeste, and Tegesta). They occupied the southeastern portion of the lower peninsula in modern-day <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Dade</a> and <a href="Broward%20County%2C%20Florida">Broward</a> counties. They may have been controlled by the Calusa, but accounts state that they sometimes refused to comply with the Calusa "<a href="cacique">cacique</a>s", which resulted in war. Like the Calusa, they rarely lived within the Everglades, but found the coastal prairies and <a href="South%20Florida%20rocklands%23Pine%20rockland">pine rocklands</a> to the east of the freshwater sloughs habitable. To the north, their territory was bordered by the Ais and Jaega. Like the Calusa, the Tequesta societies centered on the mouths of rivers. Their main village was probably on the <a href="Miami%20River%20%28Florida%29">Miami River</a> or Little River. A large shell mound on the Little River marks where a village once stood. Though little remains of the Tequesta society, a site of archeological importance called the <a href="Miami%20Circle">Miami Circle</a> was discovered in 1998 in <a href="downtown%20Miami">downtown Miami</a>. It may be the remains of a Tequesta structure. Its significance has yet to be determined, though archeologists and <a href="anthropologists">anthropologists</a> continue to study it.

The Spanish described the Tequesta as greatly feared by their sailors, who suspected the natives of torturing and killing survivors of shipwrecks. Spanish priests wrote that the Tequesta performed child sacrifices to mark the occasion of making peace with a tribe with whom they had been fighting. Like the Calusa, the Tequesta hunted small game, but depended more upon roots and less on shellfish in their diets. They did not practice cultivated agriculture. They were skilled <a href="canoe">canoe</a>ists and hunted in the open ocean for what Fontaneda described as <a href="whale">whale</a>s, but were probably <a href="West%20Indian%20Manatee">manatees</a>. They lassoed the manatees and drove a stake through their snouts.

The first contact with Spanish explorers occurred in 1513 when <a href="Juan%20Ponce%20de%20Le%C3%B3n">Juan Ponce de León</a> stopped at a bay he called "Chequescha", or <a href="Biscayne%20Bay">Biscayne Bay</a>. Finding the Tequesta unwelcoming, he left to make contact with the Calusa. Menéndez met the Tequesta in 1565 and maintained a friendly relationship with them, building some houses and setting up a mission. He also took the chief's nephew to <a href="Havana">Havana</a> to be educated, and the chief's brother to Spain. After Menéndez visited, there are few records of the Tequesta: a reference to them in 1673, and further Spanish contact to convert them. The last reference to the Tequesta during their existence was written in 1743 by a Spanish priest named Father Alaña, who described their ongoing assault by another tribe. The survivors numbered only 30, and the Spanish transported them to Havana. In 1770 a <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> surveyor described multiple deserted villages in the region where the Tequesta had lived. Archeologist John Goggin suggested that by the time European Americans settled the area in 1820, any remaining Tequesta were assimilated into the <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a> people. Common descriptions of Native Americans in Florida by 1820 identified only the "Seminoles".

Following the demise of the Calusa and Tequesta, Native Americans in southern Florida were referred to as "Spanish Indians" in the 1740s, probably due to their friendlier relations with Spain. Between the Spanish defeat in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a> in 1763 and the end of the <a href="American%20War%20of%20Independence">American War of Independence</a> in 1783, the United Kingdom ruled Florida. The first known use of the term "Seminolie" is from a British <a href="Indian%20agent">Indian agent</a> in a document dated 1771. The beginnings of the tribe are vague, but records show that <a href="Creek%20%28people%29">Creeks</a> invaded the Florida peninsula, conquering and assimilating what was left of pre-Columbian societies into the Creek Confederacy. The mixing of cultures is evident in the language influences present among the Seminoles: various <a href="Muskogean">Muskogean</a> languages, notably <a href="Hitchiti">Hitchiti</a>, and Creek, as well as <a href="Timucua%20language">Timucuan</a>. In the early 19th century, a US Indian agent explained the Seminoles this way: "The word Seminole means runaway or broken off. Hence ... applicable to all the Indians in the Territory of Florida as all of them ran away ... from the Creek ... Nation". Linguistically, the term "Seminole" comes from a corruption of the Spanish word "cimarron," likening their migratory history to wild horses. The traditional Muskogee Creek Language lacks a rhotic phoneme. There was a metathesis of the penultimate and ultimate syllables.

Creeks, who were centered in modern-day <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> and <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, were known to incorporate conquered tribes into their own. Some Africans escaping <a href="slavery">slavery</a> from <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> and Georgia fled to Florida, lured by Spanish promises of freedom should they convert to <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Catholicism</a>, and found their way into the tribe. Seminoles originally settled in the northern portion of the territory, but the 1823 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Moultrie%20Creek">Treaty of Moultrie Creek</a> forced them to live on a <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservation</a> north of Lake Okeechobee. They soon ranged farther south, where they numbered approximately 300 in the Everglades region, including bands of <a href="Miccosukee">Miccosukee</a>s—a similar tribe who spoke a different language—who lived in The Big Cypress. Unlike the Calusa and Tequesta, the Seminole depended more on agriculture and raised domesticated animals. They hunted for what they ate, and traded with European-American settlers. They lived in structures called <a href="chickee">chickee</a>s, open-sided palm-thatched huts, probably adapted from the Calusa.

In 1817, <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> invaded Florida to hasten its annexation to the United States in what became the <a href="First%20Seminole%20War">First Seminole War</a>. After Florida became a U.S. territory and settlement increased, conflicts between colonists and Seminoles became more frequent. The <a href="Second%20Seminole%20War">Second Seminole War</a> (1835–1842) resulted in almost 4,000 Seminoles in Florida being displaced or killed. The Seminole Wars pushed the Indians farther south and into the Everglades. Those who did not find refuge in the Everglades were relocated to Oklahoma <a href="Indian%20territory">Indian territory</a> under <a href="Indian%20Removal">Indian Removal</a>.

The <a href="Third%20Seminole%20War">Third Seminole War</a> lasted from 1855 to 1859. Over its course, 20 Seminoles were killed and 240 were removed. By 1913, Seminoles in the Everglades numbered no more than 325. They made their villages in <a href="South%20Florida%20rocklands%23Rockland%20hammock">hardwood hammocks</a>, islands of hardwood trees that formed in rivers or <a href="South%20Florida%20rocklands%23Pine%20rockland">pine rockland forests</a>. Seminole diets consisted of <a href="hominy">hominy</a> and <a href="Zamia%20integrifolia">coontie</a> roots, fish, turtles, venison, and small game. Villages were not large, due to the limited size of hammocks, which on average measured between one and . In the center of the village was a cook-house, and the largest structure was reserved for eating. When the Seminoles lived in northern Florida, they wore animal-skin clothing similar to their Creek predecessors. The heat and humidity of the Everglades influenced their adapting a different style of dress. Seminoles replaced their heavier <a href="Buckskin%20%28leather%29">buckskins</a> with clothing of unique <a href="Calico%20%28textile%29">calico</a> patchwork designs made of lighter <a href="cotton">cotton</a>, or silk for more formal occasions.

The Seminole Wars increased the U.S. military presence in the Everglades, which resulted in the exploration and mapping of many regions that had not previously been recorded. The military officers who had done the mapping and charting of the Everglades were approached by <a href="Thomas%20Buckingham%20Smith">Thomas Buckingham Smith</a> in 1848 to consult on the feasibility of <a href="Draining%20and%20development%20of%20the%20Everglades">draining the region for agricultural use</a>.

Between the end of the Third Seminole War and 1930, a few hundred Seminoles continued to live in relative isolation in the Everglades area. Flood control and drainage projects in the area beginning in the early 20th century opened up much land for development and significantly altered the natural environment, inundating some areas while leaving former swamps dry and arable. These projects, along with the completion of the <a href="Tamiami%20Trail">Tamiami Trail</a> which bisected the Everglades in 1930, simultaneously ended old ways of life and introduced new opportunities. A steady stream of white developers and tourists came to the area, and the native people began to work in local farms, ranches, and souvenir stands. They cleared land for the town of <a href="Everglades%2C%20Florida">Everglades</a>, and were "the best fire fighters [the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>] could recruit" when <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a> caught fire in times of drought.

As metropolitan areas in South Florida began to grow, the <a href="Miccosukee">Miccosukee</a> branch of the Seminoles became closely associated with the Everglades, simultaneously seeking privacy and serving as a tourist attraction, wrestling alligators, selling crafts, and giving <a href="Ecotourism">eco-tours</a> of their land. As of 2008, there were six Seminole and Miccosukee reservations throughout Florida; they feature <a href="Native%20American%20gambling%20enterprises">casino</a> gaming that supports the tribe.

Nick Adenhart

Nicholas James Adenhart (August 24, 1986 – April 9, 2009) was an American <a href="Right-handedness">right-handed</a> baseball <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a> who played two seasons in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB) for the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim">Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim</a>. In four career games, Adenhart pitched 18 innings and posted a win-loss record of 1–0, with nine <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>s and a 6.00 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> (ERA).

A graduate of <a href="Williamsport%20High%20School">Williamsport High School</a>, Adenhart was highly touted as a high school prospect until an injury in his final game required <a href="Tommy%20John%20surgery">Tommy John surgery</a>. He was drafted by the Angels in the 14th round of the <a href="2004%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">2004 Major League Baseball draft</a>, and began playing in their minor league system after the surgery was a success. He spent three full seasons in the minor leagues before making his major league debut on May 1, 2008. After appearing in three games, Adenhart spent the rest of 2008 in the minor leagues developing his skills, and in 2009 he earned a spot in the Angels' starting rotation.

Just after pitching his first start of 2009, Adenhart was killed in a <a href="traffic%20collision">collision</a> with a drunk driver. Both the Angels and the <a href="Salt%20Lake%20Bees">Salt Lake Bees</a>, for whom Adenhart played in 2008, suspended their next games. There were many tributes to him over the course of the season, including his former teammates celebrating with him by spraying champagne and beer on one of his jerseys after they clinched the 2009 <a href="American%20League%20West">American League West</a> division championship.

Nicholas James Adenhart was born in <a href="Silver%20Spring%2C%20Maryland">Silver Spring, Maryland</a>, the only son of Janet and Jim Adenhart, a former <a href="United%20States%20Secret%20Service">United States Secret Service</a> officer. His parents divorced and Janet later remarried Duane Gigeous, with whom she had a son named Henry, who is a pitcher at the <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a>. Adenhart played Halfway <a href="Little%20League%20Baseball">Little League Baseball</a> for Gehr Construction and attended Springfield Middle School in <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Maryland">Williamsport, Maryland</a>. He pitched for the Hagerstown <a href="PONY%20Baseball%20and%20Softball">PONY League</a> for six years, and was a member of the 1999 team that won the Maryland District 1 title.

After graduating from middle school, Adenhart attended <a href="Saint%20Maria%20Goretti%20High%20School">Saint Maria Goretti High School</a> in <a href="Hagerstown%2C%20Maryland">Hagerstown, Maryland</a>. He played <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> and <a href="outfield">outfield</a>, in addition to pitching. While attending Saint Maria Goretti, Adenhart was a <a href="guard%20%28basketball%29">guard</a> on the basketball team that won the <a href="Baltimore%20Catholic%20League">Baltimore Catholic League</a> championship. At the age of 14, Adenhart joined the Oriolelanders, a showcase team composed of Maryland amateur players and sponsored by the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>, where he would stay for four years. In 2003, at the age of 16, Adenhart pitched for the <a href="Youse%27s%20Maryland%20Orioles">Youse's Maryland Orioles</a>, who went on to win the All American Amateur Baseball Association Tournament for that year.

Adenhart transferred to <a href="Williamsport%20High%20School">Williamsport High School</a> after his sophomore year, where he gave up basketball to focus solely on baseball, as a pitcher. Scouts began closely following him when he was named the top junior prospect by "<a href="Baseball%20America">Baseball America</a>". 

Adenhart had a 6–0 record with a 1.04 <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a> during the regular season in his junior year, and as a result was named the <a href="Gatorade%20Player%20of%20the%20Year%20awards">Gatorade Player of the Year</a> in Maryland. In a 1–0 loss during the playoff quarterfinal matchup, he threw a no-hitter and had 14 strikeouts. Entering his final high school season, "Baseball America" dubbed Adenhart the top high school prospect in the country. In his senior year, Adenhart threw a <a href="perfect%20game">perfect game</a> in his very first outing, <a href="strikeout">striking out</a> 15 of the 21 batters faced. Entering the final regular season game of his high school career, he had a 5–1 record, a 0.73 ERA and an average of 2.2 strikeouts per <a href="inning">inning</a>. During November of his senior year, Adenhart signed a <a href="National%20Letter%20of%20Intent">letter of intent</a> to play with the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20baseball">North Carolina Tar Heels baseball team</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20North%20Carolina">University of North Carolina</a>, although his chances of being drafted high continued to climb and the North Carolina coaching staff saw their chances of acquiring Adenhart to be slim.

In his final high school game, in front of two dozen scouts, Adenhart felt a pop in his elbow after throwing a <a href="curveball">curveball</a> to the third batter. The injury, which abruptly ended his season, was a partial ligament tear in his elbow that required <a href="Tommy%20John%20surgery">Tommy John surgery</a>. Though he had originally been projected as a first-round draft pick, the injury caused his stock to plummet two weeks before the <a href="2004%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">2004 Major League Baseball draft</a>. 

He fell to the 413th overall pick in the 14th round, selected by the <a href="Anaheim%20Angels">Anaheim Angels</a>. Angels scout Dan Radcliff and director of scouting <a href="Eddie%20Bane">Eddie Bane</a> convinced Adenhart to forego a scholarship offer from the University of North Carolina and signed him to a $710,000 bonus ($ in 2010) on July 26, 2004. After having <a href="James%20Andrews%20%28physician%29">Dr. James Andrews</a> perform the Tommy John surgery, Adenhart spent the next year rehabilitating his elbow at the Angels' rehab facility in <a href="Tempe%2C%20Arizona">Tempe, Arizona</a>. During that time, Adenhart also attended classes at <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a>.

Adenhart made his professional debut on June 25, 2005 with the <a href="Pioneer%20League%20%28baseball%29">Pioneer League</a>'s <a href="Orem%20Owlz">Orem Owlz</a>, the Angels' Rookie League affiliate. In his lone appearance for the Owlz, he pitched six innings, allowed one <a href="unearned%20run">unearned run</a>, struck out seven, and earned the win. He spent the rest of the 2005 season with the Angels of the <a href="Arizona%20League">Arizona League</a> that summer. In 13 games for the Angels, he had a 2–3 record, a 3.68 ERA, and 52 strikeouts. The following spring, at the age of 19, Adenhart was one of twelve pitchers who earned a non-roster invitation to the Angels' big league camp. As the 2006 season began, he was also considered the Angels' sixth best prospect and the 90th-best overall by "Baseball America". Adenhart was assigned to the <a href="Cedar%20Rapids%20Kernels">Cedar Rapids Kernels</a>, the Angels' Low-A affiliate, after <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a>. He pitched well for the Kernels. In 16 games, Adenhart had 10 wins, a 1.95 ERA, and 99 strikeouts in 106 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings pitched</a>. His performance earned him a starting assignment in the 2006 <a href="All-Star%20Futures%20Game">All-Star Futures Game</a> on June 21 and a promotion to the <a href="Rancho%20Cucamonga%20Quakes">Rancho Cucamonga Quakes</a>, the organization's High-A affiliate, soon after. He continued his efforts with the Quakes, winning five games and losing two in nine starts. Adenhart was a member of the <a href="United%20States%20national%20baseball%20team">United States Olympic Qualifying team</a> in 2006, along with fellow Angels prospect <a href="Brandon%20Wood">Brandon Wood</a>.

In 2007, Adenhart became a top-ranked prospect in the Angels organization. "Baseball America" ranked him as the 34th-best prospect in baseball and second in the Angels organization. He was called up to the <a href="Double-A%20%28baseball%29">Double-A</a> <a href="Arkansas%20Travelers">Arkansas Travelers</a> for which he played the 2007 season. In 26 appearances, he had a record of 10–8 with a 3.65 ERA. The following year, Adenhart was called up to the <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">Triple-A</a> <a href="Salt%20Lake%20Bees">Salt Lake Bees</a>, where he spent the majority of the 2008 season. He was declared the 24th-best prospect in the majors that season. In the month of April, Adenhart had a 4–0 record with a 0.87 ERA and 21 strikeouts in 31 innings. As a result, he was brought up to the Angels' major league roster, and was scheduled to make his debut on May 1, pitching on three days' rest. Shortstop <a href="Maicer%20Izturis">Maicer Izturis</a> was placed on the <a href="disabled%20list">disabled list</a> when Adenhart was brought up.

Adenhart made his Major League debut as the starting pitcher against the <a href="2008%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Oakland Athletics</a> at home in <a href="Angel%20Stadium%20of%20Anaheim">Angel Stadium of Anaheim</a>. At the time, he was the youngest active-roster pitcher in the major leagues. In his debut, he gave up five earned runs and <a href="Base%20on%20balls">walked</a> five in two innings, earning a <a href="no-decision">no-decision</a> in a 15–8 loss. Adenhart was disappointed in his first appearance, saying, "I let down the team first. You always want to go out and prove yourself to your teammates and your manager and your coaches. I was a disappointment to myself also." His second start was against the <a href="2008%20Kansas%20City%20Royals%20season">Kansas City Royals</a>, where he earned another no-decision, allowing three earned runs and striking out three over 4⅓ innings in a 5–3 win by the Angels. The reaction to his second start was more positive, with manager <a href="Mike%20Scioscia">Mike Scioscia</a> saying that "it was definitely a start in the right direction." Adenhart earned his only career decision, a <a href="Win%20%28baseball%29">victory</a>, on May 12, 2008, against the <a href="2008%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">Chicago White Sox</a> in Anaheim, giving up four earned runs in 5⅔ innings en route to a 10–7 Angels victory. After the win against the White Sox, Adenhart was sent back down to the Salt Lake Bees. He spent the rest of the 2008 season at Salt Lake, amassing a 9–13 record with a 5.76 ERA in 26 games.

Adenhart was declared the best prospect in the Angels organization going into 2009, and was ranked 68th overall on "Baseball America"'s 2009 Top 100 Prospects list, citing his 158 innings pitched per year over the past three seasons. Adenhart earned his spot in the <a href="2009%20Los%20Angeles%20Angels%20of%20Anaheim%20season">Angels' 2009</a> starting rotation during spring training. He appeared in six starts and had a 3–0 record with a 3.12 ERA over 26 innings pitched. He allowed only nine earned runs and five walks, while striking out 18. Adenhart opened the 2009 season as the third starter in the Angels' rotation. In his season debut on April 8, 2009, he earned a no-decision, giving up seven hits and no runs while striking out five batters and walking three in six innings against the <a href="2009%20Oakland%20Athletics%20season">Oakland Athletics</a> at Angel Stadium of Anaheim.

Shortly after midnight on April 9, 2009, Adenhart was involved in a car crash in <a href="Fullerton%2C%20California">Fullerton, California</a>, just hours after being the starting pitcher in the previous night's game. Police reported that an individual driving a red <a href="Toyota%20Sienna">Toyota Sienna</a> minivan ran a <a href="Traffic%20light">red light</a> and <a href="Side%20collision">broadsided</a> a gray <a href="Mitsubishi%20Eclipse">Mitsubishi Eclipse</a> in which Adenhart was a passenger, sending it crashing into a telephone pole. The driver of the Eclipse, Henry Pearson, and a passenger, Cal State Fullerton cheerleader Courtney Stewart, were pronounced dead at the scene. 

Adenhart and Jon Wilhite, another passenger in the Mitsubishi, were taken to <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Irvine%20Medical%20Center">University of California, Irvine Medical Center</a>, where Adenhart died as a result of his injuries at the age of 22. Wilhite suffered <a href="internal%20decapitation">internal decapitation</a> and survived after undergoing five hours of surgery to reattach his skull to his spine six days after the crash.

The minivan driver fled the scene on foot, but was later arrested and identified as Andrew Thomas Gallo. On May 27, 2009, Gallo was indicted by the <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20California">Orange County</a> <a href="grand%20jury">grand jury</a> on three counts of murder, one count each of felony hit-and-run, <a href="driving%20under%20the%20influence">driving under the influence</a> and causing injury, and driving with a .08 percent blood alcohol or higher and causing injury and death. Gallo had a <a href="blood%20alcohol%20content">blood alcohol content</a> of .19 percent two hours after the crash, and was also driving with a suspended license. On June 8, 2009, Gallo entered a not guilty plea at his arraignment. After a two-week <a href="jury%20trial">jury trial</a> held in September 2010, Gallo was convicted on three counts of second-degree murder, two counts of driving under the influence causing great bodily injury, and one felony count of hit-and-run. A <a href="bench%20trial">bench trial</a> found Gallo guilty of driving on a suspended license. On December 22, 2010, Gallo was sentenced to 51 years to <a href="Life%20sentence">life</a> in jail.

Adenhart's family released this statement, following his death:

Angels General Manager <a href="Tony%20Reagins">Tony Reagins</a> released a statement as well:

The Angels postponed the game against the Athletics for the day immediately after Adenhart's death. In remembrance of Adenhart, for the rest of the 2009 season, a black number 34 patch was placed above the heart on the Angels' uniforms, his locker in the <a href="Angel%20Stadium%20of%20Anaheim">Angel Stadium of Anaheim</a> clubhouse remained as it was, and a locker was assigned to him on road games. The team hung one of Adenhart's jerseys in their dugout during games. 

A black-and-white photo of Adenhart along with his name and number was added to the center field fence at Angel Stadium. A makeshift shrine, dedicated to Adenhart, was established outside the home plate gates to Angel Stadium. The makeshift shrine was maintained by Angels personnel until its removal in December 2009. The Angels do not have any plans to create a permanent memorial.

The <a href="Salt%20Lake%20Bees">Salt Lake Bees</a>, the Angels' <a href="Triple-A%20%28baseball%29">AAA affiliate</a>, also postponed their game on April 9 against the <a href="Reno%20Aces">Reno Aces</a>. The team also wore a number 32 patch through the season representing Adenhart's jersey number during his time with the Bees. A number 32 was also painted on the grass in front of the Bees dugout.

On September 28, 2009, when the Angels celebrated winning the <a href="American%20League%20West">American League West</a> division, they honored Adenhart by spraying champagne and beer on one of his jerseys, and then gathered in front of the outfield wall memorial for a team picture. The appropriateness of celebrating with alcohol in respect to Adenhart's death being alcohol-related was questioned, but family members were supportive of the celebrations. Adenhart's father Jim stated, "That's baseball. If Nick were there, he'd have been throwing a few back as well." Adenhart's teammates voted to give his family a full <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20postseason%23Postseason%20bonuses">playoff share</a> for the 2009 playoffs worth $138,038.57. Angels manager <a href="Mike%20Scioscia">Mike Scioscia</a> dedicated his 2009 American League <a href="Manager%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Manager of the Year Award</a> to Adenhart.

The Angels established the Nick Adenhart Pitcher of the Year award given to an Angels pitcher for outstanding performance throughout the regular season. The team commissioned <a href="Harry%20Weber%20%28sculptor%29">Harry Weber</a> to create a bronze statue of Adenhart, which will be on display in the Angel Stadium trophy case. Smaller versions of the statue will be presented to all honorees of the Nick Adenhart award.

The Adenhart family created the Nick Adenhart Memorial Fund, which is designed to provide financial support to youth baseball organizations. The goal is to lend a helping hand to struggling leagues around the country to buy equipment and cover expenses to keep youth baseball functioning. The first presentation from the fund was for $5000 to the Halfway Little League in <a href="Halfway%2C%20Maryland">Halfway, Maryland</a>. Two annual events, the Nick Adenhart 5K Run and Walk and the Nick Adenhart Baseball Camp, have been established to benefit the foundation.

Adenhart's number 21 jersey was retired by the <a href="Cedar%20Rapids%20Kernels">Cedar Rapids Kernels</a>, the Angels' <a href="Single-A%20%28baseball%29">Class A affiliate</a>, on June 20, 2010. The Kernels, the Kernels Foundation, and the Adenhart family also established the Nick Adenhart Memorial Scholarship, a yearly $1,000 scholarship. The <a href="Orem%20Owlz">Orem Owlz</a>, for whom Adenhart briefly played in 2005, have worn special jerseys, which bear the likeness of a screen-printed picture of Adenhart, along with his number 34. The <a href="Little%20League%20Baseball">Little League Baseball</a> field where Adenhart played in Halfway, Maryland, was rededicated as the Nicholas James Adenhart Memorial Field. The <a href="Hagerstown%20Suns">Hagerstown Suns</a>, the Minor League Baseball affiliate in <a href="Hagerstown%2C%20Maryland">Hagerstown, Maryland</a>, held a fundraiser for the Nick Adenhart Memorial Fund and added Adenhart to their Wall of Fame at <a href="Municipal%20Stadium%20%28Hagerstown%29">Municipal Stadium</a>. The city of <a href="Manhattan%20Beach%2C%20California">Manhattan Beach</a>, Wilhite's home town, erected the Pearson-Wilhite-Stewart-Adenhart Commemorative Wall at Marine Avenue Park honoring all four victims of the crash.

As a memorial, Angels pitcher <a href="Jered%20Weaver">Jered Weaver</a> wrote the initials "NA" in the dirt on the back of the pitcher's mound before each start in honor of Adenhart. Weaver also named his son Aden in memory of Adenhart. <a href="Mike%20Napoli">Mike Napoli</a>, who caught Adenhart's final game, goes out to center field before every game, and writes Adenhart's name in the warning track dirt. <a href="Darren%20O%27Day">Darren O'Day</a>, who came up through the Angels minor system with Adenhart, writes Adenhart's number and initials on the brim of every new cap he wears. <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> pitcher <a href="Miguel%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20%28pitcher%29">Miguel González</a> paid tribute to Adenhart, his former minor league teammate, by wearing one of his gloves in his first major league start, which was against the Angels on July 6, 2012.

Adenhart is buried at Greenlawn Cemetery, in <a href="Williamsport%2C%20Maryland">Williamsport, Maryland</a>, just across the street from Springfield Middle School, where he attended and played baseball as a child. A public memorial service was held at Williamsport High School the day after his burial.

Subsequent to Adenhart's death, his former high school teammate and close friend, David Warrenfeltz, was hired as the Williamsport High School baseball coach. In a crash described as "eerily similar to Adenhart's", the school's star pitcher and his girlfriend were both killed in a collision in 2012.

Emmet Walsh</a>), the brother of a previously recurring retired FBI agent with the same name, tells Mulder the story of a black baseball player who played for the Roswell Grays in <a href="Roswell%2C%20New%20Mexico">Roswell, New Mexico</a> in 1947 under the pseudonym "Josh Exley" (<a href="Jesse%20L.%20Martin">Jesse L. Martin</a>). Exley was actually an alien with a love of baseball. Exley is later tracked down by the <a href="Colonist%20%28The%20X-Files%29%23Alien%20Bounty%20Hunters">Alien Bounty Hunter</a> (<a href="Brian%20Thompson">Brian Thompson</a>) and executed for betraying his people.

Among other things, the episode was inspired by the history of baseball in Roswell, as well as the infamous 1947 <a href="Roswell%20Incident">Roswell Incident</a>. Jesse Martin was offered the lead guest role as Exley after Duchovny noticed him in a production of the musical "<a href="Rent%20%28musical%29">Rent</a>" and an episode of "<a href="Ally%20McBeal">Ally McBeal</a>". Originally, <a href="Darren%20McGavin">Darren McGavin</a> was cast as Arthur Dales, but after he suffered a stroke, he was replaced by Walsh. Many of the outdoor baseball scenes were filmed at Jay Littleton Ballfield, an all-wood stadium located in <a href="Ontario%2C%20California">Ontario, California</a>. The episode has been critically examined for its use of literary motifs, its <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>-like structure, and its themes concerning racism and <a href="Social%20alienation">alienation</a>.

In 1947, a mixed group of black and white men play baseball in <a href="Roswell%2C%20New%20Mexico">Roswell, New Mexico</a>. Suddenly, a group of <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> (KKK) members arrive on horseback, seeking one of the players: Josh Exley (Jesse L. Martin), a talented black baseball player. Men from the team fight back against the KKK, and when the mask of the clan's leader is taken off, the leader is revealed to actually be an alien.

In 1999, FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) look through Roswell newspapers from the 1940s. Mulder spots an article showing a young Arthur Dales (<a href="Fredric%20Lehne">Frederic Lane</a>)—the original investigator of the <a href="X-File">X-File</a>s division who had previously appeared in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%205%29">fifth season</a> episode "<a href="Travelers%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Travelers</a>" and the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%206%29">sixth season</a> episode "<a href="Agua%20Mala">Agua Mala</a>"—Josh Exley, and the shape-shifting <a href="Colonist%20%28The%20X-Files%29%23Alien%20Bounty%20Hunters">Alien Bounty Hunter</a> (<a href="Brian%20Thompson">Brian Thompson</a>) who has assisted the show's antagonists throughout the series. Mulder seeks out Dales in Washington D.C. but finds that he still lives in Florida. Instead, Mulder meets Dales's brother (<a href="M.%20Emmet%20Walsh">M. Emmet Walsh</a>), who is also named Arthur.

In flashback, Dales tells Mulder about first meeting Exley in 1947. Dales (portrayed as a young man by Frederic Lane), a member of the Roswell Police Department, has been assigned to protect a hesitant Exley. Dales travels with Exley and his teammates on their bus, and one night sees that the sleeping Exley is reflected in a window as an alien. The next day, during a game, Exley is <a href="Hit%20by%20pitch">hit</a> by a <a href="Pitch%20%28baseball%29">pitch</a> and starts making utterances in a strange language before returning to his senses. Afterwards, Dales notices that a mysterious green ooze appeared where Exley's bleeding head had rested.

Dales decides to investigate Exley's hometown of <a href="Macon%2C%20Georgia">Macon, Georgia</a>, and discovers that a boy with Exley's name had vanished about five years previously. That night at the hotel, Dales hears noises from Exley's hotel room and breaks in, only to find Exley in his true form as an alien. Exley tells Dales that he was forbidden from intermingling with the human race but fell in love with the game of baseball and remained on Earth. Meanwhile, the Alien Bounty Hunter, who has been pursuing the renegade alien ever since he deserted his alien heritage, takes Exley's form and murders a scientist who is investigating the green ooze that Dales found. After learning of the attack, Dales warns Exley that he is now wanted by the police, and Exley goes into hiding.

The <a href="narrative">narrative</a> returns to the events at the start of the episode. The KKK leader is revealed as the Alien Bounty Hunter, who has arrived to assassinate Exley. The Bounty Hunter demands that Exley revert to his true form before he dies. Exley refuses and the Bounty Hunter then kills him. However, Exley miraculously bleeds red, human blood. Back in 1999, Mulder invites Scully to hit baseballs with him on an empty field.

"The Unnatural" was the first episode of "The X-Files" that Duchovny wrote by himself. (He had previously co-developed the stories for the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> episodes "<a href="Colony%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Colony</a>" and "<a href="Anasazi%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Anasazi</a>" - both with series creator Chris Carter, and received <a href="teleplay">teleplay</a> credits for the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%203%29">third season</a> episodes "<a href="Avatar%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Avatar</a>" and "<a href="Talitha%20Cumi%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Talitha Cumi</a>".) Prior to the show's sixth season, Duchovny felt that he did not have the skills necessary; he said, "I didn't have the surety, the confidence in my mind, that I could write a teleplay ... It took me to the sixth year of the show to actually sit down and write one of my ideas." In late 1998, Duchovny eventually felt secure in his abilities and approached series creator <a href="Chris%20Carter%20%28screenwriter%29">Chris Carter</a> about working on an episode; Carter agreed to the request, and a late-season installment was slated for Duchovny to write.

While both Duchovny and Carter had wanted to write an episode about baseball for several years, Duchovny first conceived the basic premise for "The Unnatural" during <a href="1998%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20home%20run%20record%20chase">the home run race in 1998</a> between <a href="Mark%20McGwire">Mark McGwire</a> and <a href="Sammy%20Sosa">Sammy Sosa</a> when he read a newspaper report about <a href="Joe%20Bauman">Joe Bauman</a>. Bauman was a baseball player who, despite hitting a record 72 <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s during the 1954 season, never played in the Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying "I just made the association ... What if this guy was an alien? and I just started working on that idea." Duchovny later said that "these happy chronological coincidences" facilitated the development of the story.

Inspired by the story of <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> (who was the first black player who was accepted into the Major Leagues in the 1940s), Duchovny decided to make the lead character black and set the story before the <a href="History%20of%20baseball%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Racial%20integration%20in%20baseball">integration of the baseball leagues</a>. After Duchovny finished his first draft, Carter added additional <a href="plot%20point">plot point</a>s, such as the inclusion of the Alien Bounty Hunter and retired FBI agent Arthur Dales. Duchovny largely worked on his ideas alonea fact that he was later very proud of. The episode title is a play on the novel and movie "<a href="The%20Natural">The Natural</a>". The tagline that appears in the opening credits for this episode is "In the Big Inning", which serves as a pun on the phrase, "In the beginning".

Jesse L. Martin was the first actor considered for the part of Exley. Duchovny had first noticed Martin in a production of the musical "<a href="Rent%20%28musical%29">Rent</a>", and noticed him again during a guest appearance on the <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> <a href="legal%20drama">legal</a> <a href="comedy-drama">comedy-drama</a> "<a href="Ally%20McBeal">Ally McBeal</a>". Watching the latter performance, Duchovny decided that Martin had the "right feel" for the lead role. Duchovny later noted that he had little involvement with the casting process since a majority of the characters in the episode were recurring.

Originally, <a href="Darren%20McGavin">Darren McGavin</a> was set to reprise his role as Arthur Dales; the character had previously appeared in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%205%29">fifth-season</a> episode "Travelers" and the sixth-season episode "<a href="Agua%20Mala">Agua Mala</a>". Unfortunately, two days into filming, McGavin suffered a <a href="stroke">stroke</a>, forcing Duchovny and the producers to scrap the few scenes he had shot, rewrite the script to explain his absence, and replace his character with M. Emmet Walsh. Because many of the scenes featuring a younger Dales had already been shot, Duchovny was forced to give Walsh's character the same name as McGavin's character; this was justified in the episode as a quirk on behalf of the two brothers' parents. The two scenes that were filmed with McGavin included the sequence in which Mulder asks Dales whether all great baseball players are aliens, and a scene in which Mulder asks Dales why he joined the FBI. McGavin eventually recovered and allowed his scenes to be included on the sixth season DVD as bonus features. Executive producer <a href="Frank%20Spotnitz">Frank Spotnitz</a> later called it a "great sorrow that" the show had to replace Darren McGavin because the series' producers were "huge fans" of his role in the 1972 film "<a href="The%20Night%20Stalker%20%281972%20film%29">The Night Stalker</a>" and .

Actor Frederic Lane had previously appeared in "Travelers," playing the younger version of McGavin's character. Since McGavin was written out of the episode, Lane played the younger version of Walsh's character. <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> radio announcer <a href="Vin%20Scully">Vin Scully</a> (whose name served as the inspiration for Dana Scully's name) played the <a href="sports%20commentator">baseball announcer</a> in this episode. The announcer was initially unable to appear owing to budgetary issues, but later agreed to record his part for free. <a href="Daniel%20Duchovny">Daniel Duchovny</a>, David's brother, appeared in this episode in a minor role as a <a href="Glossary%20of%20baseball%20%28B%29%23bench%20jockey">bench jockey</a>.

"The Unnatural" was the first episode of the series to be directed by Duchovny, which had been decided when Duchovny was working on plot points with Carter. As the episode, made up mostly of <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a>s, did not heavily feature his character, Duchovny was able to focus on <a href="pre-production">pre-production</a>. This <a href="narratology">narratological</a> method also gave Anderson a minor respite from her work. While Duchovny later expressed gratitude that "The Unnatural" enabled him to get a feel for directing, he also experienced severe anxiety during the production process because of the stress that helming an episode produced. However, when the episode was finished, Duchovny was pleased, calling the results "great." He later noted that his stress was largely uncalled for because the episode would have been made even "if [he] just showed up and drooled for 24 hours a day."

The first five seasons of the series were mainly filmed in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, but production of the show's sixth season was based in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. Jay Littleton Ballfield, an all-wood stadium located in <a href="Ontario%2C%20California">Ontario, California</a>, was used as the setting for the Roswell Baseball Stadium. The show's producers advertised in local media for fans to attend the game dressed in period clothing. During filming, a raffle was held between takes, and signed copies of <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28film%29">"The X-Files"</a>' movie, , and film poster were given away. The scene featuring Mulder teaching Scully how to play baseball was filmed at <a href="Cheviot%20Hills%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Cheviot Hills</a> Park in Los Angeles. The park was later used in the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%208%29">eighth season</a> episode "<a href="Three%20Words%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Three Words</a>" and the <a href="The%20X-Files%20%28season%209%29">ninth season</a> episode "<a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Flies%20%28The%20X-Files%29">Lord of the Flies</a>".

<a href="Costume%20designer">Costume designer</a> Christine Peters crafted the episode's <a href="baseball%20uniform">baseball uniform</a>s after visiting Sports Robe, a <a href="Hollywood">Hollywood</a> costume house. Dena Green from the hair department gave extras haircuts so that they would be in the style of the 1940s. Car coordinator Kelly Padovich secured the use of two 1947 model <a href="Flxible">Flxible</a> buses for the Roswell Greys on-bus scenes, as well as various other contemporary vehicles. Researcher Lee Smith worked with the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20and%20Museum">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> to ensure the accuracy of the statistics used in the episode. The <a href="Theatrical%20property">props</a> department developed from scratch the Peter Rosebud Bank that Dales shows Mulder; property master Tom Day later noted that it was "one of the most expensive props" of the season. The score for the episode, written by the series' composer <a href="Mark%20Snow">Mark Snow</a>, was recorded with the help of musicians Nick Kirgo and Tommy Morgana first for the series (which had previously relied solely on <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s for its soundtrack).

Near the beginning of the episode, Mulder uses one of <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>'s "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Heaven%20and%20Hell%23Proverbs%20of%20Hell">Proverbs of Hell</a>" from his 18th century book "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Heaven%20and%20Hell">The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</a>" in an argument with Scully: "The road to excess leads to the palace of wisdom." Sharon R. Yang, in her essay "Weaving and Unweaving the Story," writes that Mulder is using affluent literature to "justify his passionate dedication to questing for knowledge in arcane areas scorned by mainstream intellectual authority". In addition, <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a> and <a href="Lars%20Pearson">Lars Pearson</a>, in their book "Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen", argue that the episode functions as a <a href="fairy%20tale">fairy tale</a>, and that its conclusion, while sad, is nevertheless an example of a <a href="happy%20ending">happy ending</a>; Exley bleeds red blood as he lays dying, granting the alien his wish "to be a man." In addition, the two mused that the <a href="meta">meta</a> nature of the episode is similar to the way fans of the series reacted to new episodes of "The X-Files".

Ideas of racism and <a href="Racial%20segregation">segregation</a> also permeate the episode. Sara Gwenllian-Jones in her book "Cult Television" argues that, throughout the entry, "the blacks are equated with aliens," turning them into a certain type of "<a href="Other%20%28philosophy%29">other</a>" that is "never allowed to fit in or feel safe". Gwenllian-Jones highlights the scene in which Dales, late one night on the team bus, wakes to see Exley's sleeping body being reflected as an alien in a window as an example of the racial comparison. She points out that, despite coming to Earth, Exley has moved from one segregated society—that of the aliens—into another. She points out that Exley, after revealing his true form to Dales, says that "my people guard their privacy zealously. They don't want our people to intermingle with your people". This quote expresses a similar sentiment to the segregated mentality of the 1940s.

"The Unnatural" originally aired in the United States on the Fox network on April 25, 1999, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on <a href="Sky%201">Sky 1</a> on July 4, 1999. In the U.S., the episode was watched by 16.88 million viewers, and ranked as the 17th most-watched episode of any series on network TV for the week ending April 25. It earned a <a href="Nielsen%20rating">Nielsen household rating</a> of 10.1, with a 15 share. Nielsen ratings are <a href="audience%20measurement">audience measurement</a> systems that determine the audience size and composition of <a href="broadcast%20programming">television programming</a> in the U.S. This means that roughly 10.1 percent of all television-equipped households, and 15 percent of households watching television, were watching the episode. In the U.K., "The Unnatural" was seen by 870,000 viewers, making it the channel's second-most watched program for that week after an episode of "<a href="The%20Simpsons">The Simpsons</a>". On November 5, 2002, the episode was released on DVD as part of the complete sixth season.

The cast and crew of the show were complimentary towards the finished episode. Carter said, "I think that David, a person who has a very intimate understanding of the show, made the best of his opportunity to tell a very different kind of X-File, and expand the elastic show that it is." Anderson was also pleased, saying, "I was proud of David for writing the script. I thought it was wonderful. He was kind and gentle and respectful and humble, and always tried to do his best."

Initial reviews were positive. Eric Mink from the "<a href="New%20York%20Daily%20News">New York Daily News</a>", in a pre-premiere review, said that it "ingeniously grafts classic "X-Files" story elements and wry, self-mocking wit onto a delightfully fresh premise". The "<a href="Lexington%20Herald-Leader">Lexington Herald-Leader</a>"s review was mostly positive, complimenting the clever writing and noting that the "show was full of visual delights". <a href="Sarah%20Stegall">Sarah Stegall</a> awarded the episode five points out of five, praising Duchovny's analysis of "bigotry from two angles" and his ability to tie the "ongoing "X-Files" conspiracy arc ... into a comic tragedy like this". Stegall also called Duchovny's direction "innovative and interesting", and applauded a transition scene, in which the camera apparently moves through a television screen, as "a wonderful visual metaphor for "The X-Files" itself".

Paula Vitaris from "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" gave the episode a largely positive review, awarding it four stars out of four. Vitaris was complimentary towards the episode's <a href="Exposition%20%28narrative%29">exposition</a>, and wrote, "above all, 'The Unnatural' is about the power of <a href="storytelling">storytelling</a>. We don't really know if Dales' story is true or if it's the liquor-fueled ramblings of a broken-down man, but in the end, this is irrelevant." Melissa Runstrom from "<a href="Michigan%20Daily">Michigan Daily</a>" called it a "charming independent story," but that it "seems to say more about the <a href="human%20condition">human condition</a> than about any extraterrestrial plot". Tom Kessenich, in his book "Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files" wrote, "In his entertaining debut as an "X-Files" writer/director, Duchovny took us down a very familiar path this season: [humor]. But unlike some previous <a href="navigator">navigator</a>s, Duchovny stayed on course, made sure we saw all of the spectacular <a href="landmark">landmark</a>s along the way and, when we reached our final destination, I found I thoroughly enjoyed the ride."

Recent reviews have also applauded the episode. Shearman and Pearson rated the episode five stars out of five, describing it as "[a] delightful ... comic fable". Todd VanDerWerff of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" awarded the episode an "A–" and wrote that it "works because it takes this very silly idea and proceeds to take it seriously." He criticized the program for its "corniness" and its reliance on the "<a href="Magical%20Negro">magical black guy</a>" stereotype, but concluded that "The Unnatural" was successful "because it embraces this side of the show’s profile [that] could do something sweet and lovely and moving". VanDerWerff also complimented Martin's performance, calling his acting "terrific". Cynthia Fuchs from "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" wrote that Duchovny's directing debut was excellent.

Since its debut, the episode has been ranked as one of the best episodes of "The X-Files". Kessenich named it one of the "Top 25 Episode of All Time" of "The X-Files", ranking it at number six. "<a href="The%20Vancouver%20Sun">The Vancouver Sun</a>" listed "The Unnatural" on their list of the best standalone episodes of the show, and said that the story was heartbreaking. In addition, the scene featuring Mulder teaching Scully to play baseball was well received by critics. Shearman and Pearson wrote that it "is especially delightful, and gives this sentimental episode an extra warm glow." Jean Helms of "<a href="The%20Mobile%20Register">The Mobile Register</a>" named it one of the "Top 10 "X-Files" Clips We'd Like to See in the Official Video of Bree Sharp's '<a href="David%20Duchovny%20%28song%29">David Duchovny</a>'". Vitaris called the scene "one of the most charming finales in an "X-Files" episode" due to its "utterly endearing" qualities and its "unspoken <a href="subtext">subtext</a>".

Fanno Creek

Fanno Creek is a <a href="tributary">tributary</a> of the <a href="Tualatin%20River">Tualatin River</a> in the U.S. state of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. Part of the drainage basin of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, its <a href="Drainage%20basin">watershed</a> covers about in <a href="Multnomah%20County%2C%20Oregon">Multnomah</a>, <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Oregon">Washington</a>, and <a href="Clackamas%20County%2C%20Oregon">Clackamas</a> counties, including about within the <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a> city limits.

From its <a href="headwater">headwater</a>s in the <a href="Tualatin%20Mountains">Tualatin Mountains</a> (West Hills) in southwest Portland, the creek flows generally west and south through the cities of Portland, <a href="Beaverton%2C%20Oregon">Beaverton</a>, <a href="Tigard%2C%20Oregon">Tigard</a> and <a href="Durham%2C%20Oregon">Durham</a>, and <a href="unincorporated%20area">unincorporated area</a>s of Washington County. It enters the Tualatin River about above the Tualatin's <a href="confluence">confluence</a> with the <a href="Willamette%20River">Willamette River</a> at <a href="West%20Linn%2C%20Oregon">West Linn</a>.

When settlers of European origin arrived, the <a href="Kalapuya%20people">Kalapuya</a> lived in the area, having displaced the <a href="Multnomah%20people">Multnomahs</a> in <a href="Pre-Columbian%20era">pre-contact</a> times. In 1847, the first settler of European descent, Augustus Fanno, for whom the creek is named, established an onion farm in what became Beaverton. <a href="Augustus%20Fanno%20Farmhouse">Fanno Farmhouse</a>, the restored family home, is a <a href="Century%20Farm">Century Farm</a> on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> and is one of 16 urban parks in a narrow corridor along the creek. 

Although heavily polluted, the creek supports aquatic life, including <a href="coastal%20cutthroat%20trout">coastal cutthroat trout</a> (leopard spotted) in its upper reaches. Watershed councils such as the Fans of Fanno Creek and government agencies have worked to limit pollution and to restore native vegetation in <a href="riparian">riparian</a> zones.

Fanno Creek arises at an elevation of above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> and falls between source and <a href="mouth%20%28river%29">mouth</a> to an elevation of . The main stem begins at about <a href="river%20mile">river mile</a> (RM) 15 or river kilometer (RK) 24 in the <a href="Hillsdale%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Hillsdale</a> neighborhood of southwest Portland, in Multnomah County. The creek flows west along the north side of <a href="Oregon%20Route%2010">Oregon Route 10</a> (the Beaverton–Hillsdale Highway), passing Albert Kelly Park and receiving Ivey Creek and Bridlemile Creek on the <a href="wikt%3Aright%20bank">right</a> before reaching the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS) <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a> at Southwest 56th Avenue from the mouth. Shortly thereafter and in quick succession, it enters <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Oregon">Washington County</a> and the unincorporated community of <a href="Raleigh%20Hills%2C%20Oregon">Raleigh Hills</a>, crosses under Route 10, and receives Sylvan Creek on the right. Here the stream turns south, passing through Bauman Park, where Vermont Creek enters on the <a href="wikt%3Aleft%20bank">left</a> about from the mouth, and then southwest to flow through the Portland Golf Club and Vista Brook Park, where Woods Creek enters on the left. From here it flows west again for about , passing through Fanno Creek Trail Park and entering Beaverton about from the mouth before turning sharply south and flowing under <a href="Oregon%20Route%20217">Oregon Route 217</a> (Beaverton–Tigard Highway).

Fanno Creek then flows roughly parallel to Route 217 for about through Fanno Creek Park and Greenway Park. Near the southern end of Greenway Park, the creek passes under <a href="Oregon%20Route%20210">Oregon Route 210</a> (Scholls Ferry Road), and enters Tigard about from the mouth. In quick succession, Hiteon Creek enters on the right, Ash Creek on the left, and Summer Creek on the right before the creek reaches Woodard Park, goes under <a href="Oregon%20Route%2099W">Oregon Route 99W</a> (Southwest Pacific Highway), and flows through Fanno Park and Bonita Park as well as residential neighborhoods. Between the two parks, Red Rock Creek enters on the left about from the mouth. Slightly downstream of Bonita Park, Ball Creek enters on the left. Fanno Creek then enters Durham, passes a USGS gauging station from the mouth, flows through Durham City Park, and empties into the Tualatin River from its confluence with the Willamette River.

The USGS monitors the flow of Fanno Creek at two stations, one in Durham, from the mouth, and the other in Portland, from the mouth. The average flow of the creek at the Durham station is . This is from a drainage area of , more than 99 percent of the total Fanno Creek watershed. The maximum flow recorded there was on December 3, 2007, and the minimum flow was on September 13, 2001, and September 15, 2009. At the Portland station, the average flow is . This is from a drainage area of or about 7 percent of the total Fanno Creek watershed. The maximum flow recorded there was on February 8, 1996, and the minimum flow was on September 4, 2001.

 Draining , Fanno Creek receives water from Portland's <a href="Tualatin%20Mountains">West Hills</a>, Sexton Mountain in Beaverton, and <a href="Bull%20Mountain%2C%20Oregon">Bull Mountain</a> near Tigard. Nearly all of the watershed is urban. About , roughly 22 percent of the total, lies inside the Portland city limits. The highest elevation in the watershed is at <a href="Council%20Crest%20Park">Council Crest</a> in the West Hills. The peak elevation on Sexton Mountain is , while Bull Mountain rises to . About of streams flow through the watershed, including Ash Creek, Summer Creek, and 12 smaller tributaries. A small part of the drainage basin lies in the city of <a href="Lake%20Oswego%2C%20Oregon">Lake Oswego</a> in <a href="Clackamas%20County%2C%20Oregon">Clackamas County</a>, near the headwaters of Ball Creek, a Fanno Creek tributary.

The slopes at the headwaters of Fanno Creek consist mainly of <a href="Columbia%20River%20Basalt%20Group">Columbia River Basalt</a> exposed in ravines but otherwise covered by up to of wind-deposited silt. Silts and clays are the most common watershed soils, and significant <a href="erosion">erosion</a> is common. About of precipitation, almost all of which is rain and about half of which arrives in November, December, and January, falls on the watershed each year. Although significant flooding occurred in 1977, the watershed has not experienced a <a href="100-year%20flood">100-year flood</a> since the area became urban.

Small watersheds adjacent to the Fanno Creek watershed include those of minor tributaries of the Willamette or Tualatin rivers. <a href="Tryon%20Creek">Tryon Creek</a>, <a href="Balch%20Creek">Balch Creek</a>, and other small streams east of Fanno Creek flow down the eastern flank of the West Hills into the Willamette. To the northwest, Hall Creek, Cedar Mill Creek, and Bronson Creek flow into Beaverton Creek, a tributary of Rock Creek, which empties into the Tualatin River at the larger stream's RM 38.4 (RK 61.8), about upriver from the mouth of Fanno Creek.

In 2015, Portland's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) began issuing annual "report cards" for watersheds or fractions thereof that lie within the city. BES assigns grades for each of four categories: hydrology, water quality, habitat, and fish and wildlife. Hydrology grades depend on the amount of pavement and other <a href="impervious%20surface">impervious surface</a>s in the watershed and the degree to which its streams flow freely, not dammed or diverted. Water-quality grades are based on measurements of <a href="Oxygen%20saturation">dissolved oxygen</a>, "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E-coli</a>" bacteria, temperature, <a href="suspended%20solid">suspended solid</a>s, and substances such as mercury and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>. Habitat ranking depends on the condition of stream banks and floodplains, <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a>s, <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">tree canopies</a>, and other variables. The fish and wildlife assessment includes birds, fish, and <a href="Invertebrate">macroinvertebrate</a>s. In 2015, the BES grades for the Fanno Creek watershed fraction within Portland are hydrology, C; water quality, C+; habitat, B−, and fish and wildlife, D−.

The previous people of the Fanno Creek watershed were the Atfalati or Tualaty tribe of the <a href="Kalapuya%20people">Kalapuya</a>, said to have displaced even earlier inhabitants, the <a href="Multnomah%20people">Multnomahs</a>, prior to European contact. The valleys of the Willamette River and its major tributaries such as the Tualatin River consisted of open grassland maintained by annual burning, with scattered groves of trees along the rivers and creeks. The Kalapuya moved from place to place in good weather to fish, to hunt small animals, birds, waterfowl, deer, and elk, and to gather nuts, seeds, roots, and berries. Important foods included <a href="Camassia">camas</a> and <a href="Sagittaria">wapato</a>. In addition to fishing for eels, suckers, and trout, the Atfalati traded for salmon from <a href="Chinookan">Chinookan</a> tribes near <a href="Willamette%20Falls">Willamette Falls</a>. During the winter, the Kalapuya lived in longhouses in settled villages. Their population was greatly reduced after contact in the late 18th century with Europeans, who carried <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, <a href="measles">measles</a>, and other diseases. Added pressure came from white settlers who seized and fenced native land, regarded it as private property, and sometimes punished natives for trespassing. Of the original population of 1,000 to 2,000 Atfalati reported in 1780, only 65 remained in 1851. In 1855, the U.S. government sent the survivors to the <a href="Grand%20Ronde%20Community">Grande Ronde</a> reservation further west.

Fanno Creek is named after Augustus Fanno, the first European American settler along the creek. In 1847, he started an onion farm on a <a href="Donation%20Land%20Claim%20Act">donation land claim</a> in what later became part of Beaverton. Other 19th century newcomers along the creek engaged mainly in logging, farming, and dairy farming until the <a href="Southern%20Pacific%20Railroad">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> and the <a href="Oregon%20Electric%20Railway">Oregon Electric Railway</a> lines made the watershed more accessible for urban development around the turn of the 20th century. The Oregon Electric, a system built between 1903 and 1915, ran between downtown Portland and <a href="Garden%20Home-Whitford%2C%20Oregon">Garden Home</a> in the Fanno Creek watershed, where it split into branches leading to <a href="Salem%2C%20Oregon">Salem</a> and <a href="Forest%20Grove%2C%20Oregon">Forest Grove</a>. The Southern Pacific began running electric passenger trains, known as the <a href="Red%20Electric">Red Electric</a>, in the watershed in 1914. The company that eventually became <a href="Portland%20General%20Electric">Portland General Electric</a> installed electric service in the area, and by 1915 the population of the upper Fanno Creek neighborhoods of <a href="Multnomah%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Multnomah</a>, <a href="Maplewood%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Maplewood</a>, Hillsdale, and <a href="West%20Portland%20Park%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">West Portland Park</a> had grown to 2,000.

The highways and railroads serve a population that increased most dramatically in the second half of the 20th century. When Beaverton was incorporated as a city in 1893, it had a population of 400. By 2010, the number had soared to 94,000, although not all of them lived in the watershed. Tigard, which did not exist as a city until 1961, grew to 49,000 by the year 2013, all in the watershed. Fanno Creek, which had few people living near it until 1850, "is surrounded by the most populous region in Oregon".

Although the <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a> (DEQ) rated the average water quality of Fanno Creek as "very poor" between 1986 and 1995, it also noted steady improvement over that span. Historically, Fanno Creek has been polluted by urban and industrial sources, small sewage treatment plants, ineffective septic systems, farming and grazing operations, and illegal dumping. Health and environmental concerns led to the closing of substandard wastewater treatment plants in the 1970s, and urban development reduced the number of farms and farm animals along the creek. A ban in 1991 on <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> detergents, increased connection to municipal sewers, stormwater management, and greater public awareness helped to reduce urban pollution not coming from <a href="Point%20source%20pollution">point sources</a>, and water quality improved.

DEQ monitors Fanno Creek at Bonita Road in Tigard, at about from the mouth. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for Fanno Creek between 1986 and 1995 was 55 but steadily improved to 65, or "poor", by the end of the period. By comparison, the average in the nearby Willamette River at the Hawthorne Bridge in downtown Portland was 74 during the same years. Measurements of water quality at the Tigard site during the years covered by the DEQ report showed high concentrations of phosphates, <a href="fecal%20coliforms">fecal coliform bacteria</a>, and suspended solids, and a high <a href="biochemical%20oxygen%20demand">biochemical oxygen demand</a>. Moderately high concentrations of <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> and <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a> nitrogen occurred during high flows during fall, winter, and spring. High temperatures and low dissolved oxygen concentration in the summer were evidence of <a href="eutrophication">eutrophication</a>.

The high fraction of impervious surfaces in the watershed makes it difficult to improve water quality in the creek. The Portland Bureau of Environmental Services estimates that one-third of the surface area of the watershed that lies within its jurisdiction is impervious. All of the roughly of the surface of Tigard, much of it impervious, drains into Fanno Creek. The watershed watch coordinator for Tualatin Riverkeepers, a volunteer group, was quoted in a July 2008 newspaper article saying that "the biggest impact to Fanno Creek is the impervious area". To slow run-off, reduce erosion, and keep pollutants out of streams, watershed councils, neighborhood groups, and government agencies have been planting native species of vegetation at selected sites throughout the watershed.

About 100 bird species, several kinds of mammals, and a few fish species live in the watershed. Mammals commonly seen include <a href="North%20American%20beaver">beaver</a>, <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>, <a href="opossum">opossum</a>, <a href="spotted%20skunk">spotted skunk</a>, <a href="Douglas%20squirrel">Douglas squirrel</a>, and <a href="Townsend%27s%20chipmunk">Townsend's chipmunk</a>; <a href="black-tail%20deer">black-tail deer</a> and <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s are more rare. Fanno Creek supports non-migrating <a href="coastal%20cutthroat%20trout">coastal cutthroat trout</a> that <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawn</a> in the fast-flowing, gravel-bottomed <a href="headwater">headwater</a>s and grow to as long as . Other fish species found in the creek include <a href="sculpin">sculpin</a>s, <a href="mosquitofish">mosquitofish</a> and <a href="eel">eel</a>.

Beavers, rodents weighing up to , have sometimes caused problems along Fanno Creek. In 2014 and 2015, a growing population of beavers gnawed down trees and dammed the creek in Greenway Park in Beaverton. Rising waters have covered one of the side trails in the park, which has been gated and closed. During heavy rains, water from the beaver pond sometimes covers the main trail. Park officials are considering a variety of options, including re-routing the trails, building a boardwalk over the water, or removing the beaver dams.

 The creek begins in the <a href="Coast%20Range%20%28EPA%20ecoregion%29">Coast Range ecoregion</a> designated by the U.S. <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and flows thereafter through the <a href="Willamette%20Valley%20%28ecoregion%29">Willamette Valley ecoregion</a>. The narrow <a href="riparian">riparian</a> corridors along streams in the watershed commonly include native species such as <a href="Thuja%20plicata">western redcedar</a>, <a href="Douglas%20fir">Douglas fir</a>, <a href="Acer%20circinatum">vine maple</a>, and <a href="Polystichum%20munitum">sword fern</a> as well as invasive species like <a href="Hedera%20helix">English ivy</a>. Many <a href="red%20alder">red alder</a> and <a href="Acer%20macrophyllum">big leaf maple</a> grow in the watershed, and shrubs include <a href="Vaccinium%20parvifolium">red huckleberry</a>, <a href="Oregon-grape">Oregon-grape</a>, <a href="Sambucus">elderberry</a>, <a href="Rosa%20gymnocarpa">wood rose</a>, and <a href="Rubus%20spectabilis">salmonberry</a>. A restoration project in Tigard along the main stem has removed invasive plants such as <a href="reed%20canary%20grass">reed canary grass</a> and <a href="Rubus%20armeniacus">Himalayan blackberry</a> and replaced them with native species. A project in Beaverton is replacing turf and degraded habitat along the creek with native shrubs and trees such as <a href="Garry%20Oak">Oregon white oak</a>.

The Tualatin Riverkeepers, a nonprofit watershed council based in Tigard; Clean Water Services, a public utility that protects water resources in the Tualatin River watershed, and the <a href="Tualatin%20Hills%20Park%20%26amp%3B%20Recreation%20District">Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District</a> (THPRD) have formed the Tualatin Basin Invasive Species Working Group to identify and eradicate invasive plants that displace native plants, cause erosion, and diminish water quality. The five plants considered most threatening are <a href="Japanese%20knotweed">Japanese knotweed</a>, <a href="Centaurea">meadow knapweed</a>, <a href="Giant%20Hogweed">giant hogweed</a>, <a href="Garlic%20Mustard">garlic mustard</a> and <a href="Lythrum%20salicaria">purple loosestrife</a>. The Oregon Department of Agriculture and the city of Tigard are working to eradicate giant hogweed from lower Fanno Creek.

Fanno Creek passes through or near 16 parks in several jurisdictions. <a href="Portland%20Parks%20%26amp%3B%20Recreation">Portland Parks & Recreation</a> manages three: Hillsdale Park, with picnic tables and a <a href="dog%20park">dog park</a> near the headwaters; Albert Kelly Park, with unpaved paths, picnic tables, play areas, and <a href="Wi-Fi">Wi-Fi</a> north of the creek about from the mouth, and the Fanno Creek Natural Area, north of the creek about from the mouth.

The Tualatin Hills Park & Recreation District (THPRD) manages seven Fanno Creek parks in Beaverton and unincorporated Washington County. The district, tax-supported and governed by an elected board, is the largest special park and recreation district in Oregon. The seven include Bauman Park, about at about from the mouth. Slightly downstream from Bauman Park are Vista Brook Park, about with trails including one that is <a href="Accessibility">accessible</a> to people with physical handicaps, a playground, and courts for basketball and tennis, and Fanno Creek Trail, about , with picnic tables and trails. Other THPRD parks lie along Fanno Creek from roughly to roughly from the mouth. These are Fanno Creek Park, about , with trails including one accessible to people with handicaps; Fanno Farmhouse, about with an accessible trail and picnic tables as well as the Fanno family home, restored by THPRD and listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>; Greenway Park, about with trails including an accessible trail, picnic tables, a playground, and sports fields, and Koll Center Wetlands, about with wildlife.

The five Fanno Creek parks managed by the city of Tigard include Englewood Park, with play structures and trails, including a segment of the Fanno Creek Trail; Woodard Park, of big trees, trails, and play structures; Bonita Park, including a playground and picnic areas; Dirksen Nature Park, of forest, wetlands, and open space, and Fanno Creek Park, a natural area in downtown Tigard. About 20 percent of the small city of Durham is parkland. Surrounded by the larger cities of Tigard and <a href="Tualatin%2C%20Oregon">Tualatin</a>, the city covers occupied by about 1,400 people. Durham City Park, at the confluence of Fanno Creek and the Tualatin River, consists of of heavily wooded <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a> with paved trails, children's play areas, and a picnic shelter.

Sections of trail along the main stem of Fanno Creek form part of a planned Fanno Creek Greenway Trail linking <a href="Willamette%20Park">Willamette Park</a> on the Willamette River in southwest Portland to the confluence of the creek with the Tualatin River in Durham. The trail, for pedestrians and bicyclists, is accessible to people with disabilities. Several unfinished segments remained as of 2013.

Marojejy National Park

Marojejy National Park is a <a href="national%20park">national park</a> in the <a href="Sava%20Region">Sava Region</a> of northeastern <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. It covers and is centered on the <a href="Marojejy%20Massif">Marojejy Massif</a>, a mountain chain that rises to an elevation of . Access to the area around the <a href="massif">massif</a> was restricted to research scientists when the site was set aside as a strict <a href="nature%20reserve">nature reserve</a> in 1952. In 1998, it was opened to the public when it was converted into a national park. It became part of the <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> known as the <a href="Rainforests%20of%20the%20Atsinanana">Rainforests of the Atsinanana</a> in 2007. Despite its rugged terrain, <a href="poaching">poaching</a> and <a href="Selection%20cutting">selective logging</a> are still persistent problems, particularly since the start of the <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">2009 political crisis in Madagascar</a>. Mining, <a href="slash-and-burn">slash-and-burn</a> agriculture, and wood collection also pose threats to the park and its wildlife.

The wide range of elevations and rugged topography of the massif create diverse habitats that transition quickly with changes in altitude. Warm, dense <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> can be found at lower elevations, followed by shorter forests at higher elevations, followed still by <a href="cloud%20forest">cloud forest</a>, and topped near the peaks with the only remaining undisturbed mountain <a href="Shrubland">scrub</a> in Madagascar. Better growing conditions for plants can be found on the eastern side of the mountains, which receives more rain than the western side. This habitat diversity lends itself to high levels of <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. At least 118 species of bird, 148 species of reptile and amphibian, and 11 species of <a href="lemur">lemur</a> are known to occur within Marojejy National Park. One of the lemurs, the <a href="silky%20sifaka">silky sifaka</a> ("Propithecus candidus") is listed among "<a href="The%20World%27s%2025%20Most%20Endangered%20Primates">The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates</a>". The <a href="helmet%20vanga">helmet vanga</a> ("Euryceros prevostii") is considered the iconic bird species of the park.

One path leads from the entrance of the park to the summit. There are three camps along the route: Camp Mantella at in elevation in lowland rainforest, Camp Marojejia at at the transition between lowland and montane rain forest, and Camp Simpona at in the middle of the montane rainforest. Camp Simpona acts as a <a href="Mountaineering%23Base%20Camp">base camp</a> for the trek to the summit, a route that stretches and can take up to four or five hours to traverse.

Marojejy National Park is located in the northeast of Madagascar between the towns of <a href="Andapa">Andapa</a> and <a href="Sambava">Sambava</a> and extends approximately from east to west and from north to south. It is centered on the chain of mountains known as <a href="Marojejy%20Massif">Marojejy Massif</a>. Despite a scientific survey of some of the other mountains in the region by the 1929 <a href="Mission%20Zoologique%20Franco-Anglo-Am%C3%A9ricaine">Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Américaine</a>, Marojejy was not surveyed until 1937 when L.-J. Arragon of the Service Géographique de Madagascar ascended <a href="Marojejy%20Est">Marojejy Est</a>. Arragon did not conduct any field research during his visit. The massif was not geologically described until after the French <a href="Botany">botanist</a> <a href="Henri%20Jean%20Humbert">Henri Jean Humbert</a> from the <a href="Mus%C3%A9um%20national%20d%27histoire%20naturelle">National Museum of Natural History in Paris</a> explored the mountains in 1948. Humbert had previously explored numerous mountain ranges in continental Africa before going to Marojejy. Between November 1948 and November 1950, he spent five months collecting 4,039 dried plant (<a href="herbarium">herbarium</a>) specimens for study. After several expeditions, he published the book "A Marvel of Nature" in 1955, in which he claimed the <a href="massif">massif</a> was the most impressive range in all of Madagascar because of its size, floral diversity, and pristine natural state.

Marojejy was set aside as one of Madagascar's strict nature reserves in 1952 largely due to Humbert's enthusiasm and support. Under this protection, only research scientists were permitted to visit the site. In 1998, Marojejy was converted into a national park and thus became open to visitors.

Originally seen as a transition zone between the eastern rainforests and the <a href="Central%20Highlands%20%28Madagascar%29">central highlands</a>, Marojejy is now recognized as having its own unique features, with some of the richest <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> on the island. Several studies from the early 1970s through the 1990s surveyed the mountain ecosystems and inventoried the flora and fauna. In 2007, Marojejy was listed as a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> as part of the <a href="Rainforests%20of%20the%20Atsinanana">Rainforests of the Atsinanana</a>. Due to <a href="Illegal%20logging%20in%20Madagascar">illegal logging</a> and trafficking of valuable hardwoods, and especially after the <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">2009 political crisis in Madagascar</a>, the Rainforests of the Atsinanana was added to the <a href="list%20of%20World%20Heritage%20in%20Danger">list of World Heritage in Danger</a> in 2010.

The boundaries of Marojejy National Park were originally established by approximation when the park was established in 1952. With a second decree (no. 66-242) from the <a href="Politics%20of%20Madagascar">government of Madagascar</a> in 1966, the park's status as a strict nature reserve was reaffirmed, and its boundaries were marked by 89 points. From these markers, the size of the park was estimated at . At the time, two families were living within the park boundaries, which initially was permitted under the conditions that they did not extend their cultivated land into the park or allow others to join them. The families were later expelled for violating these conditions. Many families from the local communities did not understand why such a large area so rich in resources and necessary for their survival was forbidden to them, and between the late 1980s and 1993, they stopped honoring the status of the park. They began clearing the outer edges of the reserve to start plantations of <a href="vanilla">vanilla</a> and <a href="coffee">coffee</a>. In 1993, the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> (WWF) and the Service des Eaux et Forêts renewed conservation efforts in the area, evicted the people living inside the reserve, and renegotiated the borders with the local community, based on the 1966 decree. Trails and posts were then used to clearly mark the edges of the reserve. In the years following these events, many communities living near the borders of the park have become more involved in forest surveillance, and deforestation has fallen off sharply to only a few <a href="hectare">hectare</a>s a year.

In 1998, the WWF requested that the government of Madagascar relax the restrictions on the reserve to allow for <a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a>, the revenue from which could benefit the people living in the periphery of the park. With a decree (no. 98-375) in May 1998, the reserve became a national park. The boundaries were renegotiated, particularly in the western and northwestern regions of the park, and this time using clear natural landmarks, such as ridge crests, as markers. The size of the park was adjusted to , with some western communities gaining access to untouched forest zones while communities in the northwest lost agricultural land. Approximately had been illegally cleared within the park and are still part of the park. There are now 91 boundary markers and the boundaries are <a href="georeference">georeference</a>d. Intermediate boundary markers are placed between existing markers to demarcate the edges of the park during disputes with the local community.

During October 2005, reports surfaced showing that boundary markers were being moved with the approval of park employees and that areas within the park were being cleared for agriculture. In January 2006, the Park Logistics Coordinator was fired for moving boundary markers while employed as the Park Conservation Agent and selling the of park land to a local farmer for 2 million <a href="Malagasy%20franc">Malagasy franc</a>s (~). In 2010, a new demarcation adjusted the size the park down to .

Marojejy National Park covers and protects almost the entire massif, which ranges in elevation from at the summit. The massif is part of a <a href="Mountain%20range">mountain chain</a> that stretches from <a href="Tsaratanana">Tsaratanana</a> in the northwest to the <a href="Masoala%20Peninsula">Masoala Peninsula</a> in the south. The crests of the massif form an east–west line with a series of distinct peaks along its irregular structure, which consists of parallel or divergent crest lines broken apart by steep and irregular slopes. Rising over as little as , the Marojejy Massif has some of the most precipitous terrain in Madagascar. As a result of this sharp rise in elevation and rugged <a href="topography">topography</a>, it has a variety of <a href="microclimate">microclimate</a>s and a visible change in habitat, making it one of the few places in the world where <a href="Cloud%20forest">cloud-covered rainforest</a> rapidly transitions to high mountain shrubland over a distance that can be covered on foot. Also due to the rugged topography, the vegetative mosaic varies between the crests and slopes of the massif, even at the same elevations. For example, crests and adjoining slopes often have less than 20% of their flowering plant species in common.

Temperatures in the region are fairly constant, with both the daily temperature range and the seasonal range varying only slightly. February is the hottest month, averaging , while August is the coolest, averaging . Climbing the peaks, temperature decreases by 1 °C per 200 m of increased altitude (1 °F per 200/1.8/0.3048round-1 ft), and temperatures on the summit decline to in July. The <a href="relative%20humidity">relative humidity</a> for the region hovers around 87% throughout most of the year, although it rises to 97% between March and April. Rain falls every month on the southern side of the mountain, with the region receiving at least of rain annually, making it one of the wettest areas in Madagascar. The northern side of the mountain is more tropical, with a 6-month dry season, and receives about of rain per year. The general region receives the most rainfall during the warm season, from November through April, when heavy rain and occasional <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>s are delivered from the northwest by <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>s. During the cooler season, between May and October, lighter rains are delivered by winds from the southeast.
Both temperature and rainfall vary significantly by location within the park. Lower temperatures are found at higher elevations, and the eastern slopes of the massif receive the most of the rainfall, since the western slopes lie in the <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a> of the mountain and consequently experience a prolonged dry period. The tops of the ridges experience strong winds and offer poor soil conditions. The effect can be seen in the plant life and their growth rates. The wide range in elevations and the rugged topography also play a crucial role in creation of the varied habitats distributed across the mountain slopes by affecting <a href="Temperature">air temperature</a>, fluctuations in temperature, and humidity levels. The interplay between these factors impacts the growth and development of plants, which form the foundation of the ecosystem. The result is an extremely varied and unevenly distributed forest that covers 90% of the park.

The mountains of both Marojejy and nearby <a href="Anjanaharibe-Sud%20Reserve">Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve</a> feed several <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a>s, including the <a href="Lokoho%20River">Lokoho River</a>, which is sourced from the western and southern slopes of Marojejy, and the <a href="Androranga%20River">Androranga River</a>, which originates from the northern slopes of Marojejy. Both rivers travel towards Sambava and drain into the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. Marojejy is connected to the Anjanaharibe-Sud Special Reserve by the <a href="Betaolana%20corridor">Betaolana corridor</a>, a narrow mid-elevation strip of forest extending west and slightly south.

As with the rest of Madagascar, the rocks of Marojejy National Park were once part of the <a href="supercontinent">supercontinent</a> of <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>, which began to break up 160 million years ago to form the southern continents. However, the <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> of Marojejy formed over 500 million years ago during the <a href="Precambrian">Precambrian</a> beneath an ancient mountain range that has since eroded away completely. The bedrock is composed mostly of <a href="Granite">granitic</a> rocks, although it also contains a significant amount of <a href="gneiss">gneiss</a>, a <a href="Ore">high-grade</a> <a href="metamorphic%20rock">metamorphic rock</a> that formed under high pressure and temperature deep beneath the ancient mountain range. In places where heat and pressure were highest, the rock melted completely and eventually recrystallized at depth as granite, an <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a>. Later, <a href="Vein%20%28geology%29">veins</a> of <a href="quartz">quartz</a> formed in cracks in the bedrock; these are the source of the quartz and <a href="amethyst">amethyst</a> crystals mined in the region today. In more recent geological times, the area's abundant <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a> formed when quartz-rich sands were deposited on the bedrock, and were then buried and recrystallized (<a href="Metamorphism">metamorphosed</a>). The <a href="soil%20pH">soil pH</a> is expected to be acidic to neutral.

The highest, most rugged peaks of Marojejy owe their form to the gneiss from which they are made. The gneiss consists of alternating bands of light and dark colored minerals. The light minerals, consisting mostly of quartz and <a href="feldspar">feldspar</a>, are the hardest and most resistant, whereas the dark minerals, which are mostly <a href="biotite">biotite mica</a> and <a href="hornblende">hornblende</a>, are softer and weather out faster. This layered composition, in combination with the north-facing 45-degree angle at which the rocks are tilted, accounts for the asymmetric character of the peaks. The northern slopes dip moderately, while the southern faces are typically near-vertical cliffs where the rocks fractured counter to the layered grain. The cliff named Ambatotsondrona, with its sheer, south-facing rock wall, is an example.

Marojejy National Park is noted for its rich biodiversity, which can appeal to both scientist and ecotourist. There are a wide range of habitats within the park, and many of its plants and animals are <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to the area. Scientific expeditions regularly discover species that are either not previously documented in Marojejy, or in some cases, completely new to science. Some new species are highly <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>. In the case of many large groups, such as <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, very little is known and much remains to be discovered.

The vegetation of Marojejy National Park is extremely diverse due to the various microclimates. The microclimates also affect plant growth rates, with the wet eastern slopes showing faster plant growth, the dry western slopes exhibiting slower plant growth, and the plants on the ridge tops hindered by high winds and poor soils. More than 2,000  species of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s (angiosperms) have been discovered at the park so far. At least four plant <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">families</a> are found at all elevations: <a href="Clusiaceae">Clusiaceae</a> and <a href="Poaceae">Poaceae</a> are generally common, while <a href="Myrsinaceae">Myrsinaceae</a> and <a href="Elaeocarpaceae">Elaeocarpaceae</a> are rare.

There are four basic types of forest found at Marojejy:


Of the many plant species found in Marojejy, 35 are palms, several of which are <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> and have extremely low populations. Only three of these palm species can be found outside of Madagascar, and seven can only be found at Marojejy. More than 275 fern species are present in the rainforests of the massif, 18 of which are tree ferns and seven are found only at Marojejy. Many of these fern species are very rare and have highly restricted distributions.

Marojejy also contains several types of rare <a href="rosewood">rosewood</a> and palisandre (genus "<a href="Dalbergia">Dalbergia</a>"), all of which are endemic to Madagascar. Rosewood, or "andramena" in Malagasy, is a type of hardwood with a lustrous deep red color, while palisandre, such as "<a href="Dalbergia%20madagascariensis">Dalbergia madagascariensis</a>", lacks the red color. Of the three species of "Dalbergia" found in Marojejy, "D. madagascariensis" and "<a href="Dalbergia%20baronii">D. baronii</a>" are listed as "<a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>, while "<a href="Dalbergia%20louvelii">D. louvelii</a>" is listed as "<a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>." The park has few large specimens of the former two due to <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a>, and specimens are rarely found in the surrounding surrounding the park. The latter, "D. louvelii", is not found outside of the park.

Marojejy National Park is best known for its two iconic species, the <a href="helmet%20vanga">helmet vanga</a> ("Euryceros prevostii") and the critically endangered <a href="silky%20sifaka">silky sifaka</a> or "simpona" ("Propithecus candidus"). The silky sifaka has been listed as one of "<a href="The%20World%27s%2025%20Most%20Endangered%20Primates">The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates</a>" since the inception of the list in 2000. According to estimates, fewer than 1,000 individuals of this species remain, and none exist in captivity.

The wealth of species of well-known groups of animals demonstrates the depth of the biodiversity found at Marojejy National Park. For example, 75 of the 118 species of <a href="bird">bird</a>s (64%) found in or around Marojejy are forest-dwelling birds, a total that surpasses any other mountain site in Madagascar. All of these forest-dependent bird species are endemic to Madagascar and utilize the forest for some portion of their life-cycle. One of these birds is the <a href="Madagascar%20serpent-eagle">Madagascar serpent-eagle</a> ("Eutriorchis astur"), which prior to being reported in 1990, had not been seen by <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a>s since 1932.

In addition to the silky sifaka, Marojejy is home to 10 other species of <a href="lemur">lemur</a>, several of which are also endangered due mainly to <a href="habitat%20loss">habitat loss</a>. The nocturnal <a href="aye-aye">aye-aye</a> has only been seen once at the park, although one old nest and traces of its feeding have been found at various elevations. Other mammals include at least 15 species of <a href="Tenrecidae">tenrec</a>, seven species of native <a href="rodent">rodent</a>, the <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a> ("Cryptoprocta ferox"), and the <a href="Madagascar%20sucker-footed%20bat">Madagascar sucker-footed bat</a> ("Myzopoda aurita")

The <a href="reptile">reptile</a> and <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a> diversity at Marojejy is also rich, higher than any other protected area in Madagascar. A total of 148 species have been inventoried, and 17 of these are found only in Marojejy, including "<a href="Brookesia%20karchei">Brookesia karchei</a>" and "<a href="Chamaeleo%20peyrieresi">Chamaeleo peyrieresi</a>", two species of several <a href="chameleon">chameleon</a>s found there. The <a href="panther%20chameleon">panther chameleon</a> ("Furcifer pardalis"), leaf-tailed geckos (genus "<a href="Uroplatus">Uroplatus</a>"), and many species of frogs are also reported from this locality. Invertebrates include large <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s, <a href="spider">spider</a>s, and an abundance of small <a href="leech">leech</a>es.

Marojejy National Park is open all year, with <a href="Bradt%20Travel%20Guides">Bradt Travel Guides</a> recommending April to May and September to December as the best times to visit due to less rainfall. The park is one of the only <a href="List%20of%20national%20parks%20of%20Madagascar">national parks in Madagascar</a> offering wooden chalets or bungalows, in addition to having a kitchen and toilet facilities at each of its three main camps inside a primary rainforest. The housing provides beds and basic bedding, while the kitchen and eating areas are covered and offer basic cooking utensils. These three camps have basic tent sites for campers. Tent campsites are also offered outside the park, while the only other overnight accommodations outside the park are in Andapa and Sambava.

Before beginning the hike, most tourists fly into the Sambava airport and spend a night in town. However, to properly understand local culture, some tourists may instead wish to house in Manantenina. This can shed light into vanilla, coffee, and rice production, in addition to meeting locals and trying street food. Only one housing option, however, is available at the moment for non-Malagasy speakers through <a href="https%3A//www.airbnb.com/rooms/26649475">AirBnb</a>. If staying with <a href="https%3A//www.airbnb.com/rooms/26649475">Nadege Rinot</a>, he can easily organize the entire hike on your behalf.

If instead you organize your own trip, payment of the entrance fees, renting of the facilities, and hiring of guides, cooks, and porters are handled at either the park headquarters in Andapa or the Park Visitor Center in Manantenina, which is along the main Andapa-Sambava road, from Sambava and from Andapa. The park has a single trail that leads from the information center in Manantenina to the highest peak. The path into the rain forest is divided into three treks that vary in length and lead to each of the three main camps, each of which is situated at different altitudes and offer views of their own distinctive flora and fauna.
The first section of the path, known as the Mantella Trek, takes visitors just inside the park entrance, and leads to a picnic area after the first . The first camp, Camp Mantella, is further along the path. The camp is in the lowland rain forest above the Manantenina River at an elevation of . The camp is from the <a href="Humbert%20Falls">Humbert waterfalls</a>, and offers opportunities to see lemurs, such as the <a href="northern%20bamboo%20lemur">northern bamboo lemur</a> ("Hapalemur occidentalis"); many species of bird, such as the helmet vanga; as well as a variety of amphibians and reptiles, such as leaf-tailed geckos, leaf chameleons (genus "<a href="Brookesia">Brookesia</a>"), and many types of frogs.

The next along the path is known as the Simpona Trek; the name comes from the <a href="Malagasy%20language">Malagasy</a> name for the silky sifaka, which is found in the area. The trail leads to Camp Marojejia, located at an elevation of at the transition between lowland and montane rain forest. The camp sits on a mountainside, and its dining area overlooks a forested outcrop of rock, which includes the peak named Ambatotsondrona, or "Leaning Rock". This camp is reported to be the best location for spotting the silky sifaka, although the staff recommend that visitors hire a specialist tracker to aid in the search.

The Marojejy Summit Trek continues up the mountain for another to Camp Simpona, which is in the middle of the moist montane forest at an elevation of . There is a ridge with a viewing platform built on it near the camp. Despite the stunted height of the trees in this high-altitude region, silky sifakas can occasionally be spotted from the bungalows. The <a href="rufous-headed%20ground-roller">rufous-headed ground-roller</a> ("Atelornis crossleyi") and <a href="yellow-bellied%20sunbird-asity">yellow-bellied sunbird-asity</a> ("Neodrepanis hypoxantha") can be seen here, and a nearby stream teems with a diverse collection of frog species. Camp Simpona also serves as a basecamp for the steep climb to the summit of Marojejy Massif, one of Madagascar's highest but most accessible peaks. The climb to the peak stretches and takes four to five hours.

The Andapa Basin, surrounded by the high, rugged mountains of Marojejy and Anjanaharibe-Sud, was extremely remote and difficult to access until relatively recently. As a consequence, the area was not permanently settled until the mid-1800s, when refugees fled the <a href="Merina%20Kingdom">Merina Kingdom</a>. Nearly half a century later, another wave of refugees settled in the area, this time fleeing from French colonists. The population in the region, however, remained relatively small, despite a last small wave of immigration following <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> when people from <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> came to the region to grow vanilla. The population did not increase noticeably until the early 1970s when construction of the Andapa–Sambava road was completed, connecting the region to the coast. This improved transportation route encouraged agricultural development and spawned another wave of immigration. Over the next 30 years, it was estimated that the population tripled, with more than 100,000 people living in the region by 2003. With 37 villages surrounding Marojejy, the population density is one of the highest in Madagascar and it continues to grow. The dominant <a href="Ethnic%20groups%20of%20Madagascar">ethnic groups</a> in the region are the <a href="Tsimihety">Tsimihety</a> (the first settlers) and the <a href="Betsimisaraka%20people">Betsimisaraka</a>, although other groups from the southern part of the island have also established themselves.
The local people have traditionally utilized material from the forest, whether for use in their <a href="Architecture%20of%20Madagascar">architecture</a>, to make <a href="pirogue">pirogue</a>s (dugout canoes), to provide fiber for weaving, to provide firewood, to gather leaves for <a href="traditional%20medicine">traditional medicine</a>, or to flavor their drinks. Most of the residents are <a href="Subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence rice farmers</a> who cultivate irrigated <a href="Paddy%20field">paddies</a> in valleys or who plant on hillsides that have been cleared and burned (<a href="slash%20and%20burn">slash and burn</a> agriculture, known locally as "tavy"). The swamps which formerly covered vast areas of Andapa Basin have been converted to rice paddies which are intensively cultivated; however the Tsimihety traditionally practice slash and burn techniques on the hillsides in preference to irrigated rice fields. Coffee was an important cash crop before market prices fell in the 1970s, but vanilla remains an important crop for the area. Until the mid-2000s, vanilla prices were high, but they have since fallen off significantly. The crash of vanilla prices, along with a <a href="Human%20overpopulation">rapidly growing population</a> and steady decrease in cultivatable land, has resulted in widespread and extreme <a href="poverty">poverty</a>. Between January and April, before the main rice harvest, many people in the region do not receive enough food to eat. The <a href="Sava%20Region">Sava Region</a>, which includes Marojejy, is the poorest region in Madagascar, and in 2011, continued <a href="2007%E2%80%932008%20world%20food%20price%20crisis">rises in global food prices</a>—particularly that of imported rice—has made obtaining food more difficult for rural families.

Not only have international environmental organizations (such as <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a>, <a href="Wildlife%20Conservation%20Society">Wildlife Conservation Society</a>, <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a>, and <a href="Care%20International">Care International</a>) established programs to help local residents, many local people work to improve their situation through environmental and health education programs. An increase in <a href="sustainable%20agriculture">sustainable agriculture</a>, <a href="silviculture">silviculture</a>, conservation awareness, and improved education and health care have also furthered the goal of protecting the environment and promoting livelihoods centered on the remaining forest. Limited and responsible ecotourism is also seen as a long-term alternative to continued <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>.
The protections normally afforded to <a href="national%20park">national park</a>s have not halted the degradations of Marojejy National Park. The hunting of lemurs, including the silky sifaka, is a persistent problem, as is the harvesting of precious hardwoods, such as rosewood and palissandre. Semi-precious gemstones, such as <a href="amethyst">amethyst</a>, are still mined within the boundaries of the park, while slash and burn agriculture and wood collection for firewood and construction continue to cause the periphery to recede. These pressures are growing strong as the population in the region continues to increase. In 2003, approximately 200,000 people lived within of the park, 80% of whom were farmers that were still dependent upon the forest for agricultural land and various products, such as honey, firewood, and plant fibers, as well as tree bark from plants of the family <a href="Rutaceae">Rutaceae</a> (primarily genus "<a href="Evodia">Evodia</a>") used to ferment "betsabetsa", a local sugarcane spirit. Additionally, inappropriate use of the park or excessive visitation by guests could also pose a threat to the fragile high-altitude scrub.

Madagascar's northeastern rain forests are severely threatened by <a href="illegal%20logging">illegal logging</a> of precious hardwood, which not only dries out the forest (making it susceptible to fire), introduces <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>, <a href="Habitat%20destruction">degrades habitat</a>, and reduces <a href="genetic%20diversity">genetic diversity</a>, but also violates local taboos and traditions. Additional species, such as species of "<a href="Dombeya">Dombeya</a>", are typically cut to make rafts for floating the heavier hardwoods down rivers and out of the parks. Rosewood trees are cut into multiple logs for easier transport, and five or more high-buoyancy trees are cut per hardwood log. To tie the rafts together, the loggers cut thousands of <a href="liana">liana</a>s or vines, which are used by 75% of the forest fauna as avenues for moving around in the canopy. The logging activities are labor-intensive and dangerous. The labor employs the impoverished local population, but the officials who facilitate the process primarily benefit.
In 2005, illegal logging of rosewood was reported to have occurred more than 20 times. In 2007 at the port cities of <a href="Voh%C3%A9mar">Vohémar</a>, <a href="Antalaha">Antalaha</a>, and <a href="Toamasina">Toamasina</a>, authorities confiscated thousands of logs valued at millions of dollars (<a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>). Some of this material was reportedly logged from eastern and northeastern parts of the park. At the start of the <a href="2009%20Malagasy%20political%20crisis">Malagasy political crisis</a> in March 2009, thousands of woodcutters intensely logged precious hardwoods for six to eight weeks in the SAVA Region. An estimated 52,000 tons of rosewood lumber, or nearly 100,000 trees, were logged that year, with one-third of the total coming from Marojejy National Park and the remainder from nearby <a href="Masoala%20National%20Park">Masoala National Park</a>. As a result, the park was closed briefly, but reopened in May 2009. In 2010, the situation improved in Marojejy, but illegal logging intensified in Masoala and the <a href="Makira%20Natural%20Park">Makira Protected Area</a>.

Illegal logging has been facilitated by insufficient governance, unclear forest regulation, and undermined judicial control while the exportation of the acquired logs (in 1992, 2006, and 2009–2010) has been permitted by government decrees that either precede elections or are issued during periods of political instability. The trade is organized and operated by high-ranking officials and influential businessmen. Additionally, the trade in Malagasy rosewood is not regulated under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>).

Geography and ecology of the Everglades

The geography and ecology of the Everglades involve the complex elements affecting the natural environment throughout the southern region of the U.S. state of <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. <a href="Draining%20and%20development%20of%20the%20Everglades">Before drainage</a>, the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> were an interwoven mesh of <a href="marsh">marsh</a>es and <a href="prairie">prairie</a>s covering . The Everglades is simultaneously a vast <a href="drainage%20basin">watershed</a> that has historically extended from <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a> south to <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a> (around one-third of the southern Florida peninsula), and many interconnected ecosystems within a geographic boundary. It is such a unique meeting of water, land, and climate that the use of either singular or plural to refer to the Everglades is appropriate. When <a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas">Marjory Stoneman Douglas</a> wrote her definitive description of the region in 1947, she used the metaphor "River of Grass" to explain the blending of water and plant life.

Although <a href="Cladium">sawgrass</a> and <a href="Swamp">sloughs</a> are the enduring geographical icons of the Everglades, other ecosystems are just as vital, and the borders marking them are subtle or nonexistent. Pinelands and tropical hardwood <a href="hammock%20%28ecology%29">hammocks</a> are located throughout the sloughs; the trees, rooted in soil inches above the <a href="peat">peat</a>, <a href="marl">marl</a>, or water, support a variety of wildlife. The oldest and tallest trees are <a href="Taxodium">cypresses</a>, whose roots are specially adapted to grow underwater for months at a time. The Big Cypress Swamp is well known for its 500-year-old cypresses, though cypress domes can appear throughout the Everglades. As the fresh water from Lake Okeechobee makes its way to Florida Bay, it meets salt water from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>; <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> forests grow in this transitional zone, providing nursery and nesting conditions for many species of birds, fish, and invertebrates. The marine environment of Florida Bay is also considered part of the Everglades because its sea grasses and aquatic life are attracted to the constant discharge of fresh water.

These ecological systems are always changing due to environmental factors. Geographic features such as the Western Flatwoods, Eastern Flatwoods, and the Atlantic Coastal Ridge affect drainage patterns. Geologic elements, climate, and the frequency of storms and fire are formative processes for the Everglades. They help to sustain and transform the ecosystems in the Shark River Valley, Big Cypress Swamp, coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ecosystems have been described as both fragile and resilient. Minor fluctuations in water levels have far-reaching consequences for many plant and animal species, and the system cycles and pulses with each change.

At only 5,000 years of age, the Everglades is a young region in geological terms. Its ecosystems are in constant flux as a result of the interplay of three factors: the type and amount of water present, the geology of the region, and the frequency and severity of fires.

Water is the dominant element in the Everglades, and it shapes the land, vegetation, and animal life of South Florida. The South Florida climate was once <a href="arid">arid</a> and <a href="semi-arid">semi-arid</a>, interspersed with wet periods. Between 10,000 and 20,000 years ago, sea levels rose, submerging portions of the Florida peninsula and causing the <a href="water%20table">water table</a> to rise. Fresh water saturated the <a href="limestone">limestone</a>, eroding some of it and creating <a href="spring%20%28hydrosphere%29">springs</a> and <a href="sinkhole">sinkhole</a>s. The abundance of fresh water allowed new vegetation to take root, and through evaporation formed <a href="thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a>s. Limestone was dissolved by the slightly acidic rainwater. The limestone wore away, and groundwater came into contact with the surface, creating a massive wetland ecosystem. Although the region appears flat, the wearing away of the limestone in some areas created slight valleys and plateaus—a difference of inches in elevation—that affected not only the flow of water, but also types of vegetation present.

The Everglades are unique; no other wetland system in the world is nourished primarily from the atmosphere. Before the first attempt at draining the Everglades in 1882, the entire <a href="drainage%20basin">watershed</a> extended from <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando</a> to <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a> comprising the <a href="Kissimmee%20River">Kissimmee</a>–<a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>–Everglades (KLOE) watershed. Kissimmee River outlets flow into Lake Okeechobee, which sits above sea level. Only two seasons exist in the Everglades: wet (May to November) and dry (December to April). Average annual rainfall in the Everglades is approximately , though fluctuations of precipitation are normal. Droughts, floods, and tropical storms are normal occurrences in the area. When Lake Okeechobee exceeds its water storage capacity during the wet season, it pours slowly over the southern rim and flows for to Florida Bay. The gradient change is so slight that the river moves only a minute. Sawgrass thrives in this river, dominates freshwater marshes and <a href="Swamp">sloughs</a>, and is the main characteristic of the region.

Severe weather, in the form of <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical storms and hurricanes</a>, also affects the structure of the Everglades. Between 1871 and 2003, 40 tropical cyclones struck the Everglades, usually every one to three years. These storms alter the coastline, flush decaying vegetation from <a href="estuary">estuaries</a>, strip weakened branches from trees, and disperse seeds, pollen, and plant material. <a href="Hurricane%20Donna">Hurricane Donna</a> in 1960 affected of <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> forests by depositing <a href="marl">marl</a> over the roots and depriving the trees of oxygen. It also eradicated <a href="Orchidaceae">orchids</a>, <a href="Bromeliaceae">bromeliads</a>, and other <a href="epiphyte">epiphyte</a>s that once flourished in the mangroves; their reappearance may take a century or more. Donna also significantly spread <a href="Conocarpus">buttonwood</a>, <a href="saltwort">saltwort</a>, and <a href="Salicornia">glasswort</a>, and epiphytes began to grow in new areas. Although the lasting effects remain to be seen, <a href="Hurricane%20Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a> in 1992 also destroyed mangrove forests and snapped slash pines in half. However, regrowth occurred quickly, and sand deposited by the storm surge improved nesting conditions for <a href="American%20crocodile">crocodiles</a> and <a href="sea%20turtle">sea turtle</a>s.

A vast marshland could only have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25 million and 2 million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized <a href="bryozoa">bryozoa</a>ns and tiny shells, or <a href="ooid">ooid</a>s, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a "hydroperiod", determines what particular soils and vegetation are present.

Shorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of <a href="periphyton">periphyton</a>: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, <a href="peat">peat</a> builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod.

Five types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called <a href="Groundwater-related%20subsidence">subsidence</a>. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil. The dried peat burned or was degraded into <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> and water by microorganisms. Some homes built near early farms had to restructure their foundations on stilts as the peat deteriorated; other areas lost approximately of soil depth. Between the 1880s and 2005, an estimated 3.4 billion metric tons of soil has been lost in the Everglades due to oxidation. Most of that loss occurs in the Everglades Agricultural Area; the least amount of loss is found in Everglades National Park.

Fire is another important element in the maintenance of the Everglades. The majority are caused by <a href="lightning">lightning</a> strikes from <a href="thunderstorm">thunderstorm</a>s during the wet season. Their effects are largely superficial, and serve to foster further plant growth: <a href="Cladium">sawgrass</a> will burn above water, but the roots are preserved. Fire in the sawgrass marshes serves to keep out larger bushes and trees, and releases nutrients from decaying plant matter more efficiently than <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a>. Large burned areas also affect waterflow, since wind and water are undeterred by the eradicated sawgrass; water may flow two to three times faster in recently burned areas. During the wet season only dead plant matter and the tips of plants are burned; however, the effects of fire are much more significant in the dry season, as fire may be fed by organic <a href="peat">peat</a> and burn deeply, destroying root systems. The only impediment to the spread of fire in the Everglades is the presence of water. It takes around 225 years for one foot (0.3 m) of peat to develop, but the peat is not as dense as it should be for the 5,000 years of the Everglades' existence. Scientists point to fire as the reason.

Researchers have noted that fires appear in cycles associated with those of the hydroperiods. The first cycle is the annual wet-season fires that occur with rapid frequency during the summer, but are quickly extinguished. Dry-season fires are rarer due to the lack of lightning, but their damage may be more pervasive. A longer fire cycle spanning ten to fourteen years coincides with similar water cycles affected by global climate conditions. Fires in this cycle may be numerous and have little effect, or rare and have catastrophic consequences. The third cycle appears in a 550-year frequency associated with severe drought. Layers of <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> have been detected inside peat in parts of the Everglades, indicating the region endured severe fires for years at a time, although this trend seems to have abated since the last occurrence around 940 <a href="BCE">BCE</a>.

The Everglades are dominated by <a href="Cladium">sawgrass</a> in water; this is the titular "River of Grass" popularized by <a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas">Marjory Stoneman Douglas</a> in 1947. This river contains a wide variety of plant and animal life. An early American environmentalist named <a href="Gifford%20Pinchot">Gifford Pinchot</a> said of the Everglades, "It is a region so different that it hardly seems to belong to the United States. It is full of the most vivid and most interesting life on land, in the air, and in the water. It is a land of strangeness, separate and apart from the common things we all know so well."

The sawgrass grows in prairies or strands, in between channels of water in a shallow river long and wide flowing from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Some authors refer to the sawgrass and water combination as the "true Everglades" or just "the Glades". Prior to the <a href="Draining%20and%20development%20of%20the%20Everglades">first drainage attempts in 1905</a>, the "sheetflow", or the wide shallow river starting in Lake Okeechobee, occupied nearly a third of the lower Florida peninsula. Though sawgrass remains the main feature of the Everglades, other ecosystems are scattered among the marshes and prairies, and their borders are sometimes imperceptible.

Most marshes in the Everglades are dominated by the <a href="Cyperaceae">sedge</a> known as "<a href="Cladium">Cladium</a>", or sawgrass in common terminology. The sedge is a three-dimensional v-shaped stalk with upward-pointing teeth. Sawgrass thrives in the slowly moving water, but may die if oxygen is unable to reach its roots and is particularly vulnerable to floods immediately after a fire. Some of the sawgrass can grow up to tall, and directly south of <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a> it has grown to . Farther south, where the peat is not as rich, it typically grows tall in patches, as opposed to the prairies of the upper glades. The hydroperiod for the marsh is usually nine months but can last longer. In shorter hydroperiods, <a href="marl">marl</a> may form instead of peat.

Where sawgrass grows densely, few animals or other plants thrive, although <a href="alligator">alligator</a>s often choose these locations for nesting. Where there is more room, <a href="periphyton">periphyton</a> grows, appearing as mats or brown sausage-shaped chunks. Periphyton is predominantly <a href="algae">algae</a>, although over 100 different <a href="microorganisms">microorganisms</a> help create it. <a href="Larval%20insects">Larval insects</a> and <a href="amphibians">amphibians</a> are supported by periphyton; these in turn provide food for birds, fish, and reptiles. Periphyton also absorbs <a href="calcium">calcium</a> from the water, which creates marl where sawgrass takes root.

Sloughs are channels of free-flowing water in between the sawgrass marshes. Sloughs are deeper than sawgrass marshes, about , and may stay flooded for at least 11 months out of the year if not multiple years in a row. The peat beds that support sawgrass are slightly elevated and may begin abruptly creating ridges of grass. The borders between these systems are called "ridge-and-slough" landscapes. Aquatic animals such as turtles, young alligators, snakes, and fish live in sloughs and they usually feed on aquatic invertebrates, such as the Florida <a href="apple%20snail">apple snail</a>. Plants grow here, usually submerged or floating like bladderwort ("<a href="Utricularia">Utricularia</a>"), waterlily ("<a href="Nymphaeaceae">Nymphaeaceae</a>"), or spatterdock ("<a href="Nuphar%20lutea">Nuphar lutea</a>"). Major sloughs in the Everglades system include the <a href="Shark%20River%20%28Florida%29">Shark River</a> Slough draining to Florida Bay, Lostmans Slough bordering The Big Cypress, and <a href="Taylor%20Slough">Taylor Slough</a> in the eastern Everglades.

Two kinds of wet prairies thrive in the Everglades: <a href="marl">marl</a> and water-marsh community. Wet prairies are slightly elevated like sawgrass marshes, but contain abundant plant diversity. Marl prairies are located where marl covers limestone that may protrude as pinnacles or erode into "solution holes": depressions formed by the same processes that create <a href="sinkhole">sinkhole</a>s. Solution holes, however, do not meet the water table; they are filled with rain water. The surface is covered only three to seven months of the year, but the water is usually just deep. Marl is created by layers of periphyton loosely attached to the limestone, and forms a grey or white crumbly mud when it dries. When flooded, the marl can support a variety of water plants, and dwarf cypresses may grow for hundreds of years though not exceed in height. Solution holes may remain flooded even when the prairies are dry, and they support aquatic invertebrates such as crayfish and snails, as well as larval amphibians which feed young <a href="Wader">wading birds</a>. Where the predominant soil is peat, a water-marsh community exists. Its hydroperiod is longer than the marl prairie, although its plants are less diverse. These regions tend to be on the border between sloughs and sawgrass marshes.

Alligators have created an ecological niche in wet prairies; they dig at low spots with their claws and snouts and create ponds free of vegetation that remain submerged throughout the dry season. Alligator holes are integral to the survival of aquatic invertebrates, turtles, fish, small mammals, and birds during extended drought periods. Alligators feed upon animals that visit the hole.

Islands of trees featuring dense temperate or tropical trees are called <a href="tropical%20hardwood%20hammock">tropical hardwood hammock</a>s. They may rise between above water level in freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, or pineland. These islands illustrate the difficulty of characterizing the climate of the Everglades as tropical or subtropical. Hammocks in the northern portion of the Everglades consist of more temperate plant species, but closer to Florida Bay the trees are tropical and smaller shrubs are more prevalent. Tropical trees like the West Indian mahogany ("<a href="Swietenia%20mahagoni">Swietenia mahagoni</a>") were probably spread by birds carrying seeds from the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>.

These hammocks form on slightly elevated areas unharmed by deep peat fires or limestone plateaus rising several inches above the surrounding peat. Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees that grow in very dense clumps, such as southern live oak ("<a href="Quercus%20virginiana">Quercus virginiana</a>"), gumbo limbo ("<a href="Bursera%20simaruba">Bursera simaruba</a>"), royal palm ("<a href="Roystonea">Roystonea</a>"), and willow bustic ("<a href="Dipholis%20salicifolia">Dipholis salicifolia</a>"). Near the bases of hammocks sharp saw palmettos ("<a href="Serenoa%20repens">Serenoa repens</a>") flourish, making the hammocks very difficult to penetrate. Water in sloughs flow around the islands creating <a href="moat">moat</a>s. Though some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire, hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover; the moats are therefore essential for protection. Islands vary in size, but most range between ; the water slowly flowing around them limits their size and gives them a teardrop appearance from above. The height of the trees is limited by factors such as frost, lightning, and wind: the majority of trees in hammocks grow no higher than .

Florida strangler figs ("<a href="Ficus%20aurea">Ficus aurea</a>") are common in hammocks, and find particular ease in rooting at the heads of cabbage palms ("<a href="Sabal%20palmetto">Sabal palmetto</a>"). After taking root into the ground, they build complex frameworks around the host tree, eventually squeezing out light and nutrients, and essentially taking its place. A variety of invertebrates including beetles, ants, spiders, and <a href="tree%20snail">tree snail</a>s support a food chain that includes frogs, owls and other birds of prey, snakes, rodents, <a href="bobcat">bobcat</a>s, and <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s. There are more than 50 varieties of tree snails in the Everglades; the color patterns and designs unique to single islands may be a result of the isolation of certain hammocks.

Tropical hardwood hammocks in the Everglades have been harvested for lumber, particularly by shipbuilders seeking West Indian mahogany and black ironwood ("<a href="Krugiodendron%20ferreum">Krugiodendron ferreum</a>"). The largest and most mature of these trees had been removed by the late 18th century. <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a>s made their villages in hammocks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they lived in groups of <a href="chickee">chickee</a>s numbering half a dozen, with one central chickee for cooking and another for eating. Dugout canoes, cookware, <a href="still">still</a>s, and sewing machines may still be found in remote locations.

Some hammocks are dominated by types of vegetation that grow in relation to the amount of water or type of soil present. The majority of hardwood hammocks create a thin poor soil covering the limestone called <a href="humus">humus</a>, made of decaying plant matter and moisture trapped by the structure of the trees. When peat forms the layer atop the limestone of a tree island, bayheads develop, dominated by bay trees such as sweetbay magnolia ("<a href="Magnolia%20virginiana">Magnolia virginiana</a>") and others like swamp holly ("<a href="Ilex%20decidua">Ilex decidua</a>"), wax myrtle ("<a href="Myrica%20cerifera">Myrica cerifera</a>"), and cocoplum ("<a href="Chrysobalanus%20icaco">Chrysobalanus icaco</a>"). Willowheads, dominated by willow trees ("<a href="Salix%20caroliniana">Salix caroliniana</a>"), take hold where the hydroperiod is long, usually around solution or alligator holes, and may surround the holes, giving them a <a href="donut">donut</a> appearance from above.

The prairies and sloughs of the Everglades system are bordered by two areas of poorly drained sandy soil on both sides of Lake Okeechobee: the Eastern Flatwoods and the Western Flatwoods just north of Big Cypress Swamp. The predominant ecosystem in the Flatwoods is pine forest, but there are also cypress swamps and sloughs in the Eastern Flatwoods. Along the eastern border of the Everglades is the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, rising in elevation, and curving to the southwest, gradually decreasing in elevation until it meets Taylor Slough. The Coastal Ridge prevents Everglades water from flowing into the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> to the east, directing it southwesterly into Florida Bay. The <a href="South%20Florida%20metropolitan%20area">South Florida metropolitan area</a> is located on a portion of the Atlantic Coastal Ridge, and much of the landscape has changed drastically within the past 100 years as a result of urban growth.

<a href="South%20Florida%20rocklands%23Pine%20rockland">Pine rocklands</a> (also called pinelands) are found on uneven <a href="limestone">limestone</a> <a href="Stratum">substrates</a> that contain pinnacles and solution holes. There are three primary locations of pine rocklands: the Miami Ridge, which runs from Miami into Long Pine Key near the main entrance of <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a>; the lower Florida Keys; and the Big Cypress Swamp. The most significant feature of the pine rockland ecosystem is the South Florida slash pine (<a href="Slash%20Pine">"Pinus elliotti" var "densa"</a>; also called Dade County pine) that reaches a height of . Pine rockland communities require fire for maintenance; they have adapted to promote and resist fire at the same time. These communities are located in the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod, although some floors may have flooded solution holes or puddles for a few months at a time. The sandy floor of the pine rocklands is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable. South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat. Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor, and opens pine cones to germinate seeds. A period without significant fire can turn pineland into hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines. The understory shrubs in pine rocklands include fire-resistant species like saw palmetto ("<a href="Serenoa">Serenoa repens</a>"), cabbage palm ("<a href="Sabal%20palmetto">Sabal palmetto</a>"), and West Indian lilac ("<a href="Tetrazygia%20bicolor">Tetrazygia bicolor</a>"). The most diverse group of plants in the pine community are herbs, of which two dozen species exist. These plants contain <a href="tuber">tuber</a>s and other mechanisms allowing for quick sprouts after charring.

Wildlife in pine rockland communities is diverse. In some forests, 15 species of birds can be found. Common among them are the <a href="pine%20warbler">pine warbler</a> ("Dendroica pinus"), the <a href="red-bellied%20woodpecker">red-bellied woodpecker</a> ("Melanerpes carolinus"), and the <a href="eastern%20meadowlark">eastern meadowlark</a> ("Sturnella magna"). More than 20 species of reptiles and amphibians have been noted, such as the <a href="green%20anole">green anole</a> ("Anolis carolinensis"), <a href="southern%20leopard%20frog">southern leopard frog</a> ("Rana sphenocephala"), and southern black racer ("<a href="Coluber%20constrictor%20priapus">Coluber constrictor priapus</a>"). Mammals such as the <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> <a href="Florida%20panther">Florida panther</a> ("Puma concolor coryi"), <a href="American%20black%20bearFlorida%20black%20bear%20">American black bearFlorida black bear </a>("Ursus americanus floridanus"), and several types of bats also live in the pine rocklands.

Before urban development of the South Florida region, pine rocklands covered around in <a href="Miami-Dade%20County%2C%20Florida">Miami-Dade County</a>. Pine forests were extensively cleared by urban developers and the lumber industry in the 1930s and 1940s. Within Everglades National Park, of pine rockland communities are protected, but outside the park, of pine forests remain as of 1990, averaging in size. Dade County pine has a remarkable longevity and has proven to be <a href="termite">termite</a>-resistant, though dense enough to make driving nails difficult. In 1984 they were protected by a county <a href="Local%20ordinance">ordinance</a>, after many pine areas had been depleted. A misunderstanding of fire's role also played a part in the disappearance of pine forests, as natural fires were put out and pine rocklands transitioned into hardwood hammocks. Today <a href="prescribed%20fire">prescribed fire</a>s occur in Everglades National Park in pine rocklands every three to seven years.

West of the sawgrass prairies and sloughs lies the Big Cypress Swamp, commonly called "The Big Cypress", referring to its size rather than the height or diameter of its trees. It takes up the majority of <a href="Collier%20County%2C%20Florida">Collier County</a>; at its most limited measurement, the swamp measures , but its hydrological boundary is nearly twice as large. The Big Cypress is slightly elevated at at its highest point and slopes gradually to the coastline for approximately . Because the defining feature of The Big Cypress is the abundance of trees it is considered a swamp, rather than a marsh where grass is the main characteristic.

The basin for The Big Cypress receives on average of water in the rainy season. Most of The Big Cypress sits atop a bedrock covered by a thin layer of limestone that contains <a href="quartz">quartz</a>, creating a sandy soil that hosts a variety of vegetation. The majority of trees are bald cypress ("<a href="Taxodium%20distichum">Taxodium distichum</a>") and not true cypresses ("<a href="Cupressaceae">Cupressaceae</a>"). Cypresses are conifers that are uniquely adapted to thrive in flooded conditions, with buttressed trunks and root projections that protrude out of the water, called "knees".

Cypress trees in the area can live for hundreds of years; some giants grow to and are 500 years old. Still, they may be only seventh- or eighth-generation cypresses. Few massive trees survived the logging operations that took place in the 1930s and 1940s. As a result, much of The Big Cypress is protected by various federal or state agencies that include <a href="Big%20Cypress%20National%20Preserve">Big Cypress National Preserve</a>, <a href="Corkscrew%20Swamp%20Sanctuary">Corkscrew Swamp Sanctuary</a>, <a href="Fakahatchee%20Strand%20State%20Preserve">Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve</a> and two Indian reservations.

Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as "heads", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple ("<a href="Acer%20rubrum">Acer rubrum</a>"), swamp bay ("<a href="Persea%20palustris">Persea palustris</a>"), and pop ash ("<a href="Fraxinus%20caroliniana">Fraxinus caroliniana</a>"). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest.

Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as <a href="orchid">orchid</a>s, <a href="bromeliad">bromeliad</a>s, and <a href="fern">fern</a>s thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks ("<a href="Mycteria%20americana">Mycteria americana</a>") nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to <a href="Restoration%20of%20the%20Everglades">controlled water</a>. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.

Water from Lake Okeechobee and The Big Cypress eventually flows to the ocean. At a transitional zone where fresh water meets salt water, <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a> trees thrive, adapted as they are to both kinds of water. This <a href="brackish">brackish</a> mixture of water and mangrove systems, crisscrossed by hundreds of <a href="tidal%20creek">tidal creek</a>s, harbors a very productive ecosystem. The depth of these zones is dependent on how much water flows from the Everglades. In the wet season, fresh water pours into Florida Bay and sawgrass appears near the coastline. In dryer years, salt water creeps inland to the coastal prairie, an ecosystem that buffers the freshwater marshes by absorbing sea water. Mangrove trees grow in fresh water ecosystems when the salt water flows far enough inland. The Everglades have the most extensive contiguous system of mangroves in the world. The mangrove forests of the <a href="Ten%20Thousand%20Islands">Ten Thousand Islands</a> cover almost .

Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red ("<a href="Rhizophora%20mangle">Rhizophora mangle</a>"), black ("<a href="Avicennia%20germinans">Avicennia germinans</a>"), and white ("<a href="Laguncularia%20racemosa">Laguncularia racemosa</a>"), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a>s.

The estuaries act as <a href="fisheries">fisheries</a> for fry and nurseries for <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s. Shrimp, <a href="oyster">oyster</a>s, crabs, <a href="whelk">whelk</a>s, <a href="cockle%20%28bivalve%29">cockles</a>, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial <a href="Atlantic%20horseshoe%20crab">horseshoe crabs</a> ("Limulus polyphemus"). The region supports a $59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp ("<a href="Farfantepenaeus%20duorarum">Farfantepenaeus duorarum</a>") industry, and a $22 million-a-year <a href="Florida%20stone%20cran">stone crab</a> ("Menippe mercenaria") industry. Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called <a href="propagule">propagule</a>s, are full <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.

Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as <a href="roseate%20spoonbill">roseate spoonbill</a>s ("Platalea ajaja"), <a href="egret">egret</a>s, and <a href="tricolored%20heron">tricolored heron</a>s ("Egretta tricolor") use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources and the protection offered from most prey. Thousands of birds can nest in the mangroves at once, making a noisy and messy colony, but their droppings fertilize the mangrove trees. Shorebirds like <a href="Rallidae">rails</a>, <a href="tern">tern</a>s and <a href="gull">gull</a>s; diving birds such as <a href="pelican">pelican</a>s and <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s; and <a href="birds%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> such as <a href="osprey">osprey</a>s, <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s and <a href="vulture">vulture</a>s are among the more than 100 species of birds that use Everglades mangrove trees to raise their young.

Because much of the coast and inner estuaries are built by mangroves—and there is no border between the coastal marshes and the bay—the ecosystems in <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a> are considered part of the Everglades. More than of Florida Bay is protected by <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a>, representing the largest body of water in the park boundaries. There are approximately one hundred <a href="cay">keys</a> in Florida Bay, many of which are mangrove forests. Larger islands may be taken over by hardwood hammocks. The outer rims of the Ten Thousand Islands and <a href="Cape%20Sable">Cape Sable</a> share characteristics of the intertwining saltwater bays and fresh water marshes.

The fresh water entering Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of <a href="seagrass">turtle grass</a> and algae formations that foster animal life in the bay. <a href="Sea%20turtle">Sea turtle</a>s and <a href="manatee">manatee</a>s ("Trichechus manatus latirostris") eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic <a href="plankton">plankton</a>. Female sea turtles return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The <a href="Calusa">Calusa</a> Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, due to the lack of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch ("<a href="Triplofusus%20papillosus">Triplofusus papillosus</a>"), left-handed whelk ("<a href="Sinistrofulgur">Sinistrofulgur</a>"), and the Florida crown conch ("<a href="Melongena%20corona">Melongena corona</a>") as drinking vessels, picks, hammers, knives and awls.

Sea grasses stabilize sea beds and protect shorelines from erosion by absorbing energy from waves. Shrimp, <a href="spiny%20lobster">spiny lobster</a>s, and <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s live in and among the grasses and feed on <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>; they in turn feed larger predators such as <a href="shark">shark</a>s, <a href="Rajiformes">rays</a>, <a href="barracuda">barracuda</a>, and <a href="king%20mackerel">king mackerel</a> ("Scomberomorus cavalla"). Due to shallow water and abundant sunlight, Florida Bay hosts communities of <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s and <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s, although the majority of the state's reefs are closer to the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>. Everglades keys that foster mangroves also support nurseries for wading birds such as the <a href="Great%20blue%20heron">Great blue heron</a> ("Ardea herodias"), which was almost wiped out in the <a href="Labor%20Day%20Hurricane%20of%201935">Labor Day Hurricane of 1935</a> (only 146 were counted afterward). After recovering to number more than 2,000, they were further endangered by <a href="Hurricane%20Donna">Hurricane Donna</a> in 1960, which decreased their numbers by 35 to 40 percent.

Sea floor patterns of Florida Bay are formed by currents and winds. However, since 1932, sea levels have been rising at a rate of per 100 years. Though mangroves serve to build and stabilize the coastline, seas may be rising more rapidly than the trees are able to build.

Ecosystems in the Everglades have been described as both fragile and resilient. Author Michael Grunwald wrote about the observations of the Everglades' first American visitors: "If the Grand Canyon was a breathtaking painting, the Everglades was a complex drama, and everything in it had a role." An estimated 11,000 species of seed-bearing plants and 400 species of land or water vertebrates live in the Everglades, but slight variations in water levels affect many organisms and reshape land formations. The health and productivity of any ecosystem relies on the number of species present: the loss of one species weakens the entire ecosystem.

For example, Florida apple snails ("<a href="Ampullariidae">Pomacea paludosa</a>") are an amphibious fresh water mollusk. They have a single gill and lung, and live on stalks of sawgrass in water depths no more than . They are the primary food of the endangered <a href="snail%20kite">snail kite</a> ("Rostrhamus sociabilis") and <a href="limpkin">limpkin</a> ("Aramus guarauna") as well as the raccoon, otter, and young alligator. Apple snails lay their eggs on sawgrass stalks about above the water line, and they are intolerant of being submerged for long periods of time. When the eggs hatch, young snails must enter the water quickly or face death. When water levels are too low or rise too quickly while snail eggs are developing, apple snails do not flourish, affecting the many reptiles, mammals, and birds that feed on them. With regard to the ecology of <a href="trophic%20dynamics">trophic dynamics</a>, or food chains, the 174 species of invertebrates play a vital role in the Everglades. <a href="Crayfish">Crayfish</a>, insects, scorpions, and other invertebrates also support a web of animals.

The group of animals most integral to the overall success of Everglades wildlife is freshwater fish. Few places in the Everglades stay submerged from one year to the next, so alligator holes and deep clefts in the limestone are vital to the survival of fish, and the animal community as a whole. Freshwater fish are the main diet of most wading birds, alligators, and otters, and require large areas of open water in order to repopulate. Young amphibians also play an important role in the food chain. <a href="Tadpole">Tadpole</a>s spread quickly in isolated areas where fish do not have the time or access to reproduce in numbers necessary to support larger animals. Hundreds of species of amphibians are found in the Everglades, and their availability helps support wildlife during short hydroperiods or in remote locations.

These smaller animals support communities of larger animals, including 70 species of land birds that breed within the Everglades, and 120 water birds, of which 43 breed in the area. Many of these birds go on to migrate through the West Indies and North America. Several dozen species of mammals also thrive in the region, from tiny bats and shrews to midsize <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s ("Procyon lotor"), <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">otter</a>s ("Lontra canadensis"), <a href="Virginia%20opossum">opossum</a>s ("Didelphis virginiana"), and <a href="fox">fox</a>es. The largest include <a href="white%20tailed%20deer">white tailed deer</a> ("Odocoileus virginianus"), the Florida black bear, and the Florida panther.

Although slight changes in water level affect many species, the system as a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the diversity of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, and some are induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the <a href="Restoration%20of%20the%20Everglades%23Invasive%20species">introduction of exotic species</a>, and rapid <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but <a href="wood%20stork">wood stork</a>s and <a href="Cape%20Sable%20seaside%20sparrow">Cape Sable seaside sparrow</a>s ("Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis") do well in dryer circumstances.

People have lived in the Everglades region for thousands of years. Within the past 100 years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades. The <a href="South%20Florida%20metropolitan%20area">South Florida metropolitan area</a> grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life in many of these urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.

Humans have also adversely impacted the ecology of the Everglades by introducing numerous <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>, which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging example of this phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the <a href="Burmese%20python">Burmese python</a> in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.

Diffuse panbronchiolitis

Diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) is an <a href="inflammation">inflammatory</a> <a href="lung%20disease">lung disease</a> of unknown cause. It is a severe, progressive form of <a href="bronchiolitis">bronchiolitis</a>, an inflammatory condition of the <a href="bronchiole">bronchiole</a>s (small air passages in the lungs). The term "diffuse" signifies that <a href="lesion">lesion</a>s appear throughout both lungs, while "panbronchiolitis" refers to inflammation found in all layers of the <a href="respiratory%20bronchioles">respiratory bronchioles</a> (those involved in <a href="gas%20exchange">gas exchange</a>). DPB causes severe inflammation and <a href="Nodule%20%28medicine%29">nodule</a>-like lesions of <a href="terminal%20bronchiole">terminal bronchiole</a>s, chronic <a href="sinusitis">sinusitis</a>, and intense coughing with large amounts of <a href="sputum">sputum</a> production.

The disease is believed to occur when there is susceptibility, or a lack of <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> resistance, to DPB-causing bacteria or viruses, caused by several genes that are found predominantly in individuals of <a href="East%20Asian%20people">East Asian</a> descent. The highest <a href="Incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">incidence</a> occurs among <a href="Japanese%20people">Japanese people</a>, followed by <a href="Koreans">Koreans</a>. DPB occurs more often in males, and usually begins around age 40. It was recognized as a distinct new disease in the early 1960s, and was formally named "diffuse panbronchiolitis" in 1969.

If left untreated, DPB progresses to <a href="bronchiectasis">bronchiectasis</a>, an irreversible lung condition that involves enlargement of the bronchioles, and pooling of <a href="mucus">mucus</a> in the bronchiolar passages. Daily treatment of DPB with <a href="macrolide">macrolide</a> <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a>s such as <a href="erythromycin">erythromycin</a> eases symptoms and increases survival time, but the disease currently has no known cure. The eventual result of DPB can be <a href="respiratory%20failure">respiratory failure</a> and heart problems.

The term "bronchiolitis" generally refers to inflammation of the bronchioles. DPB is classified as a form of "primary bronchiolitis", which means that the underlying cause of bronchiolitis is originating from or is confined to the bronchioles. Along with DPB, additional forms of primary bronchiolitis include <a href="bronchiolitis%20obliterans">bronchiolitis obliterans</a>, follicular bronchiolitis, <a href="Respiratory%20bronchiolitis%20interstitial%20lung%20disease">respiratory bronchiolitis</a>, <a href="mineral%20dust%20airway%20disease">mineral dust airway disease</a>, and a number of others. Unlike DPB, bronchiolitis that is not considered "primary" would be associated with diseases of the larger airways, such as <a href="chronic%20bronchitis">chronic bronchitis</a>.

Symptoms of DPB include <a href="chronic%20sinusitis">chronic sinusitis</a> (inflamed <a href="paranasal%20sinus">paranasal sinus</a>es), wheezing, <a href="rales">crackles</a> (<a href="respiratory%20sounds">respiratory sounds</a> made by obstructions such as phlegm and <a href="secretion">secretion</a>s in the lungs), <a href="dyspnea">dyspnea</a> (shortness of breath), and a severe cough that yields large amounts of sputum (coughed-up phlegm). There may be <a href="pus">pus</a> in the sputum, and affected individuals may have fever. Typical signs of DPB progression include (enlargement) of the bronchiolar passages and <a href="hypoxemia">hypoxemia</a> (low levels of oxygen in the blood). If DPB is left untreated, bronchiectasis will occur; it is characterized by dilation and thickening of the walls of the bronchioles, inflammatory damage to respiratory and <a href="terminal%20bronchiole">terminal bronchiole</a>s, and pooling of mucus in the lungs. DPB is associated with progressive <a href="respiratory%20failure">respiratory failure</a>, <a href="hypercapnia">hypercapnia</a> (increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood), and can eventually lead to <a href="pulmonary%20hypertension">pulmonary hypertension</a> (high blood pressure in the <a href="pulmonary%20vein">pulmonary vein</a> and <a href="pulmonary%20artery">artery</a>) and <a href="cor%20pulmonale">cor pulmonale</a> (dilation of the <a href="right%20ventricle">right ventricle</a> of the heart, or "right heart failure").

DPB is <a href="idiopathic">idiopathic</a>, which means an exact <a href="physiological">physiological</a>, <a href="Environment%20%28biophysical%29">environment</a>al, or <a href="pathogen">pathogen</a>ic cause of the disease is unknown. However, several factors are suspected to be involved with its <a href="pathogenesis">pathogenesis</a> (the way in which the disease works).

The <a href="major%20histocompatibility%20complex">major histocompatibility complex</a> (MHC) is a large <a href="genome">genomic</a> region found in most <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s that is associated with the immune system. It is located on <a href="chromosome%206">chromosome 6</a> in humans. A subset of MHC in humans is <a href="human%20leukocyte%20antigen">human leukocyte antigen</a> (HLA), which controls the <a href="antigen%20presentation">antigen-presenting system</a>, as part of <a href="adaptive%20immunity">adaptive immunity</a> against pathogens such as <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a> and <a href="virus">virus</a>es. When human cells are infected by a pathogen, some of them can present parts of the pathogen's proteins on their surfaces; this is called "antigen presentation". The infected cells then become targets for types of <a href="cytotoxic%20T-cell">cytotoxic T-cell</a>s, which kill the infected cells so they can be removed from the body.

Genetic predisposition for DPB susceptibility has been localized to two HLA <a href="haplotype">haplotype</a>s (a <a href="nucleotide">nucleotide</a> or gene sequence difference between <a href="Homologous%20chromosome">paired chromosomes</a>, that is more likely to occur among a common ethnicity or trait) common to people of East Asian descent. <a href="HLA-B54">HLA-B54</a> is associated with DPB in the Japanese, while <a href="HLA-A11">HLA-A11</a> is associated with the disease in Koreans. Several genes within this region of <a href="human%20leukocyte%20antigen">class I HLA</a> are believed to be responsible for DPB, by allowing increased susceptibility to the disease. The common genetic background and similarities in the HLA profile of affected Japanese and Korean individuals were considered in the search for a DPB gene. It was suggested that a mutation of a suspected disease-susceptibility gene located somewhere between <a href="HLA-B">HLA-B</a> and <a href="HLA-A">HLA-A</a> had occurred on an ancestral chromosome carrying both HLA-B54 and HLA-A11. Further, it is possible that a number of <a href="genetic%20recombination">genetic recombination</a> events around the disease <a href="locus%20%28genetics%29">locus</a> (location on a chromosome) could have resulted in the disease being associated with HLA-B54 in the Japanese and HLA-A11 in Koreans. After further study, it was concluded that a DPB susceptibility gene is located near the HLA-B locus at chromosome 6p21.3. Within this area, the search for a genetic cause of the disease has continued.

Because many genes belonging to HLA remain unidentified, <a href="Genetic%20screen%23Positional%20cloning">positional cloning</a> (a method used to identify a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) has been used to determine that a <a href="mucin">mucin-like</a> gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, <a href="Bare%20lymphocyte%20syndrome%23BLS%20I">bare lymphocyte syndrome I</a> (BLS I), exhibits a number of similarities with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of "H. influenzae". Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, and the fact that the gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causes—such as unidentified bacteria or viruses—have not been ruled out.

<a href="Cystic%20fibrosis">Cystic fibrosis</a> (CF), a progressive multi-system lung disease, has been considered in the search for a genetic cause of DPB. This is for a number of reasons. CF, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, abundant mucus production, infection, and shows a genetic predominance among Caucasians of one geographic group to the rarity of others; whereas DPB dominates among East Asians, CF mainly affects individuals of European descent. While no gene has been implicated as the cause of DPB, mutation in a specific gene—much more likely to occur in Europeans—causes CF. This mutation in the <a href="Cystic%20fibrosis%20transmembrane%20conductance%20regulator">CF-causing gene</a> is not a factor in DPB, but a unique <a href="genetic%20polymorphism">polymorphism</a> (variation) in this gene is known to occur in many Asians not necessarily affected by either disease. It is being investigated whether this gene in any state of mutation could contribute to DPB.

Inflammation is a normal part of the human immune response, whereby <a href="leukocyte">leukocyte</a>s (white blood cells), including <a href="neutrophil">neutrophil</a>s (white blood cells that specialize in causing inflammation), gather, and <a href="chemokine">chemokine</a>s (proteins released from certain cells, which activate or elicit a response from other cells) accumulate at any location in the body where bacterial or viral infections occur. Inflammation interferes with the activity of bacteria and viruses, and serves to clear them from the body. In DPB, bacteria such as "<a href="Haemophilus%20influenzae">Haemophilus influenzae</a>" and "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>" can cause the proliferation of inflammatory cells into the bronchiolar tissues. However, when neither bacteria are present with DPB, the inflammation continues for an as yet unknown reason. In either circumstance, inflammation in DPB can be so severe that nodules containing inflammatory cells form in the walls of the bronchioles. The presence of inflammation and infection in the airways also results in the production of excess mucus, which must be coughed up as sputum. The combination of inflammation, nodule development, infection, mucus, and frequent cough contributes to the breathing difficulties in DPB.

The fact that inflammation in DPB persists with or without the presence of "P. aeruginosa" and "H. influenzae" provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. <a href="Leukotriene">Leukotriene</a>s are <a href="eicosanoid">eicosanoid</a>s, <a href="lipid%20signaling">signaling molecules</a> made from <a href="essential%20fatty%20acid">essential fatty acid</a>s, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is <a href="leukotriene%20B4">leukotriene B4</a>, which specializes in neutrophil proliferation via <a href="chemotaxis">chemotaxis</a> (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules).

Inflammation in DPB is also caused by the chemokine <a href="CCL4">MIP-1alpha</a> and its involvement with <a href="CD8">CD8</a> <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>s. <a href="Beta%20defensin">Beta defensin</a>s, a family of <a href="antimicrobial">antimicrobial</a> <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s found in the respiratory tract, are responsible for further inflammation in DPB when a pathogen such as "P. aeruginosa" is present. If present with DPB, the <a href="human%20T-lymphotropic%20virus">human T-lymphotropic virus, type I</a>, a <a href="retrovirus">retrovirus</a>, modifies DPB pathogenesis by infecting <a href="T%20helper%20cell">T helper cell</a>s and altering their effectiveness in recognizing the presence of known or unknown pathogens involved with DPB.

The diagnosis of DPB requires <a href="medical%20test">analysis</a> of the lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung <a href="biopsy">biopsy</a>, or the more preferred <a href="high%20resolution%20computed%20tomography">high resolution computed tomography</a> (HRCT) scan of the lungs. The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the <a href="terminal%20bronchiole">terminal</a> and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs. The nodules in DPB appear as <a href="Opacity%20%28optics%29">opaque</a> lumps when viewed on <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a>s of the lung, and can cause <a href="airway%20obstruction">airway obstruction</a>, which is evaluated by a <a href="spirometry">pulmonary function test</a>, or PFT. Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DBP. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which is referred to as the <a href="tree-in-bud%20sign">"tree-in-bud"</a> pattern. Hypoxemia, another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called <a href="arterial%20blood%20gas">arterial blood gas</a>. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of <a href="lymphocyte">lymphocyte</a>s (<a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s that fight infection), neutrophils, and <a href="histiocyte">foamy histiocytes</a> (tissue <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s) in the lung <a href="lumen%20%28anatomy%29">lining</a>. Bacteria such as "H. influenzae" and "P. aeruginosa" are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses. The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a <a href="complete%20blood%20count">complete blood count</a> (CBC). Elevated levels of <a href="IgG">IgG</a> and <a href="IgA">IgA</a> (classes of <a href="immunoglobulin">immunoglobulin</a>s) may be seen, as well as the presence of <a href="rheumatoid%20factor">rheumatoid factor</a> (an indicator of <a href="autoimmunity">autoimmunity</a>). <a href="Hemagglutination">Hemagglutination</a>, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a> in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in <a href="bronchoalveolar%20lavage">bronchoalveolar lavage</a> fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.

In the <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> (finding the correct diagnosis between diseases that have overlapping features) of some obstructive lung diseases, DPB is often considered. A number of DPB symptoms resemble those found with other obstructive lung diseases such as <a href="asthma">asthma</a>, <a href="chronic%20bronchitis">chronic bronchitis</a>, and <a href="emphysema">emphysema</a>. <a href="Wheeze">Wheezing</a>, coughing with <a href="sputum">sputum</a> production, and shortness of breath are common symptoms in such diseases, and obstructive respiratory functional impairment is found on <a href="pulmonary%20function%20testing">pulmonary function testing</a>. Cystic fibrosis, like DPB, causes severe lung inflammation, excess mucus production, and infection; but DPB does not cause disturbances of the pancreas nor the <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>s, as does CF, so the two diseases are different and probably unrelated. DPB is distinguished by the presence of lesions that appear on X-rays as nodules in the bronchioles of both lungs; inflammation in all <a href="tissue%20%28biology%29">tissue</a> layers of the respiratory bronchioles; and its higher prevalence among individuals with East Asian lineage.

DPB and <a href="bronchiolitis%20obliterans">bronchiolitis obliterans</a> are two forms of primary bronchiolitis. Specific overlapping features of both diseases include strong cough with large amounts of often pus-filled sputum; nodules viewable on lung X-rays in the lower bronchi and bronchiolar area; and chronic sinusitis. In DPB, the nodules are more restricted to the respiratory bronchioles, while in OB they are often found in the membranous bronchioles (the initial non-cartilaginous section of the bronchiole, that divides from the <a href="tertiary%20bronchus">tertiary bronchus</a>) up to the <a href="secondary%20bronchus">secondary bronchus</a>. OB is a bronchiolar disease with worldwide prevalence, while DPB has more localized prevalence, predominantly in Japan. Prior to clinical recognition of DPB in recent years, it was often misdiagnosed as <a href="bronchiectasia">bronchiectasia</a>, <a href="COPD">COPD</a>, <a href="Idiopathic%20pulmonary%20fibrosis">IPF</a>, <a href="phthisis%20miliaris">phthisis miliaris</a>, <a href="sarcoidosis">sarcoidosis</a> or <a href="bronchioloalveolar%20carcinoma">alveolar cell carcinoma</a>.

<a href="Macrolide">Macrolide</a> antibiotics, such as <a href="erythromycin">erythromycin</a>, are an effective treatment for DPB when taken regularly over an extended period of time. <a href="Clarithromycin">Clarithromycin</a> or <a href="roxithromycin">roxithromycin</a> are also commonly used. The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through <a href="Immunotherapy">immunomodulation</a> (adjusting the immune response), which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low <a href="dosing">doses</a>. Treatment consists of daily oral administration of erythromycin for two to three years, an extended period that has been shown to dramatically improve the effects of DPB. This is apparent when an individual undergoing treatment for DPB, among a number of disease-related remission criteria, has a normal neutrophil count detected in BAL fluid, and <a href="arterial%20blood%20gas">blood gas</a> (an <a href="artery">arterial</a> <a href="blood%20test">blood test</a> that measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood) readings show that free oxygen in the blood is within the normal range. Allowing a temporary break from erythromycin therapy in these instances has been suggested, to reduce the formation of macrolide-resistant "P. aeruginosa". However, DPB symptoms usually return, and treatment would need to be resumed. Although highly effective, erythromycin may not prove successful in all individuals with the disease, particularly if macrolide-resistant "P. aeruginosa" is present or previously untreated DPB has progressed to the point where respiratory failure is occurring.

With erythromycin therapy in DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression of not only <a href="neutrophil">neutrophil</a> proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water <a href="secretion">secretion</a>s in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides are not involved in their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant "P. aeruginosa", erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.

A number of factors are involved in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of <a href="interleukin%208">interleukin 8</a> and <a href="leukotriene%20B4">leukotriene B4</a> to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of <a href="cell%20adhesion">adhesion molecules</a> that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.

Untreated DPB leads to bronchiectasis, respiratory failure, and death. A journal report from 1983 indicated that untreated DPB had a five-year survival rate of 62.1%, while the 10-year survival rate was 33.2%. With erythromycin treatment, individuals with DPB now have a much longer life expectancy due to better management of symptoms, delay of progression, and prevention of associated infections like "P. aeruginosa". The 10-year survival rate for treated DPB is about 90%. In DPB cases where treatment has resulted in significant improvement, which sometimes happens after about two years, treatment has been allowed to end for a while. However, individuals allowed to stop treatment during this time are closely monitored. As DPB has been proven to recur, erythromycin therapy must be promptly resumed once disease symptoms begin to reappear. In spite of the improved prognosis when treated, DPB currently has no known cure.

DPB has its highest <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals with the disease have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The disease is more common in males, with the male to female ratio at 1.4–2:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 increases the risk of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.

In Europe and the Americas, a relatively small number of DPB cases have been reported in Asian immigrants and residents, as well as in individuals of non-Asian ancestry. Misdiagnosis has occurred in the West owing to less recognition of the disease than in Asian countries. Relative to the large number of Asians living in the west, the small number of them thought to be affected by DPB suggests non-genetic factors may play some role in its cause. This rarity seen in Western Asians may also be partly associated with misdiagnosis.

In the early 1960s, a relatively new chronic lung disease was being observed and described by physicians in Japan. In 1969, the name "diffuse panbronchiolitis" was introduced to distinguish it from chronic bronchitis, emphysema, <a href="Extrinsic%20allergic%20alveolitis">alveolitis</a>, and other obstructive lung disease with inflammation. Between 1978 and 1980, results of a nationwide survey initiated by the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan revealed more than 1,000 probable cases of DPB, with 82 histologically confirmed. By the 1980s, it was internationally recognized as a distinct disease of the lungs.

Before the 1980s, the prognosis or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with <a href="superinfection">superinfection</a> (the emergence of a new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by "P. aeruginosa". DPB continued to have a very high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and <a href="oxygen%20therapy">oxygen therapy</a> were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, the prognosis significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.

Tropical Storm Cindy (1993)

Tropical Storm Cindy was a weak but unusually wet <a href="Atlantic%20hurricane">Atlantic tropical cyclone</a> that caused disastrous floods and mudslides across <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a> in August 1993. Cindy formed east of the island and became the <a href="1993%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">annual hurricane season</a>'s third <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20naming%23Atlantic">named storm</a> on August 14. Due to unfavorable <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Factors">atmospheric conditions</a>, Cindy remained disorganized throughout its journey across the northeastern <a href="Caribbean%20Sea">Caribbean Sea</a>. After attaining <a href="maximum%20sustained%20wind">maximum sustained wind</a>s of 45 mph (75 km/h), the storm began to weaken from an interaction with the high terrain of <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>. It made <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> in the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a> as a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a> on August 16, and dissipated over the territory the following day.

Despite its poor cloud structure, Cindy dropped torrential rain over portions of the northeastern Caribbean. The island of Martinique received a record 12 inches (305 mm) of rain over a 24-hour period, affecting northern villages and <a href="commune">commune</a>s. <a href="Le%20Pr%C3%AAcheur">Le Prêcheur</a> was particularly devastated by an extensive <a href="debris%20flow">debris flow</a>, which washed away entire structures. The storm wrought $19 million (1993 USD) in damage across Martinique, and left two people dead and hundreds homeless on the island. En route to Hispaniola, Cindy affected the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a> and <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> with rough surf and moderate rain. Heavy downpours and flooding killed two people in the Dominican Republic, though the exact extent of the damage there is unknown.

The origins of Tropical Storm Cindy can be traced to a <a href="tropical%20wave">tropical wave</a> that departed the western coast of <a href="Africa">Africa</a> on August 8, 1993. Over the following days, the wave tracked steadily west-northwestward across the <a href="tropical%20Atlantic">tropical Atlantic</a> while retaining a distinct cloud pattern on <a href="Weather%20satellite">satellite images</a>. Although initial data from a <a href="Hurricane%20Hunters">reconnaissance aircraft</a> mission on August 13 indicated that the system lacked a defined wind circulation, a second mission at 12:00 <a href="UTC">UTC</a> the next day revealed an improvement in its structure at the lower levels of the atmosphere. The <a href="National%20Hurricane%20Center">National Hurricane Center</a> (NHC) thus classified the system as a <a href="tropical%20depression">tropical depression</a>—a <a href="tropical%20cyclone">tropical cyclone</a> with <a href="Maximum%20sustained%20wind">sustained winds</a> of less than 39 mph (62 km/h)—and initiated public advisories on it soon thereafter.

Steered by a mid- to low-level <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%23Steering%20winds">wind flow</a>, the depression continued west-northwest toward <a href="Martinique">Martinique</a>, decelerating in reaction to the island's northern mountain range. Satellite images on the afternoon of August 14 showed the development of a <a href="central%20dense%20overcast">central dense overcast</a>, as greater atmospheric turbulence over the rugged terrain amplified the cyclone's <a href="Atmospheric%20convection">convection</a>; the next reconnaissance flight revealed that wind speeds near the center had increased to <a href="gale">gale</a> force. Based on these observations, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Cindy around 18:00 UTC, at which time the cyclone was located over Martinique with winds of 40 mph (65 km). Although Cindy briefly developed a favorable <a href="Outflow%20%28meteorology%29">outflow</a>, its upper-level structure debilitated after it moved away from the Lesser Antilles, impeding further development. Over the course of August 15, Cindy's cloud pattern remained disorganized due to unfavorable <a href="wind%20shear">wind shear</a>; the center of circulation became ill-defined, with the strongest thunderstorms confined to the eastern portion of the cyclone. Despite the unfavorable conditions, the storm managed to strengthen marginally on August 16, attaining peak winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a minimum <a href="Atmospheric%20pressure">pressure</a> of 1007 <a href="Bar%20%28unit%29">mbar</a> (<a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">hPa</a>; 29.74 <a href="Inch%20of%20mercury">inHg</a>), roughly 85 mi (140 km) southeast of <a href="Santo%20Domingo">Santo Domingo</a>.

Shortly after peaking in strength, Cindy began to interact with the mountains of nearby <a href="Hispaniola">Hispaniola</a>. The high terrain disrupted its circulation, causing it to weaken to a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC on August 16. The depression made <a href="Landfall%20%28meteorology%29">landfall</a> near <a href="Barahona%2C%20Dominican%20Republic">Barahona, Dominican Republic</a>, with winds of 35 mph (55 km/h). It became increasingly diffuse over land, prompting the NHC to declassify it as a tropical cyclone on August 17. The remnants proceeded inland near the border with <a href="Haiti">Haiti</a> and emerged into the Atlantic, where they spread across the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a> before eventually dissipating the next day.

When Cindy became a tropical cyclone on August 14, <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20watches%20and%20warnings%23Tropical%20Storm%20Warning">tropical storm warnings</a> were issued for the Lesser Antilles from Martinique northward to the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>. A <a href="Tropical%20cyclone%20watches%20and%20warnings%23Tropical%20Storm%20Watch">tropical storm watch</a> was posted for <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> at the time. The warnings, excluding those for the Virgin Islands, were discontinued on August 15. As Cindy drifted farther north later that day, the watch for Puerto Rico was upgraded to a tropical storm warning. Officials issued <a href="flash%20flood%20warning">flash flood warning</a>s for parts of the island, and about 600 people living in flood-prone areas sought shelter ahead of the storm. Ferry service between <a href="Fajardo%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Fajardo</a> and the offshore islands of <a href="Culebra%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Culebra</a> and <a href="Vieques%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Vieques</a> was suspended, leaving about 400 passengers stranded for a day. A <a href="Price%20controls">price freeze</a> was placed on emergency supplies such as wood, nails, batteries, kerosene, and lanterns.

Also on August 15, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Dominican Republic, from <a href="Saman%C3%A1%20%28town%29">Samaná</a> to <a href="Cape%20Enga%C3%B1o%20%28Dominican%20Republic%29">Cabo Engaño</a> along the northern coast and westward to <a href="Beata%20Island">Isla Beata</a> off the southwestern coast. Thousands of residents stocked up on bottled water, canned goods, and gas, although many stores in and around the capital remained closed for the day. The <a href="Las%20Am%C3%A9ricas%20International%20Airport">Santo Domingo International Airport</a> suspended all flight operations on the morning of August 16. The tropical storm warning for the island was discontinued when Cindy made landfall as no more than a weak tropical depression. In <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, a storm alert was issued for eastern provinces as forecasters warned of possibly heavy rainfall.

On August 14, Cindy passed over Martinique with rough winds and particularly violent rain, amplified by the storm's <a href="Orographic%20lift">interaction with the rising terrain</a>. The greatest quantities fell to the northeast of a line between <a href="Sainte-Marie%2C%20Martinique">Sainte-Marie</a> and <a href="Fort-de-France">Fort-de-France</a>, with day totals of more than 4 in (100 mm) recorded at every weather station in that region. The highest 1- and 24-hour rainfall rates were observed in <a href="Le%20Pr%C3%AAcheur">Le Prêcheur</a>, totaling 5.79 in (147 mm) and 12.0 in (305 mm), respectively. These amounts were well above the September average of 9.29 in (236 mm), making Cindy one of the most extreme rain events in the island's history. A maximum gust of 40 mph (65 km/h) was recorded during the storm, though sustained winds onshore did not reach tropical storm force.

Initially, Cindy's brisk winds downed banana trees and power lines across northern Martinique. After hours of continued rain, several rivers—such as the <a href="Rivi%C3%A8re%20des%20P%C3%A8res">Rivière des Pères</a>, <a href="Rivi%C3%A8re%20Claire">Rivière Claire</a> and <a href="Rivi%C3%A8re%20S%C3%A8che">Rivière Sèche</a>—quickly swelled and overflowed. Severe flooding and mudslides swept through northern villages, submerging homes and destroying roads and bridges. News footage on national television showed "cars [being] swept away to sea and buried in mud". The Prêcheur River, which normally flows at 18 ft/s (0.5 m/s), burst its banks upon attaining an exceptional <a href="River%23Rate">discharge rate</a> of nearly 25,000 ft/s (700 m/s). Large amounts of volcanic matter from the riverbed congealed into a massive <a href="debris%20flow">debris flow</a>, which struck the small commune of Le Prêcheur. Reaching heights of up to 10 ft (3 m), the debris completely covered houses and roads and wreaked an estimated <a href="Martinique%20franc">₣</a>15 million (1993 value; $2.7 million in 1993 USD) in structural damage. Flash floods following the overflow of the <a href="Grande%20Rivi%C3%A8re">Grande Rivière</a> surged through the adjacent village of the <a href="Grand%27Rivi%C3%A8re">same name</a>, devastating property and drowning one person. Despite recent improvements to its flood defenses, the <a href="Rivi%C3%A8re%20Roxelane">Rivière Roxelane</a> rapidly topped its banks and inundated much of <a href="Saint-Pierre%2C%20Martinique">Saint-Pierre</a>. Farther south, a combination of torrential rainfall and poor storm drains resulted in flood damage to private property and an <a href="Aquaculture">aquafarm</a> in <a href="Le%20Morne-Vert">Le Morne-Vert</a>.

In all, Cindy killed 2 people, injured 11, and destroyed more than 150 homes across Martinique. Monetary losses reached ₣107 million ($19 million), with road damage comprising ₣68 million ($12 million). After the storm's passage, thousands of people on the island sought refuge in emergency shelters, and about 3,000 residents became homeless. "La Capricieuse", a <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> ship stationed in <a href="French%20Guiana">French Guiana</a>, delivered disaster relief supplies to Fort-de-France; the goods included 250 packages with clothing items, distributed by the <a href="Lions%20Clubs%20International">Lions Club Association</a> of <a href="Saint%20Barth%C3%A9lemy">Saint Barthélemy</a>. Unseasonable sea conditions in Cindy's wake hindered local fishers from selling their catch to trading vessels in <a href="Petite%20Martinique">Petite Martinique</a>. Due to the severity of the flooding in Martinique, waterways and harbors were <a href="Dredging">dredged</a>, and river banks and dykes were reinforced to prevent recurrence.

Minimal effects were felt elsewhere in the Lesser Antilles. In <a href="Guadeloupe">Guadeloupe</a>, the storm dropped rain across southern <a href="Basse-Terre%20Island">Basse-Terre Island</a> through August 14–15; a peak total of 9.02 in (229 mm) was recorded at the summit of <a href="La%20Grande%20Soufri%C3%A8re">La Grande Soufrière</a>. Wind gusts at <a href="Pointe-%C3%A0-Pitre%20International%20Airport">Raizet Airport</a> reached 38 mph (61 km/h), just below tropical storm force. A moderate breeze with 28 mph (44 km/h) gusts brushed <a href="Dominica">Dominica</a>, and 1.25 in (32 mm) of rain fell at <a href="Canefield%20Airport">Canefield Airport</a> within 24 hours of Cindy's passage. Farther south, a weather station in <a href="Saint%20Lucia">Saint Lucia</a> recorded 1.88 in (48 mm) of precipitation, as well as light winds. As Cindy passed south of the Virgin Islands, unsettled seas and minor <a href="beach%20erosion">beach erosion</a> affected the islands' southern shores, with <a href="Swell%20%28ocean%29">swells</a> of 4 to 5 ft (1.2 to 1.5 m) reported at <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Croix</a>. Onshore, the island experienced wind gusts to 35 mph (55 km/h) and 1.48 in (38 mm) of rainfall.

On August 16, Cindy made its closest point of approach to Puerto Rico, although its center remained well south of the island. Impact from the storm was therefore limited to intermittent downpours and 8 ft (2.4 m) waves along the southern coast. The rough seas caused some minor erosion to beach facilities. According to a report from the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS), a maximum of 5.54 in (141 mm) of rain fell near <a href="R%C3%ADo%20Cerrillos">Río Cerrillos</a> in <a href="Ponce%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Ponce</a>, though the highest measurement from the <a href="Weather%20Prediction%20Center">Weather Prediction Center</a> (WPC) was 4.60 in (117 mm) at Puerto Real in <a href="Cabo%20Rojo%2C%20Puerto%20Rico">Cabo Rojo</a>. Many other locations received rainfall amounts of 2.0–4.5 in (50–115 mm), which flooded some roads and low-lying areas.

Cindy brought considerable rainfall to southern and eastern parts of the Dominican Republic, with totals of 4–10 in (100–255 mm). Upon the storm's landfall in the country, winds reached 35 mph (55 km/h) in Barahona. The rain filled rivers and caused scattered street flooding, affecting hundreds of houses. In <a href="Villa%20Altagracia">Villa Altagracia</a>, one fatality occurred when a child drowned in flood waters; the final death toll for the country stood at two. There were no reports of damage elsewhere after Cindy's rapid demise over Hispaniola, though its remnants likely produced localized showers in Haiti.

Creatures of Impulse

Creatures of Impulse is a stage play by the English <a href="dramatist">dramatist</a> <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>, with music by the composer-conductor <a href="Alberto%20Randegger">Alberto Randegger</a>, which Gilbert adapted from his own short story. Both the play and the short story concern an unwanted and ill-tempered old <a href="fairy">fairy</a> who enchants people to behave in a manner opposite to their natures, with <a href="farce">farcical</a> results.

The short story was written for "<a href="The%20Graphic">The Graphic</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Christmas number of 1870, and the play was first produced at the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Court Theatre</a> on 2 April 1871. It originally included six songs, but three were eventually cut, and some productions dispensed with the music entirely. While the lyrics survive, the music was never published and is lost. Reviews of the play were mostly positive, though it was criticised for the lack of a significant plot or superstructure to support its comic premise. Nonetheless, reviewers found it enjoyable, and it was a modest success, running for 91 performances and enjoying revivals into the early part of the 20th century.

Gilbert had already written a considerable body of stories, plays, poems, criticism and other works before writing "Creatures of Impulse". He later wrote the <a href="libretto">libretti</a> to the famous series of <a href="Savoy%20operas">Savoy operas</a> (composed by <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a>) between 1871 and 1896.

From the mid-1860s to the early 1870s, <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a> was extremely productive, writing a large quantity of comic verse, theatre reviews and other journalistic pieces, short stories, and dozens of plays and <a href="comic%20operas">comic operas</a>. His output in 1870 included dozens of his popular comic "<a href="Bab%20Ballads">Bab Ballads</a>"; two blank verse comedies, "<a href="The%20Princess%20%28play%29">The Princess</a>" and "<a href="The%20Palace%20of%20Truth">The Palace of Truth</a>"; two comic operas, "<a href="Our%20Island%20Home">Our Island Home</a>" and "<a href="The%20Gentleman%20in%20Black">The Gentleman in Black</a>"; and various other short stories, comic pieces, and reviews appearing in various periodicals and newspapers. In 1871 he was even busier, producing seven plays and operas.

Gilbert's dramatic writing during this time was evolving from his early <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">musical burlesques</a> to a more restrained style, as exemplified in his string of blank-verse fairy comedies. The first of these was "The Palace of Truth", which opened in 1870 to widespread acclaim. He was also developing his unique style of absurdist humour, described as "Topsy-Turvy", made up of "a combination of wit, irony, topsyturvydom, parody, observation, theatrical technique, and profound intelligence". The story and play "Creatures of Impulse" date from the middle of this period, when Gilbert was trying different styles and working towards the mature style of his later work, including the famous series of <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> operas. Gilbert described the play as a "musical fairytale".

Italian-born <a href="Alberto%20Randegger">Alberto Randegger</a> was better known as a conductor and professor of singing than as a composer, although he composed several full-length works and numerous vocal pieces in England in the 1860s and 1870s. He is also remembered for his important 1879 textbook entitled "Singing". His music for "Creatures of Impulse" was criticised as "extremely undramatic", though others found it "pretty". Much of it was cut from revivals of the piece.

Gilbert first published "Creatures of Impulse" as a short story, under the title "A Strange Old Lady", in the 1870 Christmas number of "<a href="The%20Graphic">The Graphic</a>", an illustrated weekly newspaper. He later selected it for inclusion in the only collection of his short stories published during his lifetime, "<a href="Foggerty%27s%20Fairy%20and%20Other%20Tales">Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales</a>" (1890), at which point he renamed it to match the theatrical adaptation. Gilbert did not originally intend for the story to be turned into a play; nonetheless, a few months later it was on stage.

He adapted the story into a play for <a href="Marie%20Litton">Marie Litton</a>'s <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court Theatre</a>. Litton took over the proprietorship of the New Chelsea Theatre in 1871 and renamed it the Royal Court. Its opening attraction was the première of Gilbert's "<a href="Randall%27s%20Thumb">Randall's Thumb</a>", and when that play proved successful, it was no surprise, as the "London Echo" pointed out, that she followed it with another work by Gilbert. He often used his previous prose work as the basis of later plays, and "The Strange Old Lady" was no exception. Under the new title of "Creatures of Impulse", it opened on 2 April 1871 as a companion piece for "Randall's Thumb". Successful, it lasted through 91 performances and acted as a companion piece to five different plays. Litton continued to commission works from Gilbert, including Gilbert's adaptation of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' "<a href="Great%20Expectations">Great Expectations</a>" in 1871, "<a href="Broken%20Hearts">Broken Hearts</a>" in 1875, various translations of French works, and "<a href="The%20Happy%20Land">The Happy Land</a>" in 1873, which portrayed members of the British Government on stage and caused such a scandal that it had an unusually long run.

The play was revived in 1872 at the Court Theatre, in 1873 at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Theatre%2C%20Long%20Acre">Queen's Theatre</a>, and in 1874 at the <a href="Vaudeville%20Theatre">Vaudeville Theatre</a> (running for over 100 performances), all in London. It appears to have gone through several changes during these revivals, the first of which was described on its playbill as a "shortened version", and the last as an "altered" one. Various versions continued to be produced into the 20th century by amateurs as well as occasional professional groups, such as <a href="Ben%20Greet">Ben Greet</a>'s <a href="Elizabethan%20Stage%20Society">Elizabethan Stage Society of England</a>. An acting edition was published by T. H. Lacy around 1871. T. H. Lacy was acquired by <a href="Samuel%20French">Samuel French</a>, and the libretto continued to be printed until about 1970. The piece, still occasionally produced, was part of the <a href="International%20Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan%20Festival">International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival</a> in 2006.

Substantial cuts were made in the text by the time the play was collected for "Original Plays, Fourth Series" (1911), the last volume of the only large-scale collection of Gilbert's stage work. Victorian plays had to be approved by the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a> for decency before they were performed, and the version submitted was then archived, providing a more-or-less complete collection of Victorian theatrical output, now part of the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>. Comparison of the "licensing copy" of "Creatures of Impulse" from this archive with that printed in "Original Plays" reveals lyrics for three additional songs and a second verse to the opening chorus and finale.

"Note: The short story takes place at an inn on the road from London to <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>, but the play calls for <a href="Alsace">Alsatian</a> costumery. Otherwise, the plots of the short story and play are nearly identical. The summary below uses the names from the play and notes significant changes in plot between the play and short story." "There are also various small changes to the order of events, not described."
At "The Three Pigeons" inn, it is a good day for some: the miser Boomblehardt has been out collecting rents from his tenants, and Sergeant Klooque, hero of <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, has just arrived at the inn on leave and may now flirt with any lady he chooses, without the need to pretend they are his relatives to get around his tyrannical Colonel. However, it is not a good day for Martha, the landlady of the inn: staying there is a strange old lady, a mischievous fairy, who refuses to pay or to leave, and who needs neither food nor water. This is substantially cutting into Martha's profits. She enlists Boomblehardt and Klooque, the cowardly farmer Peter, and her extremely shy niece, Pipette, to help solve this problem.

Peter, not cowardly enough to fear an old woman, nor superstitious enough to believe in her power, threatens the old fairy, trying to chase her away. Unfortunately, she does indeed have fairy powers and casts a spell that forces Peter to threaten anyone he encounters or, if alone, to fight imaginary enemies. Peter flees before he can get himself into trouble by threatening anyone bigger than him, calling out challenges as he goes. Sergeant Klooque approaches the old woman next and tries to use his military charm to win her over. It turns out that she hates soldiers, and she strikes out with her stick, making him duck and dodge. She then casts a spell to make his cringing, dodging and ducking permanent, intending that he lose his reputation and be branded a coward. Pipette arrives and watches his behaviour in astonishment. "He's showing you how he fought the enemy at Johannesburg," exclaims the old lady, but he replies "No, my dear!" I'm showing you how the enemy fought us. This is the way they retreated". He leaves, cringing and pleading for imaginary attackers to stop as he goes.

Pipette then tries to coax the old lady into leaving, kissing and hugging her, and appealing to her (hoped for) good nature. The old lady sees through her attempt, and in punishment for her "telling stories" compels her to kiss and cuddle all she meets. She cries out in protest that she's too shy for such behaviour, but the old lady assures her that she'll "get over [her] shyness after a year or two of that sort of thing". Boomblehardt approaches next, and Pipette flings herself on him, crying "Kiss me!". He obliges. She responds, "How dare you take such a liberty! You insolent old man! Kiss me". And so he does. She boxes his ears, much to his confusion, and then retreats into the inn in tears.

Boomblehardt then meets with the old woman. The miser has heard that the strange old lady does not need to eat and offers to help her stay at the inn if she will teach him her secret of how to avoid wasting money on food. He offers her a golden guinea. The fairy decides that someone that miserly must be punished and compels him to continue passing out guineas to all he meets.
Soon complications arise from these curses. Boomblehardt finds Sergeant Klooque's curse hilarious and decides that if he must give out money, the sergeant is as good as any other. The shy Pipette throws herself at Sergeant, who unwillingly ducks and dodges, trying to avoid her. When Peter arrives, he is forced to get into a fight with the sergeant over her, at which, to his surprise, the brave sergeant cowers, dodges, and ducks. Boomblehardt continues passing out guineas, his fortune dribbling away. Then Martha chases her customers out of the inn with a broom: She too has been cursed. Everyone has fallen under the fairy's ironic curses, forced to behave in a manner contrary to his or her intrinsic nature.

Now the old lady makes her crucial mistake: She heads downstairs to check on her mischief, and the cursed group all run up to her to beg her to relent. They all behave as compelled by their curses: Peter threatens her, Pipette tries to kiss her, the sergeant ducks away from her, the miser offers her money, and the landlady keeps trying to chase her out with a broom. The chaos is overwhelming: "In short, the Old Lady, who was much more than a match for each of them taken singly, was overpowered by numbers". She is left with no choice but to relent, release the spells and leave, vanquished and embarrassed.

The short story continues a bit further, making explicit some elements that are only hinted at in the play:
The really curious part of this story is that, after everything had been explained, and all had been restored to their normal courses of action, none of the personages involved in it married each other. They were all so annoyed at having made such fools of themselves that they walked out of the inn in different directions, and were never seen or heard of again.

Except Peter, who, seeing nothing to be ashamed of in showing such undaunted courage, remained and kept the "Three Pigeons," and prospered remarkably to the end of his days.
That no one marries at the end of the play was a daring innovation for Victorian theatre, and the reviewer from "Era" mentioned his surprise at this.

Synopsis notes:<br>

As was common in Victorian drama, a woman (Maggie Brennan) <a href="breeches%20role">played a young man</a> (Peter). The play's script assigns dialogue to three numbered villagers in the opening scene. The named character of Jacques has no more lines than any of these and disappears after the first page of the script. Righton, who first played Boomblehardt, portrayed him as a Jewish caricature. Gilbert's script did not use a Jewish dialect, and historian Jane Stedman suggests that Righton's increasingly broad portrayal and interpolations show that Gilbert had little control of Righton's portrayal of the part.

The number of songs varied from production to production. The version submitted to the Lord Chamberlain had six songs, and an early review in "The Times" wrote that it was "overweighted with a quantity of extremely undramatic music", though the "London Echo" thought the music was "pretty". Nonetheless, the version printed in Gilbert's "Original Plays" (1911) cut these six songs to three, and some productions omitted the songs entirely.

The list of songs in the licence copy is:

While the lyrics survive, none of the music was ever published, and it has been lost. The version in "Original Plays" omits the second verse of Nos. 1 and 6 and cuts Nos. 2, 3, and 5.

Reviews for the play were generally favourable, but it was criticised for its loose structure and lack of a substantial plot. "Bell's Life in London and Sporting Chronicle" opined: "Amusing, simple, and ingenious, 'Creatures of Impulse' is another, though a slight, addition to the successes of its author". The "London Echo" compared the piece to a "<a href="burletta">burletta</a> of the stamp that was in vogue a hundred years ago, resembling <a href="Midas%20%28burletta%29">"Midas"</a>, perhaps, more nearly than that of any modern burlesque", and wrote that it "contains pretty music, and smart if not witty dialogue, a semi-moral and a semi-plot". "<a href="The%20Graphic">The Graphic</a>" concluded that "Although it occupies only an hour in performance, the story is well told and the piece is exceedingly amusing" and praised the acting. Righton received special praise for his portrayal of Boomblehardt: "No character on stage perhaps ever made audiences laugh more in so short a time". In an 1882 assessment of the piece for amateur theatre societies, M. E. James noted that "The singing is a great addition. It is altogether an amusing bit of nonsense, and very original".

"<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" review was less positive than most, saying that although the play was good, more was expected of Gilbert:

History of the National Hockey League (1917–1942)

The National Hockey League (NHL) was founded in 1917 following the demise of its predecessor league, the <a href="National%20Hockey%20Association">National Hockey Association</a> (NHA). In an effort to remove <a href="Eddie%20Livingstone">Eddie Livingstone</a> as owner of the <a href="Toronto%20Blueshirts">Toronto Blueshirts</a>, a majority of the NHA franchises (the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>, <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Montreal Wanderers</a>, <a href="Ottawa%20Senators%20%28original%29">Ottawa Senators</a> and <a href="Quebec%20Bulldogs">Quebec Bulldogs</a>) suspended the NHA and formed the new NHL. Quebec, while a member, did not operate in the NHL for the first two years. Instead the owners of the Toronto <a href="Arena%20Gardens">Arena Gardens</a> operated a new Toronto franchise. While the NHL was intended as a temporary measure, the continuing dispute with Livingstone led to the four NHA owners meeting and making the suspension of the NHA permanent one year later.

The NHL's first quarter-century saw the league compete against two rival major leagues, the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Hockey%20Association">Pacific Coast Hockey Association</a> and <a href="Western%20Canada%20Hockey%20League">Western Canada Hockey League</a>, for players and the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>. The NHL first expanded into the United States in 1924 with the founding of the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>, and by 1926 consisted of ten teams in <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region">Great Lakes region</a>, and the <a href="Northeastern%20United%20States">Northeastern United States</a>. At the same time, the NHL emerged as the only major league and the sole competitor for the Stanley Cup.

The game itself continued to evolve during this time. Numerous innovations to the rules and equipment were put forward as the NHL sought to improve the flow of the game and make the sport more fan-friendly. The NHL played with six men to a side rather than the traditional seven, and was among the first leagues to allow goaltenders to leave their feet to make saves. The NHL's footprint spread across Canada as <a href="Foster%20Hewitt">Foster Hewitt</a>'s radio broadcasts were heard coast-to-coast starting in 1933.

The <a href="Montreal%20Forum">Montreal Forum</a> and <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a> were built, and each played host to All-Star benefit games held to raise money to support <a href="Ace%20Bailey">Ace Bailey</a> and the family of <a href="Howie%20Morenz">Howie Morenz</a> in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> and <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, respectively. Both players' careers had ended due to an on-ice incident, with Morenz eventually dying, a month after he sustained his initial injury. These early NHL All-Star games would lead to the annual All-Star games which continue today.

The <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and World War II reduced the league to six teams by 1942. Founding team Ottawa, and expansion teams <a href="New%20York%20Americans">New York Americans</a>, <a href="Montreal%20Maroons">Montreal Maroons</a> and <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20%28NHL%29">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>/<a href="Philadelphia%20Quakers%20%28NHL%29">Philadelphia Quakers</a> passed from the scene. Expansion team <a href="Detroit%20Falcons%20%28NHL%29">Detroit Falcons</a> declared bankruptcy in 1932 and only survived through a merger with the Chicago Shamrocks of the American Hockey League and the pockets of prosperous owner <a href="James%20E.%20Norris">James Norris</a> to become the <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a>. Desperate conditions in Montreal meant that the city nearly lost both of its teams in the 1930s; the Canadiens nearly moved to <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, but survived due to its stronger fan support. The six teams left standing in 1942 (the Boston Bruins, <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Black Hawks</a>, Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> and <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>) are known today as the "<a href="Original%20Six">Original Six</a>".

The first attempts to regulate competitive ice hockey matches came in the late 1880s. Before then, teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time. In 1887, four clubs from Montreal (the <a href="Montreal%20Hockey%20Club">Montreals</a>, the <a href="Montreal%20Crystals">Crystals</a>, the <a href="Montreal%20Victorias">Victorias</a>, and <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a>) and the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators%20%28original%29">Ottawa HC</a> formed the <a href="Amateur%20Hockey%20Association%20of%20Canada">Amateur Hockey Association of Canada</a> (AHAC) and developed a structured schedule. <a href="Frederick%20Stanley%2C%2016th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Stanley</a> donated the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> and appointed Sheriff John Sweetland and <a href="Philip%20Dansken%20Ross">Philip Dansken Ross</a> as its trustees; they chose to award it to the best team in the AHAC, or to any pre-approved team that won it in a challenge. Since the Cup carried an air of nobility, its prestige greatly benefited the AHAC.

The coordination and regularized schedule that the AHAC brought helped commercialize amateur ice hockey, which ran against the spirit of the prevailing amateur ethic. As the importance of winning grew, AHAC clubs began recruiting players from outside, and the disparity in skill between teams of the AHAC and those of other leagues became clearer. Since team owners in the AHAC wanted to defend the Stanley Cup and maintain the organization's honour, and rink owners wanted senior hockey as their marquee attraction, AHAC clubs became increasingly reluctant about admitting new teams into the league and the senior series. When the relatively weak <a href="Ottawa%20Capitals">Ottawa Capitals</a> joined in 1898, the five original clubs withdrew from the AHAC to form the new <a href="Canadian%20Amateur%20Hockey%20League">Canadian Amateur Hockey League</a> (CAHL). In 1903, four new teams created the <a href="Federal%20Amateur%20Hockey%20League">Federal Amateur Hockey League</a> (FAHL), and in 1904, the <a href="International%20Professional%20Hockey%20League">International Hockey League</a> (IHL), based in both <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20%28disambiguation%29">Sault Ste. Marie</a>s, the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula of Michigan</a>, and <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, was created as the first fully professional league. The IHL's ability to pay salaries caused an "Athletic War" that drained amateur clubs of top players, most noticeably in the <a href="Ontario%20Hockey%20Association">Ontario Hockey Association</a> (OHA).

By the 1905–06 season, several of the FAHL and CAHL markets were overcrowded; Montreal alone had seven clubs. To solve the problem, the leagues merged into the new <a href="Eastern%20Canada%20Amateur%20Hockey%20Association">Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association</a> (ECAHA), which kept four of the Montreal clubs. The new league mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters, which led to the demise of the IHL. With the IHL gone, teams from Toronto, <a href="Kitchener%2C%20Ontario">Berlin</a> (now Kitchener), <a href="Brantford">Brantford</a>, and <a href="Guelph">Guelph</a> filled the void with the <a href="Ontario%20Professional%20Hockey%20League">Ontario Professional Hockey League</a> (OPHL). Bidding wars for players led many ECAHA teams to lose money, and before the 1907–08 season, the Montreal Victorias and the Montreal HC left. The ECAHA dropped "Amateur" from its name for the 1909 season, and on November 25, it folded. Ottawa HC, Quebec HC, and the Montreal Shamrocks founded the <a href="Canadian%20Hockey%20Association%20%281909%E2%80%9310%29">Canadian Hockey Association</a> (CHA), and the league later admitted the <a href="Montreal%20Le%20National">Montreal Le National</a> and All-Montreal HC. Rejected CHA applicants formed the <a href="National%20Hockey%20Association">National Hockey Association</a> (NHA).

When compared to the CHA, the geographical distances between NHA teams were much greater; however, the NHA's financial backers were more notable businessmen. These businessmen applied financial principles similar to those of early baseball, and the leagues quickly entered a bitter bidding war over players. In particular, after being rejected from the CHA, <a href="Renfrew%20Creamery%20Kings">Renfrew</a> aggressively pursued any players that the CHA's Ottawa club wanted. Montreal became a notable battleground as the NHA established two franchises, including the modern-day <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>. With its significantly wealthier backers, the NHA easily recruited the top players, leaving the CHA teams, except Ottawa, relatively mediocre. Ottawa regularly trounced its opponents, and league attendance and interest dropped. The CHA's final season lasted eight games, and the league folded in 1910, as its Ottawa and Montreal clubs joined the NHA.

In the <a href="1916%E2%80%9317%20NHA%20season">1916–17 season</a>, the NHA was facing numerous problems. The <a href="Quebec%20Bulldogs">Quebec Bulldogs</a> were in financial difficulty, while the league's most popular team, the <a href="Toronto%20228th%20Battalion%20%28NHA%29">Toronto 228th Battalion</a>, was called away to fight in World War I. Several of the league's team owners were growing frustrated with <a href="Toronto%20Blueshirts">Toronto Blueshirts</a> owner <a href="Eddie%20Livingstone">Eddie Livingstone</a>, with whom they had been having problems since 1915. Prior to the start of the season, the owners of the Montreal teams, <a href="Sam%20Lichtenhein">Sam Lichtenhein</a> of the <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Wanderers</a> and <a href="George%20Kennedy%20%28sports%20promoter%29">George Kennedy</a> of the Canadiens, threatened to drop the Blueshirts from the league over a player dispute Livingstone was having with the 228th Battalion. Livingstone was also in a dispute with the Ottawa Senators over the rights to <a href="Cy%20Denneny">Cy Denneny</a>, while Kennedy and Livingstone had a mutual dislike that occasionally threatened to come to blows at league meetings.

The remaining owners used the loss of the 228th Battalion as a reason to eliminate the Blueshirts on February 11, 1917. The Montreal teams led a motion to reduce the NHA to four teams by removing the Blueshirts, ignoring Livingstone's attempts to create a revamped five-team schedule. Livingstone was promised that his players would be returned to him after the season. The dispersal of the Blueshirts' players, organized by league secretary <a href="Frank%20Calder">Frank Calder</a>, was described by the Toronto "<a href="The%20Mail%20and%20Empire">Mail and Empire</a>" as a "raid of the Toronto players". At the same meeting, the league adopted a motion commanding Livingstone sell the Blueshirts by June 1. 

By November 1917, with the sale of Livingstone's Blueshirts still not completed, the remaining owners, realizing they were powerless under the NHA constitution to forcibly eject Livingstone, decided to suspend the NHA and form a new league without Livingstone. On November 26, 1917, following several meetings of the NHA owners throughout the month, the National Hockey League was created at the <a href="Windsor%20Hotel%20%28Montreal%29">Windsor Hotel</a> in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>. The new league was represented by Lichtenhein's Wanderers, Kennedy's Canadiens, <a href="Tommy%20Gorman">Tommy Gorman</a> on behalf of the Senators, and Mike Quinn of the Bulldogs. A <a href="Toronto%20Arenas">new team</a> in Toronto, under the control of the Toronto Arena Company, completed the five-team league. The NHL adopted the NHA's constitution and named Calder its first president. Quebec retained membership in the NHL, but did not operate that season, so their players were dispersed by draft among the other teams.

At a meeting of representatives of hockey clubs held at the Windsor Hotel, Montreal, November 22nd, 1917[,] the following present[,] G.W. Kendall, S.E. Lichtenhein, T.P. Gorman, M.J. Quinn and Frank Calder, it was explained by the last named that in view of the suspension of operations by the National Hockey Association of Canada Limited, he had called the meeting at the suggestion of the Quebec Hockey Club to ascertain if some steps could not be taken to perpetuate the game of Hockey.

Frank Calder was elected to the Chair and a discussion ensued after which it was moved by T.P. Gorman, seconded by G.W. Kendall[:] "That the Canadien, Wanderer, Ottawa and Quebec Hockey Clubs unite to comprise the National Hockey League". The motion was carried.

It was then moved by M.J. Quinn seconded by G.W. Kendall that: "This League agrees to operate under the rules and conditions governing the game of hockey prescribed by the National Hockey Association of Canada Limited". The motion was carried.

At this stage, Mr. W.E. Northey, representing the Toronto Arena Company asked to be admitted to the meeting and was admitted. Mr. Northey explained that he was empowered by the interests he represented to say that in the event of a league being formed to contain four clubs, the Toronto Arena desired to enter a team in the competition.

Upon this assurance M.J. Quinn on behalf of Quebec Hockey Club declared the latter willing to withdraw provided a suitable arrangement could be made regarding players then the property of the Quebec Hockey Club.

After discussion it was unanimously agreed that the Quebec players be taken over by the league at a cost of $700 (Seven Hundred Dollars) of which amount 50% should be paid to the Quebec Hockey Club by the club winning the championship, 30% by the second club and 20% by the third club in the race...

The meeting then proceeded to the election of officers. The following directors were elected S.E. Lichtenhein (Wanderers), Martin Rosenthal (Ottawa), G.W. Kendall (Canadiens) and a director to be named by the Toronto club.

M.J. Quinn was elected Honorary President with power to vote on matters pertaining to the general welfare of the league.

Frank Calder was elected President and Secretary-Treasurer at a salary of $800 (Eight Hundred Dollars) on the understanding that there could be no appeal from his decisions...
The NHL was intended to be a temporary league, as the owners hoped to remove Livingstone from Toronto, then return to the NHA in 1918–19. Livingstone had other ideas, filing lawsuits against the new league, the owners and the players in an attempt to keep his team operating. Nonetheless, the NHL began play three weeks after it was created, with the first games held on December 19 in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> and Montreal. A French language newspaper ad discovered in 2017 established that the Montreal game started at 8:15 pm, ahead of the Ottawa match scheduled to begin at 8:30 pm and delayed a short time by a contract dispute, making the <a href="Montreal%20Wanderers">Montreal Wanderers</a> 10-9 defeat of the <a href="Toronto%20Arenas">Toronto Arenas</a> at the <a href="Montreal%20Arena">Montreal Arena</a> the league's first game, with Montreal's <a href="Dave%20Ritchie%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Dave Ritchie</a> scoring the new league's first goal and goalie <a href="Bert%20Lindsay">Bert Lindsay</a> earning the first win.

The NHL's first superstar was "Phantom" <a href="Joe%20Malone%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Joe Malone</a>. A two-time NHA scoring champion, Malone scored five goals for the Montreal Canadiens in a 7–4 victory over the Ottawa Senators on the NHL's opening night. Malone went on to record a league-leading 44 goals in 20 games in <a href="1917%E2%80%9318%20NHL%20season">1917–18</a>. He again led the NHL in scoring in <a href="1919%E2%80%9320%20NHL%20season">1919–20</a>, scoring 39 goals in 24 games with Quebec. During that season, on January 20, 1920, Malone scored seven goals in one game against the <a href="Toronto%20St.%20Patricks">Toronto St. Patricks</a>, a record that still stands today. Malone was elected to the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in 1950.

The first goal in NHL history was scored by <a href="Dave%20Ritchie%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Dave Ritchie</a> of the Montreal Wanderers one minute into a 10–9 win over Toronto, which was the only victory the Wanderers recorded in the NHL. On January 2, 1918, a fire destroyed the <a href="Montreal%20Arena">Montreal Arena</a>, home to both the Wanderers and the Canadiens. While the Canadiens relocated to the 3,000-seat <a href="Jubilee%20Arena">Jubilee Arena</a>, Lichtenhein chose to withdraw the Wanderers, citing the lack of available players due to the war. The NHL continued on as a three-team league until Quebec returned to it in 1919.

In its first years, the NHL continued the NHA's <a href="split%20season">split season</a> format. The first-half champion Canadiens fell to the second-half champion Toronto team in the 1918 playoffs for the <a href="O%27Brien%20Trophy%20%28ice%20hockey%29">O'Brien Cup</a> by a combined score of 10–7 in a two-game, total goals series. The victory gave Toronto the right to face the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20Hockey%20Association">Pacific Coast Hockey Association</a>'s champion, the <a href="Vancouver%20Millionaires">Vancouver Millionaires</a>, in the Stanley Cup final. The Torontos defeated Vancouver to become the first NHL team to win the Cup.

The Canadiens won the NHL championship over the Senators in <a href="1918%E2%80%9319%20NHL%20season">1918–19</a>, and traveled west to meet the PCHA's champion, the <a href="Seattle%20Metropolitans">Seattle Metropolitans</a>. The series is best remembered for its cancellation with the series tied at two wins, two losses, and a tie (2–2–1) due to the <a href="Spanish%20flu%20pandemic">Spanish flu pandemic</a>. Several players from both teams became ill, prompting health officials in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> to cancel the sixth, and deciding, game. Canadiens defenceman <a href="Joe%20Hall">Joe Hall</a> died as a result of the flu on April 5, 1919.

Meanwhile, defending champions Toronto finished in last place in both halves of the 1918–19 season. On February 20, 1919, Toronto informed the league that it was withdrawing from competition. The NHL avoided being reduced to two teams for 1919–20 when the team was reorganized as the Toronto St. Patricks. The Quebec franchise also returned, (known for the season as the "Quebec Athletic Club") increasing the league to four teams. The Quebec club posted a 4–20 record in 1919–20, despite the return of Malone. It was the franchise's final season in Quebec City, relocating to <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton, Ontario</a>, in 1920 to become the <a href="Hamilton%20Tigers">Hamilton Tigers</a>.

Throughout, Livingstone continued to try to revive the NHA, convening league meetings on September 20 and December 11, 1918, which representatives of the Canadiens, Senators and Wanderers determined to close out the expired league for good.

Beginning in 1921, the NHL faced competition from a third major league, the <a href="Canadian%20Prairies">prairie</a>-based <a href="Western%20Canada%20Hockey%20League">Western Canada Hockey League</a> (WCHL). With three leagues competing for talent, ice hockey players were among the highest-paid athletes in North America. They commanded salaries equivalent to the top <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> players of the era. The WCHL only survived for six seasons, merging with the PCHA in 1924, but challenged the NHL for the Stanley Cup four times. In the <a href="1923%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1923 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, the Senators defeated the <a href="Edmonton%20Eskimos%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Edmonton Eskimos</a> after eliminating the PCHA's Vancouver Millionaires. In <a href="1924%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1924</a>, the Canadiens defeated the PCHA's Millionaires and the WCHL's <a href="Calgary%20Tigers">Calgary Tigers</a> on the strength of two shutouts by <a href="Georges%20V%C3%A9zina">Georges Vezina</a> and a strong offensive showing by rookie forward <a href="Howie%20Morenz">Howie Morenz</a>.

In <a href="1924%E2%80%9325%20NHL%20season">1924–25</a>, the Hamilton Tigers finished first in the NHL after four consecutive last-place finishes. While the Canadiens and St. Patricks prepared to play in a semi-final playoff round, the Tigers' players, upset that the team had turned a sizable profit despite claiming financial difficulty, went on strike to demand a <a href="Canadian%20Dollar">C$</a>200 playoff bonus each. Threatened with fines, suspension and a possible lawsuit by league president Frank Calder, the players, led by <a href="Billy%20Burch">Billy Burch</a> and <a href="Shorty%20Green">Shorty Green</a>, held firm. Calder then suspended the entire team and declared Montreal the NHL champions after they defeated Toronto in the semi-final.

The Canadiens faced the <a href="Victoria%20Cougars">Victoria Cougars</a>, then of the WCHL, in the <a href="1925%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1925 Stanley Cup Finals</a>. Victoria defeated Montreal three games to one in the best-of-five final. In doing so, they became the last non-NHL team to win the Stanley Cup. The WCHL ceased operations one year later, with its assets purchased by the NHL for $300,000. The rights to the Tigers' players, meanwhile, were purchased for $75,000 by New York mobster <a href="Bill%20Dwyer%20%28mobster%29">Bill Dwyer</a> to stock his expansion <a href="New%20York%20Americans">New York Americans</a>. The Americans began play in 1925, replacing the Tigers.

The NHL grew to six teams in 1924, adding a second team in Montreal, the <a href="Montreal%20Maroons">Maroons</a>, and the first American team, the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>. The Bruins were purchased by <a href="Charles%20Adams%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Charles Adams</a>, a grocery store financier who first developed an interest in hockey during the Stanley Cup playoffs, paying $15,000 for the team. The Maroons were created to replace the Wanderers and to appeal to the English population of Montreal. The first NHL game played in the United States was a 2–1 Bruins victory over the Maroons at the <a href="Boston%20Arena">Boston Arena</a> on December 1, 1924, at an ice hockey venue which still exists today, and is used in the 21st century for <a href="Hockey%20East">American college hockey</a> and <a href="Northeastern%20Huskies">other indoor collegiate sports</a>.

The <a href="Montreal%20Forum">Montreal Forum</a>, which in later decades became synonymous with the Canadiens, was built in 1924 to house the Maroons. The Canadiens did not move into the Forum until two years later. The Forum hosted its first Stanley Cup final in its second year, as the Maroons defeated the WCHL's Victoria Cougars in the <a href="1926%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1926 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, the last time a non-NHL team competed for the Cup.

The New York Americans began play in 1925 along with the NHL's third American-based team, the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates%20%28NHL%29">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>. Three more teams were added for the <a href="1926%E2%80%9327%20NHL%20season">1926–27 season</a>. <a href="Tex%20Rickard">Tex Rickard</a>, operator of the then-new, 1925-completed <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden%20%281925%29">Madison Square Garden</a>, had reluctantly allowed the Americans into his arena the year before. However, the Americans were so popular in New York he felt his arena could support a second team. As a result, the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> were granted to Rickard on May 15, 1926. In November of that year, the league announced that the cities of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> would get teams. Detroit purchased the assets of the Victoria Cougars to stock the expansion <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Cougars</a>. The players of the <a href="Portland%20Rosebuds%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Portland Rosebuds</a> were sold to coffee tycoon <a href="Frederic%20McLaughlin">Frederic McLaughlin</a> for his new <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Black Hawks</a> team. The three new franchises brought the NHL to ten teams.

The Rangers reached the <a href="1928%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1928 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, in just their second season, against the Maroons. <a href="Lorne%20Chabot">Lorne Chabot</a> was injured early in the second game of the series, leaving the Rangers without a goaltender. As the Maroons were unwilling to allow the Rangers to substitute a goaltender watching from the Montreal Forum stands, Rangers coach <a href="Lester%20Patrick">Lester Patrick</a> was forced into goal himself. A defenceman during his playing days, the 44-year-old Patrick allowed only one goal on 19 shots as the Rangers won the game in overtime, 2–1. The Rangers signed New York Americans goaltender <a href="Joseph%20Anthony%20Miller">Joe Miller</a> the next day, and went on to capture the Stanley Cup in five games.

Throughout the NHL's first decade, Eddie Livingstone continued to press his claim to the Toronto franchise in court. On October 18, 1923, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Ontario">Supreme Court of Ontario</a> awarded Livingstone $100,000 in damages. St. Patricks owner <a href="Charles%20Querrie">Charlie Querrie</a> made numerous attempts to prevent Livingstone from collecting on his awards. In 1923, he transferred the ownership of his team to his wife, Ida, making her the first female owner in ice hockey history. The $100,000 award was later reduced to $10,000 by the <a href="Ontario%20Court%20of%20Appeal">Ontario Court of Appeal</a>, causing <a href="List%20of%20Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council%20cases%20originating%20in%20Canada%2C%201920%E2%80%9329">Livingstone to appeal</a> to the highest court in the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a> in London, England; the court denied his claim.

Despite the reduced awards, the Querries found the pressures of meeting their obligations to Livingstone too great and, as a result, placed the St. Patricks up for sale in 1927. On February 14, 1927, the St. Patricks were sold to a group represented by <a href="Conn%20Smythe">Conn Smythe</a> for $160,000 despite a potentially greater offer from a <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>-based group. Among the first moves Smythe made was to rename his team the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>.

When Smythe bought the Leafs, he promised that the team would win the Stanley Cup within five years. To that end, Smythe wanted to bring in a star player to help his team. In 1930, with the Senators struggling financially due to the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, they put <a href="King%20Clancy">King Clancy</a> up for sale. Smythe's partners could only offer $25,000 for Ottawa's defensive star, one-half of Ottawa's asking price. In an attempt to raise money, Smythe entered a <a href="thoroughbred">thoroughbred</a> racing horse he owned, Rare Jewel, in the <a href="Coronation%20Futurity%20Stakes">Coronation Futurity Stakes</a> at odds of 106–1. Rare Jewel won the race, earning Smythe over $15,000. Smythe then acquired Clancy for $35,000 and two players worth $15,000, which was an unprecedented price to pay for one player. It was also the only race Rare Jewel ever won.

Smythe also envisioned building a new shrine for his team. He described it as "a place where people can go in evening clothes, if they want to come there for a party or dinner ... a place that people can be proud to bring their wives or girlfriends to". Smythe purchased a piece of land at the corner of Church and <a href="Carlton%20Street">Carlton Street</a>s from the <a href="Eaton%27s">Eaton's</a> department store chain for $350,000. Skeptics argued that Smythe would never get the arena built, nor fill it, as the Depression was in full swing. They referred to the arena plan as "Smythe's Folly". To help fund the arena, the Leafs convinced construction workers to accept 20% of their wages in shares in the arena. Just 4½ months after breaking ground, <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a> opened on November 12, 1931. Many in the sold-out crowd of over 13,000 wore evening clothes in response to Smythe's stated goal in building the arena. In 1932, five years after Smythe's promise, the Leafs won the Stanley Cup in three games over the Rangers.

Maple Leaf Gardens also featured the famous "gondola", a broadcast booth specially constructed for <a href="Foster%20Hewitt">Foster Hewitt</a>. Hewitt began broadcasting hockey games in 1923 on <a href="CFCA-AM">CFCA</a>, a radio station owned by his father, <a href="W.%20A.%20Hewitt">W. A. Hewitt</a>. It was an assignment he initially did not want. Smythe supported the broadcast of Leafs games in contrast of other team owners, who feared that airing games on the radio would cut into gate receipts. By 1931, Hewitt had established himself as the voice of hockey in Canada with his famous <a href="catchphrase">catchphrase</a>: ""he shoots, he scores!"" heard first on the national "General Motors Hockey Broadcast" on the <a href="CNR%20Radio">CNR Radio</a> network. On January 1, 1933, Leafs' broadcasts were heard across Canada on 20 stations of CN Radio's successor, the <a href="Canadian%20Radio%20Broadcasting%20Commission">Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission</a> (today the <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a>). Hewitt's broadcasts quickly attracted audiences of over one million listeners. The broadcasts were a precursor to "<a href="Hockey%20Night%20in%20Canada">Hockey Night in Canada</a>", a Saturday night tradition that continues today.

On December 13, 1933, Bruins defenceman <a href="Eddie%20Shore">Eddie Shore</a>, in a daze following what he thought was a check by Toronto's <a href="Ace%20Bailey">Ace Bailey</a>, charged the latter player from behind, flipping Bailey into the air and causing him to suffer a severe skull fracture after he landed on his head. The check was so vicious that Bailey was given the <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a> before being transported to the hospital in Boston. <a href="Neurosurgery">Neurosurgeons</a> operated throughout the night to save his life; however, Bailey's prognosis was so grim that morning papers printed his death notice. Bailey survived, but he never played professionally again. Shore ultimately served a 16-game suspension for the hit, and avoided being charged with <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a> had Bailey died.

To raise money for Bailey's recovery, Maple Leaf Gardens hosted the <a href="Ace%20Bailey%20Benefit%20Game">Ace Bailey All-Star Benefit Game</a> on February 14, 1934. The Maple Leafs defeated an all-star team of players from the rest of the league 7–3 while raising over $20,000. Prior to the game, the Leafs announced that no Toronto player would ever wear Bailey's #6 again, marking the first time in NHL history that a team retired a player's jersey number. Before the game, each player came out and shook Bailey's hand as they received their all-star jersey. The last player to do so was Eddie Shore. The crowd, which had fallen silent as Shore approached, erupted into loud cheering as Bailey extended his hand towards his attacker. Elmer Ferguson described the moment as "the most completely dramatic event I ever saw in hockey".

While Smythe was building Maple Leaf Gardens, several other teams were facing financial difficulty. At the end of the <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20NHL%20season">1929–30 season</a>, the Pittsburgh Pirates were US$400,000 in debt and relocated to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, to become the <a href="Philadelphia%20Quakers%20%28NHL%29">Philadelphia Quakers</a>. The Quakers lasted only one season before suspending operations in 1931, along with the Ottawa Senators. The Quakers never returned, but Ottawa resumed operations in <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20NHL%20season">1932–33</a>. The Senators continued to struggle, and despite a promise by Calder in 1934 that the Senators would never leave "hockey's birthplace of Canada", the team was nonetheless transferred south to become the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Eagles">St. Louis Eagles</a>. The Eagles played only one year in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> before asking for permission to suspend operations. The league refused, and instead bought and dissolved the team. The Eagles' players were dispersed amongst the remaining teams. It was announced that the NHL would be an eight-team league in <a href="1935%E2%80%9336%20NHL%20season">1935–36</a>.

That summer, the Canadiens' franchise was for sale, after posting losses of $60,000 over the previous two seasons. Over forty thousand families and 150,000 individuals were receiving social assistance in Montreal. Owners Leo Dandurand and Joseph Cattarinich held negotiations with A. C. Sutphin to sell the club and move it to <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>. Just before the season, a syndicate of local Montreal businessmen, led by Maurice Forget and Ernest Savard, stepped forward to buy the club and prevent the transfer.

At the same time, the league reduced its <a href="salary%20cap">salary cap</a> to $62,500 per team, and $7,000 per player. Several well-paid star players were traded as teams attempted to fit under the cap. The biggest name was Montreal's Howie Morenz, a three-time <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Trophy</a> winner, two-time scoring leader and the face of the Canadiens organization. Drawing only 2,000 fans per game in an arena that held 10,000, Canadiens owner <a href="L%C3%A9o%20Dandurand">Léo Dandurand</a> sent his star to the Black Hawks. The Montreal fans voiced their opinion of the deal by giving Morenz a standing ovation when he scored against the Canadiens on the last day of the 1935 season. Less than two seasons later, Morenz was traded back to Montreal after a brief time playing for the Rangers.

On January 28, 1937, Morenz's skate caught on the ice while he was being checked by Chicago's <a href="Earl%20Seibert">Earl Seibert</a>; he broke his leg in four places. On March 8, Morenz died of a <a href="coronary%20embolism">coronary embolism</a>. Morenz's teammate <a href="Aur%C3%A8le%20Joliat">Aurèle Joliat</a> had a different explanation of his death: "Howie loved to play hockey more than anyone ever loved anything, and when he realized that he would never play again, he couldn't live with it. I think Howie died of a broken heart." On the day of his funeral, 50,000 people filed past Morenz's casket at centre ice of the Montreal Forum to pay their last respects to the man the media called "the <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> of hockey". A benefit game held in November 1937 raised $20,000 for Morenz's family as the NHL All-Stars defeated the Montreal Canadiens 6–5. Morenz was one of the first players elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame when it was created in 1945.

In the mid-1930s, Black Hawks owner and staunch American nationalist Frederic McLaughlin commanded his general manager to compile a team of only American players. At the time, <a href="Taffy%20Abel">Taffy Abel</a> was the only American-born player who was a regular player in the league. The Black Hawks hired Major League Baseball <a href="umpire%20%28baseball%29">umpire</a> <a href="Bill%20Stewart%20%28sports%20official%29">Bill Stewart</a> to be the first American coach in NHL history. They were led in goal by Minnesotan <a href="Mike%20Karakas">Mike Karakas</a>, one of eight Americans on the 14-man roster. The <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20NHL%20season">1937–38</a> Black Hawks "All-American" team won only 14 of 48 games, finishing third in the American division. In the playoffs, however, the Hawks upset the Canadiens and the Americans to reach the Stanley Cup Final against the heavily favoured Maple Leafs.

In the first game of the final, the Hawks were forced to use minor-league goaltender <a href="Alfie%20Moore">Alfie Moore</a> after Karakas suffered a broken toe. Moore led the Hawks to a 3–1 victory before being ruled ineligible to play the rest of the series by the NHL. After Chicago lost game two, Karakas returned wearing a steel-toed boot and led the Hawks to victories in games three and four, and the Stanley Cup. The <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20Chicago%20Black%20Hawks%20season">1938 Black Hawks</a> remain the only team in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup despite a losing regular-season record.

In the <a href="1942%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1942 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, the heavily favoured Maple Leafs initially found themselves unable to counter the fifth-place Red Wings' strategy of firing the puck into the offensive zone then chasing after it, losing the first three games of the final as a result. <a href="Jack%20Adams">Jack Adams</a>' "dump-and-chase" tactic led Leafs goaltender <a href="Turk%20Broda">Turk Broda</a> to declare the Wings "unbeatable". Toronto rebounded, however, winning the final four games, and the Stanley Cup. The 1942 Leafs remain the only team in NHL history to come back from a 3–0 deficit to win a championship series.

In financial difficulty, and unable to compete with the Canadiens for fan support in Montreal, the Maroons suspended operations prior to the <a href="1938%E2%80%9339%20NHL%20season">1938–39 season</a> after being denied permission to relocate to St. Louis. Six Maroons players were transferred to the Canadiens while three were sold to the Black Hawks. The Americans, also struggling in New York and under the control of the league, were turned over to <a href="Red%20Dutton">Red Dutton</a> in 1940 with orders to improve the club's finances. By 1942, 90 players had left the NHL for active duty during World War II. Continuing to struggle financially, and due to a lack of players, the Americans were suspended prior to the <a href="1942%E2%80%9343%20NHL%20season">1942–43 season</a>. Thus began what became known as the "<a href="Original%20Six">Original Six</a>" era of the National Hockey League.

The 1920s saw numerous rule innovations as the sport evolved. The Ottawa Senators won three Stanley Cups in the early 1920s using strong defence and the goaltending of <a href="Clint%20Benedict">Clint Benedict</a>, who recorded a record five <a href="shutout">shutout</a>s in a 24-game season in 1921. The Senators employed a strategy where they kept both defencemen and a forward in their own zone at all times after they gained a lead. After the Senators' third championship in 1924, Frank Calder made it illegal for more than two players to be in their defensive zone if the puck was not.

Defence continued to dominate the game, however, as in <a href="1928%E2%80%9329%20NHL%20season">1928–29</a>, the league averaged less than three goals per game. Canadiens goaltender <a href="George%20Hainsworth">George Hainsworth</a> set what remains a league record with 22 shutouts in only 44 games. As a result, the league allowed the use of the <a href="forward%20pass">forward pass</a> in all zones beginning in 1929; previously, forward passing was allowed only in the defensive and neutral zones. The change saw offence rise to 6.9 goals per game over the first third of the season as players began to park themselves on their opponent's goal crease. The league responded by introducing the <a href="offside%20%28ice%20hockey%29">offside</a> rule early in the 1929–30 season, barring offensive players from entering their opponent's zone before the puck. Despite this, <a href="Cooney%20Weiland">Cooney Weiland</a>, <a href="Dit%20Clapper">Dit Clapper</a>, and Howie Morenz all broke the 40-goal mark, the first players to do so since Joe Malone scored 44 in the NHL's first season.

Boston Bruins governor Charles Adams had long disliked the defensive tactic of shooting the puck the length of the ice ("<a href="icing%20%28ice%20hockey%29">icing</a>") to relieve pressure. After the New York Americans iced the puck 61 times in a 3–2 win in Boston during the <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20NHL%20season">1936–37 season</a>, Adams promised that he would see to it that the Bruins played a similar style in New York. True to his word, the Bruins iced the puck 87 times in a 0–0 tie at Madison Square Garden. The NHL introduced the icing rule the following season, calling for a faceoff in the offending team's defensive zone after each infraction.

Benedict became the first goaltender to wear facial protection during a game, as he donned a leather mask to protect a broken nose on January 20, 1930. The mask obscured Benedict's vision, and he abandoned it shortly after. Later that season, Benedict was again hit by a puck, effectively ending his NHL career. It was not the first attempt at changing how goaltenders played their position. When the NHL was formed, the league abandoned the rule forbidding goaltenders from leaving their feet to make a save. While the NHA imposed a $2 fine every time a goalie left his feet, Calder dismissed the idea for the NHL. He was quoted as saying: "as far as I'm concerned, they can stand on their head if they choose to". The phrase became, and remains today, a popular way to describe a goaltender who plays a great game.

<a href="Art%20Ross">Art Ross</a> was an early innovator of the game. He designed rounded goal nets that became the league standard, replacing the old square-backed nets. He also successfully argued for using synthetic rubber pucks rather than real rubber. Some of Ross' inventions did not catch on, however. Ross invented a puck with rounded edges that was rejected after goaltenders complained about their erratic behaviour on the ice. He also created a two-piece hockey stick that had a metal shaft and replaceable wooden blades. The idea did not catch on at the time, but was a forerunner to modern composite sticks used today.

Woolly mammoth

The woolly mammoth ("Mammuthus primigenius") is an extinct species of <a href="mammoth">mammoth</a> that lived during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> until its extinction in the early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> epoch. It was one of the last in a line of mammoth species, beginning with "<a href="Mammuthus%20subplanifrons">Mammuthus subplanifrons</a>" in the early <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>. The woolly mammoth diverged from the <a href="steppe%20mammoth">steppe mammoth</a> about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the <a href="Asian%20elephant">Asian elephant</a>. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any <a href="Prehistory">prehistoric</a> animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> and <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric <a href="cave%20painting">cave painting</a>s. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of <a href="legendary%20creature">legendary creature</a>s. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> in 1796.

The woolly mammoth was roughly the same size as modern <a href="African%20elephant">African elephant</a>s. Males reached shoulder heights between and weighed up to . Females reached in shoulder heights and weighed up to . A newborn calf weighed about . The woolly mammoth was well adapted to the cold environment during the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">last ice age</a>. It was covered in fur, with an outer covering of long guard hairs and a shorter undercoat. The colour of the <a href="coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a> varied from dark to light. The ears and tail were short to minimise <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a> and heat loss. It had long, curved <a href="tusk">tusk</a>s and four <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molars</a>, which were replaced six times during the lifetime of an individual. Its behaviour was similar to that of modern elephants, and it used its tusks and trunk for manipulating objects, fighting, and foraging. The diet of the woolly mammoth was mainly grasses and <a href="Cyperaceae">sedges</a>. Individuals could probably reach the age of 60. Its habitat was the <a href="mammoth%20steppe">mammoth steppe</a>, which stretched across northern Eurasia and North America.

The woolly mammoth coexisted with early humans, who used its bones and tusks for making art, tools, and dwellings, and the species was also hunted for food. It disappeared from its mainland range at the end of the Pleistocene 10,000 years ago, most likely through climate change and consequent shrinkage of its habitat, hunting by humans, or a combination of the two. Isolated populations survived on <a href="Saint%20Paul%20Island%20%28Alaska%29">St. Paul Island</a> until 5,600 years ago and on <a href="Wrangel%20Island">Wrangel Island</a> until 4,000 years ago. After its extinction, humans continued using its <a href="ivory">ivory</a> as a raw material, a tradition that continues today. With a <a href="genome%20project">genome project</a> for the mammoth completed in 2015, it has been proposed the species could be recreated through various means, but none of these is yet feasible.

Remains of various extinct elephants were known by Europeans for centuries, but were generally interpreted, based on <a href="bible">biblical</a> accounts, as the remains of <a href="legendary%20creatures">legendary creatures</a> such as <a href="behemoth">behemoth</a>s or <a href="Giant%20%28mythology%29">giants</a>. They were thought to be remains of modern elephants that had been brought to Europe during the <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman Republic</a>, for example the <a href="war%20elephants">war elephants</a> of <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a> and <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus of Epirus</a>, or animals that had wandered north. The first woolly mammoth remains studied by European scientists were examined by <a href="Hans%20Sloane">Hans Sloane</a> in 1728 and consisted of fossilised teeth and tusks from Siberia. Sloane was the first to recognise that the remains belonged to <a href="elephant">elephant</a>s. Sloane turned to another biblical explanation for the presence of elephants in the Arctic, asserting that they had been buried during the <a href="Deluge%20myth">Great Flood</a>, and that Siberia had previously been tropical before a drastic climate change. Others interpreted Sloane's conclusion slightly differently, arguing the flood had carried elephants from the <a href="tropics">tropics</a> to the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a>. Sloane's paper was based on travellers' descriptions and a few scattered bones collected in Siberia and Britain. He discussed the question of whether or not the remains were from elephants, but drew no conclusions. In 1738, the German zoologist <a href="Johann%20Philipp%20Breyne">Johann Philipp Breyne</a> argued that mammoth fossils represented some kind of elephant. He could not explain why a tropical animal would be found in such a cold area as Siberia, and suggested that they might have been transported there by the Great Flood. In 1796, <a href="French%20people">French</a> anatomist <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> was the first to identify the woolly mammoth remains not as modern elephants transported to the Arctic, but as an entirely new species. He argued this species had gone <a href="Extinction">extinct</a> and no longer existed, a concept that was not widely accepted at the time.

Following Cuvier's identification, German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Blumenbach">Johann Friedrich Blumenbach</a> gave the woolly mammoth its scientific name, "Elephas primigenius", in 1799, placing it in the same <a href="genus">genus</a> as the <a href="Asian%20elephant">Asian elephant</a>. This name is Latin for "first elephant". Cuvier coined the name "Elephas mammonteus" a few months later, but the former name was subsequently used. In 1828, the British naturalist <a href="Joshua%20Brookes">Joshua Brookes</a> used the name "Mammuthus borealis" for woolly mammoth fossils in his collection that he put up for sale, thereby coining a new genus name. Where and how the word "mammoth" originated is unclear. According to the" Oxford English Dictionary", it comes from an old <a href="Vogul">Vogul</a> word "mēmoŋt", "earth-horn". It may be a version of "mehemot", the <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> version of the biblical word "behemoth". Another possible origin is <a href="Estonian%20language">Estonian</a>, where "maa" means "earth", and "mutt" means "<a href="mole%20%28animal%29">mole</a>". The word was first used in Europe during the early 17th century, when referring to "maimanto" tusks discovered in Siberia. American president <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, who had a keen interest in <a href="palaeontology">palaeontology</a>, was partially responsible for transforming the word "mammoth" from a noun describing the prehistoric elephant to an adjective describing anything of surprisingly large size. The first recorded use of the word as an adjective was in a description of a wheel of cheese (the "<a href="Cheshire%20Mammoth%20Cheese">Cheshire Mammoth Cheese</a>") given to Jefferson in 1802.

By the early 20th century, the taxonomy of extinct elephants was complex. In 1942, American palaoentologist <a href="Henry%20Fairfield%20Osborn">Henry Fairfield Osborn</a>'s posthumous monograph on the <a href="Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a> was published, wherein he used various taxon names that had previously been proposed for mammoth species, including replacing "Mammuthus" with "Mammonteus", as he believed the former name to be invalidly published. Mammoth taxonomy was simplified by various researchers from the 1970s onwards, all species were retained in the genus "Mammuthus", and many proposed differences between species were instead interpreted as <a href="intraspecific">intraspecific</a> variation. Osborn chose two molars (found in Siberia and <a href="Osterode%20%28district%29">Osterode</a>) from Blumenbach's collection at <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen%20University">Göttingen University</a> as the <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a> specimens for the woolly mammoth, since <a href="holotype">holotype</a> designation was not practised in Blumenbach's time. Russian palaeontologist <a href="Vera%20Gromova">Vera Gromova</a> further proposed the former should be considered the lectotype with the latter as paralectotype. Both molars were thought lost by the 1980s, and the more complete "Taimyr mammoth" found in Siberia in 1948 was therefore proposed as the <a href="neotype">neotype</a> specimen in 1990. Resolutions to historical issues about the validity of the genus name "Mammuthus" and the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> designation of "E. primigenius" were also proposed. The paralectotype molar (specimen GZG.V.010.018) has since been located in the Göttingen University collection, identified by comparing it with Osborn's illustration of a cast.

The earliest known members of the <a href="Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>, the <a href="clade">clade</a> which contains modern elephants, existed about 55 million years ago around the <a href="Tethys%20Sea">Tethys Sea</a>. The closest known relatives of the Proboscidea are the <a href="sirenians">sirenians</a> (dugongs and manatees) and the <a href="hyraxes">hyraxes</a> (an order of small, herbivorous mammals). The family <a href="Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> existed 6 million years ago in Africa and includes the modern elephants and the mammoths. Among many now extinct clades, the <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a> ("Mammut") is only a distant relative of the mammoths, and part of the separate family <a href="Mammutidae">Mammutidae</a>, which diverged 25 million years before the mammoths evolved. The following <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> shows the placement of the genus "Mammuthus" among other proboscideans, based on characteristics of the <a href="hyoid%20bone">hyoid bone</a> in the neck:

In 2005, researchers assembled a complete <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial genome</a> profile of the woolly mammoth, which allowed them to trace the close evolutionary relationship between mammoths and Asian elephants ("Elephas maximus"). A 2015 DNA review confirmed Asian elephants as the closest living relative of the woolly mammoth. African elephants ("Loxodonta africana") branched away from this clade around 6 million years ago, close to the time of the similar split between <a href="Pan%20%28genus%29">chimpanzee</a>s and humans. Before the publication of the <a href="Neanderthal%20genome">Neanderthal genome</a>, many researchers expected the first fully sequenced <a href="nuclear%20genome">nuclear genome</a> of an extinct species would be that of the mammoth. A 2010 study confirmed these relationships, and suggested the mammoth and Asian elephant lineages diverged 5.8–7.8 million years ago, while African elephants diverged from an earlier common ancestor 6.6–8.8 million years ago. In 2008, much of the woolly mammoth's <a href="chromosome">chromosomal</a> <a href="DNA">DNA</a> was mapped. The analysis showed that the woolly mammoth and the African elephant are 98.55% to 99.40% identical. The team mapped the woolly mammoth's nuclear genome sequence by extracting DNA from the hair follicles of both a 20,000-year-old mammoth retrieved from <a href="permafrost">permafrost</a> and another that died 60,000 years ago. In 2012, <a href="proteins">proteins</a> were confidently identified for the first time, collected from a 43,000-year-old woolly mammoth.

Since many remains of each species of mammoth are known from several localities, reconstructing the evolutionary history of the genus through <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> studies is possible. Mammoth species can be identified from the number of enamel ridges (or <a href="Lamella%20%28anatomy%29">lamellar plates</a>) on their <a href="molars">molars</a>; primitive species had few ridges, and the number increased gradually as new species evolved to feed on more abrasive food items. The crowns of the teeth became deeper in height and the skulls became taller to accommodate this. At the same time, the skulls became shorter from front to back to minimise the weight of the head. The short and tall skulls of woolly and <a href="Columbian%20mammoths">Columbian mammoths</a> ("Mammuthus columbi") are the culmination of this process.

The first known members of the genus "Mammuthus" are the African species "<a href="Mammuthus%20subplanifrons">Mammuthus subplanifrons</a>" from the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, and "<a href="M.%20africanavus">M. africanavus</a>" from the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. The former is thought to be the ancestor of later forms. Mammoths entered Europe around 3 million years ago. The earliest European mammoth has been named "<a href="M.%20rumanus">M. rumanus</a>"; it spread across Europe and China. Only its molars are known, which show that it had 8–10 enamel ridges. A population evolved 12–14 ridges, splitting off from and replacing the earlier type, becoming "<a href="M.%20meridionalis">M. meridionalis</a>" about 2–1.7 million years ago. In turn, this species was replaced by the <a href="steppe%20mammoth">steppe mammoth</a> ("M. trogontherii") with 18–20 ridges, which evolved in eastern Asia around 1 million years ago. The Columbian mammoth evolved from a population of "M. trogontherii" that had crossed the <a href="Bering%20Strait">Bering Strait</a> and entered North America about 1.5 million years ago; it retained a similar number of molar ridges. Mammoths derived from "M. trogontherii" evolved molars with 26 ridges 400,000 years ago in Siberia and became the woolly mammoth. Woolly mammoths entered North America about 100,000 years ago. Asian elephants have a variable number of enamel ridges that is intermediate between those of the Columbian/steppe mammoth and the woolly mammoth.

Individuals and populations showing transitional morphologies between each of the mammoth species are known, and primitive and <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> species coexisted, as well, until the former disappeared. The different species and their intermediate forms have therefore been termed "<a href="chronospecies">chronospecies</a>". Many taxa intermediate between "M. primigenius" and other mammoths have also been proposed, but their validity is uncertain; depending on author, they are either considered primitive forms of an advanced species or advanced forms of a primitive species. Distinguishing and determining these intermediate forms has been called one of the most long-lasting and complicated problems in Quaternary palaeontology. Regional and intermediate species and subspecies such as "M. intermedius", "M. chosaricus", "M. p. primigenius", "M. p. jatzkovi", "M. p. sibiricus", "M. p. fraasi", "M. p. leith-adamsi", "M. p. hydruntinus", "M. p. astensis", "M. p. americanus", "M. p. compressus", and "M. p. alaskensis" have been proposed.

A 2011 genetic study showed that two examined specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of woolly mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as "M. jeffersonii" may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where "M. columbi" and "M. primigenius" overlapped formed a <a href="metapopulation">metapopulation</a> of hybrids with varying morphology. It also suggested that Eurasian "M. primigenius" had a similar relationship with "M. trogontherii" in areas where their range overlapped.

The appearance of the woolly mammoth is probably the best known of any prehistoric animal due to the many frozen specimens with preserved soft tissue and depictions by contemporary humans in their art. Fully grown males reached shoulder heights between and weighed up to . This is almost as large as extant male African elephants, which commonly reach a shoulder height of , and is less than the size of the earlier mammoth species "M. meridionalis" and "M. trogontherii", and the contemporary "M. columbi". The reason for the smaller size is unknown. Female woolly mammoths reached in shoulder heights and were built more lightly than males, weighing up to . A newborn calf would have weighed about . These sizes are deduced from comparison with modern elephants of similar size. Few frozen specimens have preserved genitals, so the gender is usually determined through examination of the skeleton. The best indication of sex is the size of the <a href="pelvic">pelvic</a> girdle, since the opening that functions as the birth canal is always wider in females than in males. Though the mammoths on Wrangel Island were smaller than those of the mainland, their size varied, and they were not small enough to be considered "dwarves". The last woolly mammoth populations are claimed to have decreased in size and increased their <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, but this was dismissed in a 2012 study.

Woolly mammoths had several adaptations to the cold, most noticeably the layer of fur covering all parts of their bodies. Other adaptations to cold weather include ears that are far smaller than those of modern elephants; they were about long and across, and the ear of the 6- to 12-month-old frozen calf "Dima" was under long. The small ears reduced heat loss and <a href="frostbite">frostbite</a>, and the tail was short for the same reason, only long in the "Berezovka mammoth". The tail contained 21 vertebrae, whereas the tails of modern elephants contain 28–33. Their skin was no thicker than that of present-day elephants, between . They had a layer of fat up to thick under the skin, which helped to keep them warm. Woolly mammoths had broad flaps of skin under their tails which covered the <a href="anus">anus</a>; this is also seen in modern elephants.

Other characteristic features depicted in <a href="cave%20painting">cave painting</a>s include a large, high, single-domed head and a sloping back with a high shoulder hump; this shape resulted from the <a href="spinous%20process">spinous process</a>es of the back vertebrae decreasing in length from front to rear. These features were not present in juveniles, which had convex backs like Asian elephants. Another feature shown in cave paintings was confirmed by the discovery of a frozen specimen in 1924, an adult nicknamed the "Middle Kolyma mammoth", which was preserved with a complete trunk tip. Unlike the trunk lobes of modern elephants, the upper "finger" at the tip of the trunk had a long pointed lobe and was long, while the lower "thumb" was and was broader. The trunk of "Dima" was long, whereas the trunk of the adult "Liakhov mammoth" was long. The well-preserved trunk of a juvenile specimen nicknamed "<a href="Yuka%20%28mammoth%29">Yuka</a>" was described in 2015, and it was shown to possess a fleshy expansion a third above the tip. Rather than oval as the rest of the trunk, this part was ellipsoidal in cross section, and double the size in diameter. The feature was also shown to be present in two other specimens, of different sexes and ages.

The <a href="Coat%20%28animal%29">coat</a> consisted of an outer layer of long, coarse "guard hair", which was on the upper part of the body, up to in length on the flanks and underside, and in diameter, and a denser inner layer of shorter, slightly curly under-wool, up to long and in diameter. The hairs on the upper leg were up to long, and those of the feet were long, reaching the toes. The hairs on the head were relatively short, but longer on the underside and the sides of the trunk. The tail was extended by coarse hairs up to long, which were thicker than the guard hairs. The woolly mammoth likely <a href="moulting">moulted</a> seasonally, and the heaviest fur was shed during spring. Since mammoth carcasses were more likely to be preserved, possibly only the winter coat has been preserved in frozen specimens. Modern elephants have much less hair, though juveniles have a more extensive covering of hair than adults. Comparison between the over-hairs of woolly mammoths and extant elephants show that they did not differ much in overall morphology. Woolly mammoths had numerous <a href="sebaceous%20gland">sebaceous gland</a>s in their skin, which secreted oils into their hair; this would have improved the wool's insulation, repelled water, and given the fur a glossy sheen.

Preserved woolly mammoth fur is orange-brown, but this is believed to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of <a href="pigment">pigment</a>ation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the <a href="Melanocortin%201%20receptor">"Mc1r" gene</a> (which influences hair colour in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two <a href="allele">allele</a>s were found: a <a href="dominance%20%28genetics%29">dominant</a> (fully active) and a <a href="recessive%20trait">recessive</a> (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive" Mc1r" alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from nonpigmented on the overhairs, bicoloured, nonpigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and nonpigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.

Woolly mammoths had very long tusks (modified <a href="incisor">incisor</a> teeth), which were more curved than those of modern elephants. The largest known male tusk is long and weighs , but and was a more typical size. Female tusks were smaller and thinner, and weighing . The sheaths of the tusks were parallel and spaced closely. About a quarter of the length was inside the sockets. The tusks grew spirally in opposite directions from the base and continued in a curve until the tips pointed towards each other, sometimes crossing. In this way, most of the weight would have been close to the skull, and less <a href="torque">torque</a> would occur than with straight tusks. The tusks were usually asymmetrical and showed considerable variation, with some tusks curving down instead of outwards and some being shorter due to breakage. Calves developed small <a href="milk%20tusks">milk tusks</a> a few centimetres long at six months old, which were replaced by permanent tusks a year later. Tusk growth continued throughout life, but became slower as the animal reached adulthood. The tusks grew by each year. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths with small or no tusks, but whether this reflected reality or was artistic license is unknown. Female Asian elephants have no tusks, but no fossil evidence indicates that any adult woolly mammoths lacked them.

Woolly mammoths had four functional <a href="molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a> teeth at a time, two in the upper jaw and two in the lower. About of the crown was within the jaw, and was above. The crown was continually pushed forwards and up as it wore down, comparable to a <a href="conveyor%20belt">conveyor belt</a>. The teeth had up to 26 separated ridges of <a href="Tooth%20enamel">enamel</a>, which were themselves covered in "prisms" that were directed towards the chewing surface. These were quite wear-resistant and kept together by <a href="cementum">cementum</a> and <a href="dentine">dentine</a>. A mammoth had six sets of molars throughout a lifetime, which were replaced five times, though a few specimens with a seventh set are known. The latter condition could extend the lifespan of the individual, unless the tooth consisted of only a few plates. The first molars were about the size of those of a human, , the third were 15 cm (6 in) long, and the sixth were about long and weighed . The molars grew larger and contained more ridges with each replacement. The woolly mammoth is considered to have had the most complex molars of any elephant.

Distortion in the molars is the most common health problem found in woolly mammoth fossils. Sometimes, the replacement was disrupted, and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this. Teeth from Britain showed that 2% of specimens had <a href="periodontal%20disease">periodontal disease</a>, with half of these containing <a href="caries">caries</a>. The teeth also sometimes had <a href="cancerous">cancerous</a> growths.

Adult woolly mammoths could effectively defend themselves from predators with their tusks, trunks and size, but juveniles and weakened adults were vulnerable to pack hunters such as <a href="wolves">wolves</a>, <a href="cave%20hyena">cave hyena</a>s and large <a href="felidae">felines</a>. The tusks may also have been used in intraspecies fighting, such as fights over <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a> or mates. Display of the large tusks of males could also have been used to attract females, and to intimidate rivals. Because of their curvature, the tusks were not suitable for stabbing, but may have been used for hitting, as indicated by injuries to some fossil shoulder blades. The very long hairs on the tail probably compensated for the shortness of the tail, enabling its use as a <a href="flyswatter">flyswatter</a>, similar to the tail on modern elephants. As in modern elephants, the sensitive and muscular trunk worked as a limb-like organ with many functions. It was used for manipulating objects, and in social interactions. The well-preserved foot of the adult male "<a href="Yukagir%20mammoth">Yukagir mammoth</a>" shows that the soles of the feet contained many cracks that would have helped in gripping surfaces during locomotion. Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths walked on their toes and had large, fleshy pads behind the toes. 

Like modern elephants, woolly mammoths were likely very social and lived in <a href="matriarchal">matriarchal</a> (female-led) family groups. This is supported by fossil assemblages and cave paintings showing groups. So, most of their other social behaviours probably were similar to those of modern elephants. How many mammoths lived at one location at a time is unknown, as fossil deposits are often accumulations of individuals that died over long periods of time. The numbers likely varied by season and lifecycle events. Modern elephants can form large herds, sometimes consisting of multiple family groups, and these herds can include thousands of animals migrating together. Mammoths may have formed large herds more often, since animals that live in open areas are more likely to do this than those in forested areas. Trackways made by a woolly mammoth herd 11,300–11,000 years ago have been found in the <a href="St.%20Mary%20Reservoir">St. Mary Reservoir</a> in Canada, showing that in this case almost equal numbers of adults, subadults, and juveniles were found. The adults had a stride of , and the juveniles ran to keep up. 

The woolly mammoth was probably the most specialised member of the family Elephantidae. They had lipopexia (fat storage) in their neck and <a href="withers">withers</a>, for times when food availability was insufficient during winter, and their first three molars grew more quickly than in the calves of modern elephants. The expansion identified on the trunk of "Yuka" and other specimens was suggested to function as a "fur mitten"; the trunk tip was not covered in fur, but was used for foraging during winter, and could have been heated by curling it into the expansion. The expansion could be used to melt snow if a shortage of water to drink existed, as melting it directly inside the mouth could disturb the thermal balance of the animal. As in <a href="reindeer">reindeer</a> and <a href="musk%20oxen">musk oxen</a>, the <a href="haemoglobin">haemoglobin</a> of the woolly mammoth was adapted to the cold, with three mutations to improve oxygen delivery around the body and prevent freezing. This feature may have helped the mammoths to live at high latitudes.

In a 2015 study, high-quality <a href="genome">genome</a> sequences from three Asian elephants and two woolly mammoths were compared. About 1.4 million DNA nucleotide differences were found between mammoths and elephants, which affect the sequence of more than 1,600 proteins. Differences were noted in genes for a number of aspects of physiology and biology that would be relevant to Arctic survival, including development of skin and hair, storage and metabolism of adipose tissue, and perceiving temperature. Genes related to both sensing temperature and transmitting that sensation to the brain were altered. One of the heat-sensing genes encodes a protein, TRPV3, found in skin, which also affects hair growth. When inserted into human cells, the mammoth's version of the protein was found to be less sensitive to heat than the elephant's. This is consistent with a previous observation that mice lacking active TRPV3 are likely to spend more time in cooler cage locations than wild-type mice, and have wavier hair. Also, several alterations in circadian clock genes were found, perhaps needed to cope with the extreme polar variation in length of daylight. Similar mutations are known in other Arctic mammals, such as reindeer.

Food at various stages of digestion has been found in the intestines of several woolly mammoths, giving a good picture of their diet. Woolly mammoths sustained themselves on plant food, mainly grasses and sedges, which were supplemented with <a href="herbaceous%20plant">herbaceous plant</a>s, <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a>s, <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s, <a href="moss">moss</a>es, and tree matter. The composition and exact varieties differed from location to location. Woolly mammoths needed a varied diet to support their growth, like modern elephants. An adult of 6 tons would need to eat daily, and may have <a href="foraged">foraged</a> as long as 20 hours every day. The two-fingered tip of the trunk was probably adapted for picking up the short grasses of the last <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a> (<a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">Quaternary glaciation</a>, 2.58 million years ago to present) by wrapping around them, whereas modern elephants curl their trunks around the longer grass of their tropical environments. The trunk could also be used for pulling off large grass tufts, delicately picking <a href="bud">bud</a>s and flowers, and tearing off leaves and branches where trees and shrubs were present. The "Yukagir mammoth" had ingested plant matter that contained spores of <a href="coprophilous%20fungi">dung fungus</a>. <a href="Isotope%20analysis">Isotope analysis</a> shows that woolly mammoths fed mainly on <a href="C3%20plants">C3 plants</a>, unlike horses and rhinos.

Scientists identified milk in the stomach and <a href="faecal%20matter">faecal matter</a> in the intestines of the mammoth calf "<a href="Lyuba">Lyuba</a>". The faecal matter may have been eaten by "Lyuba" to promote development of the <a href="gut%20flora">intestinal microbes</a> necessary for digestion of vegetation, as is the case in modern elephants. An isotope analysis of woolly mammoths from Yukon showed that the young nursed for at least 3 years, and were <a href="weaned">weaned</a> and gradually changed to a diet of plants when they were 2-3 years old. This is later than in modern elephants and may be due to a higher risk of predator attack or difficulty in obtaining food during the long periods of winter darkness at high latitudes.

The molars were adapted to their diet of coarse tundra grasses, with more enamel plates and a higher crown than their earlier, southern relatives. The woolly mammoth chewed its food by using its powerful jaw muscles to move the mandible forwards and close the mouth, then backwards while opening; the sharp enamel ridges thereby cut across each other, grinding the food. The ridges were wear-resistant to enable the animal to chew large quantities of food, which often contained grit. Woolly mammoths may have used their tusks as shovels to clear snow from the ground and reach the vegetation buried below, and to break ice to drink. This is indicated on many preserved tusks by flat, polished sections up to long on the part of the surface that would have reached the ground. The tusks were also used for obtaining food in other ways, such as digging up plants and stripping off bark.

The lifespan of mammals is related to their size, and since modern elephants can reach the age of 60 years, the same is thought to be true for woolly mammoths, which were of a similar size. The age of a mammoth can be roughly determined by counting the <a href="growth%20rings">growth rings</a> of its tusks when viewed in cross section, but this does not account for its early years, as these are represented by the tips of the tusks, which are usually worn away. In the remaining part of the tusk, each major line represents a year, and weekly and daily ones can be found in between. Dark bands correspond to summers, so determining the season in which a mammoth died is possible. The growth of the tusks slowed when foraging became harder, for example during winter, during disease, or when a male was banished from the herd (male elephants live with their herds until about the age of 10). Mammoth tusks dating to the harshest period of the last glaciation 25–20,000 years ago show slower growth rates. Woolly mammoths continued growing past adulthood, like other elephants. Unfused limb bones show that males grew until they reached the age of 40, and females grew until they were 25. The frozen calf "Dima" was tall when it died at the age of 6–12 months. At this age, the second set of molars would be in the process of erupting, and the first set would be worn out at 18 months of age. The third set of molars lasted for 10 years, and this process was repeated until the final, sixth set emerged when the animal was 30 years old. When the last set of molars was worn out, the animal would be unable to chew and feed, and it would die of starvation. A study of North American mammoths found that they often died during winter or spring, the hardest times for northern animals to survive.

The best-preserved head of a frozen adult specimen, that of a male nicknamed the "Yukagir mammoth", shows that woolly mammoths had temporal glands between the ear and the eye. This feature indicates that, like bull elephants, male woolly mammoths also entered "<a href="musth">musth</a>", a period of heightened aggressiveness. The glands are used especially by males to produce an oily substance with a strong smell called <a href="temporin">temporin</a>. Their fur may have helped in spreading the scent further.

Examination of preserved calves shows that they were all born during spring and summer, and since modern elephants have <a href="gestation%20periods">gestation periods</a> of 21–22 months, the <a href="mating%20season">mating season</a> probably was from summer to autumn. <a href="%CE%B415N">δ15N</a> isotopic analysis of the teeth of "Lyuba" has demonstrated their <a href="prenatal%20development">prenatal development</a>, and indicates its gestation period was similar to that of a modern elephant, and that it was born in spring.

Evidence of several different <a href="bone%20disease">bone disease</a>s has been found in woolly mammoths. The most common of these was <a href="osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a>, found in 2% of specimens. One specimen from Switzerland had several fused <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e as a result of this condition. The "Yukagir mammoth" had suffered from <a href="spondylitis">spondylitis</a> in two vertebrae, and <a href="osteomyelitis">osteomyelitis</a> is also known from some specimens. Several specimens have healed <a href="bone%20fracture">bone fracture</a>s, showing that the animals had survived these injuries. An abnormal number of cervical vertebrae has been found in 33% of specimens from the North Sea region, probably due to inbreeding in a declining population. <a href="Parasitism">Parasitic</a> flies and <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a> were identified in the gut of the calf "Dima".

The habitat of the woolly mammoth is known as "<a href="mammoth%20steppe">mammoth steppe</a>" or "tundra steppe". This environment stretched across northern Asia, many parts of Europe, and the northern part of North America during the last ice age. It was similar to the grassy <a href="steppes">steppes</a> of modern Russia, but the <a href="flora">flora</a> was more diverse, abundant, and grew faster. Grasses, sedges, shrubs, and herbaceous plants were present, and scattered trees were mainly found in southern regions. This habitat was not dominated by ice and snow, as is popularly believed, since these regions are thought to have been <a href="high-pressure%20area">high-pressure area</a>s at the time. The habitat of the woolly mammoth also supported other grazing herbivores such as the <a href="woolly%20rhinoceros">woolly rhinoceros</a>, <a href="Equus%20%28genus%29">wild horses</a>, and <a href="bison">bison</a>. A 2014 study concluded that <a href="forb">forb</a>s (a group of herbaceous plants) were more important in the steppe-tundra than previously acknowledged, and that it was a primary food source for the ice-age megafauna.

The southernmost woolly mammoth specimen known is from the <a href="Shandong%20province">Shandong province</a> of China, and is 33,000 years old. The southernmost European remains are from the <a href="Depression%20of%20Granada">Depression of Granada</a> in Spain and are of roughly the same age. DNA studies have helped determine the <a href="phylogeography">phylogeography</a> of the woolly mammoth. A 2008 DNA study showed two distinct groups of woolly mammoths: one that became extinct 45,000 years ago and another one that became extinct 12,000 years ago. The two groups are speculated to be divergent enough to be characterised as <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>. The group that became extinct earlier stayed in the middle of the high Arctic, while the group with the later extinction had a much wider range. Recent stable isotope studies of Siberian and New World mammoths have shown there were also differences in climatic conditions on either side of the <a href="Beringia">Bering land bridge</a>, with Siberia being more uniformly cold and dry throughout the Late Pleistocene. During the <a href="Younger%20Dryas">Younger Dryas</a> age, woolly mammoths briefly expanded into north-east Europe, whereafter the mainland populations became extinct.

A 2008 genetic study showed that some of the woolly mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia migrated back about 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the <a href="Hot%20Springs%20sinkhole">Hot Springs sinkhole</a> of <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a> where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were <a href="sympatry">sympatric</a> and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there.

Modern humans coexisted with woolly mammoths during the <a href="Upper%20Palaeolithic">Upper Palaeolithic</a> period when the humans entered Europe from Africa between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Before this, <a href="Neanderthals">Neanderthals</a> had coexisted with mammoths during the <a href="Middle%20Palaeolithic">Middle Palaeolithic</a>, and already used mammoth bones for toolmaking and building materials. Woolly mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. <a href="William%20Buckland">William Buckland</a> published his discovery of the <a href="Red%20Lady%20of%20Paviland">Red Lady of Paviland</a> skeleton in 1823, which was found in a cave alongside woolly mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, <a href="%C3%89douard%20Lartet">Édouard Lartet</a> found an engraving of a woolly mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the <a href="Abri%20de%20la%20Madeleine">Abri de la Madeleine</a> cave in <a href="Dordogne">Dordogne</a>, France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.

The woolly mammoth is the third-most depicted animal in ice-age art, after horses and bison, and these images were produced between 35,000 and 11,500 years ago. Today, more than 500 depictions of woolly mammoths are known, in media ranging from cave paintings and engravings on the walls of 46 caves in Russia, France, and Spain to engravings and sculptures (termed "<a href="portable%20art">portable art</a>") made from ivory, antler, stone and bone. Cave paintings of woolly mammoths exist in several styles and sizes. The French <a href="Rouffignac%20Cave">Rouffignac Cave</a> has the most depictions, 159, and some of the drawings are more than in length. Other notable caves with mammoth depictions are the <a href="Chauvet%20Cave">Chauvet Cave</a>, <a href="Les%20Combarelles%20Cave">Les Combarelles Cave</a>, and <a href="Font-de-Gaume">Font-de-Gaume</a>. A depiction in the <a href="Cave%20of%20El%20Castillo">Cave of El Castillo</a> may instead show "<a href="Palaeoloxodon">Palaeoloxodon</a>", the "straight-tusked elephant".

"Portable art" can be more accurately dated than cave art since it is found in the same deposits as tools and other ice-age artefacts. The largest collection of portable mammoth art, consisting of 62 depictions on 47 plaques, was found in the 1960s at an excavated open-air camp near <a href="G%C3%B6nnersdorf">Gönnersdorf</a> in Germany. A correlation between the number of mammoths depicted and the species that were most often hunted does not seem to existd, since reindeer bones are the most frequently found animal remains at the site. Two <a href="spear%20throwers">spear throwers</a> shaped as woolly mammoths have also been found in France. Some portable mammoth depictions may not have been produced where they were discovered, but could have moved around by ancient trading.

Woolly mammoth bones were used as construction material for dwellings by both Neanderthals and modern humans during the ice age. More than 70 such dwellings are known, mainly from the <a href="Russian%20Plain">Russian Plain</a>. The bases of the huts were circular, and ranged from . The arrangement of dwellings varied, and ranged from apart, depending on location. Large bones were used as foundations for the huts, tusks for the entrances, and the roofs were probably skins held in place by bones or tusks. Some huts had floors that extended below ground. Some huts included fireplaces, which used bones as fuel, probably because wood was scarce. Some of the bones used for materials may have come from mammoths killed by humans, but the state of the bones, and the fact that bones used to build a single dwelling varied by several thousands of years in age, suggests that they were collected remains of long-dead animals. Woolly mammoth bones were also made into various tools, furniture, and musical instruments. Large bones, such as shoulder blades, were also used to cover dead human bodies during burial.

Woolly mammoth ivory was used to create art objects. Several <a href="Venus%20figurines">Venus figurines</a>, including the <a href="Venus%20of%20Brassempouy">Venus of Brassempouy</a> and the <a href="Venus%20of%20Lespugue">Venus of Lespugue</a>, were made from this material. Weapons made from ivory, such as daggers, spears, and a <a href="boomerang">boomerang</a>, are also known. To be able to process the ivory, the large tusks had to be chopped, chiseled, and split into smaller, more manageable pieces. Some ivory artefacts show that tusks had been straightened, and how this was achieved is unknown.

Several woolly mammoth specimens show evidence of being butchered by humans, which is indicated by breaks, cut marks, and associated stone tools. How much prehistoric humans relied on woolly mammoth meat is unknown, since many other large herbivores were available. Many mammoth carcasses may have been scavenged by humans rather than hunted. Some cave paintings show woolly mammoths in structures interpreted as pitfall traps. Few specimens show direct, unambiguous evidence of having been hunted by humans. A Siberian specimen with a spearhead embedded in its shoulder blade shows that a spear had been thrown at it with great force. A specimen from the <a href="Mousterian">Mousterian</a> age of Italy shows evidence of spear hunting by Neanderthals. The juvenile specimen nicknamed "Yuka" is the first frozen mammoth with evidence of human interaction. It shows evidence of having been killed by a large predator, and of having been scavenged by humans shortly after. Some of its bones had been removed, and were found nearby. A site near the <a href="Yana%20River">Yana River</a> in Siberia has revealed several specimens with evidence of human hunting, but the finds were interpreted to show that the animals were not hunted intensively, but perhaps mainly when ivory was needed. Two woolly mammoths from <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>, the "Schaefer" and "Hebior mammoths", show evidence of having been butchered by <a href="Palaeoamericans">Palaeoamericans</a>.

Most woolly mammoth populations disappeared during the late Pleistocene and early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>, alongside most of the <a href="Pleistocene%20megafauna">Pleistocene megafauna</a> (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">Quaternary extinction event</a>, which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, which led to the shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the woolly mammoth, or whether it was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different woolly mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the <a href="Chaunsky%20District">Kyttyk Peninsula</a> of Siberia 9,650 years ago. A small population of woolly mammoths survived on <a href="Saint%20Paul%20Island%20%28Alaska%29">St. Paul Island</a>, Alaska, well into the Holocene with the most recently published date of extinction being 5,600 years B.P. The last known population remained on <a href="Wrangel%20Island">Wrangel Island</a> in the <a href="Arctic%20Ocean">Arctic Ocean</a> until 4,000 years ago, well into the start of human <a href="civilization">civilization</a> and concurrent with the construction of the <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Giza">Great Pyramid</a> of <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>.

DNA sequencing of remains of two mammoths, one from Siberia 44,800 years BP and one from Wrangel Island 4,300 years BP, indicates two major population crashes: one around 280,000 years ago from which the population recovered, and a second about 12,000 years ago, near the ice age's end, from which it did not. The Wrangel Island mammoths were isolated for 5000 years, and due to the small population present when the island was isolated by rising post-ice-age sea level, about 300 to 1000 individuals experienced a 20% to 30% loss of heterozygosity, and a 65% loss in mitochondrial DNA diversity. The population seems to have subsequently been stable, without suffering further significant loss of genetic diversity. Genetic evidence thus implies the extinction of this final population was sudden, rather than the culmination of a gradual decline. 

Before their extinction, the Wrangel Island mammoths had accumulated numerous genetic defects due to their small population, consistent with the concept of <a href="genomic%20meltdown">genomic meltdown</a>; in particular, a number of genes for olfactory receptors and urinary proteins became nonfunctional, possibly because they had lost their selective value on the island environment. It is not clear whether these genetic changes contributed to their extinction. The disappearance coincides roughly in time with the first evidence for humans on the island. The woolly mammoths of eastern <a href="Beringia">Beringia</a> (modern <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a>) had similarly died out about 13,300 years ago, soon (roughly 1000 years) after the first appearance of humans in the area, which parallels the fate of all the other late Pleistocene <a href="proboscid">proboscid</a>s (mammoths, <a href="gomphothere">gomphothere</a>s, and <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a>s), as well as most of the rest of the <a href="megafauna">megafauna</a>, of the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. In contrast, the St. Paul Island mammoth population apparently died out before human arrival because of habitat shrinkage resulting from the post-ice age sea-level rise, perhaps in large measure as a result of a consequent reduction in the freshwater supply.

Changes in climate shrank suitable mammoth habitat from 42,000 years ago to 6,000 years ago. Woolly mammoths survived an even greater loss of habitat at the end of the <a href="Saale%20glaciation">Saale glaciation</a> 125,000 years ago, and humans likely hunted the remaining populations to extinction at the end of the <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>. Studies of an 11,300–11,000-year-old <a href="trackway">trackway</a> in south-western Canada showed that "M. primigenius" was in decline while coexisting with humans, since far fewer tracks of juveniles were identified than would be expected in a normal herd.

The decline of the woolly mammoth could have increased temperatures by up to at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. Mammoths frequently ate birch trees, creating a grassland habitat. With the disappearance of mammoths, birch forests, which absorb more sunlight than grasslands, expanded, leading to regional warming.

Woolly mammoth fossils have been found in many different types of deposits, including former rivers and lakes, and also in "<a href="Doggerland">Doggerland</a>" in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, which was dry at times during the ice age. Such fossils are usually fragmentary and contain no soft tissue. Accumulations of modern elephant remains have been termed "<a href="elephants%27%20graveyard">elephants' graveyard</a>s", as these sites were erroneously thought to be where old elephants went to die. Similar accumulations of woolly mammoth bones have been found; these are thought to be the result of individuals dying near or in the rivers over thousands of years, and their bones eventually being brought together by the streams. Some accumulations are also thought to be the remains of herds that died together at the same time, perhaps due to flooding. Natural traps, such as <a href="kettle%20holes">kettle holes</a>, <a href="sink%20holes">sink holes</a>, and mud, have also trapped mammoths in separate events over time.

Apart from frozen remains, the only soft tissue known is from a specimen that was preserved in a <a href="petroleum%20seep">petroleum seep</a> in <a href="Starunia">Starunia</a>, Poland. Frozen remains of woolly mammoths have been found in the northern parts of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> and Alaska, with far fewer finds in the latter. Such remains are mostly found above the <a href="Arctic%20Circle">Arctic Circle</a>, in permafrost. Soft tissue apparently was less likely to be preserved between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, perhaps because the climate was milder during that period. Most specimens have partially degraded before discovery, due to exposure or to being scavenged. This "<a href="natural%20mummification">natural mummification</a>" required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semisolids such as silt, mud, and icy water, which then froze.

The presence of undigested food in the stomach and seed pods still in the mouth of many of the specimens suggests neither starvation nor exposure is likely. The maturity of this ingested vegetation places the time of death in autumn rather than in spring, when flowers would be expected. The animals may have fallen through ice into small ponds or potholes, entombing them. Many are certainly known to have been killed in rivers, perhaps through being swept away by floods. In one location, by the Berelekh River in <a href="Sakha%20Republic">Yakutia</a> in Siberia, more than 8,000 bones from at least 140 mammoths have been found in a single spot, apparently having been swept there by the current.

Between 1692 and 1806, only four descriptions of frozen mammoths were published in Europe. None of the remains of those five was preserved, and no complete skeleton was recovered during that time. While frozen woolly mammoth carcasses had been excavated by Europeans as early as 1728, the first fully documented specimen was discovered near the delta of the <a href="Lena%20River">Lena River</a> in 1799 by Ossip Schumachov, a Siberian hunter. Schumachov let it thaw until he could retrieve the tusks for sale to the <a href="ivory%20trade">ivory trade</a>. While in Yakutsk in 1806, <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Adam">Michael Friedrich Adams</a> heard about the frozen mammoth. Upon arrival at the location, Adams discovered that wild animals had eaten most of the organs and flesh of the mammoth, including the trunk. He examined the carcass and realised what was left would still be the most complete mammoth recovered by that time. Adams recovered the entire skeleton, apart from the tusks, which Shumachov had already sold, and one foreleg, most of the skin, and nearly 18 kg (40 lb) of hair. During his return voyage, he purchased a pair of tusks that he believed were the ones that Shumachov had sold. Adams brought all to the <a href="Zoological%20Museum%20of%20the%20Zoological%20Institute%20of%20the%20Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Zoological Museum of the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences</a>, and the task of mounting the skeleton was given to <a href="Wilhelm%20Gottlieb%20Tilesius%20von%20Tilenau">Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius</a>. The <a href="Kunstkamera">Kunstkamera</a>, the museum established by Peter the Great, contained the skeleton of an Indian elephant that could be used as reference. This was one of the first attempts at reconstructing the skeleton of an extinct animal. Most of the reconstruction is correct, but Tilesius placed each tusk in the opposite socket, so that they curved outward instead of inward. The error was not corrected until 1899, and the correct placement of mammoth tusks was still a matter of debate into the 20th century.

The 1901 excavation of the "Berezovka mammoth" is the best documented of the early finds. It was discovered at the Siberian <a href="Berezovka%20River">Berezovka River</a>, and the Russian authorities financed its excavation. Its head was exposed, and the flesh had been scavenged. The animal still had grass between its teeth and on the tongue, showing that it had died suddenly. The entire expedition took 10 months, and the specimen had to be cut to pieces before it could be transported to St. Petersburg. It was identified as a 35- to 40-year-old male, which had died 35,000 years ago. One of its shoulder blades was broken, which may have happened when it fell into a crevasse.

By 1929, the remains of 34 mammoths with frozen soft tissues (skin, flesh, or organs) had been documented. Only four of them were relatively complete. Since then, about that many more have been found. In most cases, the flesh showed signs of decay before its freezing and later desiccation. Since 1860, Russian authorities have offered rewards of up to for finds of frozen woolly mammoth carcasses. Often, such finds were kept secret due to superstition. Several carcasses have been lost because they were not reported, and one was fed to dogs. In more recent years, scientific expeditions have been devoted to finding carcasses instead of relying solely on chance encounters. The most famous frozen specimen from Alaska is a calf nicknamed "Effie", which was found in 1948. It consists of the head, trunk, and a fore leg, and is about 25,000 years old. 

In 1977, the well-preserved carcass of a seven- to eight-month-old woolly mammoth calf named "Dima" was discovered. This carcass was recovered near a tributary of the <a href="Kolyma%20River">Kolyma River</a> in northeastern Siberia. This specimen weighed about at death and was high and long. <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">Radiocarbon dating</a> determined that "Dima" died about 40,000 years ago. Its internal organs are similar to those of modern elephants, but its ears are only one-tenth the size of those of an African elephant of similar age. A less complete juvenile, nicknamed "Mascha", was found on the <a href="Yamal%20Peninsula">Yamal Peninsula</a> in 1988. It was 3–4 months old, and a laceration on its right foot may have been the cause of death. It is the westernmost frozen mammoth found.

In 1997, a piece of mammoth tusk was discovered protruding from the tundra of the <a href="Taymyr%20Peninsula">Taymyr Peninsula</a> in Siberia, Russia. In 1999, this 20,380-year-old carcass and 25 tons of surrounding sediment were transported by an <a href="Mil%20Mi-26">Mi-26</a> heavy lift helicopter to an ice cave in <a href="Khatanga%2C%20Russia">Khatanga</a>. The specimen was nicknamed the "<a href="Jarkov%20Mammoth">Jarkov mammoth</a>". In October 2000, the careful defrosting operations in this cave began with the use of <a href="hair%20dryer">hair dryer</a>s to keep the hair and other soft tissues intact.

In 2002, a well-preserved carcass was discovered near the Maxunuokha River in northern Yakutia, which was recovered during three excavations. This adult male specimen was called the "<a href="Yukagir%20mammoth">Yukagir mammoth</a>", and is estimated to have lived around 18,560 years ago, and to have been 282.9 cm (9.2 ft) tall at the shoulder, and weighed between 4 and 5 tonnes. It is one of the best-preserved mammoths ever found due to the almost complete head, covered in skin, but without the trunk. Some postcranial remains were also found, some with soft tissue.

In 2007, the carcass of a female calf nicknamed "<a href="Lyuba">Lyuba</a>" was discovered near the <a href="Yuribey%20Bridge">Yuribey River</a>, where it had been buried for 41,800 years. By cutting a section through a molar and analysing its growth lines, they found that the animal had died at the age of one month. The mummified calf weighed , was high and in length. At the time of discovery, its eyes and trunk were intact and some fur remained on its body. Its organs and skin are very well preserved. "Lyuba" is believed to have been suffocated by mud in a river that its herd was crossing. After death, its body may have been colonised by bacteria that produce <a href="lactic%20acid">lactic acid</a>, which "pickled" it, preserving the mammoth in a nearly pristine state.

In 2012, a juvenile was found in Siberia, which had man-made cut marks. Scientists estimated its age at death to be 2.5 years, and nicknamed it "<a href="Yuka%20%28mammoth%29">Yuka</a>". Its skull and pelvis had been removed prior to discovery, but were found nearby. After being discovered, the skin of "Yuka" was prepared to produce a <a href="taxidermy">taxidermy</a> mount. Another mammoth discovery was reported in October 2012, when it was excavated on the Taymyr Peninsula. It was dated to 30,000 years old. Formally known as the <a href="Sopkarga%20mammoth">Sopkarga mammoth</a>, it was nicknamed "Zhenya" after the boy who found it.

In 2013, a well-preserved carcass was found on <a href="Maly%20Lyakhovsky%20Island">Maly Lyakhovsky Island</a>, one of the islands in the <a href="New%20Siberian%20Islands">New Siberian Islands</a> archipelago, a female between 50 and 60 years old at the time of death. The carcass contained well-preserved muscular tissue. When it was extracted from the ice, liquid blood spilled from the abdominal cavity. The finders interpreted this as indicating woolly mammoth blood possessed antifreezing properties.

The existence of frozen soft tissue remains and DNA of woolly mammoths has led to the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this. <a href="Cloning">Cloning</a> would involve removal of the DNA-containing <a href="cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a> of the <a href="Ovum">egg cell</a> of a female elephant, and replacement with a nucleus from woolly mammoth tissue, a process called <a href="somatic%20cell%20nuclear%20transfer">somatic cell nuclear transfer</a>. For example, Akira Iritani, at the Kyoto University in Japan, reportedly planned to do this. The cell would then be stimulated into dividing, and implanted in a female elephant. The resulting calf would have the genes of the woolly mammoth. However, nobody has yet found a viable mammoth cell, and most scientists doubt that any living cell could have survived freezing in the tundra. Because of their conditions of preservation, the DNA of frozen mammoths has deteriorated significantly.

A second method involves <a href="artificially%20inseminating">artificially inseminating</a> an elephant egg cell with <a href="sperm">sperm</a> cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring would be an elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process would have to be repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named <a href="Motty">Motty</a>, but it died of defects at less than 2 weeks old.
The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing makes this method unfeasible. 

In April 2015, Swedish scientists published the complete <a href="genome">genome</a> (<a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> sequence) of the woolly mammoth. Several projects are working on gradually replacing the genes in <a href="elephant">elephant</a> cells with mammoth genes. One such project is that of Harvard University geneticist <a href="George%20M.%20Church">George M. Church</a> —who is funded by the <a href="Long%20Now%20Foundation">Long Now Foundation</a>, which is attempting to create a mammoth-elephant hybrid using DNA from frozen mammoth carcasses. According to the researchers, a mammoth cannot be recreated, but they will try to eventually grow a hybrid elephant with some woolly mammoth traits in an "artificial womb". The Harvard University team is attempting to study the animals' characteristics "in vitro" by replacing or <a href="Genome%20editing">editing</a> some specific mammoth genes into Asian elephant skin cells called <a href="fibroblasts">fibroblasts</a> that have the potential to become <a href="embryonic%20stem%20cell">embryonic stem cell</a>s. By March 2015 and using the new <a href="CRISPR%20gene%20editing">CRISPR</a> DNA editing technique, Church's team had some woolly mammoth genes edited into the genome of an Asian elephant; Focusing on cold-resistance initially, the target genes are for the external ear size, subcutaneous fat, <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>, and hair attributes. By February 2017, Church's team had made 45 substitutions to the elephant genome. So far his work focuses solely on single cells.

The Mammoth Genome Project at <a href="Pennsylvania%20State%20University">Pennsylvania State University</a> is also researching the modification of African elephant DNA to create an elephant-mammoth hybrid. If a viable hybrid embryo is obtained by <a href="Genome%20editing">gene editing</a> procedures, implanting it into a female Asian elephant housed in a zoo may be possible, but with the current knowledge and technology, whether the hybrid embryo would be carried through the 2-year gestation is unknown. If any method is ever successful, a suggestion has been made to introduce the hybrids to a wildlife reserve in Siberia called the <a href="Pleistocene%20Park">Pleistocene Park</a>. Some biologists question the ethics of such recreation attempts. In addition to the technical problems, not much habitat is left that would be suitable for elephant-mammoth hybrids. Because both species are [were] social and <a href="gregarious">gregarious</a>, creating a few specimens would not be ideal. The time and resources required would be enormous, and the scientific benefits would be unclear, suggesting these resources should instead be used to preserve extant elephant species which are endangered. The ethics of using elephants as surrogate mothers in hybridization attempts has also been questioned, as most embryos would not survive, and knowing the exact needs of a hybrid elephant-mammoth calf would be impossible.

The woolly mammoth has remained culturally significant long after its extinction. <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20Siberia">Indigenous peoples of Siberia</a> had long found what are now known to be woolly mammoth remains, collecting their tusks for the <a href="ivory">ivory</a> trade. Native Siberians believed woolly mammoth remains to be those of giant mole-like animals that lived underground and died when burrowing to the surface. Woolly mammoth tusks had been articles of trade in Asia long before Europeans became acquainted with them. <a href="G%C3%BCy%C3%BCk">Güyük</a>, the 13th-century Khan of the Mongols, is reputed to have sat on a throne made from mammoth ivory. Inspired by the Siberian natives' concept of the mammoth as an underground creature, it became recorded in the Chinese pharmaceutical encyclopedia, "<a href="Ben%20Cao%20Gangmu">Ben Cao Gangmu</a>", as "yin shu", "the hidden rodent".

The <a href="indigenous%20peoples%20of%20North%20America">indigenous peoples of North America</a> also used woolly mammoth ivory and bone for tools and art. As in Siberia, North American natives had "myths of observation" explaining the remains of woolly mammoths and other elephants; the Bering Strait <a href="Inupiat">Inupiat</a> also believed the bones came from underground burrowing creatures, while other peoples associated them with primordial giants or "great beasts". Observers have interpreted legends from several Native American peoples as containing <a href="folk%20memory">folk memory</a> of extinct elephants, though other scholars are sceptical that folk memory could survive such a long time.

Siberian mammoth ivory is reported to have been exported to Russia and Europe in the 10th century. The first Siberian ivory to reach western Europe was brought to London in 1611. When Russia occupied Siberia, the ivory trade grew and it became a widely exported commodity, with huge amounts being excavated. From the 19th century and onwards, woolly mammoth ivory became a highly prized commodity, used as raw material for many products. Today, it is still in great demand as a replacement for the now-banned export of elephant ivory, and has been referred to as "white gold". Local dealers estimate that 10 million mammoths are still frozen in Siberia, and conservationists have suggested that this could help save the living species of elephants from extinction. Elephants are hunted by poachers for their ivory, but if this could instead be supplied by the already extinct mammoths, the demand could instead be met by these. Trade in elephant ivory has been forbidden in most places following the 1989 <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a> Conference, but dealers have been known to label it as mammoth ivory to get it through customs. Mammoth ivory looks similar to elephant ivory, but the former is browner and the <a href="Schreger%20lines">Schreger lines</a> are coarser in texture. In the 21st century, <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a> has made access to Siberian tusks easier, since the permafrost thaws more quickly, exposing the mammoths embedded within it.

Stories abound about frozen woolly mammoth meat that was consumed once defrosted, especially that of the "Berezovka mammoth", but most of these are considered dubious. The carcasses were in most cases decayed, and the stench so unbearable that only wild scavengers and the dogs accompanying the finders showed any interest in the flesh. Such meat apparently was once recommended against illness in China, and Siberian natives have occasionally cooked the meat of frozen carcasses they discovered.

There have been occasional claims that the woolly mammoth is not extinct, and that small, isolated herds might survive in the vast and sparsely inhabited <a href="tundra">tundra</a> of the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>. In the 19th century, several reports of "large shaggy beasts" were passed on to the Russian authorities by Siberian tribesmen, but no scientific proof ever surfaced. A French "<a href="charg%C3%A9%20d%27affaires">chargé d'affaires</a> "working in <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a>, M. Gallon, said in 1946 that in 1920, he had met a Russian fur-trapper who claimed to have seen living giant, furry "elephants" deep into the <a href="taiga">taiga</a>. Gallon added that the fur-trapper had not heard of mammoths before. Due to the large area of Siberia, that woolly mammoths survived into more recent times cannot be completely ruled out, but all evidence indicates that they became extinct thousands of years ago. These natives likely had gained their knowledge of woolly mammoths from carcasses they encountered, and that this is the source for their legends of the animal.

In the late 19th century, rumours existed about surviving mammoths in Alaska. In October 1899, Henry Tukeman detailed his killing of a mammoth in Alaska and his subsequent donation of the specimen to the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>. The museum denied the story. Bengt Sjögren believed that the myth began when the American biologist <a href="Charles%20Haskins%20Townsend">Charles Haskins Townsend</a> travelled in Alaska, saw <a href="Eskimo">Eskimo</a>s trading mammoth tusks, asked if mammoths were still living in Alaska, and provided them with a drawing of the animal.

Draining and development of the Everglades

The history of draining and development of the Everglades dates back to the 19th century. A national push for expansion and progress toward the latter part of the 19th century stimulated interest in draining the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> for agricultural use. According to historians, "From the middle of the nineteenth century to the middle of the twentieth century, the United States went through a period in which wetland removal was not questioned. Indeed, it was considered the proper thing to do."

A pattern of political and financial motivation, and a lack of understanding of the <a href="geography%20and%20ecology%20of%20the%20Everglades">geography and ecology of the Everglades</a> have plagued the history of drainage projects. The Everglades are a part of a massive <a href="Drainage%20basin">watershed</a> that originates near <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando</a> and drains into <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>, a vast and shallow lake. As the lake exceeds its capacity in the wet season, the water forms a flat and very wide river, about long and wide. As the land from Lake Okeechobee slopes gradually to <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a>, water flows at a rate of half a mile (0.8 km) a day. Before human activity in the Everglades, the system comprised the lower third of the <a href="Florida">Florida</a> peninsula. The first attempt to drain the region was made by real estate developer <a href="Hamilton%20Disston">Hamilton Disston</a> in 1881. Disston's sponsored canals were unsuccessful, but the land he purchased for them stimulated economic and population growth that attracted railway developer <a href="Henry%20Flagler">Henry Flagler</a>. Flagler built a <a href="Florida%20East%20Coast%20Railroad">railroad</a> along the east coast of Florida and <a href="Overseas%20Railroad">eventually</a> to <a href="Key%20West%2C%20Florida">Key West</a>; towns grew and farmland was cultivated along the rail line.

During his 1904 campaign to be elected <a href="governor">governor</a>, <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte%20Broward">Napoleon Bonaparte Broward</a> promised to drain the Everglades, and his later projects were more effective than Disston's. Broward's promises sparked a land boom facilitated by blatant errors in an engineer's report, pressure from real estate developers, and the burgeoning tourist industry throughout south Florida. The increased population brought hunters who went unchecked and had a devastating impact on the numbers of <a href="wading%20birds">wading birds</a> (hunted for their plumes), alligators, and other Everglades animals.

Severe hurricanes in <a href="1926%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1926</a> and <a href="1928%20Atlantic%20hurricane%20season">1928</a> caused catastrophic damage and flooding from Lake Okeechobee that prompted the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> to build a <a href="Dike%20%28construction%29">dike</a> around the lake. Further floods in 1947 prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern Florida. Following another population boom after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and the creation of the <a href="Central%20and%20Southern%20Florida%20Flood%20Control%20Project">Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project</a>, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late 1960s, following a proposal to construct a massive <a href="Dade-Collier%20Training%20and%20Transition%20Airport">airport</a> next to <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a>, national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the Everglades.

American involvement in the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> began during the <a href="Second%20Seminole%20War">Second Seminole War</a> (1836–42), a costly and very unpopular conflict. The United States spent between $30 million and $40 million and lost between 1,500 and 3,000 lives. The U.S. military drove the Seminoles into the Everglades and were charged with the task of finding them, defeating them, and moving them to Oklahoma <a href="Indian%20territory">Indian territory</a>. Almost 4,000 Seminoles were killed in the war or were removed. The U.S. military was completely unprepared for the conditions they found in the Everglades. They tore their clothes on <a href="Cladium">sawgrass</a>, ruined their boots on the uneven <a href="limestone">limestone</a> floor, and were plagued by <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es. Soldiers' legs, feet, and arms were cut open on the sawgrass and <a href="gangrene">gangrene</a> infection set in, taking many lives and limbs. Many died of mosquito-borne illness. After slogging through mud, one private died in his tracks of exhaustion in 1842. General <a href="Thomas%20Jesup">Thomas Jesup</a> admitted the military was overwhelmed by the terrain when he wrote to the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> in 1838, trying to dissuade him from prolonging the war.

Opinion about the value of Florida to the Union was mixed: some thought it a useless land of swamps and horrible animals, while others thought it a gift from God for national prosperity. In 1838 comments in "The Army and Navy Chronicle" supported future development of southern Florida: [The] climate [is] most delightful; but, from want of actual observation, [it] could not speak so confidently of the soil, although, from the appearance of the surrounding vegetation, a portion of it, at least, must be rich. Whenever the aborigines shall be forced from their fastnesses, as eventually they must be, the enterprising spirit of our countrymen will very soon discover the sections best adapted to cultivation, and the now barren or unproductive everglades will be made to blossom like a garden. It is the general impression that these everglades are uninhabitable during the summer months, by reason of their being overflowed by the abundant rains of the season; but if it should prove that these inundations are caused or increased by obstructions to the natural courses of the rivers, as outlets to the numerous lakes, American industry will remove these obstructions.

The military penetration of southern Florida offered the opportunity to map a poorly understood part of the country. As late as 1823, official reports doubted the existence of a large inland lake, until the military met the Seminoles at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Okeechobee">Battle of Lake Okeechobee</a> in 1837. To avenge repeated surprise attacks on himself and ammunition stores, Colonel <a href="William%20Harney">William Harney</a> led an expedition into the Everglades in 1840, to hunt for a chief named <a href="Chekika">Chekika</a>. With Harney were 90 soldiers in 16 canoes. One soldier's account of the trip in the "St. Augustine News" was the first printed description of the Everglades available to the general public. The anonymous writer described the hunt for Chekika and the terrain they were crossing: "No country that I have ever heard of bears any resemblance to it; it seems like a vast sea filled with grass and green trees, and expressly intended as a retreat for the rascally Indian, from which the white man would never seek to drive them".

The final blame for the military stalemate was determined to lie not in military preparation, supplies, leadership, or superior tactics by the Seminoles, but in Florida's impenetrable terrain. An army surgeon wrote: "It is in fact a most hideous region to live in, a perfect paradise for Indians, alligators, serpents, frogs, and every other kind of loathsome reptile." The land seemed to inspire extreme reactions of wonder or hatred. In 1870, an author described the mangrove forests as a "waste of nature's grandest exhibition to have these carnivals of splendid vegetation occurring in isolated places where it is but seldom they are seen." A band of hunters, naturalists, and collectors ventured through in 1885, taking along with them the 17-year-old grandson of an early resident of Miami. The landscape unnerved the young man shortly after he entered the <a href="Shark%20River%20%28Florida%29">Shark River</a>: "The place looked wild and lonely. About three o'clock it seemed to get on Henry's nerves and we saw him crying, he would not tell us why, he was just plain scared."

In 1897, an explorer named Hugh Willoughby spent eight days canoeing with a party from the mouth of the Harney River to the <a href="Miami%20River%20%28Florida%29">Miami River</a>. He wrote about his observations and sent them back to the "New Orleans Times-Democrat". Willoughby described the water as healthy and wholesome, with numerous <a href="spring%20%28hydrosphere%29">springs</a>, and 10,000 <a href="alligator">alligator</a>s "more or less" in Lake Okeechobee. The party encountered thousands of birds near the Shark River, "killing hundreds, but they continued to return". Willoughby pointed out that much of the rest of the country had been mapped and explored except for this part of Florida, writing, "(w)e have a tract of land one hundred and thirty miles long and seventy miles wide that is as much unknown to the white man as the heart of Africa."

As early as 1837, a visitor to the Everglades suggested the value of the land without the water:Could it be drained by deepening the natural outlets? Would it not open to cultivation immense tracts of rich vegetable soil? Could the waterpower, obtained by draining, be improved to any useful purpose? Would such draining render the country unhealthy? ... Many queries like these passed through our minds. They can only be solved by a thorough examination of the whole country. Could the waters be lowered ten feet, it would probably drain six hundred thousand acres; should this prove to be a rich soil, as would seem probable, what a field it would open for tropical productions! What facilities for commerce!

Territorial representative <a href="David%20Levy%20Yulee">David Levy</a> proposed a resolution that was passed in <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> in 1842: "that the Secretary of War be directed to place before this House such information as can be obtained in relation to the practicability and probable expense of draining the everglades of Florida." From this directive <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</a> <a href="Robert%20J.%20Walker">Robert J. Walker</a> requested <a href="Thomas%20Buckingham%20Smith">Thomas Buckingham Smith</a> from <a href="St.%20Augustine%2C%20Florida">St. Augustine</a> to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three <a href="canal">canal</a>s to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he "never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had it occurred to me that so great an undertaking, one so utterly impracticable, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, I should not have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but by those who have waded the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water."

Nevertheless, Smith returned a report to the Secretary of the Treasury asking for $500,000 to do the job. The report is the first published study on the topic of the Everglades, and concluded with the statement: The Ever Glades are now suitable only for the haunt of noxious vermin or the resort of pestilent reptiles. The statesman whose exertions shall cause the millions of acres they contain, now worse than worthless, to teem with the products of agricultural industry; that man who thus adds to the resources of his country ... will merit a high place in public favor, not only with his own generation, but with posterity. He will have created a State! Smith suggested cutting through the rim of the Everglades (known today as the Atlantic Coastal Ridge), connecting the heads of rivers to the coastline so that of water would be drained from the area. The result, Smith hoped, would yield farmland suitable for corn, sugar, rice, cotton, and tobacco.

In 1850 Congress passed a law that gave several states <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s within their state boundaries. The <a href="Swamp%20and%20Overflowed%20Lands%20Act">Swamp and Overflowed Lands Act</a> ensured that the state would be responsible for funding the attempts at developing wetlands into farmlands. Florida quickly formed a committee to consolidate grants to pay for such attempts, though attention and funds were diverted owing to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>. Not until after 1877 did attention return to the Everglades.

After the Civil War, an agency named the Internal Improvement Fund (IIF), charged with using grant money to <a href="Internal%20improvements">improve Florida's infrastructure</a> through canals, rail lines, and roads, was eager to be rid of the debt incurred by the Civil War. IIF trustees found a <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> real estate developer named <a href="Hamilton%20Disston">Hamilton Disston</a> who was interested in implementing plans to drain the land for agriculture. Disston was persuaded to buy of land for $1 million in 1881. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" declared it the largest purchase of land ever by any individual. Disston began building canals near <a href="St.%20Cloud%2C%20Florida">St. Cloud</a> to lower the basin of the <a href="Caloosahatchee%20River">Caloosahatchee</a> and <a href="Kissimmee%20River">Kissimmee River</a>s. His workers and engineers faced conditions similar to those of the soldiers during the Seminole Wars; it was harrowing, backbreaking labor in dangerous conditions. The canals seemed at first to work in lowering the water levels in the wetlands surrounding the rivers. Another dredged waterway between the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and Lake Okeechobee was built, opening the region to <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a> traffic.

Disston's engineers focused on Lake Okeechobee as well. As one colleague put it, "Okeechobee is the point to attack"; the canals were to be "equal or greater than the inflow from the Kissimmee valley, which is the source of all the evil." Disston sponsored the digging of a canal long from Lake Okeechobee towards Miami, but it was abandoned when the rock proved denser than the engineers had expected. Though the canals lowered the groundwater, their capacity was inadequate for the wet season. A report that evaluated the failure of the project concluded: "The reduction of the waters is simply a question of sufficient capacity in the canals which may be dug for their relief".

Though Disston's canals did not drain, his purchase primed the economy of Florida. It made news and attracted tourists and land buyers alike. Within four years property values doubled, and the population increased significantly. One newcomer was the inventor <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, who bought <a href="Thomas%20Edison%20Winter%20Estate">a home</a> in <a href="Fort%20Myers%2C%20Florida">Fort Myers</a>. Disston opened real estate offices throughout the United States and Europe, and sold tracts of land for $5 an acre, establishing towns on the west coast and in central Florida. English tourists in particular were targeted and responded in large numbers. Florida passed its first water laws to "build drains, ditches, or water courses upon petition of two or more landowners" in 1893.

Due to Disston's purchase, the IIF was able to sponsor railroad projects, and the opportunity presented itself when oil tycoon <a href="Henry%20Flagler">Henry Flagler</a> became enchanted with St. Augustine during a vacation. He built the opulent <a href="Ponce%20de%20Leon%20Hotel">Ponce de Leon Hotel</a> in <a href="St.%20Augustine%2C%20Florida">St. Augustine</a> in 1888, and began buying land and building <a href="Florida%20East%20Coast%20Railroad">rail lines</a> along the east coast of Florida, first from <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a> to <a href="Daytona%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Daytona</a>, then as far south as <a href="Palm%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Palm Beach</a> in 1893. Flagler's establishment of "the Styx", a settlement for hotel and rail line workers across the river from the barrier island containing Palm Beach, became <a href="West%20Palm%20Beach%2C%20Florida">West Palm Beach</a>. Along the way he built resort hotels, transforming territorial outposts into tourist destinations and the land bordering the rail lines into citrus farms.

The winter of 1894–1895 produced a bitter frost that killed citrus trees as far south as Palm Beach. Miami resident <a href="Julia%20Tuttle">Julia Tuttle</a> sent Flagler a pristine orange blossom and an invitation to visit Miami, to persuade him to build the railroad farther south. Although he had earlier turned her down several times, Flagler finally agreed, and by 1896 the rail line had been extended to <a href="Biscayne%20Bay">Biscayne Bay</a>. Three months after the first train arrived, the residents of Miami, 512 in all, voted to incorporate the town. Flagler publicized Miami as a "Magic City" throughout the United States and it became a prime destination for the extremely wealthy after the <a href="Royal%20Palm%20Hotel%20%28Miami%29">Royal Palm Hotel</a> was opened.

Despite the sale of to Disston and the skyrocketing price of land, by the turn of the 20th century the IIF was bankrupt due to mismanagement. Legal battles ensued between the State of Florida and the railroad owners about who owned the rights to sell reclaimed land in the Everglades. In 1904 <a href="Governor">gubernatorial</a> campaigning, the strongest candidate, <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte%20Broward">Napoleon Bonaparte Broward</a>, made draining the Everglades a major plank. He called the future of south Florida the "Empire of the Everglades" and compared its potential to that of <a href="Holland">Holland</a> and <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>: "It would indeed be a commentary on the intelligence and energy of the State of Florida to confess that so simple an engineering feat as the drainage of a body of land above the sea was above their power", he wrote to voters. Soon after his election, he fulfilled his promise to "drain that abominable pestilence-ridden swamp" and pushed the Florida legislature to form a group of commissioners to oversee reclamation of flooded lands. They began by taxing counties that would be affected by the drainage attempts, at 5 cents an acre, and formed the Everglades Drainage District in 1907.

Broward asked James O. Wright—an engineer on loan to the State of Florida from the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">USDA</a>'s Bureau of Drainage Investigations—to draw up plans for drainage in 1906. Two dredges were built by 1908, but had cut only of canals. The project quickly ran out of money, so Broward sold real estate developer <a href="Richard%20%26quot%3BDicky%26quot%3B%20J.%20Bolles">Richard "Dicky" J. Bolles</a> a million dollars worth of land in the Everglades, , before the engineer's report had been submitted. Abstracts from Wright's report were given to the IIF stating that eight canals would be enough to drain at a cost of a dollar an acre. The abstracts were released to real estate developers who used them in their advertisements, and Wright and the USDA were pressed by the real estate industry to publicize the report as quickly as possible. Wright's supervisor noted errors in the report, as well as undue enthusiasm for draining, and delayed its release in 1910. Different unofficial versions of the report circulated—some that had been altered by real estate interests—and a version hastily put together by Senator <a href="Duncan%20U.%20Fletcher">Duncan U. Fletcher</a> called "U.S. Senate Document 89" included early unrevised statements, causing a frenzy of speculation.

Wright's initial report concluded that drainage would not be difficult. Building canals would be more cost effective than constructing a dike around <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>. The soil would be fertile after drainage, the climate would not be adversely affected, and the enormous lake would be able to irrigate farmland in the dry season. Wright based his conclusions on 15 years of weather data since the recording of precipitation began in the 1890s. His calculations concentrated on the towns of <a href="Jupiter%2C%20Florida">Jupiter</a> and <a href="Kissimmee%2C%20Florida">Kissimmee</a>. Since weather data had not been recorded for any area within the Everglades, none was included in the report. Furthermore, the heaviest year of rain on record, Wright assumed, was atypical, and he urged that canals should not be constructed to bear that amount of water due to the expense. Wright's calculations for what canals should be able to hold were off by 55 percent. His most fundamental mistake, however, was designing the canals for a maximum rainfall of of water a day, based on flawed data for July and August rainfall, despite available data that indicated torrential downpours of and had occurred in 24-hour periods.

Though a few voices expressed skepticism of the report's conclusions—notably <a href="Frank%20Stoneman">Frank Stoneman</a>, the editor of the "Miami News-Record" (the forerunner of "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>")—the report was hailed as impeccable, coming from a branch of the U.S. government. In 1912 Florida appointed Wright to oversee the drainage, and the real estate industry energetically misrepresented this mid-level engineer as the world's foremost authority on wetlands drainage, in charge of the <a href="U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">U.S. Bureau of Reclamation</a>. However, the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> investigated Wright since no report had officially been published despite the money paid for it. Wright eventually retired when it was discovered that his colleagues disagreed with his conclusions and refused to approve the report's publication. One testified at the hearings: "I regard Mr. Wright as absolutely and completely incompetent for any engineering work".

Governor Broward ran for the <a href="U.S.%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, <a href="William%20Sherman%20Jennings">William Jennings</a>, were paid by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage. Broward was elected to the Senate in 1910, but died before he could take office. He was eulogized across Florida for his leadership and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale%2C%20Florida">Fort Lauderdale</a> paid him tribute by naming <a href="Broward%20County%2C%20Florida">Broward County</a> after him (the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $15 an acre a month after Broward died. Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them. News of the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan to build to <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a> in 1912.

Real estate companies continued to advertise and sell land along newly dug canals. In April 1912—the end of the dry season—reporters from all over the U.S. were given a tour of what had recently been drained, and they returned to their papers and raved about the progress. Land developers sold 20,000 lots in a few months. But as news about the Wright report continued to be negative, land values plummeted, and sales decreased. Developers were sued and arrested for <a href="mail%20fraud">mail fraud</a> when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and tractors used for plowing got mired in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Settlers encountered rodents, <a href="skink">skink</a>s, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops sprouted quickly and lushly, they just as quickly wilted and died, seemingly without reason. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked <a href="copper">copper</a> and other trace elements. The USDA released a pamphlet in 1915 that declared land along the New River Canal would be too costly to keep drained and fertilized; people in Ft. Lauderdale responded by collecting all of the pamphlets and burning them.

With the increasing population in towns near the Everglades came hunting opportunities. Even decades earlier, <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a> had been horrified at the hunting by visitors, and she wrote the first conservation publication for Florida in 1877: "[t]he decks of boats are crowded with men, whose only feeling amid our magnificent forests, seems to be a wild desire to shoot something and who fire at every living thing on shore." Otters and raccoons were the most widely hunted for their skins. Otter pelts could fetch between $8 and $15 each. Raccoons, more plentiful, only warranted 75 cents each in 1915. Hunting often went unchecked; on one trip, a Lake Okeechobee hunter killed 250 alligators and 172 otters.
<a href="Wader">Wading birds</a> were a particular target. Their feathers were used in women's hats from the late 19th century until the 1920s. In 1886, five million birds were estimated to have been killed for their feathers. They were usually shot in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. <a href="Aigrette">Aigrette</a>s, as the plumes were called in the <a href="Hatmaking">millinery</a> business, sold in 1915 for $32 an ounce, also the price of gold. Millinery was a $17-million-a-year industry that motivated <a href="plume%20hunting">plume harvesters</a> to lie in wait at the nests of <a href="egret">egret</a>s and other large birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small-bore rifles, and leave the chicks to starve. Many hunters refused to participate after watching the gruesome results of a plume hunt. Still, plumes from Everglades wading birds could be found in Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. A dealer in New York paid at least 60 hunters to provide him with "almost anything that wore feathers, but particularly the Herons, Spoonbills, and showy birds". Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day.

Plume harvesting became a dangerous business. The <a href="Audubon%20Society">Audubon Society</a> became concerned with the amount of hunting being done in rookeries in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a warden, <a href="Guy%20Bradley">Guy Bradley</a>, to watch the rookeries around Cuthbert Lake. Bradley had lived in <a href="Flamingo%2C%20Florida">Flamingo</a> within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first <a href="wildlife%20refuge">wildlife refuge</a> when President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> set <a href="Pelican%20Island%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Pelican Island</a> as a sanctuary in 1903.

In the 1920s, after birds were protected and alligators hunted nearly to extinction, <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> created a living for those willing to smuggle alcohol into the U.S. from Cuba. <a href="Rum-runner">Rum-runner</a>s used the vast Everglades as a hiding spot: there were never enough law enforcement officers to patrol it. The advent of the fishing industry, the arrival of the railroad, and the discovery of the benefits of adding copper to Okeechobee muck soon created unprecedented numbers of residents in new towns like <a href="Moore%20Haven%2C%20Florida">Moore Haven</a>, <a href="Clewiston%2C%20Florida">Clewiston</a>, and <a href="Belle%20Glade%2C%20Florida">Belle Glade</a>. By 1921, 2,000 people lived in 16 new towns around Lake Okeechobee. <a href="Sugarcane">Sugarcane</a> became the primary crop grown in south Florida and it began to be mass-produced. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in <a href="Coral%20Gables%2C%20Florida">Coral Gables</a> $150 million and saw undeveloped land north of Miami sell for $30,600 an acre. Miami became cosmopolitan and experienced a renaissance of architecture and culture. Hollywood movie stars vacationed in the area and industrialists built lavish homes. Miami's population multiplied fivefold, and Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach grew many times over as well. In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over , most of it real estate advertising. Waterfront property was the most highly valued. Mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view. Acres of south Florida <a href="slash%20pine">slash pine</a> were taken down, some for lumber, but the wood was found to be dense and it split apart when nails were driven into it. It was also <a href="termite">termite</a>-resistant, but homes were needed quickly. Most of the pine forests in Dade County were cleared for development.

The canals proposed by Wright were unsuccessful in making the lands south of Lake Okeechobee fulfill the promises made by real estate developers to local farmers. The winter of 1922 was unseasonably wet and the region was underwater. The town of Moore Haven received of rain in six weeks in 1924. Engineers were pressured to regulate the water flow, not only for farmers but also for commercial fishers, who often requested conflicting water levels in the lake. Fred Elliot, who was in charge of building the canals after James Wright retired, commented: "A man on one side of the canal wants it raised for his particular use and a man on the other side wants it lowered for his particular use".

The 1920s brought several favorable conditions that helped the land and population boom, one of which was an absence of any severe storms. The last severe hurricane, in 1906, had struck the Florida Keys. Many homes were constructed hastily and poorly as a result of this lull in storms. However, on September 18, 1926, a storm that became known as the <a href="1926%20Miami%20Hurricane">1926 Miami Hurricane</a> struck with winds over , and caused massive devastation. The <a href="storm%20surge">storm surge</a> was as high as in some places. Henry Flagler's opulent Royal Palm Hotel was destroyed along with many other hotels and buildings. Most people who died did so when they ran out into the street in disbelief while the <a href="eye%20%28cyclone%29">eye of the hurricane</a> passed over, not knowing the wind was coming in from the other direction. "The lull lasted 35 minutes, and during that time the streets of the city became crowded with people", wrote Richard Gray, the local weather chief. "As a result, many lives were lost during the second phase of the storm." In Miami alone, 115 people were counted dead—although the true figure may have been as high as 175, because death totals were <a href="racial%20segregation">racially segregated</a>. More than 25,000 people were homeless in the city. The town of <a href="Moore%20Haven">Moore Haven</a>, bordering Lake Okeechobee, was hardest hit. A <a href="levee">levee</a> built of muck collapsed, drowning almost 400 of the town's entire 1,200 residents. The tops of Lake Okeechobee levees were only above the lake itself and the engineers were aware of the danger. Two days before the hurricane, an engineer predicted, "[i]f we have a blow, even a gale, Moore Haven is going under water". The engineer lost his wife and daughter in the flood.

The City of Miami responded to the hurricane by downplaying its effects and turning down aid. "The Miami Herald" declared two weeks after the storm that almost everything in the city had returned to normal. The governor supported the efforts to minimize the appearance of the destruction by refusing to call a special legislative session to appropriate emergency funds for relief. As a result, the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a> was able to collect only $3 million of $5 million needed. The 1926 hurricane effectively ended the land boom in Miami, despite the attempts at hiding the effects. It also forced drainage commissioners to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the canals. A $20 million plan to build a dike around Lake Okeechobee, to be paid by property taxes, was turned down after a skeptical constituency sued to stop it; more than $14 million had been spent on canals and they were ineffective in taking away excess water or delivering it when needed.

The weather was unremarkable for two years. In 1928, construction was completed on the <a href="Tamiami%20Trail">Tamiami Trail</a>, named because it was the only road spanning between <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa</a> and Miami. The builders attempted to construct the road several times before they blasted the muck down to the limestone, filled it with rock and paved over it. Hard rains in the summer caused Lake Okeechobee to rise several feet; this was noticed by a local newspaper editor who demanded it be lowered. However, on September 16, 1928 came a massive storm, now known as the <a href="1928%20Okeechobee%20Hurricane">1928 Okeechobee Hurricane</a>. Thousands drowned when Lake Okeechobee breached its levees; the range of estimates of the dead spanned from 1,770 (according to the Red Cross) to 3,000 or more. Many were swept away and never recovered. The majority of the dead were black migrant workers who had recently settled in or near Belle Glade. The catastrophe made national news, and although the governor again refused aid, after he toured the area and counted 126 bodies still unburied or uncollected a week after the storm, he activated the National Guard to assist in the cleanup, and declared in a telegram: "Without exaggeration, the situation in the storm area beggars description".

The focus of government agencies quickly shifted to the control of floods rather than drainage. The Okeechobee Flood Control District, financed by both state and federal funds, was created in 1929. President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> toured the towns affected by the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane and, an engineer himself, ordered the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> to assist the communities surrounding the lake. Between 1930 and 1937, a dike long was built around the southern edge of the lake, and a shorter one around the northern edge. It was tall and thick on the lake side, thick on the top, and thick toward land. Control of the <a href="Hoover%20Dike">Hoover Dike</a> and the waters of <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a> were delegated to federal powers: the United States declared legal limits of the lake to be and .

A massive canal wide and deep was also dug through the <a href="Caloosahatchee%20River">Caloosahatchee River</a>; when the lake rose too high, the excess water left through the canal to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. Exotic trees were planted along the north shore levee: <a href="Casuarina">Australian pine</a>s, <a href="Eucalyptus">Australian oak</a>s, <a href="willow">willow</a>s, and <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a>. More than $20 million was spent on the entire project. Sugarcane production soared after the dike and canal were built. The populations of the small towns surrounding the lake jumped from 3,000 to 9,000 after <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

The effects of the Hoover Dike were seen immediately. An extended drought occurred in the 1930s, and with the wall preventing water leaving Lake Okeechobee and canals and ditches removing other water, the Everglades became parched. Peat turned to dust, and salty ocean water entered Miami's wells. When the city brought in an expert to investigate, he discovered that the water in the Everglades was the area's <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a>—here, it appeared on the surface. Draining the Everglades removed this groundwater, which was replaced by ocean water seeping into the area's wells. In 1939, of Everglades burned, and the black clouds of peat and sawgrass fires hung over Miami. Underground peat fires burned roots of trees and plants without burning the plants in some places. Scientists who took soil samples before draining had not taken into account that the organic composition of peat and muck in the Everglades was mixed with bacteria that added little to the process of decomposition underwater because they were not mixed with oxygen. As soon as the water was drained and oxygen mixed with the soil, the bacteria began to break down the soil. In some places, homes had to be moved on to stilts and of topsoil was lost.

Conservationists concerned about the Everglades have been a vocal minority ever since Miami was a young city. South Florida's first and perhaps most enthusiastic naturalist was <a href="Charles%20Torrey%20Simpson">Charles Torrey Simpson</a>, who retired from the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> to Miami in 1905 when he was 53. Nicknamed "the Sage of Biscayne Bay", Simpson wrote several books about tropical plant life around Miami. His backyard contained a <a href="tropical%20hardwood%20hammock">tropical hardwood hammock</a>, which he estimated he showed to about 50,000 people. Though he tended to avoid controversy regarding development, in "Ornamental Gardening in Florida" he wrote, "Mankind everywhere has an insane desire to waste and destroy the good and beautiful things this nature has lavished upon him".

Although the idea of protecting a portion of the Everglades arose in 1905, a crystallized effort was formed in 1928 when Miami landscape designer <a href="Ernest%20F.%20Coe">Ernest F. Coe</a> established the Everglades Tropical National Park Association. It had enough support to be declared a national park by Congress in 1934, but there was not enough money during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> to buy the proposed for the park. It took another 13 years for it to be dedicated on December 6, 1947.

Coinciding with the dedication of Everglades National Park, 1947 in south Florida saw two hurricanes and a wet season responsible for of rain, ending the decade-long drought. Although there were no human casualties, cattle and deer were drowned and standing water was left in suburban areas for months. Agricultural interests lost about $59 million. The embattled head of the Everglades Drainage District carried a gun for protection after being threatened.

In 1948 Congress approved the <a href="Central%20and%20Southern%20Florida%20Project%20for%20Flood%20Control">Central and Southern Florida Project for Flood Control</a> and Other Purposes (C&SF) and consolidated the Everglades Drainage District and the Okeechobee Flood Control District under this. The C&SF used four methods in flood management: levees, water storage areas, canal improvements, and large pumps to assist gravity. Between 1952 and 1954 in cooperation with the state of Florida it built a levee long between the eastern Everglades and suburbs from Palm Beach to <a href="Homestead%2C%20Florida">Homestead</a>, and blocked the flow of water into populated areas. Between 1954 and 1963 it divided the Everglades into basins. In the northern Everglades were Water Conservation Areas (WCAs), and the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) bordering to the south of Lake Okeechobee. In the southern Everglades was Everglades National Park. Levees and pumping stations bordered each WCA, which released water in drier times and removed it and pumped it to the ocean or Gulf of Mexico in times of flood. The WCAs took up about 37 percent of the original Everglades.

During the 1950s and 1960s the <a href="South%20Florida%20metropolitan%20area">South Florida metropolitan area</a> grew four times as fast as the rest of the nation. Between 1940 and 1965, 6 million people moved to south Florida: 1,000 people moved to Miami every week. Urban development between the mid-1950s and the late 1960s quadrupled. Much of the water reclaimed from the Everglades was sent to newly developed areas. With metropolitan growth came urban problems associated with rapid expansion: traffic jams; school overcrowding; crime; overloaded sewage treatment plants; and, for the first time in south Florida's urban history, water shortages in times of drought.

The C&SF constructed over of canals, and hundreds of pumping stations and levees within three decades. It produced a film, "Waters of Destiny", characterized by author Michael Grunwald as <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a>, that likened nature to a villainous, shrieking force of rage and declared the C&SF's mission was to tame nature and make the Everglades useful. Everglades National Park management and Marjory Stoneman Douglas initially supported the C&SF, as it promised to maintain the Everglades and manage the water responsibly. However, an early report by the project reflected local attitudes about the Everglades as a priority to people in nearby developed areas: "The aesthetic appeal of the Park can never be as strong as the demands of home and livelihood. The manatee and the orchid mean something to people in an abstract way, but the former cannot line their purse, nor the latter fill their empty bellies."

Establishment of the C&SF made Everglades National Park completely dependent upon another political entity for its survival. One of the C&SF's projects was Levee 29, laid along the Tamiami Trail on the northern border of the park. Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the <a href="Biscayne%20Aquifer">Biscayne Aquifer</a>—the fresh water source for South Florida—to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. Biologists estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was halved; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90 percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C&SF for assistance, the C&SF offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the <a href="mangrove">mangrove</a>s and into <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a>. Though the C&SF refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering the east side of the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.

The C&SF established for the Everglades Agricultural Area—27 percent of the Everglades before development. In the late 1920s, agricultural experiments indicated that adding large amounts of <a href="manganese%20sulfate">manganese sulfate</a> to Everglades muck produced profitable vegetable harvests. Adding of the compound was more cost effective than adding of manure. The primary cash crop in the EAA is sugarcane, though <a href="sod">sod</a>, beans, lettuce, celery, and rice are also grown. Sugarcane became more consolidated an industry than did any other crop; in 1940 the coalition of farms was renamed <a href="US%20Sugar%20Corporation">U.S. Sugar</a> and this produced 86 percent of Everglades sugar. During the 1930s the sugarcane farmers' coalition came under investigation for labor practices that bordered on slavery. Potential employees—primarily young black men—were lured from all over the U.S. by the promise of jobs, but they were held financially responsible for training, transportation, room and board and other costs. Quitting while debts were owed was punishable with jail time. By 1942, U.S. Sugar was indicted for <a href="peonage">peonage</a> in federal court, though the charges were eventually dismissed on a technicality. U.S. Sugar benefited significantly from the <a href="United%20States%20embargo%20against%20Cuba">U.S. embargo on Cuban goods</a> beginning in the early 1960s. In 1958, before the <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Castro</a> regime, of sugarcane were harvested in Florida; by the 1964–1965 season, were harvested. From 1959 to 1962 the region went from two sugar mills to six, one of which in Belle Glade set several world records for sugar production.

Fields in the EAA are typically , on two sides bordered by canals that are connected to larger ones by which water is pumped in or out depending on the needs of the crops. The water level for sugarcane is ideally maintained at below the surface soil, and after the cane is harvested, the stalks are burned. Vegetables require more fertilizer than sugarcane, though the fields may resemble the historic hydrology of the Everglades by being flooded in the wet season. Sugarcane, however, requires water in the dry season. The fertilizers used on vegetables, along with high concentrations of <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> that are the by-product of decayed soil necessary for sugarcane production, were pumped into WCAs south of the EAA, predominantly to Everglades National Park. The introduction of large amounts of these let exotic plants take hold in the Everglades. One of the defining characteristics of natural Everglades ecology is its ability to support itself in a nutrient-poor environment, and the introduction of fertilizers began to change this ecology.

A turning point for development in the Everglades came in 1969 when a <a href="Dade-Collier%20Training%20and%20Transition%20Airport">replacement airport</a> was proposed as <a href="Miami%20International%20Airport">Miami International Airport</a> outgrew its capacities. Developers began acquiring land, paying $180 an acre in 1968, and the Dade County Port Authority (DCPA) bought in the Big Cypress Swamp without consulting the C&SF, management of Everglades National Park or the <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Department of the Interior</a>. Park management learned of the official purchase and agreement to build the jetport from "<a href="The%20Miami%20Herald">The Miami Herald</a>" the day it was announced. The DCPA bulldozed the land it had bought, and laid a single runway it declared was for training pilots. The new jetport was planned to be larger than <a href="O%27Hare%20International%20Airport">O'Hare</a>, <a href="Dulles%20International%20Airport">Dulles</a>, <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%20International%20Airport">JFK</a>, and <a href="Los%20Angeles%20International%20Airport">LAX</a> airports combined; the location chosen was north of the Everglades National Park, within WCA 3. The deputy director of the DCPA declared: "This is going to be one of the great population centers of America. We will do our best to meet our responsibilities and the responsibilities of all men to exercise dominion over the land, sea, and air above us as the higher order of man intends."

The C&SF brought the jetport proposal to national attention by mailing letters about it to 100 conservation groups in the U.S. Initial local press reaction condemned conservation groups who immediately opposed the project. "<a href="Business%20Week">Business Week</a>" reported real estate prices jumped from $200 to $800 an acre surrounding the planned location, and "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" wrote of the expectations of the commercial interests in the area. The <a href="U.S.%20Geological%20Survey">U.S. Geological Survey</a>'s study of the <a href="Environmental%20Impact%20of%20the%20Big%20Cypress%20Swamp%20Jetport">environmental impact of the jetport</a> started, "Development of the proposed jetport and its attendant facilities ... will inexorably destroy the south Florida ecosystem and thus the Everglades National Park". The jetport was intended to support a community of a million people and employ 60,000. The DCPA director was reported in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" saying, "I'm more interested in people than alligators. This is the ideal place as far as aviation is concerned."

When studies indicated the proposed jetport would create of raw sewage a day and of jet engine pollutants a year, the national media snapped to attention. "<a href="Science%20%28journal%29">Science</a>" magazine wrote, in a series on environmental protection highlighting the jetport project, "Environmental scientists have become increasingly aware that, without careful planning, development of a region and the conservation of its natural resources do not go hand in hand". "The New York Times" called it a "blueprint for disaster", and <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> senator <a href="Gaylord%20Nelson">Gaylord Nelson</a> wrote to President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> voicing his opposition: "It is a test of whether or not we are really committed in this country to protecting our environment." Governor <a href="Claude%20Kirk">Claude Kirk</a> withdrew his support for the project, and the 78-year-old <a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas">Marjory Stoneman Douglas</a> was persuaded to go on tour to give hundreds of speeches against it. She established <a href="Friends%20of%20the%20Everglades">Friends of the Everglades</a> and encouraged more than 3,000 members to join. Initially the <a href="U.S.%20Department%20of%20Transportation">U.S. Department of Transportation</a> pledged funds to support the jetport, but after pressure, Nixon overruled the department. He instead established <a href="Big%20Cypress%20National%20Preserve">Big Cypress National Preserve</a>, announcing it in the Special Message to the Congress Outlining the 1972 Environmental Program. Following the jetport proposition, <a href="restoration%20of%20the%20Everglades">restoration of the Everglades</a> became not only a statewide priority, but an international one as well. In the 1970s the Everglades were declared an <a href="International%20Biosphere%20Reserve">International Biosphere Reserve</a> and a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> by <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, and a Wetland of International Importance by the <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar Convention</a>, making it one of only three locations on earth that have appeared on all three lists.

Choral symphony

A choral symphony is a <a href="musical%20composition">musical composition</a> for <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>, <a href="choir">choir</a>, and sometimes <a href="solo%20%28music%29">solo</a> vocalists that, in its internal workings and overall musical architecture, adheres broadly to <a href="symphony">symphonic</a> <a href="musical%20form">musical form</a>. The term "choral symphony" in this context was coined by <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a> when he described his "<a href="Rom%C3%A9o%20et%20Juliette%20%28Berlioz%29">Roméo et Juliette</a>" as such in his five-paragraph introduction to that work. The direct antecedent for the choral symphony is <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Ninth Symphony</a>. Beethoven's Ninth incorporates part of the "Ode an die Freude" ("<a href="Ode%20to%20Joy">Ode to Joy</a>"), a poem by <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Friedrich Schiller</a>, with text sung by soloists and chorus in the last movement. It is the first example of a major composer's use of the human voice on the same level as instruments in a symphony.

A few 19th-century composers, notably <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a> and <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, followed Beethoven in producing choral symphonic works. Notable works in the genre were produced in the 20th century by <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a>, <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a>, <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a> and <a href="Dmitri%20Shostakovich">Dmitri Shostakovich</a>, among others. The final years of the 20th century and the opening of the 21st century have seen several new works in this genre, among them compositions by <a href="Peter%20Maxwell%20Davies">Peter Maxwell Davies</a>, <a href="Tan%20Dun">Tan Dun</a>, <a href="Philip%20Glass">Philip Glass</a>, <a href="Hans%20Werner%20Henze">Hans Werner Henze</a>, <a href="Krzysztof%20Penderecki">Krzysztof Penderecki</a>, <a href="William%20Bolcom">William Bolcom</a> and <a href="Robert%20Strassburg">Robert Strassburg</a>.

The term "choral symphony" indicates the composer's intention that the work be symphonic, even with its fusion of narrative or dramatic elements that stems from the inclusion of words. To this end, the words are often treated symphonically to pursue non-narrative ends, by use of frequent repetition of important words and phrases, and the transposing, reordering or omission of passages of the set text. The text often determines the basic symphonic outline, while the orchestra's role in conveying the musical ideas is similar in importance to that of the chorus and soloists. Even with a symphonic emphasis, a choral symphony is often influenced in musical form and content by an external narrative, even in parts where there is no singing.

The symphony had established itself by the end of the 18th century as the most prestigious of instrumental genres. While the genre had been developed with considerable intensity throughout that century and appeared in a wide range of occasions, it was generally used as an opening or closing work; in between would be works that included vocal and instrumental soloists. Because of its lack of written text for focus, it was seen as a vehicle for entertainment rather than for social, moral or intellectual ideas. As the symphony grew in size and artistic significance, thanks in part to efforts in the form by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, it also amassed greater prestige. A concurrent change in attitude toward instrumental music in general also took place, and the lack of text, once seen as a handicap, became considered a virtue.

In 1824, Beethoven redefined the symphony genre in his <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Ninth</a> by introducing text and voice into a previously instrumental genre. His doing so sparked a debate on the future of the symphony itself. Beethoven's use of words, according to <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, had shown "the limits of purely instrumental music" and marked "the end of the symphony as a vital genre". Others were not sure how to proceed—whether to emulate the Ninth by writing symphonies with choral finales, or to develop the symphony genre in a purely instrumental fashion. Eventually, musicologist Mark Evan Bonds writes, the symphony was seen "as an all-embracing, cosmic drama that transcended the realm of sound alone".

Some composers both emulated and expanded upon Beethoven's model. Berlioz showed in his choral symphony "Roméo et Juliette" a fresh approach to the epic nature of the symphony as he used voices to blend music and narrative but saved crucial moments of that narrative for the orchestra alone. In doing so, Bonds writes, Berlioz illustrates for subsequent composers "new approaches for addressing the metaphysical in the realm of the symphony". Mendelssohn wrote his <a href="Lobgesang">Lobgesang</a> as a work for chorus, soloists and orchestra. Labeling the work a "symphony-cantata", he expanded the choral finale to nine <a href="movement%20%28music%29">movements</a> by including sections for vocal soloists, <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s and sections for chorus; this made the vocal part longer than the three purely orchestral sections that preceded it. Liszt wrote two choral symphonies, following in these multi-movement forms the same compositional practices and programmatic goals he had established in <a href="Symphonic%20poems%20%28Liszt%29">his symphonic poems</a>.
After Liszt, Mahler took on the legacy of Beethoven in his early symphonies, in what Bonds terms "their striving for a utopian finale". Towards this end Mahler used a chorus and soloists in the finale of his <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Mahler%29">Second Symphony</a>, the "Resurrection". In his <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Mahler%29">Third</a>, he wrote a purely instrumental finale following two vocal movements, and in his <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Mahler%29">Fourth</a> a vocal finale is sung by a solo <a href="soprano">soprano</a>. After writing his <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Mahler%29">Fifth</a>, <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Mahler%29">Sixth</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Mahler%29">Seventh</a> Symphonies as purely instrumental works, Mahler returned to the vein of "festival-symphonic ceremonial" in his <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Mahler%29">Eighth Symphony</a>, which integrates text throughout the body of the work. After Mahler, the choral symphony became a more common genre, taking a number of compositional turns in the process. Some composers, such as Britten, Rachmaninoff, Shostakovich and Vaughan Williams, followed symphonic form strictly. Others, such as <a href="Havergal%20Brian">Havergal Brian</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Schnittke">Alfred Schnittke</a> and <a href="Karol%20Szymanowski">Karol Szymanowski</a>, chose either to expand symphonic form or to use different symphonic structures altogether.

Throughout the history of the choral symphony, works have been composed for special occasions. One of the earliest was Mendelssohn's <a href="Lobgesang">Lobgesang</a>, commissioned by the city of Leipzig in 1840 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of <a href="Johannes%20Gutenberg">Johannes Gutenberg</a>'s invention of <a href="movable%20type">movable type</a>. More than a century later, <a href="Henryk%20G%C3%B3recki">Henryk Górecki</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28G%C3%B3recki%29">Second Symphony</a>, subtitled "Copernican", was commissioned in 1973 by the <a href="Kosciuszko%20Foundation">Kosciuszko Foundation</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the astronomer <a href="Nicolaus%20Copernicus">Nicolaus Copernicus</a>. In between these two works, in 1930, conductor <a href="Serge%20Koussevitzky">Serge Koussevitzky</a> asked Stravinsky to write the "<a href="Symphony%20of%20Psalms">Symphony of Psalms</a>" for the 50th anniversary of the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> and, in 1946, composer <a href="Henry%20Barraud">Henry Barraud</a>, then head of <a href="Radiodiffusion-T%C3%A9l%C3%A9vision%20Fran%C3%A7aise">Radiodiffusion Française</a>, commissioned <a href="Darius%20Milhaud">Darius Milhaud</a> to write his <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Milhaud%29">Third Symphony</a>, subtitled "Te Deum", to commemorate the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

In the final years of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st, more such choral symphonies were written. <a href="Krzysztof%20Penderecki">Krzysztof Penderecki</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Penderecki%29">Seventh Symphony</a> was for the third millennium of the city of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>. <a href="Tan%20Dun">Tan Dun</a>'s "Symphony 1997: Heaven Earth Mankind" commemorated the <a href="transfer%20of%20sovereignty%20over%20Hong%20Kong">transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong</a> that year to the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a>. Philip Glass's <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Glass%29">Fifth Symphony</a> as one of several pieces commissioned to celebrate the beginning of the 21st century. <a href="Paul%20Spicer%20%28musician%29">Paul Spicer</a>'s choral symphony "Unfinished Remembering" (2014, libretto by Euan Tait) was commissioned to commemorate the centenary of the outbreak of the First World War.

Like an <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> or an <a href="opera">opera</a>, a choral symphony is a musical work for orchestra, choir and (often) solo voices, although a few have been written for unaccompanied voices. Berlioz, who in 1858 first coined the term when describing his work "Roméo et Juliette", explained the distinctive relationship he envisaged between voice and orchestra:

Even though voices are often used, it is neither a concert opera nor a <a href="cantata">cantata</a>, but a choral symphony. If there is singing, almost from the beginning, it is to prepare the listener's mind for the dramatic scenes whose feelings and passions are to be expressed by the orchestra. It is also to introduce the choral masses gradually into the musical development, when their too sudden appearance would have damaged the compositions's unity...

Unlike oratorios or operas, which are generally structured <a href="dramaturgy">dramaturgically</a> into <a href="aria">aria</a>s, <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s and choruses, a choral symphony is structured like a symphony, in <a href="Movement%20%28music%29">movements</a>. It may employ the traditional four-movement scheme of a fast opening movement, slow movement, <a href="scherzo">scherzo</a> and finale, or as with many instrumental symphonies, it may use a different structure of movements. The written text in a choral symphony shares equal standing with the music, as in an oratorio, and the chorus and soloists share equality with the instruments. Over time the use of text allowed the choral symphony to evolve from an instrumental symphony with a choral finale, as in the Beethoven's Ninth, to a composition that can use voices and instruments throughout the entire composition, as in Stravinsky's "Symphony of Psalms" or Mahler's Eighth Symphony.

Sometimes the text can give a basic outline that correlates to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s "<a href="The%20Bells%20%28poem%29">The Bells</a>", a progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a <a href="symphony">symphony</a> to <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Sergei Rachmaninoff</a>, which he followed in his choral symphony <a href="The%20Bells%20%28Rachmaninoff%29">of the same name</a>. The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his "Roméo et Juliette", yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts where there is no singing, as in "Roméo et Juliette". There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and saves words for <a href="exposition%20%28literary%20technique%29">expository</a> and <a href="narrative">narrative</a> sections of the work.

As in an oratorio, the written text in a choral symphony can be as important as the music, and the chorus and soloists can participate equally with the instruments in the exposition and development of musical ideas. The text can also help determine whether the composer follows symphonic form strictly, as in the case of Rachmaninoff, Britten and Shostakovich, or whether they expand symphonic form, as in the case of Berlioz, Mahler and Havergal Brian. Sometimes the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures, as with Szymanowski, Schnittke and, again, Havergal Brian. The composer can also choose to treat the text fluidly, in a manner more like music than narrative. Such was the case with Vaughan Williams, Mahler and Philip Glass.

Vaughan Williams' program note for "A Sea Symphony" discusses how the text was to be treated as music. The composer writes, "The plan of the work is symphonic rather than narrative or dramatic, and this may be held to justify the frequent repetition of important words and phrases which occur in the poem. The words as well as the music are thus treated symphonically." <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>'s poems inspired him to write the symphony, and Whitman's use of <a href="free%20verse">free verse</a> became appreciated at a time where fluidity of structure was becoming more attractive than traditional, metrical settings of text. This fluidity helped facilitate the non-narrative, symphonic treatment of text that Vaughan Williams had in mind. In the third movement in particular, the text is loosely descriptive and can be "pushed about by the music", some lines being repeated, some not consecutive in the written text immediately following one another in the music, and some left out entirely.

Vaughan Williams was not the only composer following a non-narrative approach to his text. Mahler took a similar, perhaps even more radical approach in his Eighth Symphony, presenting many lines of the first part, "Veni, Creator Spiritus", in what music writer and critic <a href="Michael%20Steinberg%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Steinberg</a> referred to as "an incredibly dense growth of repetitions, combinations, inversions, transpositions and conflations". He does the same with Goethe's text in Part Two of the symphony, making two substantial cuts and other changes.

Other works take the use of text as music still further. Vaughan Williams uses a chorus of women's voices wordlessly in his "<a href="Sinfonia%20antartica">Sinfonia Antartica</a>", based on his music for the film "<a href="Scott%20of%20the%20Antarctic%20%28film%29">Scott of the Antarctic</a>", to help set the bleakness of the overall atmosphere. While a chorus is used in the second and third movements of Glass's <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Glass%29">Seventh Symphony</a>, also known as "A Toltec Symphony", the text contains no actual words; the composer states that it is instead formed "from loose syllables that add to the evocative context of the overall orchestral texture".

Stravinsky said about the texts of his "<a href="Symphony%20of%20Psalms">Symphony of Psalms</a>" that "it is not a symphony in which I have included "Psalms" to be sung. On the contrary, it is the singing of the "Psalms" that I am symphonizing". This decision was as much musical as it was textual. Stravinsky's <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> required several musical <a href="voice%20%28polyphony%29">voices</a> to function simultaneously, independent <a href="melody">melodically</a> and <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a>ically, yet interdependent <a href="harmony">harmonically</a>. They would sound very different when heard separately, yet harmonious when heard together. To facilitate maximum clarity in this interplay of voices, Stravinsky used "a choral and instrumental ensemble in which the two elements should be on an equal footing, neither of them outweighing the other".

Mahler's intent in writing his Eighth Symphony for exceptionally large forces was a similar balance between vocal and instrumental forces. It was not simply an attempt at grandiose effect, though the composer's use of such forces earned the work the subtitle "Symphony of a Thousand" from his press agent (a name still applied to the symphony). Like Stravinsky, Mahler makes extensive and extended use of counterpoint, especially in the first part, "Veni Creator Spiritus". Throughout this section, according to music writer <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a>, Mahler displays considerable mastery in manipulating multiple independent melodic voices. Musicologist <a href="Deryck%20Cooke">Deryck Cooke</a> adds that Mahler handles his huge forces "with extraordinary clarity".

Vaughan Williams also insisted on a balance between words and music in "A Sea Symphony", writing in his program note for the work, "It is also noticeable that the orchestra has an equal share with the chorus and soloists in carrying out the musical ideas". Music critic <a href="Samuel%20Langford">Samuel Langford</a>, writing about the premiere of the work for "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", concurred with the composer, writing, "It is the nearest approach we have to a real choral symphony, one in which the voices are used throughout just as freely as the orchestra."

In his "Leaves of Grass: A Choral Symphony", <a href="Robert%20Strassburg">Robert Strassburg</a> composed a symphonic "musical setting" in ten movements for the poetry of Walt Whiteman while balancing the contributions of a narrator, a chorus and an orchestra.

Rachmaninoff's choral symphony "The Bells" reflected the four-part progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death in Poe's poem. Britten reversed the pattern for his "<a href="Spring%20Symphony">Spring Symphony</a>"—the four sections of the symphony represent, in its composer's words, "the progress of Winter to Spring and the reawakening of the earth and life which that means... It is in the traditional four movement shape of a symphony, but with the movements divided into shorter sections bound together by a similar mood or point of view."

The gestation of Shostakovich's <a href="Symphony%20No.%2013%20%28Shostakovich%29">Thirteenth Symphony</a>, "Babi Yar", was only slightly less straightforward. He set the poem "<a href="Babi%20Yar">Babi Yar</a>" by <a href="Yevgeny%20Yevtushenko">Yevgeny Yevtushenko</a> almost immediately upon reading it, initially considering it a single-movement composition. Discovering three other Yevtushenko poems in the poet's collection "Vzmakh ruki" ("A Wave of the Hand") prompted him to proceed to a full-length choral symphony, with "A Career" as the closing movement. Musicologist Francis Maes comments that Shostakovich did so by complementing "Babi Yar's" theme of Jewish suffering with Yevtushenko's verses about other Soviet abuses: "'At the Store' is a tribute to the women who have to stand in line for hours to buy the most basic foods... 'Fears' evokes the terror under <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>. 'A Career' is an attack on bureaucrats and a tribute to genuine creativity". Music historian Boris Schwarz adds that the poems, in the order Shostakovich places them, form a strongly dramatic opening movement, a scherzo, two slow movements and a finale.

In other cases, the choice of text has led the composer to different symphonic structures. Havergal Brian allowed the form of his Fourth Symphony, subtitled "Das Siegeslied" (Psalm of Victory), to be dictated by the three-part structure of his text, Psalm 68; the setting of Verses 13–18 for soprano solo and orchestra forms a quiet interlude between two wilder, highly <a href="chromaticism">chromatic</a> martial ones set for massive choral and orchestral forces. Likewise, Szymanowski allowed the text by 13th-century Persian poet <a href="Rumi">Rumi</a> to dictate what Dr. Jim Samson calls the "single tripartite movement" and "overall arch structure" of his Third Symphony, subtitled "Song of the Night".

A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a> prepared for his "Roméo et Juliette". This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the "Queen Mab Scherzo" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, "as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the "<a href="Symphonie%20fantastique">[Symphonie] Fantastique</a>", both a scherzo and a march... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its "potpourri" of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work]."

<a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a> expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Mahler%29">Second Symphony</a>, the "Resurrection", the vocal fourth movement, "Urlicht", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Mahler%29">Third Symphony</a>, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, <a href="Havergal%20Brian">Havergal Brian</a> expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%26quot%3BThe%20Gothic%26quot%3B%20%28Brian%29">Symphony No. 1 "The Gothic"</a>. Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's "<a href="Faust">Faust</a>" and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the "<a href="Te%20Deum">Te Deum</a>".

A few composers have written symphonies for unaccompanied chorus, in which the choir performs both vocal and instrumental functions. <a href="Granville%20Bantock">Granville Bantock</a> composed three such works—"Atalanta in Calydon" (1911), "Vanity of Vanities" (1913) and "A Pageant of Human Life" (1913). His "Atalanta", called by musicologist Herbert Antcliffe "the most important [work of the three] alike in technical experiment and in inspiration", was written for a choir of at least 200, the composer specifying "'not less than 10 voices for each part,'" a work with 20 separate vocal parts. Using these forces, Bantock formed groups "of different weights and colors to get something of the varied play of tints and perspective [of an orchestra]". In addition, the choir is generally divided into three sections, approximating the timbres of woodwinds, brass and strings. Within these divisions, Antcliffe writes,

Almost every possible means of vocal expression is employed separately or in combination with others. To hear the different parts of the choir describing in word and tone "laughter" and "tears" respectively at the same time is to realize how little the possibilities of choral singing have as yet been grasped by the ordinary conductor and composer. Such combinations are extremely effective when properly achieved, but they are very difficult to achieve.

<a href="Roy%20Harris">Roy Harris</a> wrote his Symphony for Voices in 1935 for "<a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>" choir split into eight parts. Harris focused on harmony, rhythm and dynamics, allowing the text by Walt Whitman to dictate the choral writing. "In a real sense, the human strivings so vividly portrayed in Whitman's poetry find a musical analog to the trials to which the singers are subjected", John Profitt writes both of the music's difficulty for performers and of its highly evocative quality. <a href="Malcolm%20Williamson">Malcolm Williamson</a> wrote his Symphony for Voices between 1960 and 1962, setting texts by Australian poet <a href="James%20McAuley">James McAuley</a>. Lewis Mitchell writes that the work is not a symphony in any true sense, but rather a four-movement work preceded by an invocation for solo <a href="contralto">contralto</a>. The text is a combination of poems celebrating the Australian wilderness and visionary Christianity, its jagged lines and rhythms matched by the music. Mitchell writes, "Of all his choral works, with the possible exception of the Requiem for a Tribe Brother, the Symphony is the most Australian in feeling".

Some recent efforts have paid less attention to symphonic form and more to programmic intent. <a href="Hans%20Werner%20Henze">Hans Werner Henze</a> wrote his 1997 <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Henze%29">Ninth Symphony</a> in seven movements, basing the structure of the symphony on the novel "<a href="The%20Seventh%20Cross">The Seventh Cross</a>" by <a href="Anna%20Seghers">Anna Seghers</a>. The novel recounts the flight of seven fugitives from a <a href="Nazis">Nazi</a> prison camp, the seven crosses symbolizing the seven death sentences; the ordeal of the one prisoner who makes it to freedom becomes the crux of the text. Penderecki's Seventh Symphony, subtitled "Seven Gates of Jerusalem" and originally conceived as an oratorio, is not only written in seven movements but, musicologist Richard Whitehouse writes, is "pervaded by the number 'seven' at various levels." An extensive system of seven-note phrases binds the work together, as well as the frequent use of seven notes repeated at a single pitch. Seven chords played "fortissimo" bring the work to a close.

Philip Glass's Fifth Symphony, completed in 1999 and subtitled "<a href="Requiem">Requiem</a>, <a href="Bardo">Bardo</a> and <a href="Trikaya">Nirmanakaya</a>", is written in 12 movements to fulfill its programmatic intent. Glass writes, "My plan has been for the symphony to represent a broad spectrum of many of the world's great 'wisdom' traditions", synthesizing "a vocal text that begins before the world's creation, passes through earthly life and paradise, and closes with a future dedication". Glass writes that he considered the millennium at the beginning of the 21st century to be a symbolic bridge between past, present and spiritual rebirth.

More recently, Glass based the philosophical and musical structure for his Seventh Symphony on the <a href="Huichol%20people">Wirrarika</a> sacred trinity. Glass wrote about the work's respective movement headings and their relation to the overall structure of the symphony, "'The Corn' represents a direct link between Mother Earth and the well-being of human beings... 'The Sacred Root' is found in the high deserts of north and central Mexico, and is understood to be the doorway to the world of the Spirit. 'The Blue Deer' is considered the holder of the Book of Knowledge. Any man or woman who aspires to be a 'Person of Knowledge' will, through arduous training and effort, have to encounter the Blue Deer..."

Addition of a text can effectively change the programmatic intent of a composition, as with the two choral symphonies of <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>. Both the <a href="Faust%20Symphony">"Faust"</a> and "<a href="Dante%20Symphony">Dante</a>" symphonies were conceived as purely instrumental works and only later became choral symphonies. However, while Liszt authority <a href="Humphrey%20Searle">Humphrey Searle</a> asserts that Liszt's later inclusion of a chorus effectively sums up "Faust" and makes it complete, another Liszt expert, Reeves Shulstad, suggests that Liszt changed the work's dramatic focus to the point of meriting a different interpretation of the work itself. According to Shulstad, "Liszt's original version of 1854 ended with a last fleeting reference to <a href="Gretchen">Gretchen</a> and an ... orchestral peroration in <a href="C%20%28musical%20note%29">C major</a>, based on the most majestic of themes from the opening movement. One might say that this conclusion remains within the persona of Faust and his imagination". When Liszt rethought the piece three years later, he added a "Chorus mysticus", the male chorus singing the final words from Goethe's "Faust". The tenor soloist, accompanied by the chorus, sings the last two lines of the text. "With the addition of the 'Chorus Mysticus' text", Shulstad writes, "the Gretchen theme has been transformed and she no longer appears as a masked Faust. With this direct association to the final scene of the drama we have escaped Faust's imaginings and are hearing another voice commenting on his striving and redemption".
Likewise, Liszt's inclusion of a choral finale in his <a href="Dante%20Symphony">"Dante" Symphony</a> changed both the structural and programmatic intent of the work. Liszt's intent was to follow the structure of the "<a href="Divina%20Commedia">Divina Commedia</a>" and compose "Dante" in three movements—one each for the "Inferno", "Purgatorio" and "Paradiso". However, Liszt's son-in-law Richard Wagner persuaded him that no earthly composer could faithfully express the joys of Paradise. Liszt dropped the third movement but added a choral element, a <a href="Magnificat">Magnificat</a>, at the end of the second. This action, Searle claims, effectively destroyed the work's formal balance and left the listener, like Dante, to gaze upward at the heights of <a href="Heaven">Heaven</a> and hear its music from afar. Shulstad suggests that the choral finale actually helps complete the work's programmatic trajectory from struggle to paradise.

Conversely, a text can also spark the birth of a choral symphony, only for that work to become a purely instrumental one when the programmatic focus of the work changes. Shostakovich originally planned his <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Shostakovich%29">Seventh Symphony</a> as a single-movement choral symphony much like his <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Shostakovich%29">Second</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Shostakovich%29">Third Symphonies</a>. Shostakovich reportedly intended to set a text for the Seventh from the Ninth Psalm, on the theme of vengeance for the shedding of innocent blood. In doing this he was influenced by Stravinsky; he had been deeply impressed with the latter's "<a href="Symphony%20of%20Psalms">Symphony of Psalms</a>", which he wanted to emulate in this work. While the Ninth Psalm's theme conveyed Shostakovich's outrage over Stalin's oppression, a public performance of a work with such a text would have been impossible before the German invasion. Hitler's aggression made the performance of such a work feasible, at least in theory; the reference to "blood" could then be associated at least officially with Hitler. With Stalin appealing to the Soviets' patriotic and religious sentiments, the authorities were no longer suppressing <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Orthodox</a> themes or images. Nevertheless, Shostakovich eventually realized that the work encompassed far more than this symbology. He expanded the symphony to the traditional four movements and made it purely instrumental.

While Berlioz allowed the programmatic aspects of his text to shape the symphonic form of "Roméo" and to guide its content, he also showed how an orchestra could supplant such a text wordlessly to further illustrate it. He wrote in his preface to "Roméo":

If, in the famous garden and cemetery scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician that he had to give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.

As a manifesto, this paragraph became significant for the amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express the majority of the drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in "Roméo", Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.

More recently, Alfred Schnittke allowed the programmatic aspects of his texts to dictate the course of both his choral symphonies even when no words were being sung. Schnittke's six-movement <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Schnittke%29">Second Symphony</a>, following the <a href="Ordinary%20of%20the%20Mass">Ordinary of the Mass</a> of the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>, works programmatically on two levels simultaneously. While soloists and chorus briefly perform the mass, set to chorales taken from the <a href="Gradual">Gradual</a>, the orchestra provides an extended running commentary that can continue much longer than the section of the mass being performed. Sometimes the commentary follows a particular chorale but more often is freer and wider ranging in style. Despite the resulting stylistic disparity, biographer Alexander Ivashkin comments, "musically almost all these sections blend the choral [sic] tune and subsequent extensive orchestral 'commentary.'" The work becomes what Schnittke called an "Invisible Mass", and Ivashkin termed "a symphony against a chorale backdrop".

The program in Schnittke's <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Schnittke%29">Fourth Symphony</a>, reflecting the composer's own religious dilemma at the time it was written, is more complex in execution, with the majority of it expressed wordlessly. In the 22 variations that make up the symphony's single movement, Schnittke enacts the 15 traditional , which highlight important moments in the life of Christ. As he did in the Second Symphony, Schnittke simultaneously gives a detailed musical commentary on what is being portrayed. Schnittke does this while using church music from the Catholic, <a href="Protestantism">Protestant</a>, <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a> and <a href="Orthodoxy">Orthodox</a> faiths, the orchestral texture becoming extremely dense from the many musical strands progressing at the same time. A <a href="tenor">tenor</a> and a <a href="countertenor">countertenor</a> also sing wordlessly at two points in the symphony. The composition saves words for a finale that uses all four types of church music <a href="counterpoint">contrapuntally</a> as a four-part choir sings the "<a href="Ave%20Maria%20%28prayer%29">Ave Maria</a>". The choir can choose whether to sing the "Ave Maria" in Russian or Latin. The programmatic intent of using these different types of music, Ivashkin writes, is an insistence by the composer "on the idea ... of the unity of humanity, a synthesis and harmony among various manifestations of belief".

SS Kroonland

SS "Kroonland was an <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a> for <a href="International%20Mercantile%20Marine%20Co.">International Mercantile Marine</a> (IMM) from her <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launch</a> in 1902 until she was scrapped in 1927. "Kroonland" was the <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> of and a near sister ship of and of the same company. "Kroonland" sailed for IMM's <a href="Red%20Star%20Line">Red Star Line</a> for 15 years, and also sailed for IMM's <a href="American%20Line">American Line</a> and <a href="Panama%20Pacific%20Line">Panama Pacific Line</a>. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, the ship served as <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> transport USAT "Kroonland through April 1918, and as the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">Navy</a> auxiliary USS "Kroonland" (ID-1541) from April 1918 to October 1919.

Announced by the Red Star Line in 1899, "Kroonland" was completed in 1902 by <a href="William%20Cramp%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">William Cramp & Sons</a> of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. When launched, she was the largest U.S. steamship ever built. "Kroonland" sailed from New York City to <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> on her maiden voyage in June 1902, beginning service on the route she would sail for the next twelve years. According to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", "Kroonland" became the first ship to issue a wireless distress call at sea when she radioed for help during a storm in 1903. In another radio first, "Kroonland" heard the "first real broadcast of history" in December 1906. "Kroonland" was one of ten ships that came to the aid of the burning liner in the mid-Atlantic in October 1913. Despite stormy seas, "Kroonland" was able to take aboard 89 survivors, for which captain and crew received accolades that included U.S. <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>s.

When the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 disrupted service to Belgium, "Kroonland" shifted to alternate routes. On a trip to the Mediterranean in October 1914, "Kroonland" was detained by British authorities at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, and part of her cargo was confiscated amidst diplomatic wrangling between the then-neutral United States and the United Kingdom. During a <a href="chartering%20%28shipping%29">chartered</a> circumnavigation of South America in February 1915, "Kroonland" became the largest passenger ship to date to transit the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>. "Kroonland" was placed in New York – Panama Canal – San Francisco service until a landslide temporarily closed the canal to navigation. Returned to transatlantic service, "Kroonland" was one of the first U.S. ships armed by the Navy for defense against German submarine attacks. In May 1917 "Kroonland" was struck by a torpedo, which failed to detonate and only slightly damaged the ship.

After the United States entered World War I, "Kroonland" served as a troopship for the U.S. Army and Navy. She made six trips carrying troops to France before the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> and eight voyages after, transporting nearly 38,000 troops in total. Returned to IMM in late 1919, "Kroonland" was scorched in a shipyard fire in January 1920 while she was being refitted for passenger service. The liner resumed North Atlantic service in April, remaining there until returning to New York – San Francisco service in 1923. "Kroonland" inaugurated IMM's winter New York – Miami service from December 1925 to March 1926, but was laid up in <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken, New Jersey</a>, when IMM did not resume the Miami service the following year. The ship was sold and scrapped at <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> in 1927.

In July 1899, the <a href="Red%20Star%20Line">Red Star Line</a> announced plans for the construction of four large ocean liners. Two ships, "Kroonland" and , were to be built at <a href="William%20Cramp%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">William Cramp & Sons</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and the others, and , at <a href="John%20Brown%20%26amp%3B%20Company">John Brown & Company</a> of <a href="Clydebank">Clydebank</a> in Scotland. By April 1901, the two Scottish-built ships were completed and in service for Red Star, with the construction of the American pair well underway.

"Kroonland" and the virtually identical "Finland", at each, were slightly larger than "Vaderland" and "Zeeland". The American pair were the largest steamships built in the United States at the time of their launch, and were the highest tonnage civilian ships ever built by William Cramp. "Kroonland" was long (<a href="length%20between%20perpendiculars">pp</a>) and <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">abeam</a>, with a <a href="molded%20depth">molded depth</a> of . Her <a href="hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> was steel and nearly all the rivets were set with <a href="rivet%20gun">pneumatic rivet guns</a>.

"Kroonland" was propelled at up to by twin <a href="triple-expansion%20steam%20engine">triple-expansion steam engine</a>s. The engines were each rated at and had cylinders of , , and with a stroke. There were nine single-ended coal-fired <a href="Scotch%20boiler">Scotch boiler</a>s with a heating area of , a grate area of , and an operating pressure of . "Kroonland" had eleven watertight compartments with reinforced bulkheads, and was designed to remain afloat with up to two compartments flooded. "Kroonland"s coal bunkers surrounded the boilers, to offer limited protection in case the ship was used in wartime.
The area below the main deck could carry up to of freight and stores. "Kroonland"s water tanks could carry of fresh water. Refrigerated storage was provided for meats and other perishables.

Third-class passenger accommodations were located on the main deck: three compartments for men located forward, and a single compartment for families at the rear. The family compartment had <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s containing either two, four, or six bunks. All compartments had well-lighted dining areas and wide hallways that led to lavatories and sanitary facilities on the upper deck.

The upper deck housed facilities for officers and first- and second-class passengers. A long <a href="forecastle">forecastle</a> contained the accommodations for the crew and <a href="petty%20officer">petty officer</a>s, as well as a hospital and the third-class lavatories. First-class staterooms for 106 passengers were located close to the middle of the ship. To their rear, between the <a href="steamship%20funnel">funnels</a>, was the first-class passenger dining room, spanning the width of the ship. With seating for 208, it featured <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> furniture and <a href="Chloroxylon">satinwood</a> paneling with inlays, and a glass skylight ceiling that extended up through two decks. Beyond this area were the <a href="galley%20%28kitchen%29">galleys</a>, <a href="scullery%20%28room%29">sculleries</a>, and pantries that served all passenger classes. Moving further aft, the second-class passenger dining room, which could accommodate 120 diners, was next. It, too, spanned the width of the ship and featured mahogany furniture, but was paneled with tapestry upon a cream-colored ground. Beyond the dining area were cabins for 76 second-class passengers.

A <a href="Deck%20%28ship%29%23Common%20names%20for%20decks">bridge deck</a> amidships contained state rooms for another 204 first-class and 120 second-class passengers. In the rear was a deck house that contained a social room for third-class passengers. A <a href="promenade%20deck">promenade deck</a> was located above and was permanently enclosed by a <a href="boat%20deck">boat deck</a>, where "Kroonland"s 20 steel <a href="Lifeboat%20%28shipboard%29">lifeboats</a> were stowed. The promenade deck housed the library and smoking room for first-class passengers.

"Kroonland" was <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on the afternoon of 20 February 1902 in a small, informal ceremony. Mrs. Rodman Griscom christened the ship, but "Kroonland" did not budge on the <a href="slipway%23Ship%20construction">launching way</a>; cold weather had frozen the <a href="tallow">tallow</a> used to grease the timbers. <a href="Hydraulic%20jack">Hydraulic jack</a>s eventually freed the ship for her plunge into the <a href="Delaware%20River">Delaware River</a>.

"Kroonland" sailed on her maiden voyage from New York to Antwerp on 28 June 1902. "Kroonland" remained on New York – Antwerp service for the next twelve years. In these early years of service, she was involved in two radio firsts. After the steering gear failed west of <a href="Fastnet%20Rock">Fastnet Rock</a> during a moderate gale in early December 1903, the ship's crew was able to communicate their predicament via <a href="Marconi%20Company">Marconi</a> <a href="radio">wireless</a> system, becoming, according to one contemporary news account, the first ship in distress ever to use wireless. "Kroonland" put in at <a href="Queenstown%2C%20Ireland">Queenstown</a>, Ireland, for repairs, and transferred her passengers and freight to ships of the <a href="White%20Star%20Line">White Star Line</a>, another IMM subsidiary. The other radio first came on 24 December 1906, when the ship's wireless operator heard—rather than the expected dots and dashes of morse code—the voice of a woman singing. The singing was followed by a recording of <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>'s "<a href="Ombra%20mai%20f%C3%B9">Largo</a>", a poetry reading, and more music played from phonographs. The steamer was on the receiving end of what journalist and author <a href="Robert%20St.%20John">Robert St. John</a> called the "first real broadcast of history", originated by early radio pioneer <a href="Reginald%20Fessenden">Reginald Fessenden</a> from <a href="Brant%20Rock">Brant Rock</a> in <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>.

During her time on the New York – Antwerp route, "Kroonland" was frequently battered by the storms that were typical in the North Atlantic. In November 1904, a <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> news agency reported a rumor that the ship had foundered in a mid-ocean storm. The report—proved false when "Kroonland" safely docked in New York—received wide coverage in the American press. While in a heavy December gale, the ship was struck by what contemporary news accounts referred to as a "<a href="rogue%20wave">tidal wave</a>" as high as the tops of her funnels. The wave crashed over the deck, and brought the ship to a standstill. A Belgian passenger's leg was broken when he was thrown into a wall, and a crewman on watch in the <a href="crow%27s%20nest">crow's nest</a> was sent tumbling to the deck below with only minor injuries.

In another December gale in 1907, one of the two <a href="propeller%20shaft">propeller shaft</a>s on "Kroonland" broke while the liner was off the <a href="Isles%20of%20Scilly">Isles of Scilly</a>. Using the lone remaining propeller, the liner was able to make her way back to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, where two tugs brought her into port. Passengers were transferred to to continue their transit to New York, while "Kroonland" entered drydock at Southampton. Fitted with a new shaft, she sailed—without passengers and cargo—for New York, where she arrived on 2 January 1908. In February 1910, severe winter storms on the North Atlantic extended one of "Kroonland"s westbound trips, delaying her arrival in New York by three days. In May, "Kroonland" broke another propeller shaft, and again headed to Southampton for repairs.

Not all of the ship's mishaps were storm-related. In late April 1911, "Kroonland" hit the breakwater in <a href="Dover%20Harbour">Dover Harbour</a>, disabling the steering gear and delaying the ship by a day. On 8 January 1913, "Kroonland" ran aground in <a href="Ambrose%20Channel">Ambrose Channel</a> during a heavy fog while outbound from New York. It took more than six hours for tugs to free the liner from the soft mud.

The Red Star Line changed "Kroonland" from American to Belgian registry on 6 November 1908 in Antwerp. One reason given for the change was to allow Red Star to hire non-American crews at lower cost. She made her maiden voyage under the <a href="Flag%20of%20Belgium">Belgian flag</a> the next day. In May 1911, "Kroonland"s crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, refused to sign on for the ship's next voyage, forcing Red Star to hire a replacement crew.

International Mercantile Marine submitted a bid for a ten-year contract for "Kroonland" and "Finland" to carry U.S. mail between New York and San Francisco after the opening of the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>. By law, only U.S.-flagged ships could carry U.S. mail under contract. It was also anticipated that U.S.-flagged vessels would receive preferential treatment for canal tolls. In a short ceremony aboard the liner in New York Harbor on 27 December 1911, the Belgian flag was lowered and the American flag was raised to the playing of "<a href="The%20Star-Spangled%20Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>" by the steamer's band, shortly before she sailed for Antwerp.

At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under charter to the Uranium Line, caught fire in a gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire for about two hours, but, realizing the severity of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of "Volturno" had his wireless operator send out <a href="SOS">SOS</a> signals. The westbound "Kroonland", already beyond "Volturno"s location, turned east to aid the burning liner. In the meantime, several of "Volturno"s lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results: all those aboard the lifeboats were killed as the boats capsized or were smashed by the hull of the heaving ship.

In all, ten ships heeded the distress calls, arriving throughout the day and into the next. "Kroonland" arrived at about 17:00, and by 20:00 had launched a lifeboat with a volunteer crew. The boat was unable to get close to the burning liner. "Kroonland"s lifeboat returned at 22:30 with an exhausted crew and the one person who had dared to brave the jump into the stormy water. Captain J. C. Barr of , the first ship to arrive, took command of the rescue effort. Barr had the vessels form a "<a href="battle%20line">battle line</a>" of sorts and slowly circle the burning ship, while his ship kept a searchlight on "Volturno" and another sweeping the ring of rescue ships to help them avoid collisions. Despite "Carmania"s efforts, "Kroonland" and the <a href="Compagnie%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20Transatlantique">French Line</a> steamer almost collided, coming—according to one passenger—within of impact.
"Kroonland"s lifeboat, manned by a fresh crew, headed back out and returned with 13 steerage passengers. On board "Volturno", the crew and some of the male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her <a href="boiler">boiler</a>s—rocked "Volturno", and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The <a href="Tanker%20%28ship%29">tanker</a> "Narragansett" turned on her pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to "Volturno"s aid. "Kroonland" launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on "Kroonland" alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.

With all boats recovered by 09:00, the liners resumed their original courses. "Kroonland" turned west and continued on to the United States, hampered by a cracked crankshaft that slowed her to . During her slow passage to New York, "Kroonland"s cabin passengers drafted a resolution honoring Captain Kreibohm and the crew for their actions during the rescue, and raised $700 for the benefit of the "Volturno" survivors. "Kroonland" finally docked in New York on 16 October.

The crew, like those of the other nine ships involved, received many accolades for its rescue efforts. After sending the ship a congratulatory telegram at the time of the rescue, <a href="Albert%20I%20of%20Belgium">King Albert</a> of Belgium made Capt. Kreibohm a Chevalier (Knight) of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28Belgium%29">Order of the Crown</a> in January 1914. At the same time, the Belgian government awarded its <a href="Civic%20Decoration%20%28Belgium%29">Third Class Civic Cross</a> to "Kroonland"s third officer, and <a href="Civic%20Decoration%20%28Belgium%29">First Class Civic Medals</a> to six crewmen and a steward. In March, <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George V</a> of the United Kingdom, on recommendation of the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a>, awarded 39 of the ship's crew the <a href="Sea%20Gallantry%20Medal">Silver Sea Gallantry Medal</a>, along with a £3 award. Crewmen from all ten ships received Sea Gallantry Medals, but no other ship had more medals awarded than "Kroonland". Later in March, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> honored Kreibohm with a gold watch, "Kroonland"s officers—including Kreibohm—with <a href="Congressional%20Gold%20Medal">Congressional Gold Medal</a>s, and other crewmen with five silver and 25 bronze medals. In April, the Life Saving Benevolent Association of New York awarded its Life Saving Medal to Kreibohm, four officers, and 35 crewmen. In June 1916, Kreibohm was presented with the <a href="American%20Cross%20of%20Honor">American Cross of Honor</a> by Congressman <a href="Henry%20Bruckner">Henry Bruckner</a>.

"Kroonland" resumed her normal New York – Antwerp service until 11 August 1914, when she arrived at New York with passengers that had narrowly escaped the hostilities beginning to engulf the European continent.

During her pre-war New York – Antwerp sailings, "Kroonland" carried some notable and interesting passengers. On 1 August 1904, one of the ship's passengers arrived in New York as somewhat of a mystery woman. She recounted that she had gone out for dinner in Antwerp and awakened to find herself at sea with only the white silk evening gown she was wearing. Having no money or luggage, she was barred from entering the United States and was compelled to remain on board the ship. After her predicament was reported in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", she received letters and telegrams that included marriage proposals. Her background story and a letter of credit eventually verified her identity, but she was deported after a New York doctor pronounced her insane. Later the same month "The New York Times" reported on first-class passengers' complaints over privileges for their dogs and the conditions in the kennel aboard the liner. One passenger was determined to have her dog in her state room, and after others joined her in removing canine companions from the kennel, "Kroonland"s crew took all the dogs back to the kennel. Many of the dog owners refused to speak to the others involved for the duration of the voyage.

On 27 May 1905, American author <a href="Molly%20Elliot%20Seawell">Molly Elliot Seawell</a> sailed for Europe on "Kroonland" on a day when six liners, with over 1,500 passengers, departed New York. In October, <a href="Helen%20Herron%20Taft">Helen Taft</a> returned from Europe on "Kroonland" and was met by her husband, Secretary of War <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a>. The next August, <a href="Henry%20Yates%20Satterlee">Henry Yates Satterlee</a>, the first <a href="Episcopal%20Diocese%20of%20Washington">Episcopal Bishop of Washington</a>, returned on "Kroonland" from a six-week tour of cathedrals of Europe, during which he noted both good and bad design elements of cathedrals in preparation for the building of the <a href="Washington%20National%20Cathedral">Washington National Cathedral</a>. Also returning on the same voyage were Admiral <a href="Charles%20Stillman%20Sperry">Charles Sperry</a> and Lieutenant Daniel W. Wurtsbaugh of the U.S. Navy, and Brigadier General <a href="Robert%20Maitland%20O%27Reilly">Robert O'Reilly</a>, the <a href="Surgeon%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">Surgeon General of the U.S. Army</a>; all were American delegates to the <a href="Second%20Geneva%20Convention">Second Geneva Convention</a>. It was not the first trip on "Kroonland" for either Satterlee and O'Reilly. Satterlee had traveled on the liner the previous May to visit the spa town of <a href="Bad%20Nauheim">Bad Nauheim</a> in Hesse; O'Reilly had been on the November 1904 trip in which "Kroonland" had been reported as sunk.

"Kroonland" was the scene of an attempted <a href="murder-suicide">murder-suicide</a> in October 1908. Two acquaintances in steerage had an argument over a young female second-class passenger that both men knew. One man threw a knife at the other—only slightly wounding him—and then fled and jumped over the railing into the English Channel near <a href="Dover">Dover</a>. U.S. Senator <a href="Benjamin%20Tillman">Benjamin Tillman</a> and his wife were aboard the liner at the time and saw the young man jump overboard. Although the ship lowered a boat to look for him, no trace of him was found, and he was presumed drowned.

American actresses <a href="Kitty%20Cheatham">Kitty Cheatham</a> and <a href="Isabel%20Irving">Isabel Irving</a>—each married to a different man named "W. H. Thompson"—traveled on "Kroonland" in May 1910. Alerted to each other's presence when mail addressed to "Mrs. W. H. Thompson" was confused, the actresses—old friends, having both worked in the theatre company of <a href="Augustin%20Daly">Augustin Daly</a>—shared a state room for the voyage. Later that month, the ship was the official "World Missionary Conference Steamship" for delegates and representatives on their way to the <a href="World%20Missionary%20Conference">World Missionary Conference</a> in Edinburgh, Scotland. Honda Yoitsu, said to be the only Japanese <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal">Methodist Episcopal</a> bishop, was among those on the liner when she sailed on 31 May. News accounts reported on some of the unusual activities aboard "Kroonland" during this trip. Among them were morning devotional services held daily in the ship's dining room, and the spontaneous singing of <a href="hymn">hymn</a>s on deck every evening.

"Kroonland" was tangentially involved in a more sinister affair in July 1910. American physician <a href="Hawley%20Harvey%20Crippen">Hawley Crippen</a> and his lover, Ethel La Neve, had fled England after the circumstances around his wife's death were questioned. After a body was found in the basement of Crippen's North London residence, <a href="Scotland%20Yard">Scotland Yard</a> Chief Inspector <a href="Walter%20Dew">Walter Dew</a> sought the couple for murder charges. One theory had the couple sailing from <a href="Dover">Dover</a> on "Kroonland", but when inspected in New York on arrival, Crippen and Le Neve were not to be found. The fleeing couple had instead sailed from Antwerp on the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Steamship%20Company">Canadian Pacific</a> liner . Crippen, identified during "Montrose"s crossing, was arrested, convicted of his wife's murder, and hanged; La Neve was acquitted.

The American novelist <a href="Theodore%20Dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a>, returning from an extended European tour in April 1912, briefly considered returning on , but instead sailed two days later on the American-flagged—and less expensive—"Kroonland". Dreiser recounted the gloomy mood of "Kroonland"s passengers after hearing the news of "Titanic"s sinking, observing that the "terror of the sea had come swiftly and directly home to all". On "Kroonland"s next return trip to New York, <a href="Horst%20von%20der%20Goltz">Horst von der Goltz</a>, a self-described German secret agent, eluded German authorities by working as a steward in steerage aboard the liner.

With the German invasion of Belgium in early August 1914, "Kroonland" was switched to New York – Liverpool service. After two circuits on that route, IMM announced that the ship would be moved to service in the Mediterranean to attract business to offset that lost because of the war. Sailing from New York on 15 October for <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, and <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, "Kroonland" became what IMM called the first large, American-flagged steamer "to engage in trade with the far corners of the Mediterranean". Along with passengers, the ship carried a cargo of rubber and of copper destined for Italy.
On 28 October, British authorities detained the ship at Gibraltar. Because neutral Italy did not restrict the shipment of copper (which could be used in war munitions) to Germany or <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a>, the British claimed the right to detain the ship—a claim disputed by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">U.S. State Department</a>. "Kroonland" was allowed to resume her journey on 8 November after the copper and rubber were unloaded and taken to a <a href="prize%20court">prize court</a>. The ship arrived at Naples on 11 November, then completed the rest of her Mediterranean trek. Returning to New York, she carried the new minister from <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a> to the United States, arriving on 4 December. IMM had advertised that "Kroonland" would sail the Mediterranean route again in December, but the liner was removed from the route.

In late January 1915, "Kroonland" departed on a business tour of South America under charter to the American Trade Tour Company. The tour was designed as a showcase for American companies hoping to expand into South America, and "Kroonland" circumnavigated that continent, traveling over in 82 days. During the voyage, the liner docked at various ports where businessmen or trade representatives, like the <a href="Babson%20Statistical%20Organization">Babson Statistical Organization</a>, made sales pitches and showed films of factories to potential customers aboard "Kroonland". During this South American foray, the ship sailed westbound through the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> on 2 February, becoming the largest passenger ship to transit the canal to that date. Also on the trip, while transiting the <a href="Straits%20of%20Magellan">Straits of Magellan</a> in late February, "Kroonland" passed British cruiser refueling from a <a href="collier%20%28ship%29">collier</a>, and, on 26 February, when entering the harbor of <a href="Punta%20Arenas%2C%20Chile">Punta Arenas, Chile</a>, passed the departing , on the hunt for the German cruiser . "Kroonland" returned to New York on 14 April.

In May 1915, "Kroonland" and sister ship "Finland" were chartered to the <a href="Panama%20Pacific%20Line">Panama Pacific Line</a> for the long-planned service between New York and San Francisco via the Panama Canal. "Kroonland" departed from New York for California on 22 May and counted 50 honeymooning couples and a large cargo of flour from <a href="St.%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">St. Paul, Minnesota</a>, among her payload. The intercoastal trip took about 17 days each way and the ships called at either Los Angeles or San Diego on eastbound and westbound trips. With two ships on the route, one ship departed from either New York or San Francisco about every three weeks. The service was marketed as the ideal manner to visit the <a href="Panama-California%20Exposition%20%281915%29">Panama-California Exposition</a> in San Diego and the <a href="Panama-Pacific%20International%20Exposition">Panama-Pacific International Exposition</a> in San Francisco. At the San Francisco exhibition, a detailed model of "Kroonland" was one of ten that comprised a part of IMM's exhibit in the Palace of Transportation.

Frequent and progressively worse landslides in the canal disrupted "Kroonland"s and "Finland"s service. In August 1915, "Kroonland"s arrival in New York was delayed a day by a <a href="Gaillard%20Cut">Gaillard Cut</a> slide. In early September, both ships were delayed ten days while waiting for the canal to be dredged after another slide. In early October, another landslide in the Gaillard Cut—this one in excess of of mud and dirt—closed the canal, and it was expected that it might remain closed for as long as ten months. "Kroonland" was en route to the canal from San Francisco, while "Finland" was at the canal's eastern terminus, <a href="Col%C3%B3n%2C%20Panama">Colón</a>. After "Kroonland" arrived at the canal's western end at <a href="Balboa%2C%20Panama">Balboa</a>, the two liners exchanged passengers—including former First Lady <a href="Helen%20Herron%20Taft">Helen Taft</a> and her daughter, <a href="Helen%20Taft%20Manning">Helen</a>—by rail across the <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Panama">isthmus</a>.

The delay caused by the October slide in the Panama Canal created uncertainty for the immediate future of "Kroonland". Her sister ship "Finland" was transferred to a New York – London route almost immediately after the canal's closure, but "Kroonland" was "trapped" on the west side of the continent. By early November, "Kroonland"—loaded with cargo destined for the United Kingdom, and sailing under the banner of the <a href="American%20Line">American Line</a>—departed San Francisco for London, via the Straits of Magellan. On 21 December, the liner arrived at <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> after having run aground, but was found to be undamaged. Continuing on to London, "Kroonland" departed for New York on 30 January 1916. Although plans were announced in mid 1916 for the two sister ships to return to the Panama Pacific Line, and to add the Hawaiian port of <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a> to the canal route, both ships remained in North Atlantic service.

On 20 February, "Kroonland", continuing to sail for the American Line, returned to New York – Liverpool service after an absence of 18 months. As a ship of the still-neutral United States sailing in a war zone, "Kroonland" had her name painted in large letters on each side of her hull. The name was flanked on either side by large American flags and kept illuminated at night. In June, she carried US$1,500,000 of <a href="Argentina">Argentine</a> gold from London for deposit with the <a href="Guaranty%20Trust%20Company%20of%20New%20York">Guaranty Trust Company of New York</a>. On late 1916, a cook aboard "Kroonland" was arrested for smuggling feathers, wings, and heads of <a href="birds%20of%20paradise">birds of paradise</a> and <a href="crowned%20pigeons">crowned pigeons</a>. The man, who was paid $300 for each load of feathers, smuggled in at least three loads of the avian contraband before his arrest. In January 1917, a <a href="jumble%20sale">jumble sale</a> held in the saloon on "Kroonland" raised £73 15s 11d for "The Times" Fund, for the benefit of the <a href="British%20Red%20Cross">British Red Cross</a> and the <a href="Venerable%20Order%20of%20Saint%20John">Order of St. John</a>.
While returning from Liverpool in early February 1917, passengers and crew on "Kroonland" witnessed the German U-boat sink the Dutch ship "Gamma" off the Irish coast. On 1 February 1917, at around 15:30, passengers and crew saw the German submarine overtake and stop the Dutch <a href="cargo%20ship">freighter</a>. At about 16:15, the U-boat, by then on the far side of the Dutch ship and out of view from "Kroonland", fired three shots from her deck gun. "Gamma" immediately began listing to port and sank within five minutes. "Kroonland" was less than away, and was prepared to rescue the crew of the sunken ship, but stopped when the German submarine took "Gamma"s lifeboat in tow. Four days later, a suspected submarine was seen off "Kroonland"s port side, and there were other reports of a ship that passengers took to be a German <a href="commerce%20raider">commerce raider</a> or <a href="submarine%20tender">submarine tender</a>.

Because Germany had again on 1 February, "Kroonland" was laid up for almost two months at the American Line piers in New York, along with sister ship "Finland" and three other vessels. During this forced downtime, "Kroonland" was converted from coal burning to oil burning, a long-awaited modification that had been announced in October 1915. The conversion reduced the number of <a href="stoker%20%28occupation%29">stokers</a> needed from 75 to 12, lowering "Kroonland"s payroll. Because fuel oil was stored inside the <a href="double%20bottom">double bottom</a> of her hull, her cargo capacity was increased through the elimination of her coal bunkers. The labor savings and the additional freight revenues from the increased cargo space resulted in a net gain of $25,000 income per trip.

"Kroonland" served as a <a href="troopship">troopship</a> for about the next year. In early March, U.S. Navy ordnance officers inspected "Kroonland" and took measurements in preparation to arm her for defense against submarine attacks. On 13 March, she was assigned guns by the Navy, becoming one of the first seven ships to be armed. With her arming complete, and carrying an <a href="Naval%20Armed%20Guard">armed naval guard</a> to man the guns, "Kroonland" sailed for Liverpool on 25 March 1917. Twelve days later, the United States formally declared war on Germany.
On the morning of 20 May, while the liner steamed toward Liverpool through a heavy fog, a torpedo struck her without exploding. Two minutes later her lookouts spotted a submarine bearing down on "Kroonland" so close alongside the liner that her guns could not be depressed enough to open fire on the raider. Although the U-boat, apparently also taken by surprise, reversed her screws and tried to turn to avoid a collision, she lightly struck the liner's hull and scraped along her side before diving out of sight. Meanwhile, two more torpedoes came within some of hitting "Kroonland"s stern. That afternoon the liner sighted another submarine, surfaced some off her port quarter. "Kroonland" immediately began shelling the U-boat, forcing the submarine to dive for safety. In early June, this failed torpedo attack on the ship made front-page news in American newspapers.

In September, elements of the <a href="42nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 42nd Infantry Division</a> sailed from New York to <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a> on "Kroonland". The ship sailed from Halifax on 30 September in an Allied convoy with the American ship and Commonwealth ships (which had led the "Volturno" rescue in 1913), "Anchises", "Canada", "Grampian", "Ionican", "Themistocles", "Victoria", , "Medic", "Miltiades", "Mokoia", and "Ruahine". Two days out from Halifax, the last five ships split off from the convoy and headed to Scotland; "Kroonland"s group sailed to Liverpool.

On 15 October 1917, the <a href="United%20States%20Shipping%20Board">United States Shipping Board</a> (USSB) requisitioned all American passenger ships over for use by the government in the war effort. Though it is not clear what immediate impact this had on "Kroonland", it is known that the liner was operating as a U.S. Army transport (under the name USAT "Kroonland") by February 1918, when she was loaded with <a href="materiel">materiel</a> and departed New York for <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a>, France.

In February 1918 the USSB assigned "Kroonland" to the transport fleet as a U.S. Army Chartered Transport (USACT), and after her return from France on 9 April, she was converted to a troop transport in New York by the William J. Kennedy Company. A typical conversion from passenger liner to troop transport involved having all of the second- and third-class accommodations ripped out and replaced with berths for troops. Cooking and toilet facilities also had to be greatly expanded to handle the large numbers of men aboard.

After problems with crew discipline aboard Army transports and when they were torpedoed, the U.S. Navy, led by the recommendations of Rear Admiral <a href="Albert%20Gleaves">Albert Gleaves</a>, insisted that all troop transports be manned entirely by Navy personnel. This was accomplished soon after, to avoid the need for what Gleaves called "ignorant and unreliable men" who were "the sweepings of the docks". Accordingly, "Kroonland" was handed over to the Navy on 22 April and <a href="ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> the same day, with <a href="Commander%20%28United%20States%29">Commander</a> Manley H. Simons in command.

USS "Kroonland" was assigned to the <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a> after being commissioned. The ship departed New York on 30 April with the transports , , and "Finland". and —two transports that sailed from <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News, Virginia</a>—rendezvoused with "Kroonland"s group. provided the convoy with protection until its arrival in France on 12 May. "Kroonland" returned to New York on 1 June.

"Kroonland" next left New York on 15 June with "Finland", , , , , the Italian steamer , and the British steamer "Vauban" and met up with the Newport News portion of the convoy—consisting of , , , , and the British troopship (another fellow "Volturno" rescuer)—the next morning and set out for France. The convoy was escorted by the cruisers and , and the destroyers and ; the battleship and several other destroyers joined in escort duties for the group for a time. The convoy had a false alarm when a floating barrel was mistaken for submarine, but the otherwise uneventful trip concluded at Brest on the afternoon of 27 June.
On 10 July, as "Kroonland" steamed homeward from France, a lookout spotted a periscope rising from the water about away. "Kroonland" opened fire and the fourth shot from her No. 4 gun "burst with a tremendous cloud of dirty blue smoke" exactly on the periscope. The submarine zig-zagged "erratically back and forth until she was directly in the disturbed water" of "Kroonland"s wake. The transport continued firing until the submarine disappeared, leaving an oil slick which could be seen for at least 15 minutes. "Kroonland" arrived safely in New York on 13 July.

On 26 July, "Kroonland", loaded with 3,248 officers and men, departed on her next trip to France. In the company of "Finland" and the Italian steamer , she met up with , , and the Italian steamers and from Newport News. The cruisers , , and destroyers and escorted the transports. Gordon Van Kleeck, a private in Company F of the U.S. 51st Pioneer Infantry, one of the units aboard "Kroonland" on this trip, recorded his day-to-day activities in a journal. He stated that the soldiers wore overalls rather than uniforms, and were required to wear life jackets at all times. During the early mornings, the most dangerous time for submarines according to Van Kleeck, the soldiers had to stand by their life rafts until the sun was completely up. Bathing facilities were too small, so several times during the trip the soldiers gathered on deck for salt water baths, which consisted of a hose turned on them by the ship's crew. On 2 August, "Finland" developed engine trouble and fell back from the convoy, but by the next day, she and a destroyer that stayed with her had rejoined the convoy. The convoy arrived in Brest on 7 August, and "Kroonland" arrived back in the United States on 19 August.

After embarking 3,334 soldiers, "Kroonland" began her next crossing on 30 August when she sailed from New York with "Susquehanna", and to join the Newport News contingent of "Duca d'Aosta", "Caserta", and . "Kroonland"s convoy was escorted by "Frederick" and "Colhoun". As with other Navy ships throughout 1918, "Kroonland" was not immune to the worldwide <a href="Spanish%20flu">Spanish flu</a> pandemic. On this particular crossing, two of her crewmen were felled by the disease as her convoy reached France on 12 September. "Kroonland" returned to New York on 27 September.
At 20:00 on 7 October, "Kroonland" departed New York on her fifth Navy voyage with 2,567 men. She joined "Caserta" and the British steamer "Euripides" in rendezvousing with , "Susquehanna", "America", and "Czar" from Newport News. The cruisers and and the destroyers and "Fairfax" served as convoy escorts for the group, which arrived in France on 20 October. "Kroonland" arrived in New York on 3 November, and was in port when the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany">Armistice</a> was signed on 11 November. In total, "Kroonland" carried 14,125 troops to France during the five trips of her Navy career.

At war's end, the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately. "Kroonland" did her part by carrying home 26,152 passengers in eight trips. The ship departed from Brest in late November with her first load of nearly 2,000 wounded and convalescing soldiers, many of whom were from the <a href="76th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 76th Infantry Division</a>. The former liner arrived at the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Quarantine%20Station">Quarantine Station</a> on 10 December 1918, and docked in New York the next day. One of the men aboard was Captain Walter Camp who had been wounded and gassed in the <a href="Meuse-Argonne%20Offensive">Meuse-Argonne Offensive</a>; Camp was the son of the <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> <a href="American%20football">football</a> coach of <a href="Walter%20Camp">the same name</a>. Another passenger on board was Sarah Wilmer, an American <a href="YWCA%20USA">YWCA</a> front-line worker who had become lost in the <a href="Forest%20of%20Argonne">Argonne forest</a> and gassed when a German shell exploded nearby. Before departing on her next voyage, "Kroonland" hosted a party for 150 newsboys from New Jersey at her Hoboken, New Jersey, pier on Christmas Day. With a Christmas tree in the troops' mess, the newsboys were treated to a dinner and entertainment by the ship's band, and all received presents.

"Kroonland" arrived at Newport News on 18 February with 2,805 passengers, including units from the <a href="36th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 36th Infantry Division</a>, after a rough trip from Saint-Nazaire. On her next voyage, she carried another 2,943 officers and men from Saint-Nazaire to Newport News, arriving there on 24 March. The 132nd Regiment of the 61st Field Artillery Brigade returned on the ship, and brigade historian Rex F. Harlow called "Kroonland" "probably the best vessel on which any units of the brigade returned to America".

On 18 April, "Kroonland" began her next homeward journey, embarking several companies of the <a href="111th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">111th Infantry Regiment</a> of the <a href="28th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 28th Infantry Division</a> among the 3,100 troops carried. Though the fighting was over, the men still wore life jackets for the first three days at sea amidst fears of striking floating <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a>. George W. Cooper, historian of the 2nd Battalion of the 111th Infantry, reported that some of the men had to serve as stokers during the trip because of a "shortage of help". In the middle of the crossing, the ship "sprung a leak" and took on of water; she had a list for a day or so, until repairs were made. The troops later disembarked at New York on 29 April.

"Kroonland" returned to Saint-Nazaire in May and loaded Major General Joseph E. Kuhn and some 3,000 men of his <a href="79th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 79th Infantry Division</a>, which included the 304th Engineer Regiment, and departed France on 18 May. The band of the 304th Engineers gave concerts on deck every evening on the voyage home to entertain the men. Though initially bound for Newport News, "Kroonland"s crew received orders in mid ocean to head instead to New York, where they arrived on 29 May. After completing another passage to Newport News in late June, "Kroonland" sailed on 19 July with 3,642 passengers—including officers, men, thirteen <a href="war%20bride">war bride</a>s, and one war baby—from Saint-Nazaire, in the final transport departure from that port before it was closed as a port of embarkation by U.S. military authorities. Among the passengers was Brigadier General Samuel D. Rockenbach, the founder of the <a href="United%20States%20Tank%20Corps">United States Tank Corps</a>.

On 21 August, the USSB announced that "Kroonland" would be released from government service after surveys for repairs had been completed. After leaving New York on 10 August, the ship was in the middle of what would be her final trip returning soldiers. After arriving at Brest, 1,532 officers and men boarded "Kroonland" for New York, where the transport arrived on 10 September. Also on board was Michael Gilhooley, a 15-year-old stowaway making his fourth unsuccessful attempt to sneak into the United States aboard a Navy transport.

The ship was decommissioned and returned to the USSB on 13 September, and returned to International Mercantile Marine shortly thereafter. In her eight trips returning troops, "Kroonland"—affectionately called the "Empress of the Seas" by her crew—averaged just under 39 days per turnaround, beating the overall average of all ships by almost a full day, and edging out sister ship "Finland" by less than that.

After her return to International Mercantile Marine (IMM), the ship underwent a refit at the <a href="W.%20%26amp%3B%20A.%20Fletcher%20Company">W. & A. Fletcher Marine Works</a> yard in Hoboken that outfitted her for 242 first-, 310 second-, and 876 third-class passengers. On 8 January 1920, while "Kroonland" was still under repair, the American Line ship , berthed next to her at the Fletcher yard, caught fire. In the multi-alarm fire, firefighters believed that "St. Louis" was a lost cause, and so focused their efforts on saving "Kroonland". At one point, "St. Louis" heeled over and leaned on "Kroonland" but the only resulting damages were scorch marks on her side.

"Kroonland" resumed her civilian career in April 1920, sailing once again for the Red Star Line on the New York – Antwerp route. She sailed from <a href="Chelsea%20Piers">Pier 61</a> on the <a href="North%20River%20%28New%20York-New%20Jersey%29">North River</a> opposite sister ships "Finland" and "Zeeland" and the newer until early 1923. Rough weather on the North Atlantic took its toll on "Kroonland" while sailing this route. A storm off <a href="Sable%20Island">Sable Island</a> in December 1920 was so intense that the liner was only able to travel during one 24-hour stretch and nearly exhausted her fuel supply. When the liner arrived in New York, tugs were required to tow her from the quarantine station to the pier. Heavy seas in another storm in October 1921 broke "Kroonland"s port propeller shaft past Sandy Hook. She returned to New York at and transferred most of the passengers to "Lapland". Another eastbound crossing four months later was marked by almost continuous gales with winds up to ; the liner arrived at <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> covered in ice and snow.

"Kroonland" was also involved in several non-weather-related events. On 12 November 1920, after departing Antwerp for New York, she collided with a Dutch tug in the <a href="Scheldt">Scheldt</a>, killing two of the tug's crew. In March 1921, a <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>n woman gave birth to <a href="fraternal%20twins">fraternal twins</a> on board the liner shortly after she and her husband sailed from Antwerp. Because the twins were born on a U.S.-flagged vessel, they were automatically American citizens. On 10 June 1922, "The New York Times" reported that Charles Simmons, "Kroonland"s Chief Steward, was found dead in his bunk. Crewmen aboard the ship, which had been docked in New York since 4 June, said Simmons had been seen on deck in apparently good health the day before. The medical examiner nevertheless asked police to investigate, because it appeared to him that Simmons had been dead for three to four days. During an August eastbound crossing, "Kroonland" stood by for two hours after receiving a report of an explosion and fire on , some behind. The gas explosion in one of "Adriatic"s forward cargo holds killed five crewmen and seriously wounded three others. It also spawned a fire that was quickly extinguished and left little damage. Offers of help from ten liners (including "Kroonland") were politely declined and "Adriatic" arrived in New York three days later. In October, U.S. Federal judge <a href="Learned%20Hand">Learned Hand</a> issued a restraining order preventing the <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>-related seizure of alcohol aboard "Kroonland", "Finland", and "St. Paul". IMM had sought the order to enable her to continue to carry Italian third-class passengers; Italian law required a minimum number of a ship's crew to be Italian, with Italian wine of at least 12% alcohol provided for them.
"Kroonland" also carried some notable passengers during her time on this route including a majority of the U.S. delegates to the <a href="International%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">International Chamber of Commerce</a> for its meeting in Paris in June 1920. Among those on board were <a href="Myron%20T.%20Herrick">Myron T. Herrick</a>, former U.S. Ambassador to France; <a href="Paul%20Warburg">Paul M. Warburg</a>, former member of the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Board">Federal Reserve Board</a>; and 14 current and former directors of the <a href="United%20States%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">United States Chamber of Commerce</a>. Dr. <a href="Samuel%20Eyde">Samuel Eyde</a>, the newly appointed Norwegian Minister to the United States, sailed for his diplomatic post in December on "Kroonland". On the same trip, Max Goldberg, a 14-year-old flower delivery boy, returned from an accidental roundtrip, begun in New York when the <a href="%3Awikt%3Agangway">gangway</a> was raised and the ship departed while he was making a last-minute delivery. Four of the United States' seven delegates to the <a href="Inter-Parliamentary%20Union">19th Inter-Parliamentary Union Convention</a> in Stockholm—Congressmen <a href="Alben%20W.%20Barkley">Alben W. Barkley</a> and <a href="Edwin%20B.%20Brooks">Edwin B. Brooks</a>, and Senators <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Walsh">Thomas J. Walsh</a> and <a href="William%20B.%20McKinley">William B. McKinley</a>—returned on "Kroonland" in September 1921.

Passengers were not the ship's only cargo during this time. The New York press reported on gold deposits carried to the United States on the liner several times on the Antwerp route. In a storm-tossed December 1920 voyage, for example, she carried $1,650,000 in gold, and the following June she carried £100,000 gold to the <a href="Equitable%20Trust%20Company%20of%20New%20York">Equitable Trust Company</a> in New York. Another notable cargo arrived in New York in November 1922, when "Kroonland" brought of cheese from <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. The shipment was said to be the first big shipment from that country since before World War I. A more unwelcome cargo was carried in March 1921, when a Hungarian immigrant in steerage was found to have <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a>. Discovery of the disease necessitated that all 731 steerage passengers be quarantined indefinitely.

"Kroonland" began her last voyage on the Antwerp route in January 1923, after which she underwent a refit during the first half of 1923. The ship was converted to cabin- and third-class passengers only, and was painted white. In preparation for her announced return to the Panama Pacific Line in October 1923, more refrigeration and cool air space were added for transporting Southern California agricultural products.

After this refit, the ship was briefly assigned to the American Line for three roundtrips on a New York to <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> route, with intermediate stops at Plymouth and <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a>. On her first Hamburg trip, she carried American comedic actress <a href="Florence%20Shirley">Florence Shirley</a> and her husband, headed for a European vacation. <a href="Cecil%20Arden">Cecil Arden</a>, a <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> with the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a>, and <a href="botanist">botanist</a> <a href="Otto%20Warburg%20%28botanist%29">Otto Warburg</a> sailed on the same trip.

In April 1923, IMM announced that "Kroonland" and sister ship "Finland" would be returned to the Panama Pacific Line beginning in late September, sailing from New York to San Francisco via <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, the Panama Canal, and Los Angeles, with Los Angeles being the west coast hub of operations. On 18 October, "Kroonland" departed on her first voyage on the route since 1915. "Kroonland" arrived in <a href="Port%20of%20Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles Harbor</a> on 3 November amidst fanfare, becoming the largest liner to date to enter that harbor.
In contrast to her time on the North Atlantic, "Kroonland" encountered few weather or mechanical delays on the coast-to-coast route. In December 1923, however, the ship was delayed one day by unusually heavy seas and gales off <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a>. Another delay in October 1924 proved to be fatal, according to the ship's physician. An arrival two days late, caused by adverse currents north of Panama, cost a female passenger her life. Had the ship not been delayed, the physician believed, prompt hospital care could have saved her. On this same trip, "Kroonland" passed through a "hurricane zone" but was not adversely affected by the storm.

In December 1924, the Panama Pacific Line announced that it would add to the New York – California route in February to replace "Kroonland". Even though press accounts reported as late as March 1925 that "Kroonland" had sailed her last on the route, she continued carrying passengers and cargo through at least June 1925 because of booming business. Although plans had been announced to convert "Kroonland" and "Finland" to freighters upon the delivery of two new ships ordered for the route in late 1924, there is no evidence that this was ever carried out.

"Kroonland" carried her share of notable passengers during her second stint for the Panama Pacific Line. On her first voyage, passengers included American <a href="Modernism">Modernist</a> poet <a href="Wallace%20Stevens">Wallace Stevens</a> and his wife, Elsie. After transiting the Panama Canal, the liner headed north along the western coast of Mexico. The ship passed the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Tehuantepec">Gulf</a> and <a href="Isthmus%20of%20Tehuantepec">Isthmus of Tehuantepec</a> in early November, inspiring Stevens to later pen the poem "Sea Surface Full Of Clouds". First published in the July 1924 issue of literary magazine "<a href="The%20Dial">The Dial</a>", it was later included in the 1931 edition of Stevens' "<a href="Harmonium%20%28poetry%20collection%29">Harmonium</a>". Each of the five stanzas begins with the line "In that November off Tehuantepec" and is a different portrayal of the surface of the sea. The poem has been called one of Stevens' "most persuasive statements of the imagination's powers", and considered "the most perfect example of a 'pure poem'".

Other notable passengers included <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a> <a href="shortstop">shortstop</a> <a href="Ray%20E.%20French">Ray E. French</a>, who sailed with his wife to their home in California on the same voyage as Stevens. California artist <a href="William%20Barr%20%28artist%29">William Barr</a>, American author <a href="Frederick%20O%27Brien">Frederick O'Brien</a>, and actress <a href="Mary%20Carr">Mary Carr</a> all sailed on "Kroonland" in December 1923. In February 1924, <a href="Daniel%20Willard">Daniel Willard</a>, president of the <a href="Baltimore%20and%20Ohio%20Railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</a>, sailed from New York to Los Angeles. Acknowledging that the Panama Canal had "detract[ed] volumes of freight" from railroads, Willard said that there was no cause for alarm because the railroad business was booming. In January 1925, <a href="Gene%20Byrnes">Gene Byrnes</a>, creator of the <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> "<a href="Reg%27lar%20Fellers">Reg'lar Fellers</a>", sailed from New York to Los Angeles with his wife. On the same voyage, <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> president <a href="Rufus%20B.%20von%20KleinSmid">Rufus B. von KleinSmid</a> boarded "Kroonland" at Panama after attending the <a href="Pan-American%20Scientific%20Congress">Pan-American Scientific Congress</a> in Lima. In mid-June the same year, short story author and screenwriter <a href="H.%20C.%20Witwer">H. C. Witwer</a> and his family returned to New York aboard the ship.

In October 1925, the American Line announced plans for the liner to sail on a weekly New York – Miami route. "Kroonland", supplanted of the Admiral Line as the largest ship in Miami service, and sailed from <a href="Chelsea%20Piers">Pier 62</a> in New York on Thursdays, arrived and departed Miami on Sundays, and returned to New York on Wednesdays. Though "Kroonland"s passenger capacity was potentially much larger, she was outfitted for 500 passengers in first class only. She sailed on her first voyage with 400 passengers, including American professional golfer <a href="Gene%20Sarazen">Gene Sarazen</a>, on 10 December.

By the time the seasonal service to Miami ended in late March 1926, "Kroonland" had carried 11,000 passengers on the route. Though plans were announced for the liner to resume the route the following winter, this did not happen. IMM offered no reasons, but conditions in Miami at the end of 1926 were very different from the previous year. The wild South Florida real estate boom had collapsed in mid 1926, and the <a href="1926%20Miami%20hurricane">Great Miami Hurricane</a> struck on 18 September, killing more than 325 and leaving as many as 50,000 residents homeless, while causing some $100 million damage (just over $2 billion in 2005 dollars). With no place to put the aging ship, IMM <a href="%3Awikt%3Alaid%20up">laid up</a> "Kroonland" in Hoboken.

The ship was later sold to shipbreakers in Italy and departed the United States for the last time on 29 January 1927. After delivering a cargo of grain to her old homeport of Antwerp, she was taken to <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> and scrapped. According to an Associated Press report, "Kroonland" had completed 234 voyages totaling during the course of her career without serious accident.

Chandralekha (1948 film)

Chandralekha (also spelt Chandraleka) is a 1948 Tamil Indian <a href="historical%20fiction">historical</a> <a href="adventure%20film">adventure film</a> directed and produced by <a href="S.%20S.%20Vasan">S. S. Vasan</a>. Starring <a href="T.%20R.%20Rajakumari">T. R. Rajakumari</a>, <a href="M.%20K.%20Radha">M. K. Radha</a> and <a href="Ranjan%20%28actor%29">Ranjan</a> in the lead roles, the film follows two brothers (Veerasimhan and Sasankan) who fight over ruling their father's kingdom and marrying the village dancer, Chandralekha.

Its development began during the early 1940s when, after two successive box-office hits, Vasan announced that his next film would be entitled "Chandralekha". However, when the producer launched an advertising campaign for the film he only had the name of the heroine from a <a href="Gemini%20Studios">Gemini Studios</a> storyline he had rejected. Veppathur Kittoo (one of Vasan's storyboard artists) developed a story based on a chapter of <a href="George%20W.%20M.%20Reynolds">George W. M. Reynolds</a>' novel, "Robert Macaire: or, The French bandit in England". Original director T. G. Raghavachari left the film more than halfway through because of disagreements with Vasan, who took over in his directorial debut.

Originally made in <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> and later in <a href="Hindi%20language">Hindi</a>, "Chandralekha" spent five years in production (1943–1948). It underwent a number of scripting and cast changes, and was the <a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20Indian%20films">most-expensive film made in India</a> at the time. Vasan mortgaged all his property and sold his jewellery to complete the film, whose cinematographers were <a href="Kamal%20Ghosh">Kamal Ghosh</a> and <a href="K.%20Ramnoth">K. Ramnoth</a>. The music, largely inspired by Indian and Western classical music, was composed by <a href="S.%20Rajeswara%20Rao">S. Rajeswara Rao</a> and <a href="M.%20D.%20Parthasarathy">M. D. Parthasarathy</a> with lyrics by <a href="Papanasam%20Sivan">Papanasam Sivan</a> and <a href="Kothamangalam%20Subbu">Kothamangalam Subbu</a>.

"Chandralekha" was released on 9 April 1948. Although the film received generally-positive reviews, it did not recoup its production costs. Vasan directed a Hindi version with some changes, including some re-shot scenes, a slightly altered cast, and Hindi dialogues from <a href="Aghajani%20Kashmeri">Agha Jani Kashmiri</a> and Pandit Indra. The Hindi version was released on 24 December of that year, becoming a box-office success. <a href="Cinema%20of%20South%20India">South Indian cinema</a> became prominent throughout India with the film's release, and it inspired South Indian producers to market their Hindi films in <a href="North%20India">North India</a>. Dubbed in English, Japanese, Danish and other languages, it was screened at Indian and international film festivals.

Veerasimhan (<a href="M.%20K.%20Radha">M. K. Radha</a>) and Sasankan (<a href="Ranjan%20%28actor%29">Ranjan</a>) are the sons of a king. When Veerasimhan rides through a village, he meets a local dancer named Chandralekha (<a href="T.%20R.%20Rajakumari">T. R. Rajakumari</a>) and they fall in love. At the palace, the king decides to <a href="abdication">abdicate</a> his throne in favour of Veerasimhan. This enrages Sasankan, Veerasimhan's younger brother, who forms a gang of thieves; they embark on a crime spree. Chandralekha's father is injured in the ensuing chaos, and dies shortly afterwards. The orphaned Chandralekha joins a band of travelling musicians, whose caravan is raided by Sasankan's gang.

Sasankan orders Chandralekha to dance for him (which she does only after being flogged), but she soon escapes. He later ambushes Veerasimhan and takes him prisoner. Chandralekha watches Sasankan's men imprison Veerasimhan in a cave and seal its entrance with a boulder. She rescues him with the aid of elephants from a passing circus troupe. Veerasimhan and Chandralekha join the circus to hide from Sasankan's men. When Sasankan returns to the palace he imprisons his parents, declares himself king and sends a spy to find Chandralekha.

The spy sees Chandralekha performing in the circus, and tries to capture her. Veerasimhan saves her; they escape and join a group of gypsies. When Veerasimhan goes to find help, Sasankan's men capture Chandralekha and bring her to the palace. When Sasankan tries to woo Chandralekha, she pretends to faint every time he approaches her. One of her circus friends comes to Sasankan disguised as a gypsy healer and claims that she can cure Chandralekha of her "illness". Behind locked doors, the two women talk. Sasankan is pleased to find Chandralekha miraculously cured and apparently ready to accept him as her husband; in return, he agrees to her request for a drum dance at the royal wedding.

Huge drums are arranged in rows in front of the palace. Chandralekha joins the dancers, who dance on the drums. Sasankan is impressed with Chandralekha's performance but, unknown to him, Veerasimhan's soldiers are hiding inside the drums. As the dance ends, they rush out and attack Sasankan's men. Veerasimhan confronts Sasankan, and their lengthy sword fight ends with Sasankan's defeat and imprisonment. Veerasimhan releases his parents and becomes the new king, with Chandralekha as his queen.

Producer <a href="S.%20S.%20Vasan">S. S. Vasan</a> contemplated a story for his third film, which followed "<a href="Bala%20Nagamma%20%281942%20film%29">Bala Nagamma</a>" (1942) and "<a href="Mangamma%20Sapatham%20%281943%20film%29">Mangamma Sapatham</a>" (1943), which earned a profit of 4 million. He wanted to film on a grand scale, with no budgetary constraints. Vasan asked <a href="Gemini%20Studios">Gemini Studios</a>' story department (K. J. Mahadevan, <a href="Kothamangalam%20Subbu">Kothamangalam Subbu</a>, Sangu, Naina and Veppathur Kittoo) to write a screenplay. They saw "Mangamma Sapatham" and "Bala Nagamma" as "heroine-oriented stories", and suggested a similar story. The group told the story of Chandralekha, a tough woman who "outwits a vicious bandit, delivers the final insult by slashing off his nose and, as a finishing touch, fills the bloodied gaping hole with hot, red chilli powder". Vasan disliked the story's gruesomeness and vulgarity; he rejected it, but kept the heroine's name.

Without waiting for a full story, Vasan announced that his next project would be entitled "Chandralekha" and publicised it heavily. Despite hard work by Gemini's writers, the story was not ready three months later. Vasan grew impatient, and told the writers that he would shelve "Chandralekha" in favour of "<a href="Avvaiyar%20%28film%29">Avvaiyyar</a>" (1953). After he gave them one more week, Kittoo discovered <a href="George%20W.%20M.%20Reynolds">George W. M. Reynolds</a>' novel, "Robert Macaire, or the French Bandit in England". In the first chapter, he read:

Vasan was impressed when Kittoo told him a story based on the chapter. He decided to continue with the film, and named the heroine Chandralekha. Although the story was developed by Kittoo, it was credited to the entire Gemini story department.

The script had two major roles: princes in a kingdom, the elder of whom was the hero and the younger the villain. M. K. Radha was offered the part of Sasankan, the younger prince. Since he was then known for heroic roles, Radha was unwilling to play a villain and instead agreed to play the older prince, Veerasimhan. His wife Gnanambal persuaded Vasan to cast Radha in the role. K. J. Mahadevan (a member of Gemini's story department) was chosen to play Sasankan, and T. G. Raghavachari agreed to direct the film. Although some footage of Mahadevan was filmed, his performance was considered "too soft" and he was replaced; however, he remained on the project as a scriptwriter and an assistant director. When Raghavachari suggested Ranjan as Sasankan, Vasan was reluctant; although the producer initially considered the actor too <a href="effeminacy">effeminate</a> to play a "steel-hard villain", Vasan eventually relented. Ranjan had committed to B. N. Rao's "<a href="Saalivaahanan">Saalivaahanan</a>" (1945), but Kittoo persuaded him to test for "Chandralekha" and Rao gave the actor a few days off. The <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a> was successful, and Ranjan was cast.

T. R. Rajakumari was chosen to play Chandralekha replacing Vasan's first choice, <a href="K.%20L.%20V.%20Vasantha">K. L. V. Vasantha</a>. According to film historian <a href="Randor%20Guy">Randor Guy</a>, Vasan chose Rajakumari over Vasantha because she was leaving Gemini Studios for <a href="Modern%20Theatres">Modern Theatres</a> in <a href="Salem%2C%20Tamil%20Nadu">Salem, Tamil Nadu</a>. In April 1947 N. S. Krishnan, who had been convicted in the <a href="Lakshmikanthan%20murder%20case">Lakshmikanthan murder case</a>, was released from prison on appeal; Vasan recruited Krishnan and T. A. Madhuram to play the circus artists who help Veerasimhan rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. The script was rewritten, with scenes added to showcase the comic duo. Madurai Sriramulu Naidu and <a href="S.%20N.%20Lakshmi">S. N. Lakshmi</a> made their acting debuts in the film; Naidu had an uncredited role as a horseman, and Lakshmi was a dancer in the climactic drum-dance scene.

Struggling stage actor Villupuram Chinniah Pillai Ganeshamurthy (later known as <a href="Sivaji%20Ganesan">Sivaji Ganesan</a>), who had contacted Kittoo several times for a role in "Chandralekha", was interested in a minor role as Veerasimhan's bodyguard and grew his hair long for the part. Kittoo eventually brought Ganeshamurthy to Vasan, who had seen him perform onstage. Vasan turned the actor down, calling him "totally unsuited for films" and telling him to choose another profession; the incident created a permanent rift between Vasan and Ganeshamurthy. The role of the bodyguard was eventually given to N. Seetharaman, who later became known as <a href="Javar%20Seetharaman">Javar Seetharaman</a>.

Kothamangalam Subbu's wife, M. S. Sundari Bai, played a circus performer who helps Chandralekha escape from Sasankan. T. A. Jayalakshmi, in one of her earliest film roles, appeared briefly in one scene as a dancer. L. Narayana Rao played the circus manager. T. E. Krishnamachari played the king, and V. N. Janaki a gypsy dancer who gives Chandralekha and Veerasimhan shelter in the forest. Kakinada Rajarathnam played the queen. Veppathur Kittoo played Sasankan's spy and was an assistant director. Pottai Krishnamurthy appeared in the song "Naattiya Kuthirai". Other supporting actors included Seshagiri Bhagavathar, Appanna Iyengar, T. V. Kalyani, Surabhi Kamala, Subbiah Pillai, N. Ramamurthi, Ramakrishna Rao, Sundara Rao, V. S. Susheela, Varalakshmi, Velayutham and "100 Gemini boys and 500 Gemini girls". Studio staff members, their families and passers-by were recruited as extras to play spectators in the circus scenes, and Vasan introduced Chandralekha in a <a href="voice-over">voice-over</a> during her circus performance.

"Chandralekha" began filming in 1943. Raghavachari directed more than half the film, but after differences of opinion with Vasan over the shooting of scenes at the Governor's Estate (now <a href="Raj%20Bhavan%20%28Chennai%29">Raj Bhavan, Guindy</a>) he left the project. Vasan took over, for his directorial debut.

The film did not originally include circus scenes. Vasan decided to add them halfway through production, and the screenplay was changed. For the scene where Veerasimhan is freed from a cave by elephants, "hundreds" of circus elephants were used. Kittoo travelled throughout <a href="South%20India">South India</a> and Ceylon (now <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>), seeing over 50 circuses before he chose the Kamala Circus Company and Parasuram Lion Circus; Vasan employed Kamala for a month. The circus scenes were shot by <a href="K.%20Ramnoth">K. Ramnoth</a>. Kittoo reminisced about the cinematographer's work:In those days, we had no zoom lenses and yet Ramnoth did it. One night, while Chandralekha is performing on the flying trapeze, she notices the villain's henchman in the front row. She is on her perch high up and he is seated in a ringside chair. Shock hits her and to convey the shock the camera zooms fast from her to the man. Today, with a fast zoom shot it can be done very easily, but there was no such lens forty years ago. Ramnoth did it using the crane. He planned it well and rehearsed the shot for long. He took the shot 20 times and selected the best "take".

After Raghavachari's departure, the drum-dance scene he directed remained in the film. The scene involved 400 dancers and six months of daily rehearsals. It was designed by chief art director A. K. Sekhar, choreographed by Jayashankar and filmed with four cameras by <a href="Kamal%20Ghosh">Kamal Ghosh</a>. Randor Guy estimated that the scene cost (about US$105,000 in 1948); in his 2015 book, "Madras Studios: Narrative, Genre, and Ideology in Tamil Cinema", Swarnavel Eswaran Pillai estimated that the scene cost —the entire budget of a typical Tamil film of the period. The scene included the <a href="Kathakali">Kathakali</a> and <a href="Bharatanatyam">Bharatanatyam</a> <a href="Indian%20classical%20dance">classical dances</a> and the Sri Lankan <a href="Kandyan%20dance">Kandyan dance</a>. <a href="A.%20Vincent">A. Vincent</a>, who later became an established cinematographer and director in <a href="Malayalam%20cinema">Malayalam cinema</a>, assisted Ghosh in this film.

During <a href="post-production">post-production</a>, Vasan asked Ramnoth his opinion of the scene when hundreds of Veerasimhan's warriors storm the palace to rescue Chandralekha from Sasankan. Although the scene's photography, shots and action had been unanimously praised by others, Ramnoth was quiet before saying that the suspense might be ruined if the scene was shown uncut. This sparked a discussion; Vasan advised the <a href="film%20editing">editor</a> Chandru to edit in accordance with Ramnoth's direction, and was impressed with the result. C. E. Biggs was the film's <a href="audio%20engineer">audio engineer</a>.

"Chandralekha" was in production for five years (1943–1948), with changes to its story, cast and filming which generated substantial time and <a href="cost%20overrun">cost overrun</a>s. The film ultimately cost 3 million (about $600,000 in 1948), and was the <a href="List%20of%20most%20expensive%20Indian%20films">most-expensive Indian film</a> at the time. Vasan mortgaged all his property, received financial assistance from "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" editor <a href="K.%20Srinivasan">K. Srinivasan</a> and sold his jewellery to complete the film. Adjusted for inflation, "Chandralekha" would have cost $28 million in 2010. According to historian <a href="S.%20Muthiah">S. Muthiah</a>, with the free-floating exchange rate in effect at the time it was the first film with a budget of over a million dollars made outside the United States.

Although a <a href="Historical%20period%20drama">period film</a>, "Chandralekha" is not based on historical fact; its plot is based on the first chapter of "Robert Macaire, or the French Bandit in England". Sasankan is based on Macaire and, according to film historian B. D. Garga, Chandralekha is "probably" based on a female dancer in the novel whom Macaire flogs when she refuses to dance; the film includes the scene from the novel. Garga noted that "Chandralekha" was also influenced by other Western literary and cinematic works, including the novel "<a href="Vicente%20Blasco%20Ib%C3%A1%C3%B1ez">Blood and Sand</a>" (1908) and the films "<a href="The%20Mark%20of%20Zorro%20%281920%20film%29">The Mark of Zorro</a>" (1920), "<a href="Robin%20Hood%20%281922%20film%29">Robin Hood</a>" (1922), "<a href="The%20Thief%20of%20Bagdad%20%281924%20film%29">The Thief of Baghdad</a>" (1924) and "" (1925). In December 1964, film historian <a href="Jerzy%20Toeplitz">Jerzy Toeplitz</a> called the film an "extension and development" of the mythological genre: "The characters are mortals but behave like heavenly beings, and their movements and gestures, like those of the gods and heroes of the "<a href="Mahabharata">Mahabharata</a>" are impregnated with the miraculous." Toeplitz wrote that the story was a "mere pretext to hold together the different episodes, each of which builds up like a circus turn: the tension mounts to a culminating point, whereupon the next episode immediately takes over." According to Roy Armes' 1987 book, "Third World Film Making and the West", <a href="Uday%20Shankar">Uday Shankar</a>'s 1948 "<a href="Kalpana%20%281948%20film%29">Kalpana</a>" (also filmed at Gemini Studios) inspired Vasan to make "Chandralekha". In the 2003 "Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema", the film is described as a "<a href="Ruritanian%20romance">Ruritanian</a> period extravaganza".

The climactic sword fight between Veerasimhan and Sasankan has been compared to the fight in the 1894 novel, "<a href="The%20Prisoner%20of%20Zenda">The Prisoner of Zenda</a>". In 1976, American film historian <a href="William%20K.%20Everson">William K. Everson</a> compared the comedians in "Chandralekha" to <a href="Laurel%20and%20Hardy">Laurel and Hardy</a>. Although Randor Guy considers the film's drum-dance scene the first of its kind in Indian cinema, the 1947 film "<a href="Naam%20Iruvar">Naam Iruvar</a>" includes a scene when the lead actress' younger sister dances on drums to the Tamil poet <a href="Subramania%20Bharati">Subramania Bharati</a>'s "Kottu Murase"; French film historian Yves Thoraval wrote that it "prefigured the dance that "Chandralekha" made famous the very next year." According to American film critic <a href="Jonathan%20Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a>, the film "belongs to the same childhood continuum" as <a href="Fritz%20Lang">Fritz Lang</a>'s 1959 films "<a href="The%20Tiger%20of%20Eschnapur%20%281959%20film%29">The Tiger of Eschnapur</a>" and "<a href="The%20Indian%20Tomb%20%281959%20film%29">The Indian Tomb</a>" (which were set in India). In his 2009 book, "50 Indian Film Classics", film critic <a href="M.%20K.%20Raghavendra">M. K. Raghavendra</a> wrote that "Chandralekha" was constructed in a manner which "enables its narrative to incorporate elements drawn from virtually any kind of genre." According to Guy, the setting of the song "Naattiya Kuthirai" with Sundari Bai (including her dance and costume) were inspired by the 1943 musical film "<a href="Coney%20Island%20%281943%20film%29">Coney Island</a>". Film scholar Uma Vangal wrote that the film reflects Vasan's "vision of a truly democratic nation, based on equal rights for men and women" by portraying "a world where men and women work together to establish a rightful rule".

"Chandralekha" soundtrack was composed by <a href="S.%20Rajeswara%20Rao">S. Rajeswara Rao</a>, with lyrics by <a href="Papanasam%20Sivan">Papanasam Sivan</a> and Kothamangalam Subbu. R. Vaidyanathan and B. Das Gupta collaborated with <a href="M.%20D.%20Parthasarathy">M. D. Parthasarathy</a> on the background music. Rajeswara Rao recalled in a 1993 interview for "The Hindu" that it took him over a year to compose the film's music, with much of his time devoted to the drum-dance scene: "As the dancers performed, we used to rehearse and compose the music. It was done with incredibly few instruments. We used a piano, ten double-bass violins, and drums from Africa, Egypt, and Persia which we have acquired from an African War troupe." Rao's salary was 1,500. The music was influenced by <a href="Carnatic%20music">Carnatic</a> and <a href="Hindustani%20classical%20music">Hindustani</a> music, <a href="Latin%20American%20music">Latin American</a> and <a href="Portuguese%20folk%20music">Portuguese folk music</a> and <a href="Johann%20Strauss%20I">Strauss</a> waltzes. According to M. K. Raghavendra, "Chandralekha" has "snatches from <a href="Richard%20Wagner">[Richard] Wagner</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">[Nikolai] Rimsky-Korsakov</a> ("<a href="Scheherazade%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Scherezade</a>") being used at dramatic moments."

"Naattiya Kuthirai", not originally part of the film, was added during final production. Sundari Bai spent over a month rehearsing the song. M. D. Parthasarathy was the sole singer of "Aathoram Kodikkalam" and co-singer of "Naattiya Kuthirai". J. Cooling Rajaiah played accordion and piano in the film's gypsy song. The circus chorus was adapted from "The Donkey Serenade" in <a href="Robert%20Z.%20Leonard">Robert Z. Leonard</a>'s 1937 film, "<a href="The%20Firefly%20%28film%29">The Firefly</a>". Vasan offered most of the songs on the Hindi soundtrack to Uma Devi, who later became popularly known as <a href="Tun%20Tun">Tun Tun</a>. She initially hesitated, feeling that "[they] were beyond her capabilities", but was supported by Rajeswara Rao (who "worked hard on her"). "Sanjh Ki Bela", from the Hindi soundtrack, is loosely based on "Sanjh Ki Bela Panchhi Akela" from "<a href="Jwar%20Bhata%20%281944%20film%29">Jwar Bhata</a>" (1944). "Chandralekha" music helped make it one of the most-successful Indian musical films of the 1940s, and it "created an atmosphere for a number of music directors influenced by Western music" in Tamil cinema. The film was a breakthrough for Uma Devi, despite <a href="breach%20of%20contract">breaching her contract</a> with producer <a href="Abdur%20Rashid%20Kardar">Abdur Rashid Kardar</a> (who terminated her contract in retaliation). However, this and the "dwindling fortunes" of the film industry after India's independence from the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> eventually ended her career in playback singing.

In his 1997 book, "Starlight, Starbright: The Early Tamil Cinema", Randor Guy said that Parthasarathy and Rajeswara Rao "created a fine blend of lilting music of many schools." Writing for "<a href="Screen%20%28magazine%29">Screen</a>" in April 1998, film historian M. Bhaktavatsala described "Chandralekha" songs as "distinct and standing on [their] own, with barely any background score attempting to interlink anything, just periods of silence." Historian <a href="V.%20Sriram">V. Sriram</a> stated in 2018 that, although the film had no memorable songs, "Aayilo Pakiriyama", sung by Krishnan, Madhuram and Sundari Bai, was his favourite one.

The first advertisement for "Chandralekha" appeared on the back cover of the songbook for the film, "<a href="Dasi%20Aparanji">Dasi Aparanji</a>" (1944). In the advertisement, Vasantha was the heroine before she was replaced by Rajakumari. With "Chandralekha", Gemini was the first Tamil studio to attempt to distribute a film throughout India. According to film scholar <a href="P.%20K.%20Nair">P. K. Nair</a>, it was the first Indian film with a full-page newspaper advertisement. In a 2010 "<a href="Mumbai%20Mirror">Mumbai Mirror</a>" article, Vishwas Kulkarni wrote that 574,500 was spent on the film's newspaper publicity and 642,300 on posters, banners and billboards. "Chandralekha" publicity campaign was the most expensive for an Indian film at the time; the publicity budget for a typical Indian film a decade earlier was about 25,000, and publicity for a "top Indian film" cost no more than 100,000 during the 1950s. According to Guy, the film's publicity campaign "made the nation sit up and take notice".

A. K. Shekhar designed the publicity material, which included posters, booklets and full-page newspaper advertisements. Gemini Studios, inspired by American cinema, also produced a publicity brochure for distribution to exhibitors and the press. It contained a synopsis of the film, a pictorial account of key plot points, and text for use by local theatres. The booklet also had layouts for women's pages, a pictorial account of suggested marketing activities (such as "How to drape an Indian sari: Theatre demonstrations have a big draw") and information about the film's costumes. The costumes were hand-woven silk and gold; one gold-embroidered riding jacket was considered "the most expensive piece of outfitting ever used in a motion picture."

"Chandralekha" was released on 9 April 1948 simultaneously in over 40 theatres throughout South India. A typical 1940s Tamil film was released in about 10 towns, but "Chandralekha" was released simultaneously in 120 towns.

The film was released in Japan as "Shakunetsu-no ketto" ("Fight Under the Red Heat") in April 1954, where it was distributed by Nippon Cinema Corporation (NCC). It was the first Tamil film dubbed in Japanese, and the second Indian film released in Japan; the first was the 1952 <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a> film "<a href="Aan">Aan</a>", which was released in Tokyo in January 1954. NCC later collapsed, and no information about "Chandralekha" Japanese release survives. During the 1950s (when foreign currency was scarce in India), barter was a common means of exchange with overseas business partners; <a href="Reitaku%20University">Reitaku University</a>'s Tamaki Matsuoka believes that this was the case with "Chandralekha". An NCC pamphlet about the film called Vasan the "<a href="Cecil%20B.%20DeMille">Cecil B. DeMille</a> of the Indian film industry". A Danish version of the film, "Indiens hersker" ("India's Ruler"), was released on 26 April 1954. An abridged English-language version of "Chandralekha", "Chandra", was screened in the United States and Europe during the 1950s.

Despite the film's positive reviews and good box-office performance, it was unable to recover its large production costs; Vasan remade it in Hindi in an attempt to do so. The Hindi version, distributed by The Screens (a company in Bombay, now <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>), was released on 24 December 1948. With over 600 prints it was a commercial success, setting box-office records. Vasan called "Chandralekha" "a pageant for our peasants", intended for "the war-weary public that had been forced to watch insipid war propaganda pictures for years." It was selected by the Indian government for screening at the fourth <a href="Karlovy%20Vary%20International%20Film%20Festival%23History">International Film Festival</a> in <a href="Prague">Prague</a> in 1949. The film's success made Madras a production centre for Hindi films. Five years after "Chandralekha" success, Gemini paid its employees a bonus (one of the first studios in the world to do so).

Although exact figures for the film's box-office earnings are not available, film-trade websites provide estimates. <a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a> cited the Hindi version's <a href="Net%20%28economics%29">nett</a> earnings as 7 million, and said that it was the second-highest-grossing Bollywood film of 1948 (after "<a href="Shaheed%20%281948%20film%29">Shaheed</a>"). As of February 2009, the website gave "Chandralekha" adjusted nett gross as 37,98,00,000. According to the 1998 book "Indian cinema: A Visual Voyage", by India's <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20and%20Broadcasting%20%28India%29">Ministry of Information and Broadcasting</a>, "Chandralekha" grossed . Film historian B. D. Garga said in his 2005 book, "Art Of Cinema", "The two versionsTamil and Hindigrossed millions." Sharmishtha Gooptu states in her 2010 book, "Bengali Cinema: An Other Nation", that "Chandralekha" grossed 10 million (about $2,100,000 in 1948) in India. A 2011 article by <a href="Namrata%20Joshi">Namrata Joshi</a> in "<a href="Outlook%20%28magazine%29">Outlook India</a>" says, ""Chandralekha" grossed 1.55 <a href="crore">crore</a> (10.55 million) with an audience of three crore (30 million), 60 percent from rural India."

"Chandralekha" received generally-positive reviews from Indian critics. On 9 April 1948, an article from "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" said: "The Indian Screen has, indeed, in this Province or any other given us little that can bear comparison with Gemini's "Chandraleka" for the sheer magnificence of its backgrounds." On 10 April, a critic from "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>" article termed the film to be "essentially for the young of all ages". A "<a href="Dinamani">Dinamani</a>" article that day stated, "People who were depressed with the quality of our Tamil pictures so far can now raise their heads and hail proudly that a great picture can be produced in our land also." In contrast, "<a href="Kumudam">Kumudam</a>" gave the film a lukewarm review: "Though the story is ordinary, the shocking events inserted into the narrative are something new to the Tamil cinema." The magazine criticised the film's songs and length, also noting the inconsistency in its time period where the king's office featured a wall clock and the king himself was writing with a <a href="quill">quill</a>. In its January 1949 issue "Gundoosi" magazine praised "Chandralekha" Hindi version as an improvement on the Tamil version, noting that it had better dialogue and pacing.

<a href="V.%20A.%20K.%20Ranga%20Rao">V. A. K. Ranga Rao</a> called it "the most complete entertainer ever made." In their 1988 book, "One Hundred Indian Feature Films: An Annotated Filmography", Anil Srivastava and Shampa Banerjee praised "Chandralekha" grandeur, battle scenes and drum dance, which in their opinion was the film's ""raison d'etre"". In 2003, S. Muthiah called it "an epic extravaganza worthy of Cecil B. de. Mille" and "larger-than-life." In their 2008 book, "Global Bollywood: Travels of Hindi Song and Dance", Sangita Gopal and Sujata Moorti wrote that "Chandralekha" translated "the aesthetic of Hollywood <a href="Orientalism">Orientalism</a> for an indigenous mass audience", while also opining the film's drum-dance scene was "perhaps one of the most spectacular sequences in Indian cinema." In his 2009 book, "50 Indian Film Classics", M. K. Raghavendra wrote: "Indian films are rarely constructed in a way that makes undistracted viewing essential to their enjoyment and "Chandralekha" is arranged as a series of distractions".

<a href="Raja%20Sen">Raja Sen</a> praised the film's <a href="set%20piece">set piece</a>s, drum-dance sequence and the "longest swordfight ever captured on film" in May 2010 on <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff</a>, calling "Chandralekha" "just the kind of film, in fact, that would be best appreciated now after digital restoration." Randor Guy appreciated Rajakumari's performance in an October 2010 review, calling "Chandralekha" "her career-best" and saying that she "carried the movie on her shoulders." Guy also noted Radha was his "usual impressive self", saying that the film would be "remembered for: the excellent onscreen narration, the magnificent sets and the immortal drum dance sequence." Director Dhanapal Padmanabhan told K. Jeshi of "The Hindu" in 2013, ""Chandralekha" had grandeur that was at par with Hollywood standards."

Reviewing the English version of "Chandralekha", "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called Rajakumari a "buxom beauty." When the film was screened in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in 1976, William K. Everson said: "It's a colorful, naive and zestful film in which the overall ingenuousness quite disarms criticism of plot absurdity or such production shortcomings as the too-obvious studio "exteriors" ... Last but far from least, <a href="Busby%20Berkeley">Busby Berkeley</a> would surely have been delighted to see his influence extending to the climactic drum dance."

<a href="Jonathan%20Rosenbaum">Jonathan Rosenbaum</a> said in August 1981, "The prospect of a three-hour Indian film in [Tamil] with no subtitles is a little off-putting, I would saywouldn't you?" However, Rosenbaum had "surprisingly little trouble following the plot and action" of the film: "This made-in-Madras costume drama makes for a pretty action-packed 186 minutes." In June 2009, K. S. Sivakumaran of "<a href="Daily%20News%20%28Sri%20Lanka%29">Daily News Sri Lanka</a>" called "Chandralekha" "the first colossal [Tamil] film I saw." Malaysian author D. Devika Bai, writing for the "<a href="New%20Straits%20Times">New Straits Times</a>" in October 2013, praised its technical aspects: "At almost 68, I have not tired of watching the movie."

The Hindi version of "Chandralekha" was Vasan's first film in the language. For this version, Vasan re-shot several scenes and used a slightly different cast. <a href="Aghajani%20Kashmeri">Agha Jani Kashmiri</a> and Pandit Indra wrote the dialogue for the Hindi version. Indra and <a href="Bharat%20Vyas">Bharat Vyas</a> were the lyricists for the Hindi version, and Kothamangalam Subbu and Papanasam Sivan wrote the lyrics for the Tamil version. Rajeswara Rao, who composed the soundtrack for both versions, was assisted by Bal Krishna Kalla on the Hindi version. Parthasarathy and Vaidyanathan composed the Hindi version's background music. The Tamil version was over long, but the Hindi version was edited down to .

Although Rajakumari, Radha and Ranjan reprised their roles in the Hindi version, Radha and Ranjan's characters were renamed. Radha's character (Veerasimhan) was Veer Singh in the Hindi version, and Ranjan's character (Sasankan) was renamed Shashank. Of the other cast members, N. S. Krishnan, T. A. Madhuram, T. E. Krishnamachari, Pottai Krishnamoorthy and N. Seetharaman appeared only in the Tamil version, and Yashodhara Katju and H. K. Chopra appeared only in the Hindi version. Nearly the entire cast were credited in the Tamil version, but only sixRajakumari, Radha, Ranjan, Sundari Bai, Katju and L. Narayana Raowere credited in the Hindi version.

With the film's success, Vasan became known as one of the best directors in Indian cinema. <a href="Kristin%20Thompson">Kristin Thompson</a> and <a href="David%20Bordwell">David Bordwell</a>, authors of "Film History — An Introduction", called it "the biggest box-office hit of the decade." Guy later called Vasan the "Cecil B. DeMille of Tamil cinema", and called "Chandralekha" his ""<a href="masterpiece">magnum opus</a>"." According to S. Muthiah, Vasan "pioneered making South Indian films in English." He inspired producer <a href="A.%20V.%20Meiyappan">A. V. Meiyappan</a>, who became a "master at publicity." The Hindi version's success gave South Indian producers the opportunity to market their Hindi films in North India. "Chandralekha" publicity campaign had such an impact that Bombay producers passed a resolution that a limit should be imposed on advertisements for any film in periodicals. Vasan's "<a href="Apoorva%20Sagodharargal%20%281949%20film%29">Apoorva Sagodharargal</a>" (1949), also a success, is considered an unofficial sequel of the film.

"Chandralekha" enhanced Rajakumari and Ranjan's careers; both became popular throughout India after the film's release. Its climactic sword-fight scene was well received, and is considered the longest sword fight in Indian cinematic history. The drum-dance scene is considered the film's highlight, and later producers tried unsuccessfully to emulate it. Producer-director <a href="T.%20Rajendar">T. Rajendar</a> said that he was inspired by the scene for a song scene budgeted at in his 1999 film, "<a href="Monisha%20En%20Monalisa">Monisha En Monalisa</a>". Film historian Firoze Rangoonwalla ranked "Chandralekha" Hindi version eighth on his list of the top twenty films of Indian cinema. It was a major influence on <a href="Kamalakara%20Kameswara%20Rao">Kamalakara Kameswara Rao</a>'s 1953 Telugu film, "<a href="Chandraharam">Chandraharam</a>", featuring <a href="N.%20T.%20Rama%20Rao">N. T. Rama Rao</a>. On 26 August 2004, a postage stamp with Vasan and the drum dance was issued to commemorate the producer's centenary and the 35th anniversary of his death.

In July 2007, S. R. Ashok Kumar of "The Hindu" asked eight Tamil film directors to list their all-time favourite Tamil films; two<a href="J.%20Mahendran">J. Mahendran</a> and <a href="K.%20Balachander">K. Balachander</a>named "Chandralekha". Mahendran said, "If anybody tries to remake this black-and-white film, they will make a mockery of it." According to Balachander, "Just like "<a href="Sivaji%20%28film%29">Sivaji</a>" today, people talked about "Chandralekha" in the past. Produced at a cost of 30 <a href="lakh">lakh</a>s ([3 million], a huge sum at that time), it has grand sets. I have seen it 12 times." In December 2008, Muthiah said: "Given how spectacular it wasand the appreciation lavished on it from 1948 till well into the 1950s, which is when I caught up with itI'm sure that if re-released, it would do better at the box office than most Tamil films today." In a 2011 interview with <a href="Indo-Asian%20News%20Service">Indo-Asian News Service</a> (IANS), South Indian Bollywood actor <a href="Vyjayanthimala">Vyjayanthimala</a> said that although people consider that she "paved the way" for other South Indian female actors in Hindi cinema, "the person who really opened the doors was S. S. Vasan ... When ["Chandralekha" was] released, it took the North by storm because by then they haven't seen that kind of lavish sets, costumes and splendour. So Vasan was the person who opened the door for Hindi films in the South."

"Chandralekha" was K. Ramnoth's last film for Gemini Studios. Although he is often credited with shooting the drum-dance sequence, Ramnoth left the studio in August 1947 (before the scene was conceived). Director <a href="Singeetham%20Srinivasa%20Rao">Singeetham Srinivasa Rao</a> told film critic <a href="Baradwaj%20Rangan">Baradwaj Rangan</a> that he disliked "Chandralekha" when he first saw it and recognised it as a classic only after 25 years, "a fact that the audiences realised in just two minutes." Film producer and writer <a href="G.%20Dhananjayan">G. Dhananjayan</a> told "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>", "When you talk of black-and-white films, you cannot resist mentioning the 1948 epic "Chandralekha" ... That film's grandeur, be it in the sets, costumes, songs, dances and the fight sequences, still remains a benchmark even this day of colour and 3D films." In April 2012, Rediff included the film on its "A to Z of Tamil Cinema" list and said that "Chandralekha" "boasted an ensemble cast, great production values and a story that ensured it became a blockbuster all over India, the first of its kind."

It has been screened at many film festivals, and was shown in December 2012 at the 10th <a href="Chennai%20International%20Film%20Festival">Chennai International Film Festival</a> (a tribute to 100 years of Indian cinema). "Chandralekha" was screened in April 2013 at the Centenary Film Festival, organised by India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the <a href="National%20Film%20Archive%20of%20India">National Film Archive</a>. It was one of eight Indian films screened at the 28th Italian <a href="Il%20Cinema%20Ritrovato">Il Cinema Ritrovato</a> in 2014 as part of "The Golden 50s: India's Endangered Classics", the festival's first Indian-cinema retrospective. In his "Times of India" review of "" (2015), M. Suganth wrote that director <a href="S.%20S.%20Rajamouli">S. S. Rajamouli</a> had "take[n] his cues [for its visuals] from varied sources" (including "Chandralekha"). In a November 2015 interview with Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of "The Hindu", actor <a href="Kamal%20Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a> said: "Visual appeal has always gone hand-in-hand with content, since the days of "Chandralekha" and ["<a href="Mayabazar">Mayabazar</a>"], not just after "Baahubali"."

Fluorine is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol F and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 9.

As the most <a href="electronegativity">electronegative</a> element, it is extremely reactive, as it reacts with almost all other elements, except for helium and neon.

Proposed as an element in 1810, fluorine proved difficult and dangerous to separate from its compounds, and several early experimenters died or sustained injuries from their attempts. Only in 1886 did French chemist <a href="Henri%20Moissan">Henri Moissan</a> isolate elemental fluorine using low-temperature <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a>, a process still employed for modern production.

<a href="Fluorocarbon">Fluorocarbon</a> gases are generally <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es with <a href="global-warming%20potential">global-warming potential</a>s 100 to 20,000 times that of <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. <a href="Organofluorine%20compound">Organofluorine compound</a>s often persist in the environment due to the strength of the <a href="carbon%E2%80%93fluorine%20bond">carbon–fluorine bond</a>. Fluorine has no known metabolic role in mammals; a few <a href="plants">plants</a> and <a href="sea%20sponges">sea sponges</a> synthesize organofluorine poisons that help deter predation.

Fluorine atoms have nine electrons, one fewer than <a href="neon">neon</a>, and <a href="electron%20configuration">electron configuration</a> 1s2s2p: two electrons in a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one more to be filled. The outer electrons are ineffective at nuclear <a href="Shielding%20effect">shielding</a>, and experience a high <a href="effective%20nuclear%20charge">effective nuclear charge</a> of 9 − 2 = 7; this affects the atom's physical properties.

Fluorine's <a href="ionization%20energy">first ionization energy</a> is third-highest among all elements, behind helium and neon, which complicates the removal of electrons from neutral fluorine atoms. It also has a high <a href="electron%20affinity">electron affinity</a>, second only to <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a>, and tends to capture an electron to become <a href="isoelectronicity">isoelectronic</a> with the noble gas neon; it has the highest <a href="electronegativity">electronegativity</a> of any element. Fluorine atoms have a small <a href="Covalent%20radius%20of%20fluorine">covalent radius</a> of around 60 <a href="picometer">picometer</a>s, similar to those of its <a href="period%202%20element">period</a> neighbors oxygen and neon.

The <a href="bond%20energy">bond energy</a> of <a href="Compounds%20of%20fluorine%23Difluorine">difluorine</a> is much lower than that of either or and similar to the easily cleaved <a href="peroxide">peroxide</a> bond; this, along with high electronegativity, accounts for fluorine's easy dissociation, high reactivity, and strong bonds to non-fluorine atoms. Conversely, bonds to other atoms are very strong because of fluorine's high electronegativity. Unreactive substances like powdered steel, glass fragments, and <a href="asbestos">asbestos</a> fibers react quickly with cold fluorine gas; wood and water spontaneously combust under a fluorine jet.

Reactions of elemental fluorine with metals require varying conditions. <a href="Alkali%20metal">Alkali metal</a>s cause explosions and <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>s display vigorous activity in bulk; to prevent <a href="Passivation%20%28chemistry%29">passivation</a> from the formation of metal fluoride layers, most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered, and <a href="noble%20metal">noble metal</a>s require pure fluorine gas at 300–450 °C (575–850 °F). Some solid nonmetals (sulfur, phosphorus) react vigorously in liquid air temperature fluorine. <a href="Hydrogen%20sulfide">Hydrogen sulfide</a> and <a href="sulfur%20dioxide">sulfur dioxide</a> combine readily with fluorine, the latter sometimes explosively; <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> exhibits much less activity, requiring elevated temperatures.

<a href="Hydrogen">Hydrogen</a>, like some of the alkali metals, reacts explosively with fluorine. <a href="Carbon">Carbon</a>, as <a href="lamp%20black">lamp black</a>, reacts at room temperature to yield <a href="fluoromethane">fluoromethane</a>. Graphite combines with fluorine above 400 °C (750 °F) to produce <a href="non-stoichiometric%20compound">non-stoichiometric</a> <a href="carbon%20monofluoride">carbon monofluoride</a>; higher temperatures generate gaseous <a href="fluorocarbon">fluorocarbon</a>s, sometimes with explosions. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide react at or just above room temperature, whereas <a href="paraffin%20wax">paraffins</a> and other organic chemicals generate strong reactions: even fully substituted <a href="haloalkane">haloalkane</a>s such as <a href="carbon%20tetrachloride">carbon tetrachloride</a>, normally incombustible, may explode. Although <a href="nitrogen%20trifluoride">nitrogen trifluoride</a> is stable, nitrogen requires an <a href="Electric%20discharge%20in%20gases">electric discharge</a> at elevated temperatures for reaction with fluorine to occur, due to the very strong <a href="triple%20bond">triple bond</a> in elemental nitrogen; ammonia may react explosively. Oxygen does not combine with fluorine under ambient conditions, but can be made to react using electric discharge at low temperatures and pressures; the products tend to disintegrate into their constituent elements when heated. Heavier halogens react readily with fluorine as does the noble gas <a href="radon">radon</a>; of the other noble gases, only <a href="xenon">xenon</a> and <a href="krypton">krypton</a> react, and only under special conditions.

At room temperature, fluorine is a gas of <a href="diatomic%20molecule">diatomic molecule</a>s, pale yellow when pure (sometimes described as yellow-green). It has a characteristic pungent odor detectable at 20 <a href="parts%20per%20billion">ppb</a>. Fluorine condenses into a bright yellow liquid at −188 °C (−306 °F), a transition temperature similar to those of oxygen and nitrogen.

Fluorine has two solid forms, α- and β-fluorine. The latter crystallizes at −220 °C (−364 °F) and is transparent and soft, with the same disordered <a href="Cubic%20crystal%20system">cubic</a> structure of freshly crystallized solid oxygen, unlike the <a href="orthorhombic%20crystal%20system">orthorhombic</a> systems of other solid halogens. Further cooling to −228 °C (−378 °F) induces a <a href="phase%20transition">phase transition</a> into opaque and hard α-fluorine, which has a <a href="monoclinic%20crystal%20system">monoclinic</a> structure with dense, angled layers of molecules. The transition from β- to α-fluorine is more <a href="exothermic">exothermic</a> than the condensation of fluorine, and can be violent.

Only one <a href="isotope">isotope</a> of fluorine occurs naturally in abundance, the stable isotope . It has a high <a href="magnetogyric%20ratio">magnetogyric ratio</a> and exceptional sensitivity to magnetic fields; because it is also <a href="monoisotopic%20element">the only stable isotope</a>, it is <a href="Fluorine-19%20nuclear%20magnetic%20resonance">used</a> in <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a>. Seventeen <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s with <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a>s from 14 to 31 have been synthesized, of which <a href="Fluorine-18"></a> is the most stable with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of 109.77 minutes. Other radioisotopes have half-lives less than 70 seconds; most decay in less than half a second. The isotopes and undergo <a href="positron%20emission">β decay</a> and <a href="electron%20capture">electron capture</a>, lighter isotopes decay by <a href="proton%20emission">proton emission</a>, and those heavier than undergo <a href="beta%20minus%20decay">β decay</a> (the heaviest ones with delayed <a href="neutron%20emission">neutron emission</a>). Two <a href="nuclear%20isomer">metastable isomers</a> of fluorine are known, , with a half-life of 162(7) nanoseconds, and , with a half-life of 2.2(1) milliseconds.

Among the lighter elements, fluorine's abundance value of 400 <a href="parts-per%20notation">ppb</a> (parts per billion) – 24th among elements in the universe – is exceptionally low: other elements from carbon to magnesium are twenty or more times as common. This is because <a href="stellar%20nucleosynthesis">stellar nucleosynthesis</a> processes bypass fluorine, and any fluorine atoms otherwise created have high <a href="nuclear%20cross%20section">nuclear cross section</a>s, allowing further fusion with hydrogen or helium to generate oxygen or neon respectively.

Beyond this transient existence, three explanations have been proposed for the presence of fluorine:

Fluorine is the thirteenth most <a href="Abundance%20of%20elements%20in%20Earth%27s%20crust">common element in Earth's crust</a> at 600–700 ppm (parts per million) by mass. Elemental fluorine in Earth's atmosphere would easily react with atmospheric <a href="water%20vapor">water vapor</a>, precluding its natural occurrence; it is found only in combined mineral forms, of which <a href="fluorite">fluorite</a>, <a href="fluorapatite">fluorapatite</a> and <a href="cryolite">cryolite</a> are the most industrially significant. Fluorite or fluorspar (), colorful and abundant worldwide, is fluorine's main source; China and Mexico are the major suppliers. The U.S. led extraction in the early 20th century but ceased mining in 1995. Although fluorapatite (Ca(PO)F) contains most of the world's fluorine, its low <a href="mass%20fraction%20%28chemistry%29">mass fraction</a> of 3.5% means that most of it is used as a phosphate. In the U.S. small quantities of fluorine compounds are obtained via <a href="fluorosilicic%20acid">fluorosilicic acid</a>, a phosphate industry byproduct. Cryolite (), once used directly in aluminium production, is the rarest and most concentrated of these three minerals. The main commercial mine on Greenland's west coast closed in 1987, and most cryolite is now synthesized.

Other minerals such as <a href="topaz">topaz</a> contain fluorine. Fluorides, unlike other halides, are insoluble and do not occur in commercially favorable concentrations in saline waters. Trace quantities of organofluorines of uncertain origin have been detected in volcanic eruptions and geothermal springs. The existence of gaseous fluorine in crystals, suggested by the smell of crushed <a href="antozonite">antozonite</a>, is contentious; a 2012 study reported the presence of 0.04% by weight in antozonite, attributing these <a href="inclusion%20%28mineral%29">inclusions</a> to radiation from the presence of tiny amounts of <a href="uranium">uranium</a>.

In 1529, <a href="Georgius%20Agricola">Georgius Agricola</a> described fluorite as an additive used to lower the melting point of metals during <a href="smelting">smelting</a>. He penned the Latin word "fluorés" ("fluor," flow) for fluorite rocks. The name later evolved into "fluorspar" (still commonly used) and then "fluorite". The composition of fluorite was later determined to be <a href="calcium%20difluoride">calcium difluoride</a>.

<a href="Hydrofluoric%20acid">Hydrofluoric acid</a> was used in <a href="glass%20etching">glass etching</a> from 1720 onwards. <a href="Andreas%20Sigismund%20Marggraf">Andreas Sigismund Marggraf</a> first characterized it in 1764 when he heated fluorite with sulfuric acid, and the resulting solution corroded its glass container. Swedish chemist <a href="Carl%20Wilhelm%20Scheele">Carl Wilhelm Scheele</a> repeated the experiment in 1771, and named the acidic product "fluss-spats-syran" (fluorspar acid). In 1810, the French physicist <a href="Andr%C3%A9-Marie%20Amp%C3%A8re">André-Marie Ampère</a> suggested that hydrogen and an element analogous to chlorine constituted hydrofluoric acid. <a href="Humphry%20Davy">Sir Humphry Davy</a> proposed that this then-unknown substance be named "fluorine" from fluoric acid and the "-ine" suffix of other halogens. This word, with modifications, is used in most European languages; Greek, Russian, and some others (following Ampère's suggestion) use the name "ftor" or derivatives, from the Greek φθόριος ("phthorios", destructive). The New Latin name "fluorum" gave the element its current symbol F; Fl was used in early papers.

Initial studies on fluorine were so dangerous that several 19th-century experimenters were deemed "fluorine martyrs" after misfortunes with hydrofluoric acid. Isolation of elemental fluorine was hindered by the extreme corrosiveness of both elemental fluorine itself and hydrogen fluoride, as well as the lack of a simple and suitable <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a>. <a href="Edmond%20Fr%C3%A9my">Edmond Frémy</a> postulated that <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of pure hydrogen fluoride to generate fluorine was feasible and devised a method to produce anhydrous samples from acidified <a href="potassium%20bifluoride">potassium bifluoride</a>; instead, he discovered that the resulting (dry) hydrogen fluoride <a href="insulator%20%28electricity%29">did not conduct</a> electricity. Frémy's former student <a href="Henri%20Moissan">Henri Moissan</a> persevered, and after much trial and error found that a mixture of potassium bifluoride and dry hydrogen fluoride was a conductor, enabling electrolysis. To prevent rapid corrosion of the platinum in his <a href="electrochemical%20cell">electrochemical cell</a>s, he cooled the reaction to extremely low temperatures in a special bath and forged cells from a more resistant mixture of platinum and <a href="iridium">iridium</a>, and used fluorite stoppers. In 1886, after 74 years of effort by many chemists, Moissan isolated elemental fluorine.

In 1906, two months before his death, Moissan received the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Chemistry">Nobel Prize in Chemistry</a>, with the following citation:

The <a href="Frigidaire">Frigidaire</a> division of <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> (GM) experimented with chlorofluorocarbon refrigerants in the late 1920s, and <a href="Kinetic%20Chemicals">Kinetic Chemicals</a> was formed as a joint venture between GM and <a href="DuPont">DuPont</a> in 1930 hoping to market Freon-12 () as one such <a href="refrigerant">refrigerant</a>. It replaced earlier and more toxic compounds, increased demand for kitchen refrigerators, and became profitable; by 1949 DuPont had bought out Kinetic and marketed several other <a href="Freon">Freon</a> compounds. <a href="Polytetrafluoroethylene">Polytetrafluoroethylene</a> (Teflon) was serendipitously discovered in 1938 by <a href="Roy%20J.%20Plunkett">Roy J. Plunkett</a> while working on refrigerants at Kinetic, and its superlative chemical and thermal resistance lent it to accelerated commercialization and mass production by 1941.

Large-scale production of elemental fluorine began during World War II. Germany used high-temperature electrolysis to make tons of the planned incendiary chlorine trifluoride and the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> used huge quantities to produce <a href="uranium%20hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> for uranium enrichment. Since is as corrosive as fluorine, <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> plants required special materials: nickel for membranes, fluoropolymers for seals, and liquid fluorocarbons as coolants and lubricants. This burgeoning nuclear industry later drove post-war fluorochemical development.

Fluorine has a rich chemistry, encompassing organic and inorganic domains. It combines with metals, nonmetals, <a href="metalloid">metalloid</a>s, and most noble gases, and almost exclusively assumes an <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a> of −1. Fluorine's high electron affinity results in a preference for <a href="ionic%20bonding">ionic bonding</a>; when it forms <a href="covalent%20bond">covalent bond</a>s, these are polar, and almost always <a href="single%20bond">single</a>.

Alkali metals form ionic and highly soluble <a href="monofluoride">monofluoride</a>s; these have the <a href="Cubic%20crystal%20system%23Rock-salt%20structure">cubic arrangement of sodium chloride</a> and analogous chlorides. Alkaline earth <a href="difluoride">difluoride</a>s possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water, with the exception of <a href="beryllium%20difluoride">beryllium difluoride</a>, which also exhibits some covalent character and has a <a href="silicon%20dioxide">quartz</a>-like structure. <a href="Rare%20earth%20element">Rare earth element</a>s and many other metals form mostly ionic <a href="trifluoride">trifluoride</a>s.

Covalent bonding first comes to prominence in the <a href="tetrafluoride">tetrafluoride</a>s: those of zirconium, hafnium and several actinides are ionic with high melting points, while those of titanium, vanadium, and niobium are polymeric, melting or decomposing at no more than 350 °C (660 °F). <a href="Pentafluoride">Pentafluoride</a>s continue this trend with their linear polymers and <a href="oligomer">oligomer</a>ic complexes. Thirteen metal <a href="hexafluoride">hexafluoride</a>s are known, all octahedral, and are mostly volatile solids but for liquid and , and gaseous . <a href="Rhenium%20heptafluoride">Rhenium heptafluoride</a>, the only characterized metal <a href="heptafluoride">heptafluoride</a>, is a low-melting molecular solid with <a href="pentagonal%20bipyramidal%20molecular%20geometry">pentagonal bipyramidal molecular geometry</a>. Metal fluorides with more fluorine atoms are particularly reactive.

Hydrogen and fluorine combine to yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">hydrogen chloride</a>. It boils at a much higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully <a href="miscible">miscible</a> with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are <a href="strong%20acids">strong</a>, hydrofluoric acid is a <a href="weak%20acid">weak acid</a> at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.

Binary fluorides of metalloids and p-block nonmetals are generally covalent and volatile, with varying reactivities. <a href="Period%203">Period 3</a> and heavier nonmetals can form <a href="hypervalent%20molecule">hypervalent</a> fluorides.

<a href="Boron%20trifluoride">Boron trifluoride</a> is planar and possesses an incomplete octet. It functions as a <a href="Lewis%20acids%20and%20bases">Lewis acid</a> and combines with Lewis bases like ammonia to form <a href="adduct">adduct</a>s. <a href="Carbon%20tetrafluoride">Carbon tetrafluoride</a> is tetrahedral and inert; <a href="carbon%20group">its group</a> analogues, silicon and germanium tetrafluoride, are also tetrahedral but behave as Lewis acids. The <a href="pnictogen">pnictogen</a>s form trifluorides that increase in reactivity and basicity with higher molecular weight, although <a href="nitrogen%20trifluoride">nitrogen trifluoride</a> resists hydrolysis and is not basic. The pentafluorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony are more reactive than their respective trifluorides, with <a href="antimony%20pentafluoride">antimony pentafluoride</a> the strongest neutral Lewis acid known.

<a href="Chalcogen">Chalcogen</a>s have diverse fluorides: unstable difluorides have been reported for oxygen (the only known compound with oxygen in an oxidation state of +2), sulfur, and selenium; tetrafluorides and hexafluorides exist for sulfur, selenium, and tellurium. The latter are stabilized by more fluorine atoms and lighter central atoms, so <a href="sulfur%20hexafluoride">sulfur hexafluoride</a> is especially inert. Chlorine, bromine, and iodine can each form mono-, tri-, and pentafluorides, but only <a href="iodine%20heptafluoride">iodine heptafluoride</a> has been characterized among possible <a href="interhalogen">interhalogen</a> heptafluorides. Many of them are powerful sources of fluorine atoms, and industrial applications using chlorine trifluoride require precautions similar to those using fluorine.

<a href="Noble%20gas">Noble gas</a>es, having complete electron shells, defied reaction with other elements until 1962 when <a href="Neil%20Bartlett%20%28chemist%29">Neil Bartlett</a> reported synthesis of <a href="xenon%20hexafluoroplatinate">xenon hexafluoroplatinate</a>; <a href="xenon%20difluoride">xenon difluoride</a>, <a href="xenon%20tetrafluoride">tetrafluoride</a>, <a href="xenon%20hexafluoride">hexafluoride</a>, and multiple oxyfluorides have been isolated since then. Among other noble gases, krypton forms a <a href="krypton%20difluoride">difluoride</a>, and radon and fluorine generate a solid suspected to be <a href="radon%20difluoride">radon difluoride</a>. Binary fluorides of lighter noble gases are exceptionally unstable: argon and hydrogen fluoride combine under extreme conditions to give <a href="argon%20fluorohydride">argon fluorohydride</a>. Helium and neon have no long-lived fluorides, and no neon fluoride has ever been observed; helium fluorohydride has been detected for milliseconds at high pressures and low temperatures.

The <a href="carbon%E2%80%93fluorine%20bond">carbon–fluorine bond</a> is <a href="organic%20chemistry">organic chemistry</a>'s strongest, and gives stability to organofluorines. It is almost non-existent in nature, but is used in artificial compounds. Research in this area is usually driven by commercial applications; the compounds involved are diverse and reflect the complexity inherent in organic chemistry.

The substitution of hydrogen atoms in an <a href="alkane">alkane</a> by progressively more fluorine atoms gradually alters several properties: melting and boiling points are lowered, density increases, solubility in hydrocarbons decreases and overall stability increases. Perfluorocarbons, in which all hydrogen atoms are substituted, are insoluble in most organic solvents, reacting at ambient conditions only with sodium in liquid ammonia.

The term "<a href="perfluorinated%20compound">perfluorinated compound</a>" is used for what would otherwise be a perfluorocarbon if not for the presence of a <a href="functional%20group">functional group</a>, often a <a href="carboxylic%20acid">carboxylic acid</a>. These compounds share many properties with perfluorocarbons such as stability and <a href="hydrophobicity">hydrophobicity</a>, while the functional group augments their reactivity, enabling them to adhere to surfaces or act as <a href="surfactant">surfactant</a>s; <a href="Fluorosurfactant">Fluorosurfactant</a>s, in particular, can lower the <a href="surface%20tension">surface tension</a> of water more than their hydrocarbon-based analogues. <a href="Fluorotelomer">Fluorotelomer</a>s, which have some unfluorinated carbon atoms near the functional group, are also regarded as perfluorinated.

Polymers exhibit the same stability increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. <a href="Polytetrafluoroethylene">Polytetrafluoroethylene</a> (PTFE), the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of <a href="polyethylene">polyethylene</a> with <a href="structural%20unit">structural unit</a> ––, demonstrates this change as expected, but its very high melting point makes it difficult to mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: <a href="fluorinated%20ethylene%20propylene">fluorinated ethylene propylene</a> replaces some fluorine atoms with <a href="trifluoromethyl">trifluoromethyl</a> groups, <a href="perfluoroalkoxy%20alkane">perfluoroalkoxy alkane</a>s do the same with <a href="trifluoromethoxy">trifluoromethoxy</a> groups, and <a href="Nafion">Nafion</a> contains perfluoroether side chains capped with <a href="sulfonic%20acid">sulfonic acid</a> groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; <a href="polyvinylidene%20fluoride">polyvinylidene fluoride</a> has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and <a href="polyvinyl%20fluoride">polyvinyl fluoride</a> has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.

Moissan's method is used to produce industrial quantities of fluorine, via the electrolysis of a <a href="potassium%20fluoride">potassium fluoride</a>/<a href="hydrogen%20fluoride">hydrogen fluoride</a> mixture: hydrogen and fluoride ions are reduced and oxidized at a steel container <a href="cathode">cathode</a> and a carbon block <a href="anode">anode</a>, under 8–12 volts, to generate hydrogen and fluorine gas respectively. Temperatures are elevated, KF•2HF melting at and being electrolyzed at . KF, which acts as catalyst, is essential since pure HF cannot be electrolyzed. Fluorine can be stored in steel cylinders that have passivated interiors, at temperatures below ; otherwise nickel can be used. Regulator valves and pipework are made of nickel, the latter possibly using <a href="Monel">Monel</a> instead. Frequent passivation, along with the strict exclusion of water and greases, must be undertaken. In the laboratory, glassware may carry fluorine gas under low pressure and anhydrous conditions; some sources instead recommend nickel-Monel-PTFE systems.

While preparing for a 1986 conference to celebrate the centennial of Moissan's achievement, <a href="Karl%20O.%20Christe">Karl O. Christe</a> reasoned that chemical fluorine generation should be feasible since some metal fluoride anions have no stable neutral counterparts; their acidification potentially triggers oxidation instead. He devised a method which evolves fluorine at high yield and atmospheric pressure:

Christe later commented that the reactants "had been known for more than 100 years and even Moissan could have come up with this scheme." As late as 2008, some references still asserted that fluorine was too reactive for any chemical isolation.

Fluorite mining, which supplies most global fluorine, peaked in 1989 when 5.6 million <a href="metric%20ton">metric ton</a>s of ore were extracted. Chlorofluorocarbon restrictions lowered this to 3.6 million tons in 1994; production has since been increasing. Around 4.5 million tons of ore and revenue of <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>550 million were generated in 2003; later reports estimated 2011 global fluorochemical sales at $15 billion and predicted 2016–18 production figures of 3.5 to 5.9 million tons, and revenue of at least $20 billion. <a href="Froth%20flotation">Froth flotation</a> separates mined fluorite into two main metallurgical grades of equal proportion: 60–85% pure metspar is almost all used in iron smelting whereas 97%+ pure acidspar is mainly converted to the key industrial <a href="chemical%20intermediate">intermediate</a> hydrogen fluoride.

At least 17,000 metric tons of fluorine are produced each year. It costs only $5–8 per kilogram as uranium or sulfur hexafluoride, but many times more as an element because of handling challenges. Most processes using free fluorine in large amounts employ "in situ" generation under <a href="vertical%20integration">vertical integration</a>.

The largest application of fluorine gas, consuming up to 7,000 metric tons annually, is in the preparation of for the <a href="nuclear%20fuel%20cycle">nuclear fuel cycle</a>. Fluorine is used to fluorinate <a href="uranium%20tetrafluoride">uranium tetrafluoride</a>, itself formed from uranium dioxide and hydrofluoric acid. Fluorine is monoisotopic, so any mass differences between molecules are due to the presence of or , enabling uranium enrichment via gaseous diffusion or <a href="gas%20centrifuge">gas centrifuge</a>. About 6,000 metric tons per year go into producing the inert <a href="dielectric">dielectric</a> for high-voltage transformers and circuit breakers, eliminating the need for hazardous <a href="polychlorinated%20biphenyl">polychlorinated biphenyl</a>s associated with devices. Several fluorine compounds are used in electronics: rhenium and tungsten hexafluoride in <a href="chemical%20vapor%20deposition">chemical vapor deposition</a>, <a href="tetrafluoromethane">tetrafluoromethane</a> in <a href="plasma%20etching">plasma etching</a> and <a href="nitrogen%20trifluoride">nitrogen trifluoride</a> in cleaning equipment. Fluorine is also used in the synthesis of organic fluorides, but its reactivity often necessitates conversion first to the gentler , , or , which together allow calibrated fluorination. Fluorinated pharmaceuticals use <a href="sulfur%20tetrafluoride">sulfur tetrafluoride</a> instead.

As with other iron alloys, around 3 kg (6.5 lb) metspar is added to each metric ton of steel; the fluoride ions lower its melting point and <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a>. Alongside its role as an additive in materials like enamels and welding rod coats, most acidspar is reacted with sulfuric acid to form hydrofluoric acid, which is used in steel <a href="Pickling%20%28metal%29">pickling</a>, glass etching and <a href="cracking%20%28chemistry%29">alkane cracking</a>. One-third of HF goes into synthesizing <a href="sodium%20hexafluoroaluminate">cryolite</a> and <a href="aluminium%20trifluoride">aluminium trifluoride</a>, both fluxes in the <a href="Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult%20process">Hall–Héroult process</a> for aluminium extraction; replenishment is necessitated by their occasional reactions with the smelting apparatus. Each metric ton of aluminium requires about 23 kg (51 lb) of flux. Fluorosilicates consume the second largest portion, with <a href="sodium%20fluorosilicate">sodium fluorosilicate</a> used in water fluoridation and laundry effluent treatment, and as an intermediate en route to cryolite and silicon tetrafluoride. Other important inorganic fluorides include those of <a href="cobalt%20difluoride">cobalt</a>, <a href="nickel%20difluoride">nickel</a>, and <a href="ammonium%20fluoride">ammonium</a>.

Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined fluorite and over 40% of hydrofluoric acid, with <a href="%23Refrigerant%20gases">refrigerant gases</a> dominating and <a href="%23Fluoropolymers">fluoropolymers</a> increasing their market share. <a href="%23Surfactants">Surfactants</a> are a minor application but generate over $1 billion in annual revenue. Due to the danger from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150 °C (−240 °F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through <a href="Finkelstein%20reaction">halogen exchange reactions</a> such as <a href="Swarts%20fluorination">Swarts fluorination</a>, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. <a href="Electrochemical%20fluorination">Electrochemical fluorination</a> subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the <a href="Fowler%20process">Fowler process</a> treats them with solid fluorine carriers like <a href="cobalt%20trifluoride">cobalt trifluoride</a>.

Halogenated refrigerants, termed Freons in informal contexts, are identified by <a href="Refrigerant%23Refrigerants%20by%20class%20and%20R-number">R-numbers</a> that denote the amount of fluorine, chlorine, carbon, and hydrogen present. <a href="Chlorofluorocarbons">Chlorofluorocarbons</a> (CFCs) like <a href="trichlorofluoromethane">R-11</a>, <a href="dichlorodifluoromethane">R-12</a>, and <a href="1%2C2-dichlorotetrafluoroethane">R-114</a> once dominated organofluorines, peaking in production in the 1980s. Used for air conditioning systems, propellants and solvents, their production was below one-tenth of this peak by the early 2000s, after widespread international prohibition. Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) were designed as replacements; their synthesis consumes more than 90% of the fluorine in the organic industry. Important HCFCs include R-22, <a href="chlorodifluoromethane">chlorodifluoromethane</a>, and <a href="1%2C1-Dichloro-1-fluoroethane">R-141b</a>. The main HFC is <a href="1%2C1%2C1%2C2-Tetrafluoroethane">R-134a</a> with a new type of molecule <a href="2%2C3%2C3%2C3-Tetrafluoropropene">HFO-1234yf</a>, a <a href="Hydrofluoroolefin">Hydrofluoroolefin</a> (HFO) coming to prominence owing to its <a href="global%20warming%20potential">global warming potential</a> of less than 1% that of HFC-134a.

About 180,000 metric tons of fluoropolymers were produced in 2006 and 2007, generating over $3.5 billion revenue per year. The global market was estimated at just under $6 billion in 2011 and was predicted to grow by 6.5% per year up to 2016. Fluoropolymers can only be formed by <a href="polymerization">polymerizing</a> free radicals.

Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), sometimes called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by mass of the world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in <a href="electrical%20insulation">electrical insulation</a> since PTFE is an excellent <a href="dielectric">dielectric</a>. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated <a href="fabric%20structure">fiberglass cloth</a> for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for <a href="non-stick%20surface">non-stick cookware</a>. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored <a href="synthetic%20membrane">membrane</a> sometimes referred to by the brand name <a href="Gore-Tex">Gore-Tex</a> and used for rainwear, <a href="personal%20protective%20equipment">protective apparel</a>, and <a href="filtration">filters</a>; <a href="PTFE%20fiber">ePTFE fibers</a> may be made into <a href="seal%20%28mechanical%29">seals</a> and <a href="Dust%20collector">dust filters</a>. Other fluoropolymers, including <a href="fluorinated%20ethylene%20propylene">fluorinated ethylene propylene</a>, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.

The chemically resistant (but expensive) fluorinated <a href="ionomer">ionomer</a>s are used as electrochemical cell membranes, of which the first and most prominent example is <a href="Nafion">Nafion</a>. Developed in the 1960s, it was initially deployed as fuel cell material in spacecraft and then replaced mercury-based <a href="chloralkali%20process">chloralkali process</a> cells. Recently, the fuel cell application has reemerged with efforts to install <a href="proton%20exchange%20membrane">proton exchange membrane</a> fuel cells into automobiles. <a href="Fluoroelastomer">Fluoroelastomer</a>s such as <a href="Viton">Viton</a> are <a href="crosslink">crosslink</a>ed fluoropolymer mixtures mainly used in <a href="O-ring">O-ring</a>s; <a href="perfluorobutane">perfluorobutane</a> (CF) is used as a fire-extinguishing agent.

Fluorosurfactants are small organofluorine molecules used for repelling water and stains. Although expensive (comparable to pharmaceuticals at $200–2000 per kilogram), they yielded over $1 billion in annual revenues by 2006; <a href="Scotchgard">Scotchgard</a> alone generated over $300 million in 2000. Fluorosurfactants are a minority in the overall surfactant market, most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon-based products. Applications in <a href="surfactants%20in%20paint">paints</a> are burdened by <a href="compounding">compounding</a> costs; this use was valued at only $100 million in 2006.

About 30% of <a href="agrichemical">agrichemical</a>s contain fluorine, most of them <a href="herbicide">herbicide</a>s and <a href="fungicide">fungicide</a>s with a few <a href="plant%20hormone">crop regulators</a>. Fluorine substitution, usually of a single atom or at most a <a href="trifluoromethyl">trifluoromethyl</a> group, is a robust modification with effects analogous to fluorinated pharmaceuticals: increased biological stay time, membrane crossing, and altering of molecular recognition. <a href="Trifluralin">Trifluralin</a> is a prominent example, with large-scale use in the U.S. as a weedkiller, but it is a suspected carcinogen and has been banned in many European countries. <a href="Sodium%20monofluoroacetate">Sodium monofluoroacetate</a> (1080) is a mammalian poison in which two <a href="acetic%20acid">acetic acid</a> hydrogens are replaced with fluorine and sodium; it disrupts cell metabolism by replacing acetate in the <a href="citric%20acid%20cycle">citric acid cycle</a>. First synthesized in the late 19th century, it was recognized as an insecticide in the early 20th, and was later deployed in its current use. New Zealand, the largest consumer of 1080, uses it to protect <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>s from the invasive Australian <a href="common%20brushtail%20possum">common brushtail possum</a>. Europe and the U.S. have banned 1080.

Population studies from the mid-20th century onwards show <a href="topical%20medication">topical</a> fluoride reduces <a href="dental%20caries">dental caries</a>. This was first attributed to the conversion of tooth enamel <a href="hydroxyapatite">hydroxyapatite</a> into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled <a href="water%20supply">public water supply</a> fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign <a href="dental%20fluorosis">dental fluorosis</a>, <a href="water%20fluoridation%20controversy">opposition</a> still exists on ethical and safety grounds. The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. <a href="Sodium%20monofluorophosphate">Sodium monofluorophosphate</a> and sometimes sodium or <a href="tin%28II%29%20fluoride">tin(II) fluoride</a> are often found in fluoride <a href="toothpaste">toothpaste</a>s, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.

Twenty percent of modern pharmaceuticals contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer <a href="atorvastatin">atorvastatin</a> (Lipitor), made more revenue than any other drug until it became generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription <a href="Seretide">Seretide</a>, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – <a href="fluticasone">fluticasone</a> – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination also increases <a href="lipophilicity">lipophilicity</a> because the bond is more hydrophobic than the <a href="carbon%E2%80%93hydrogen%20bond">carbon–hydrogen bond</a>, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence <a href="bioavailability">bioavailability</a>.

<a href="Tricyclic%20antidepressant">Tricyclics</a> and other pre-1980s <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s had several side effects due to their non-selective interference with <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a>s other than the <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> target; the fluorinated <a href="fluoxetine">fluoxetine</a> was selective and one of the first to avoid this problem. Many current antidepressants receive this same treatment, including the <a href="selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a>s: <a href="citalopram">citalopram</a>, its isomer <a href="escitalopram">escitalopram</a>, and <a href="fluvoxamine">fluvoxamine</a> and <a href="paroxetine">paroxetine</a>. <a href="Quinolones">Quinolones</a> are artificial <a href="broad-spectrum%20antibiotic">broad-spectrum antibiotic</a>s that are often fluorinated to enhance their effects. These include <a href="ciprofloxacin">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href="levofloxacin">levofloxacin</a>. Fluorine also finds use in steroids: <a href="fludrocortisone">fludrocortisone</a> is a blood pressure-raising <a href="mineralocorticoid">mineralocorticoid</a>, and <a href="triamcinolone">triamcinolone</a> and <a href="dexamethasone">dexamethasone</a> are strong <a href="glucocorticoid">glucocorticoid</a>s. The majority of inhaled <a href="anesthetic">anesthetic</a>s are heavily fluorinated; the prototype <a href="halothane">halothane</a> is much more inert and potent than its contemporaries. Later compounds such as the fluorinated <a href="ether">ether</a>s <a href="sevoflurane">sevoflurane</a> and <a href="desflurane">desflurane</a> are better than halothane and are almost insoluble in blood, allowing faster waking times.

Fluorine-18 is often found in <a href="radioactive%20tracer">radioactive tracer</a>s for positron emission tomography, as its half-life of almost two hours is long enough to allow for its transport from production facilities to imaging centers. The most common tracer is <a href="fluorodeoxyglucose">fluorodeoxyglucose</a> which, after intravenous injection, is taken up by glucose-requiring tissues such as the brain and most malignant tumors; <a href="X-ray%20computed%20tomography">computer-assisted tomography</a> can then be used for detailed imaging.

Liquid fluorocarbons can hold large volumes of oxygen or carbon dioxide, more so than blood, and have attracted attention for their possible uses in artificial blood and in liquid breathing. Because fluorocarbons do not normally mix with water, they must be mixed into emulsions (small droplets of perfluorocarbon suspended in water) to be used as blood. One such product, <a href="Oxycyte">Oxycyte</a>, has been through initial clinical trials. These substances can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs. Partial and complete lung filling have been considered, though only the former has had any significant tests in humans. An Alliance Pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies.

Fluorine is not <a href="dietary%20mineral">essential</a> for humans and mammals, but small amounts are known to be beneficial for the strengthening of dental enamel (where the formation of fluorapatite makes the enamel more resistant to attack, from acids produced by bacterial fermentation of sugars). Small amounts of fluorine may be beneficial for bone strength, but the latter has not been definitively established. Both the WHO and the Institute of Medicine of the US National Academies publish recommended daily allowance (RDA) and upper tolerated intake of fluorine, which varies with age and gender.

Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is <a href="sodium%20fluoroacetate">fluoroacetate</a>, which is used as a <a href="plant%20defense%20against%20herbivory">defense against herbivores</a> by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a>s, <a href="fluoroacetone">fluoroacetone</a>, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme that binds fluorine to carbon – <a href="adenosyl-fluoride%20synthase">adenosyl-fluoride synthase</a> – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.

Elemental fluorine is highly toxic to living organisms. Its effects in humans start at concentrations lower than <a href="hydrogen%20cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a>'s 50 ppm and are similar to those of chlorine: significant irritation of the eyes and respiratory system as well as liver and kidney damage occur above 25 ppm, which is the <a href="IDLH">immediately dangerous to life and health</a> value for fluorine. Eyes and noses are seriously damaged at 100 ppm, and inhalation of 1,000 ppm fluorine will cause death in minutes, compared to 270 ppm for hydrogen cyanide.

Hydrofluoric acid is a contact poison with greater hazards than many strong acids like sulfuric acid even though it is weak: it remains neutral in aqueous solution and thus penetrates tissue faster, whether through inhalation, ingestion or the skin, and at least nine U.S. workers died in such accidents from 1984 to 1994. It reacts with calcium and magnesium in the blood leading to <a href="hypocalcemia">hypocalcemia</a> and possible death through <a href="cardiac%20arrhythmia">cardiac arrhythmia</a>. Insoluble calcium fluoride formation triggers strong pain and burns larger than 160 cm (25 in) can cause serious systemic toxicity.

Exposure may not be evident for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may initially be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. <a href="Calcium%20gluconate">Calcium gluconate</a> is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.

Soluble fluorides are moderately toxic: 5–10 g sodium fluoride, or 32–64 mg fluoride ions per kilogram of body mass, represents a lethal dose for adults. One-fifth of the lethal dose can cause adverse health effects, and chronic excess consumption may lead to <a href="skeletal%20fluorosis">skeletal fluorosis</a>, which affects millions in Asia and Africa. Ingested fluoride forms hydrofluoric acid in the stomach which is easily absorbed by the intestines, where it crosses cell membranes, binds with calcium and interferes with various enzymes, before urinary <a href="excretion">excretion</a>. Exposure limits are determined by urine testing of the body's ability to clear fluoride ions.

Historically, most cases of fluoride poisoning have been caused by accidental ingestion of insecticides containing inorganic fluorides. Most current calls to poison control centers for possible fluoride poisoning come from the ingestion of fluoride-containing toothpaste. Malfunctioning water fluoridation equipment is another cause: one incident in Alaska affected almost 300 people and killed one person. Dangers from toothpaste are aggravated for small children, and the <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> recommends supervising children below six brushing their teeth so that they do not swallow toothpaste. One regional study examined a year of pre-teen fluoride poisoning reports totaling 87 cases, including one death from ingesting insecticide. Most had no symptoms, but about 30% had stomach pains. A larger study across the U.S. had similar findings: 80% of cases involved children under six, and there were few serious cases.

The <a href="Montreal%20Protocol">Montreal Protocol</a>, signed in 1987, set strict regulations on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and <a href="bromofluorocarbon">bromofluorocarbon</a>s due to their ozone damaging potential (ODP). The high stability which suited them to their original applications also meant that they were not decomposing until they reached higher altitudes, where liberated chlorine and bromine atoms attacked ozone molecules. Even with the ban, and early indications of its efficacy, predictions warned that several generations would pass before full recovery. With one-tenth the ODP of CFCs, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are the current replacements, and are themselves scheduled for substitution by 2030–2040 by hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with no chlorine and zero ODP. In 2007 this date was brought forward to 2020 for developed countries; the <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> had already prohibited one HCFC's production and capped those of two others in 2003. Fluorocarbon gases are generally <a href="greenhouse%20gas">greenhouse gas</a>es with <a href="global-warming%20potential">global-warming potential</a>s (GWPs) of about 100 to 10,000; sulfur hexafluoride has a value of around 20,000. An outlier is <a href="HFO-1234yf">HFO-1234yf</a> which is a new type of refrigerant called a <a href="Hydrofluoroolefin">Hydrofluoroolefin</a> (HFO) and has attracted global demand due to its GWP of 4 compared to 1,430 for the current refrigerant standard <a href="HFC-134a">HFC-134a</a>.

Organofluorines exhibit biopersistence due to the strength of the carbon–fluorine bond. <a href="Perfluoroalkyl%20acid">Perfluoroalkyl acid</a>s (PFAAs), which are sparingly water-soluble owing to their acidic functional groups, are noted <a href="persistent%20organic%20pollutant">persistent organic pollutant</a>s; <a href="perfluorooctanesulfonic%20acid">perfluorooctanesulfonic acid</a> (PFOS) and <a href="perfluorooctanoic%20acid">perfluorooctanoic acid</a> (PFOA) are most often researched. PFAAs have been found in trace quantities worldwide from polar bears to humans, with PFOS and PFOA known to reside in breast milk and the blood of newborn babies. A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating, and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA. In the body, PFAAs bind to proteins such as <a href="serum%20albumin">serum albumin</a>; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys. Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species, with half-lives of days in rodents, and years in humans. High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels.

Bal des Ardents

The Bal des Ardents (Ball of the Burning Men) or Bal des Sauvages (Ball of the Wild Men) was a <a href="masquerade%20ball">masquerade ball</a> held on 28 January 1393 in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> at which <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI of France</a> performed in a dance with five members of the French <a href="Fiefdom">nobility</a>. Four of the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, Charles's brother <a href="Louis%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Louis, Duke of Orléans</a>. Charles and another of the dancers survived. The ball was one of a number of events intended to entertain the young king, who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted <a href="regicide">regicide</a> and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.

Charles's wife, <a href="Isabeau%20of%20Bavaria">Isabeau of Bavaria</a>, held the ball to honor the remarriage of a <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a>. Scholars believe the dance performed at the ball had elements of traditional "<a href="charivari">charivari</a>", with the dancers disguised as <a href="wild%20men">wild men</a>, mythical beings often associated with demonology, that were commonly represented in medieval Europe and documented in revels of <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor England</a>. The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as <a href="Michel%20Pintoin">the Monk of St Denis</a> and <a href="Jean%20Froissart">Jean Froissart</a>, and illustrated in a number of 15th-century <a href="illuminated%20manuscripts">illuminated manuscripts</a> by painters such as the <a href="Master%20of%20Anthony%20of%20Burgundy">Master of Anthony of Burgundy</a>. The incident later provided inspiration for <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s short story "<a href="Hop-Frog">Hop-Frog</a>".

In 1380, after the death of his father <a href="Charles%20V%20of%20France">Charles V of France</a>, the 12-year-old <a href="Charles%20VI%20of%20France">Charles VI</a> was crowned king, beginning his minority with his four uncles acting as <a href="regent">regent</a>s. Within two years one of them, Philip of Burgundy, described by historian <a href="Robert%20Knecht">Robert Knecht</a> as "one of the most powerful princes in Europe", became sole regent to the young king after Louis of Anjou pillaged the royal treasury and departed to campaign in Italy; Charles's other two uncles, John of Berry and Louis of Bourbon, showed little interest in governing. In 1387, the 20-year-old Charles assumed sole control of the monarchy and immediately dismissed his uncles and reinstated the <a href="Marmousets">Marmousets</a>, his father's traditional counselors. Unlike his uncles, the Marmousets wanted peace with England, less taxation, and a strong, responsible central government—policies that resulted in a negotiated <a href="Truce%20of%20Leulinghem">three-year truce with England</a>, and the Duke of Berry being stripped of his post as governor of <a href="Languedoc">Languedoc</a> because of his excessive taxation.

In 1392 Charles suffered the first in a lifelong series of attacks of insanity, manifested by an "insatiable fury" at the attempted assassination of the <a href="Constable%20of%20France">Constable of France</a> and leader of the Marmousets, <a href="Olivier%20de%20Clisson">Olivier de Clisson</a>—carried out by <a href="Pierre%20de%20Craon">Pierre de Craon</a> but orchestrated by <a href="John%20IV%2C%20Duke%20of%20Brittany">John IV, Duke of Brittany</a>. Convinced that the attempt on Clisson's life was also an act of violence against himself and the monarchy, Charles quickly planned a retaliatory invasion of Brittany with the approval of the Marmousets, and within months departed Paris with a force of knights.

On a hot August day outside <a href="Le%20Mans">Le Mans</a>, accompanying his forces on the way to Brittany, without warning Charles drew his weapons and charged his own household knights including his brother <a href="Louis%20I%2C%20Duke%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Louis I, Duke of Orléans</a>—with whom he had a close relationship—crying "Forward against the traitors. They wish to deliver me to the enemy." He killed four men before his <a href="Chamberlain%20%28office%29">chamberlain</a> grabbed him by the waist and subdued him, after which he fell into a coma that lasted for four days. Few believed he would recover; his uncles, the dukes of Burgundy and Berry, took advantage of the King's illness and quickly seized power, re-established themselves as regents, and dissolved the Marmouset council.

The comatose king was returned to Le Mans, where <a href="Guillaume%20de%20Harsigny">Guillaume de Harsigny</a>—a venerated and well-educated 92-year-old physician—was summoned to treat him. After Charles regained consciousness, and his fever subsided, he was returned to Paris by Harsigny, moving slowly from castle to castle, with periods of rest in between. Late in September Charles was well enough to make a pilgrimage of thanks to Notre Dame de Liesse near <a href="Laon">Laon</a> after which he returned again to Paris.

The King's sudden onset of insanity was seen by some as a sign of divine anger and punishment and by others as the result of <a href="Magic%20%28paranormal%29">sorcery</a>; modern historians such as Knecht speculate that Charles might have been experiencing the onset of <a href="paranoid%20schizophrenia">paranoid schizophrenia</a>. Charles continued to be mentally fragile, believing he was <a href="glass%20delusion">made of glass</a>, and according to historian <a href="Desmond%20Seward">Desmond Seward</a>, running "howling like a wolf down the corridors of the royal palaces". Contemporary chronicler <a href="Jean%20Froissart">Jean Froissart</a> wrote that the King's illness was so severe that he was "far out of the way; no medicine could help him". During the worst of his illness Charles was unable to recognize his wife, <a href="Isabeau%20of%20Bavaria">Isabeau of Bavaria</a>, demanding her removal when she entered his chamber, but after his recovery Charles made arrangements for her to hold guardianship of their children. Isabeau eventually became guardian to her son, the future <a href="Charles%20VII%20of%20France">Charles VII of France</a> (b. 1403), granting her great political power and ensuring a place on the council of regents in the event of a relapse.

In "<a href="A%20Distant%20Mirror">A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century</a>" the historian <a href="Barbara%20Tuchman">Barbara Tuchman</a> writes that the physician Harsigny, refusing "all pleas and offers of riches to remain", left Paris and ordered the <a href="courtiers">courtiers</a> to shield the King from the duties of government and leadership. He told the King's advisors to "be careful not to worry or irritate him ... Burden him with work as little as you can; pleasure and forgetfulness will be better for him than anything else." To surround Charles with a festive atmosphere and to protect him from the rigor of governing, the court turned to elaborate amusements and extravagant fashions. Isabeau and her sister-in-law <a href="Valentina%20Visconti%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Orl%C3%A9ans">Valentina Visconti, Duchess of Orléans</a>, wore jewel-laden dresses and elaborate <a href="braid">braid</a>ed hairstyles coiled into tall shells and covered with wide double <a href="hennin">hennin</a>s that reportedly required doorways to be widened to accommodate them.

The common people thought the extravagances excessive yet loved their young king, whom they called Charles "le bien-aimé" (the well-beloved). Blame for unnecessary excess and expense was directed at the foreign queen, who was brought from <a href="Bavaria">Bavaria</a> at the request of Charles's uncles. Neither Isabeau nor her sister-in-law Valentina—daughter of the ruthless <a href="Gian%20Galeazzo%20Visconti">Duke of Milan</a>—were well liked by either the court or the people. Froissart wrote in his "<a href="Froissart%27s%20Chronicles">Chronicles</a>" that Charles's uncles were content to allow the frivolities because "so long as the Queen and the <a href="Duc%20d%27Orl%C3%A9ans">Duc d'Orléans</a> danced, they were not dangerous or even annoying".

On 28 January 1393, Isabeau held a <a href="Masquerade%20ball">masquerade</a> at the <a href="H%C3%B4tel%20Saint-Pol">Hôtel Saint-Pol</a> to celebrate the third marriage of her lady-in-waiting, Catherine de Fastaverin. Tuchman explains that a widow's remarriage was traditionally an occasion for mockery and tomfoolery, often celebrated with a "<a href="charivari">charivari</a>" characterized by "all sorts of licence, disguises, disorders, and loud blaring of discordant music and clanging of cymbals". On the suggestion of Huguet de Guisay, whom Tuchman describes as well known for his "outrageous schemes" and cruelty, six high-ranking knights performed a dance in costume as <a href="wild%20men">wood savages</a>. The costumes, which were sewn onto the men, were made of <a href="linen">linen</a> soaked with <a href="resin">resin</a> to which <a href="flax">flax</a> was attached "so that they appeared shaggy and hairy from head to foot". Masks made of the same materials covered the dancers' faces and hid their identities from the audience. Some chronicles report that the dancers were bound together by chains. Most of the audience were unaware that Charles was among the dancers. Strict orders forbade the lighting of hall torches and prohibited anyone from entering the hall with a torch during the performance, to minimize the risk of the highly flammable costumes catching fire.

According to historian Jan Veenstra the men capered and howled "like wolves", spat obscenities and invited the audience to guess their identities while dancing in a "diabolical" frenzy. Charles's brother Orléans arrived with Phillipe de Bar, late and drunk, and they entered the hall carrying lit torches. Accounts vary, but Orléans may have held his torch above a dancer's mask to reveal his identity when a spark fell, setting fire to the dancer's leg. In the 17th century, <a href="William%20Prynne">William Prynne</a> wrote of the incident that "the Duke of Orleance ... put one of the Torches his servants held so neere the flax, that he set one of the Coates on fire, and so each of them set fire on to the other, and so they were all in a bright flame", whereas a contemporary chronicle stated that he "threw" the torch at one of the dancers.

Isabeau, knowing that her husband was one of the dancers, fainted when the men caught fire. Charles, however, was standing at a distance from the other dancers, near his 15-year-old aunt <a href="Joan%20II%2C%20Countess%20of%20Auvergne">Joan, Duchess of Berry</a>, who swiftly threw her <a href="Train%20%28clothing%29">voluminous skirt</a> over him to protect him from the sparks. Sources disagree as to whether the duchess moved into the dance and drew the King aside to speak to him, or whether the King moved away toward the audience. Froissart wrote that "The King, who proceeded ahead of [the dancers], departed from his companions ... and went to the ladies to show himself to them ... and so passed by the Queen and came near the Duchess of Berry".

The scene soon descended into chaos; the dancers shrieked in pain as they burned in their costumes, and the audience, many of them also sustaining burns, screamed as they tried to rescue the burning men. The event was chronicled in uncharacteristic vividness by <a href="Michel%20Pintoin">the Monk of St Denis</a>, who wrote that "four men were burned alive, their flaming genitals dropping to the floor ... releasing a stream of blood". Only two dancers survived: the King, thanks to the quick reactions of the Duchess of Berry, and the Sieur de <a href="Nantouillet">Nantouillet</a>, who jumped into an open vat of wine and remained there until the flames were extinguished. The Count de <a href="Joigny">Joigny</a> died at the scene; <a href="Yvain%20de%20Foix">Yvain de Foix</a>, son of <a href="Gaston%20III%2C%20Count%20of%20Foix">Gaston Fébus, Count of Foix</a>, and Aimery Poitiers, son of the <a href="Count%20of%20Valentinois">Count of Valentinois</a>, lingered with painful burns for two days. The instigator of the affair, Huguet de Guisay, survived a day longer, described by Tuchman as bitterly "cursing and insulting his fellow dancers, the dead and the living, until his last hour".

The citizens of Paris, angered by the event and at the danger posed to their monarch, blamed Charles's advisors. A "great commotion" swept through the city as the populace threatened to depose Charles's uncles and kill dissolute and depraved courtiers. Greatly concerned at the popular outcry and worried about a repeat of the <a href="Harelle">Maillotin revolt</a> of the previous decade—when Parisians armed with mallets turned against tax collectors—Charles's uncles persuaded the court to do penance at <a href="Notre%20Dame%20de%20Paris">Notre Dame Cathedral</a>, preceded by an apologetic <a href="royal%20progress">royal progress</a> through the city in which the King rode on horseback with his uncles walking in humility. Orléans, who was blamed for the tragedy, donated funds in atonement for a chapel to be built at the <a href="Celestines">Celestine</a> monastery.

Froissart's chronicle of the event places blame directly on Charles's brother, Orléans. He wrote: "And thus the feast and marriage celebrations ended with such great sorrow ... [Charles] and [Isabeau] could do nothing to remedy it. We must accept that it was no fault of theirs but of the duke of Orléans." Orléans' reputation was severely damaged by the event, compounded by an episode a few years earlier in which he was accused of sorcery after hiring an <a href="apostate">apostate</a> monk to imbue a ring, dagger and sword with demonic magic. The theologian <a href="Jean%20Petit%20%28theologian%29">Jean Petit</a> later testified that Orléans practiced sorcery, and that the fire at the dance represented a failed attempt at regicide made in retaliation for Charles's attack the previous summer.

The "Bal des Ardents" added to the impression of a court steeped in extravagance, with a king in delicate health and unable to rule. Charles's attacks of illness increased in frequency such that by the end of the 1390s his role was merely ceremonial. By the early 15th century he was neglected and often forgotten, a lack of leadership that contributed to the decline and fragmentation of the <a href="House%20of%20Valois">Valois</a> dynasty. In 1407, Philip the Bold's son, <a href="John%20the%20Fearless">John the Fearless</a>, had his cousin Orléans assassinated because of "vice, corruption, sorcery, and a long list of public and private villainies"; at the same time Isabeau was accused of having been the mistress of her husband's brother. Orléans's assassination pushed the country into a <a href="Armagnac%E2%80%93Burgundian%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> between the <a href="Burgundian%20%28party%29">Burgundians</a> and the <a href="Armagnac%20%28party%29">Orléanists</a> (known as the Armagnacs), which lasted for several decades. The vacuum created by the lack of central power and the general irresponsibility of the French court resulted in it gaining a reputation for lax morals and decadence that endured for more than 200 years.

Veenstra writes in "Magic and Divination at the Courts of Burgundy and France" that the "Bal des Ardents" reveals the tension between Christian beliefs and the latent <a href="paganism">paganism</a> that existed in 14th-century society. According to him, the event "laid bare a great cultural struggle with the past but also became an ominous foreshadowing of the future."

<a href="Wild%20man">Wild men</a> or savages—usually depicted carrying staves or clubs, living beyond the bounds of civilization without shelter or fire, lacking feelings and souls—were then a metaphor for man without God. Common superstition held that long-haired wild men, known as "lutins", who danced to firelight either to conjure demons or as part of fertility rituals, lived in mountainous areas such as the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>. In some village "charivaris" at harvest or planting time dancers dressed as wild men, to represent demons, were ceremonially captured and then an effigy of them was symbolically burnt to appease evil spirits. The church, however, considered these rituals pagan and demonic.

Veenstra explains that it was believed that by dressing as wild men, villagers ritualistically "conjured demons by imitating them"—although at that period <a href="penitential">penitential</a>s forbade a belief in wild men or an imitation of them, such as the costumed dance at Isabeau's event. In folkloric rituals the "burning did not happen literally but in "effigie"", he writes, "contrary to the "Bal des Ardents" where the seasonal fertility rite had watered down to courtly entertainment, but where burning had been promoted to a dreadful reality." A 15th-century chronicle describes the "Bal des Ardents" as "una corea procurance demone" ("a dance to ward off the devil").

Because remarriage was often thought to be a sacrilege—common belief (contrary to the Gospel – Luke 20:27–40 and Matthew 22:29–30) was that the sacrament of marriage extended beyond death—it was censured by the community. Thus the purpose of the Bal des Ardents was twofold: to entertain the court and to humiliate and rebuke Isabeau's lady-in-waiting—in an inherently pagan manner, which the Monk of St Denis seemed to dislike. A ritual burning on the wedding night of a woman who was remarrying had Christian origins as well, according to Veenstra. The <a href="Book%20of%20Tobit">Book of Tobit</a> partly concerns a woman who had seven husbands murdered by the demon <a href="Asmodeus">Asmodeus</a>; she is eventually freed of the demon by the burning of the heart and liver of a fish.

The event also may have served as a symbolic exorcism of Charles's mental illness at a time when magicians and sorcerers were commonly consulted by members of the court. In the early 15th century, ritual burning of evil, demonic, or <a href="Satan">Satan</a>ic forces was not uncommon as shown by Orléans's later persecution of the King's physician Jehan de Bar, who was burned to death after confessing, under torture, to practicing sorcery.

The death of four members of the nobility was sufficiently important to ensure that the event was recorded in contemporary chronicles, most notably by Froissart and the Monk of St Denis, and subsequently illustrated in a number of copies of <a href="illuminated%20manuscript">illuminated manuscript</a>s. While the two main chroniclers agree on essential points of the evening—the dancers were dressed as wild men, the King survived, one man fell into a vat, and four of the dancers died—there are discrepancies in the details. Froissart wrote that the dancers were chained together, which is not mentioned in the monk's account. Furthermore, the two chroniclers are at odds regarding the purpose of the dance. According to the historian Susan Crane, the monk describes the event as a wild "charivari" with the audience participating in the dance, whereas Froissart's description suggests a theatrical performance without audience participation.
Froissart wrote about the event in Book IV of his "Chronicles" (covering the years 1389 to 1440), an account described by scholar Katerina Nara as full of "a sense of pessimism", as Froissart "did not approve of all he recorded". Froissart blamed Orléans for the tragedy, and the monk blamed the instigator, de Guisay, whose reputation for treating low-born servants like animals earned him such universal hatred that "the Nobles rejoiced at his agonizing death".

The Monk wrote of the event in the "Histoire de Charles VI" ("History of Charles VI"), covering about 25 years of the King's reign. He seemed to disapprove on the grounds that the event broke social mores and the King's conduct was unbecoming, whereas Froissart described it as a celebratory event.

Scholars are unsure whether either chronicler was present that evening. According to Crane, Froissart wrote of the event about five years later, and the monk about ten. Veenstra speculates that the monk may have been an eyewitness (as he was for much of Charles VI's reign) and that his account is the more accurate of the two. The monk's chronicle is generally accepted as essential for understanding the King's court, however his neutrality may have been affected by his pro-Burgundian and anti-Orléanist stance, causing him to depict the royal couple in a negative manner. A third account was written in the mid-15th century by <a href="Jean%20Juvenal%20des%20Ursins">Jean Juvenal des Ursins</a> in his biography of Charles, "L'Histoire de Charles VI: roy de France", not published until 1614.

The Froissart manuscript dating from between 1470 and 1472 from the <a href="Harleian%20Collection">Harleian Collection</a> held at the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> includes a miniature depicting the event, titled "Dance of the Wodewoses", attributed to an unknown painter referred to as the Master of the Harley Froissart. A slightly later edition of Froissart's "Chronicles", dated to around 1480, contains a miniature of the event, "Fire at a Masked Dance", also attributed to an unidentified <a href="Early%20Netherlandish%20painting">early Netherlandish</a> painter known as the Master of the Getty Froissart. The 15th-century <a href="Froissart%20of%20Louis%20of%20Gruuthuse%20%28BnF%20Fr%202643-6%29">Gruuthuse manuscript</a> of Froissart's "Chronicles", held at the <a href="Biblioth%C3%A8que%20nationale%20de%20France">Bibliothèque nationale de France</a>, has a miniature of the event. Another edition of Froissart's "Chronicles" published in Paris around 1508 may have been made expressly for <a href="Maria%20of%20Cleves">Maria of Cleves</a>. The edition has 25 miniatures in the margins; the single full-page illustration is of the "Bal des Ardents".

Spotted green pigeon

The spotted green pigeon or Liverpool pigeon ("Caloenas maculata") is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="Columbidae">pigeon</a> which is most likely <a href="extinct">extinct</a>. It was first mentioned and <a href="Scientific%20description">described</a> in 1783 by <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a>, who had seen two specimens of unknown <a href="provenance">provenance</a> and a drawing depicting the bird. The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> relationships of the bird were long obscure, and early writers suggested many different possibilities, though the idea that it was related to the <a href="Nicobar%20pigeon">Nicobar pigeon</a> ("C. nicobarica") prevailed, and it was therefore placed in the same <a href="genus">genus</a>, "<a href="Caloenas">Caloenas</a>". Today, the species is only known from a specimen kept in <a href="World%20Museum%2C%20Liverpool">World Museum, Liverpool</a>. Overlooked for much of the 20th century, it was recognised as a valid extinct species by the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> only in 2008. In 2014 a genetic study confirmed it as a distinct species related to the Nicobar pigeon, and showed that the two were the closest relatives of the extinct <a href="dodo">dodo</a> and <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a>.

The surviving specimen is long, and has very dark, brownish <a href="plumage">plumage</a> with a green gloss. The neck feathers are elongated, and most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings have a yellowish spot on their tips. It has a black <a href="beak">bill</a> with a yellow tip, and the end of the tail has a pale band. It has relatively short legs and long wings. It has been suggested it had a knob on its bill, but there is no evidence for this. Unlike the Nicobar pigeon, which is mainly terrestrial, the physical features of the spotted green pigeon suggest it was mainly <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a>, and <a href="frugivore">fed on fruits</a>. It may have been native to an island somewhere in the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Ocean">South Pacific Ocean</a> or the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, and it has been suggested that a bird referred to in 1928 as "titi" by <a href="Tahitian%20islanders">Tahitian islanders</a> was this bird. The spotted green pigeon may have been close to extinction by the time Europeans arrived in its native area, and may have disappeared due to over-hunting and <a href="predation">predation</a> by <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced animals</a>.

The spotted green pigeon was first mentioned and <a href="Scientific%20description">described</a> by the English ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in his 1783 work "A General Synopsis of Birds". Latham stated that he had seen two specimens, in the collections of the British major <a href="Thomas%20Davies%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Thomas Davies</a> and the naturalist <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a>, but it is uncertain how these ended up in the respective collections, and their <a href="provenance">provenance</a> is unknown. Though Banks received many specimens from the British explorer <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a>, and Davies received specimens from contacts in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, implying a location in the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Ocean">South Pacific Ocean</a>, there are no records of spotted green pigeons having been sent from these sources. After Davies' death, his specimen was bought in 1812 by <a href="Edward%20Smith-Stanley%2C%2013th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Edward Smith-Stanley, 13th Earl of Derby</a>, who kept it in <a href="Knowsley%20Hall">Knowsley Hall</a>. Smith-Stanley's collection was transferred to the Derby Museum in 1851, where the specimen was prepared from the original posed mount (which had perhaps been <a href="taxidermy">taxidermised</a> by Davies himself) into a <a href="study%20skin">study skin</a>. This museum later became <a href="World%20Museum">World Museum</a>, where the specimen is housed today (numbered WML 3538), but Banks' specimen is now lost. Latham also mentioned a drawing of a spotted green pigeon in the collection of <a href="Ashton%20Lever">Ashton Lever</a>, but it is unknown which specimen this was based on; it could have been either, or a third individual. Latham included an illustration of the spotted green pigeon in his 1823 work "A General History of Birds", and though the basis for his illustration is unknown, it differs from Davies' specimen in some details. It is possible that it was based on the drawing in the <a href="Leverian%20collection">Leverian collection</a>, since Latham stated that this drawing showed the end of the tail as "deep <a href="Rust%20%28color%29">ferruginous</a>" (rust-coloured), a feature also depicted in his own illustration.

The spotted green pigeon was <a href="scientifically%20named">scientifically named</a> by <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> in 1789, based on Latham's description. The original <a href="binomial%20name">binomial name</a> "Columba maculata" means "spotted pigeon" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. Latham himself accepted this name, and used it in his 1790 work "Index ornithologicus". Since Latham appears to have based his 1783 description on Davies' specimen, this can therefore be considered the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> of the species. Subsequent writers were uncertain about the validity and relationships of the species; <a href="James%20Francis%20Stephens">James Francis Stephens</a> suggested that it belonged in the fruit pigeon genus "<a href="Ptilinopus">Ptilinopus</a>" in 1826, and <a href="Johann%20Georg%20Wagler">Johann Georg Wagler</a> instead suggested that it was a juvenile <a href="Nicobar%20pigeon">Nicobar pigeon</a> ("Caloenas nicobarica") in 1827. <a href="Tommaso%20Salvadori">Tommaso Salvadori</a> listed the bird in an appendix about "doubtful species of pigeons, which have not yet been identified" in 1893. In 1898, <a href="Henry%20Ogg%20Forbes">Henry Ogg Forbes</a> supported the validity of the species, after examining Nicobar pigeon specimens and concluding that none resembled the spotted green pigeon at any stage of development. He therefore considered it a distinct species of the same genus as the Nicobar pigeon, "Caloenas". In 1901, <a href="Walter%20Rothschild%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Rothschild">Walter Rothschild</a> and <a href="Ernst%20Hartert">Ernst Hartert</a> agreed that the pigeon belonged to "Caloenas", but suggested that it was probably an "abnormity", though more than one specimen had been recorded.

The spotted green pigeon was only sporadically mentioned in the literature throughout the 20th century; little new information was published, and the bird remained an enigma. In 2001, <a href="Errol%20Fuller">Errol Fuller</a> suggested that the bird had been historically overlooked because Rothschild (an avid collector of rare birds) dismissed it as an aberration, perhaps because he did not own the surviving specimen himself. Fuller considered it a valid, extinct species, and also coined an alternative common name for the bird: the Liverpool pigeon. On the basis of Fuller's endorsement, <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a> listed the spotted green pigeon as "Extinct" on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> in 2008; it was previously "Not Recognized". In 2001, the ornithologist <a href="David%20Gibbs%20%28naturalist%29">David Gibbs</a> stated that the spotted green pigeon was only superficially similar to the Nicobar pigeon, and possibly distinct enough to warrant its own genus (related to "Ptilinopus", "<a href="Ducula">Ducula</a>", or "<a href="Gymnophaps">Gymnophaps</a>"). He also hypothesised that the bird might have inhabited a Pacific island, based on stories told by <a href="Tahitians">Tahitian islanders</a> in 1928 about a green and white speckled bird called "titi". The palaeontologist <a href="David%20Steadman">David Steadman</a> disputed the latter claim in a book review, noting that "titi" is an <a href="onomatopoeic">onomatopoeic</a> word (resembling the sound of the bird) used especially for <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s (members of <a href="Procellariidae">Procellariidae</a>) in east <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>. The ornithologists <a href="Julian%20P.%20Hume">Julian P. Hume</a> and Michael Walters, writing in 2012, agreed with Gibbs that the bird warranted generic status.

In 2014, an <a href="ancient%20DNA">ancient DNA</a> analysis by the geneticist Tim H. Heupink and colleagues compared the <a href="gene">gene</a>s of the only spotted green pigeon specimen with that of other pigeons, based on samples extracted from two of its feathers. One of the resulting <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> trees (or <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a>s) is shown below:

The spotted green pigeon was shown to be closest to the Nicobar pigeon. The <a href="genetic%20distance">genetic distance</a> between the two was more than is seen within other pigeon species, but similar to the distance between different species within the same genus. This confirmed that the two were distinct species in the same genus, and that the spotted green pigeon was a unique, extinct <a href="taxon">taxon</a>. The genus "Caloenas" was placed in a wider <a href="clade">clade</a> in which most members showed a mixture of <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> (tree-dwelling) and <a href="terrestrial%20animal">terrestrial</a> (ground-dwelling) traits. That "Caloenas" was placed in such a <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphologically</a> diverse clade may explain why many different relationships have previously been proposed for the members of the genus. A third species in the genus "Caloenas", the <a href="Kanaka%20pigeon">Kanaka pigeon</a> ("C. canacorum"), is only known from <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a>s discovered in <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a> and <a href="Tonga">Tonga</a>. This species was larger than the two other members of the genus, so it is unlikely that it represents the same species as the spotted green pigeon. The possibility that the spotted green pigeon was a <a href="Hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybrid</a> between other species can also be disregarded based on the genetic results.

The distribution of the Nicobar pigeon and the Kanaka pigeon (which does not appear to have had diminished flight abilities) suggests <a href="Biological%20dispersal">dispersal</a> through <a href="island%20hopping">island hopping</a> and an origin for the spotted green pigeon in <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a> or <a href="southeast%20Asia">southeast Asia</a>. The fact that the closest relatives of "Caloenas" were the extinct <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a> <a href="Raphinae">Raphinae</a> (first demonstrated in a 2002 study), which consists of the <a href="dodo">dodo</a> from <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and the <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a> from <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a>, indicates that the spotted green pigeon could also have originated somewhere in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. In any case, it seems most likely that the bird inhabited an island location, like its relatives. That the "Caloenas" pigeons were grouped in a clade at the <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">base</a> of the <a href="Lineage%20%28evolution%29">lineage</a> leading to Raphinae indicates that the ancestors of the <a href="Flightless%20bird">flightless</a> dodo and Rodrigues solitaire were able to fly, and reached the <a href="Mascarene%20Islands">Mascarene Islands</a> by island hopping from south Asia.

Latham's 1823 description of the spotted green pigeon from "A General History of Birds" (expanded from the one in "A General Synopsis of Birds") reads as follows:

Most literature addressing the spotted green pigeon simply repeated Latham's descriptions, adding little new information, until Gibbs published a more detailed description in 2001, followed by the museum curator Hein van Grouw in 2014. The surviving specimen measures in length, though study specimens are often stretched or compressed during taxidermy, and may therefore not reflect the length of a living bird. The weight has not been recorded. The spotted green pigeon appears to have been smaller and slenderer than the Nicobar pigeon, which reaches , and the Kanaka pigeon appears to have been 25% larger than the latter. At in length, the tail is longer than that of the Nicobar pigeon, but the head is smaller in relation. The bill is , and the <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> measures . Though the wings of the specimen appear to be short and rounded, and have been described as being long, vanGrouw discovered that the five outer <a href="primary%20feathers">primary feathers</a> have been pulled out of each wing, and suggested that the wings would therefore had been about longer in life, around in total. This is in accordance with Latham's 1823 illustration, which shows a bird with longer wings.

The bill of the specimen is black with a yellowish tip, and the <a href="cere">cere</a> is also black, with feathers on the upper side, almost to the nostrils. The <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a> are naked, and the upper part of the head is sooty black. The rest of the head is mostly brownish-black. The feathers of the <a href="nape">nape</a> and the neck are slightly bifurcated and have a dark green gloss, the latter with coppery reflections. The feathers of the neck are elongated (sometimes referred to as <a href="hackles">hackles</a>), and some of those on the sides and lower part have paler spots near the tips. Most of the feathers on the upperparts and wings are dark brown or brownish-black with a dark green gloss. Almost all of these feathers have a triangular, yellowish-<a href="Buff%20%28colour%29">buff</a> spot at their tips. The spots are almost whitish on some of the <a href="scapular%20feathers">scapular feathers</a>, vague and dark on the primary feathers. The underside of the wings is black with browner flight feathers, which have a pale spot or band at the tips. The breast is brownish-black with a faint green sheen. The tail is blackish with a dark green sheen, brownish-black on the underside, with a narrow, <a href="cinnamon">cinnamon</a>-coloured band at the end. This differs from the rust-coloured tail-tip apparently shown in the drawing owned by Lever, and Latham's own illustration. The legs are small and slender, have long toes, large claws, and a comparatively short tarsus, whereas the Nicobar pigeon has shorter claws and a longer tarsus.

When examining the specimen, van Grouw noticed that the legs had at one point been detached and are now attached opposite their natural positions. The short feathering of the legs would therefore have been attached to the inner side of the upper tarsus in life, not the outer. The plate accompanying Forbes' 1898 article shows the feathers on the outer side, and depicts the legs as pinkish, whereas they are yellow in the skin. The spotted green pigeon has at times been described as having a knob at the base of its bill, similar to that of the Nicobar pigeon. This idea seems to have originated with Forbes, who had the bird depicted with this feature, perhaps due to his conviction that it was a species of "Caloenas"; it was depicted with a knob as late as 2002. This is despite the fact that the surviving specimen does not possess a knob, and Latham did not mention or depict this feature, so such depictions are probably incorrect. The artificial eyes of the specimen were removed when it was prepared into a study skin, but red paint around the right eye-socket suggests that it was originally intended to have red eyes. It is unknown whether this represents the natural eye colour of the bird, yet the eyes were also depicted as red in Latham's illustration, which does not appear to have been based on the existing specimen. Forbes had the <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> depicted as orange and the skin around the eye as green, though this was probably guesswork.

The triangular spots of the spotted green pigeon are not unique among pigeons, but are also seen in the <a href="spot-winged%20pigeon">spot-winged pigeon</a> ("Columba maculosa") and the <a href="speckled%20pigeon">speckled pigeon</a> ("C. guinea"), and are the result of lack of <a href="melanin">melanin</a> deposition during development. The yellow-buff coloured spots are very worn, while less worn feathers have white tips; this indicates that the former were stained during life or represent a different stage of <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, and that the latter were fresher. The plumage of the spotted green pigeon was distinct in being very soft compared to that of other pigeons, perhaps due to the body feathers being proportionally long. The hackles were not as elongated as those of the Nicobar pigeon, and the feathers did not differ from those of other pigeons in their <a href="microstructure">microstructure</a>. The plumage was also distinct in being very pigmented, except for the tips of the feathers, and even the <a href="Down%20feather">down</a> was dark, unlike that of most other birds (a feature otherwise seen in aberrant plumage).

Though the plumage of the spotted green pigeon resembles that of the Nicobar pigeon in some respects, it is also similar to that of species in the imperial pigeon genus "Ducula". The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles can be seen in the <a href="goliath%20imperial%20pigeon">goliath imperial pigeon</a> ("D. goliath"). The <a href="Polynesian%20imperial%20pigeon">Polynesian imperial pigeon</a> ("D. aurorae") has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the <a href="Pacific%20imperial%20pigeon">Pacific imperial pigeon</a> ("D. pacifica") have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they <a href="moult">moult</a>. Therefore, vanGrouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy <a href="iridescence">iridescence</a>. He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.

The behaviour of the spotted green pigeon was not recorded, but theories have been proposed based on its physical features. Gibbs found the delicate, part-feathered legs and long tail indicative of at least partially arboreal habits. After noting that the wings were not short after all, van Grouw stated that the bird would not have been terrestrial, unlike the related Nicobar pigeon. He pointed out that the overall proportions and shape of the bird (longer tail, shorter legs, primary feathers probably reaching the middle of the tail) was more similar to the pigeons of the genus "Ducula". It may therefore have been ecologically similar to those birds, have likewise been strongly arboreal, and kept to the dense <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a> of forests. By contrast, the mainly terrestrial Nicobar pigeon forages on the <a href="forest%20floor">forest floor</a>. The dark eyes of the Nicobar pigeon are typical of species that forage on forest floors, whereas the coloured bill and presumably coloured eyes of the spotted green pigeon are similar to those of <a href="frugivore">frugivorous</a> (fruit-eating) pigeons. The feet of the spotted green pigeon are also similar to those of pigeons that forage in trees. The slender bill indicates that it fed on soft fruits.

Believing that the wings were short and round, Gibbs thought the bird was not a strong flyer, and therefore not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought it would have been a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) bird, that preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in "Ducula". It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.

The spotted green pigeon is most likely extinct, and may already have been close to extinction by the time Europeans arrived in its native area. The species may have disappeared due to being over-hunted and being preyed upon by <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced animals</a>. Hume suggested that the bird may have survived until the 1820s.

Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars

Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars is a <a href="crossover%20%28fiction%29">crossover</a> <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a> developed by <a href="Eighting">Eighting</a> and published by <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a>. The game features characters from both Capcom's video game franchises and various <a href="anime">anime</a> series produced by <a href="Tatsunoko%20Production">Tatsunoko Production</a>. It was originally released in Japan for <a href="arcade%20game">arcades</a> and the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> video game console in December 2008 as . Following high demand from international fans, Capcom worked with Tatsunoko to resolve international licensing issues and a second version, "Ultimate All-Stars", was released for the Wii in North America, Japan, and Europe in January 2010, featuring additional characters and an online mode.

In "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom", players engage in combat with a team of two characters or with a single giant character and attempt to knock out their opponents. It is the seventh Capcom-designed installment in their "Vs." fighting game series, which includes the "<a href="Marvel%20vs.%20Capcom">Marvel vs. Capcom</a>" and "<a href="SNK%20vs.%20Capcom">Capcom vs. SNK</a>" series, and the first to be fully rendered in 3D graphics. The game is set in a <a href="2.5D">2.5D</a> environment; characters fight in a two-dimensional arena, but character models and backgrounds are <a href="Rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">rendered</a> in <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional graphics</a>. The game is designed around a simplified three-button attack system, which was inspired by the simplistic control schemes commonly used by both the "Vs." series and the Wii.

The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its approachable gameplay for newcomers and depth for veteran players. However, reviewers had mixed experiences with its online component, and found Arcade mode lacking in <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a>. According to the game's producer, Ryota Niitsuma, development difficulties and a lack of Wii fighting games were the reasons for its platform exclusivity; however, multiple critics questioned if that was the best choice. Capcom announced in April 2010 that the game was a commercial success.

"Tatsunoko vs. Capcom" is a -based <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a> in which players control characters with different attacks and fighting styles, and engage in combat to deplete their opponent's <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">life gauge</a>. The gameplay is set in a 2.5D environment where the characters are rendered in <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional graphics</a>, but their movements are restricted to a two dimensional plane; they may only move left and right, and upward through the air. Each player may select a team of two characters and can switch between them during combat. Alternatively, players may select one of two "giant" characters, who cannot be played as part of a team. When characters switch, the incoming one performs a special attack upon entry, and the previous one can regenerate health. Characters not in play may be used to assist, and to perform powerful team moves. A match ends when a team has no characters left, or when the timer reaches zero—in which case, the team with the most remaining life wins.

The arcade release of "Cross Generation of Heroes" has a control scheme consisting of a <a href="joystick">joystick</a> and four buttons. Wii versions of "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom" have five control options: the <a href="Classic%20Controller">Classic Controller</a>, <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube%20controller">Nintendo GameCube controller</a>, third-party <a href="Joystick%23Arcade%20sticks">arcade sticks</a>, and two simplified control schemes—intended for inexperienced players—for the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a>. Players use controller inputs to perform attacks; the most basic attacks are executed by pressing one of three attack buttons: light, medium, or strong. Players may augment basic attacks with joystick or control pad <a href="D-pad">directional inputs</a>; for example, a standard strong attack can become a <a href="Sweep%20%28martial%20arts%29">sweep</a> when the down input is added. Basic attacks can be strung together to perform <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combos</a>.

Each character has unique "universal techniques"—special attacks that are more powerful than normal moves—that require complex control inputs. Similar inputs are used to perform even stronger versions of special moves called Hyper Combos and Team Hyper Combos; these deal damage relative to the size of the player's Hyper Combo gauge, which increases when the character inflicts or receives damage. Certain universal techniques are usable by all characters; for example, each character possesses one that launches opponents upward, rendering them vulnerable to an "<a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29%23Air%20combo">air combo</a>". Other common universal techniques include the "Baroque Combo", which sacrifices the regenerable portion of a character's life gauge, but allows players to extend combos and deal more damage; and the "Mega Crash", which creates a temporary barrier around the character to knock back opponents, but partially drains their Hyper Combo and life gauges.

"Cross Generation of Heroes", the 2008 Wii version of "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom", has an Arcade <a href="Game%20mechanic%23Game%20modes">game mode</a>: the player fights against <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> (AI)-controlled opponents to reach the final <a href="Boss%20%28video%20games%29">boss character</a>, Yami from "<a href="%C5%8Ckami">Ōkami</a>". <a href="Time%20attack">Time attack</a> and Survival modes are also available, and require the player to defeat every character in the game. While Survival limits health regeneration, Time attack challenges players to win in the shortest time possible. Other modes include Vs. Mode, in which two players engage in combat, and Original Games, which sees up to four players competing in character-specific minigames. Using money obtained throughout the game, the player may purchase <a href="Secret%20character%20%28video%20games%29">unlockable characters</a>, alternate character costumes, minigames, character profiles, movies, <a href="illustration">illustration</a>s, and background music. Once purchased, the latter four are viewable in a gallery. The arcade release of "Cross Generation of Heroes" omits the game modes, and instead features a character selection screen from which a player may compete against either AI opponents or a second player.

"Ultimate All-Stars" has largely the same features as the Wii version of "Cross Generation of Heroes", with the exception of Original Games; instead, it features a <a href="shoot%20%27em%20up">top-down shooter</a> minigame set in the "<a href="Lost%20Planet">Lost Planet</a>" world called "Ultimate All-Shooters". Unique to "Ultimate All-Stars" is <a href="Nintendo%20Wi-Fi%20Connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> support for Vs. Mode competition over the Internet. Online multiplayer matches may be played either with registered friends or opponents, or randomly selected participants. Players can choose from randomly selected opponents to be of a rank similar to their own. Rank is decided by battle points, which fluctuate when a ranked match is won or lost. Once a match is completed, players can add a consenting opponent to a Rival Roster for future matches.

"Ultimate All-Stars" contains 26 playable characters from Capcom video game franchises like "<a href="Street%20Fighter">Street Fighter</a>", "<a href="Mega%20Man">Mega Man</a>", and "<a href="Viewtiful%20Joe">Viewtiful Joe</a>" and Tatsunoko Production anime franchises such as "<a href="Science%20Ninja%20Team%20Gatchaman">Science Ninja Team Gatchaman</a>", "<a href="Yatterman">Yatterman</a>", and "<a href="Neo-Human%20Casshern">Neo-Human Casshern</a>". The original arcade version of "Cross Generation of Heroes" features 18 characters, which was increased to 22 for its Wii release. The rosters of both "Ultimate All-Stars" and "Cross Generation of Heroes" are evenly divided between Tatsunoko and Capcom characters. The game's two largest and most powerful characters, Tatsunoko's <a href="Golden%20Warrior%20Gold%20Lightan">Gold Lightan</a> and Capcom's PTX-40A, cannot have partners; by extension, they cannot perform universal techniques that require a partner. Non-playable characters, derived from Capcom and Tatsunoko intellectual properties, make cameo appearances during certain attacks; for example, Casshan is assisted by his robotic dog, Friender, while Doronjo is accompanied by her lackeys Boyacky and Tonzura.

"Tatsunoko vs. Capcom" was conceived when Tatsunoko Production asked Capcom to develop a game with Tatsunoko characters. In-company discussions at Capcom about it started in mid-2006; Capcom producer Ryota Niitsuma was interested in producing a fighting game, and agreed with other Capcom employees that Tatsunoko's characters would be better suited for a "Vs." game than a "<a href="Street%20Fighter">Street Fighter</a>" game. The resulting project was the seventh Capcom-designed entry in the "Vs." series and the first in over seven years. In the 2000s decade, fighting games were less popular and plentiful than in the mid-1990s, with multiplayer competition shifting towards other genres.

The research and development team started work in parallel with "<a href="Street%20Fighter%20IV">Street Fighter IV</a>". "Capcom [hoped to] bring back the fighting genre into the mainstream market [...] with a serious fighting game for very hardcore fans, and another with a slightly lowered barrier to entry," Niitsuma said. <a href="Eighting">Eighting</a>, Capcom's hired developer, took on the job in early 2007. "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom"s design was a departure from the complex attack systems of the "Street Fighter" series, and of certain "Vs." titles. The game is built around a simplified three-button attack system (light, medium, and strong); it was inspired by the control systems commonly used by both the "Vs." series and the Wii, which allows intricate moves to be performed with basic control inputs.

On May 22, 2008, Capcom announced the game, titled "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes", for release in Japanese arcades. The arcade cabinets' <a href="arcade%20system%20board">system board</a> was <a href="proprietary%20hardware">proprietary hardware</a> based on the Wii. Beta units were sent to test locations in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a> (July 10–13) and <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a> (July 25–27). By September, the game was 70% complete, and a Wii version was announced for Japanese release. Capcom gradually revealed the game's cast until release. It was released in Japan on the Wii on December 11, 2008, and an arcade version followed in mid-December 2008.

When choosing candidates for the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, "[We] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we had to figure out how to make a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance between male and female characters." Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from "<a href="Genesis%20Climber%20MOSPEADA">Genesis Climber MOSPEADA</a>" or "<a href="Samurai%20Pizza%20Cats">Samurai Pizza Cats</a>", despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's "<a href="Muteking%2C%20The%20Dashing%20Warrior">Muteking, The Dashing Warrior</a>" and "<a href="Nurse%20Witch%20Komugi">Nurse Witch Komugi</a>" were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's <a href="Phoenix%20Wright%20%28character%29">Phoenix Wright</a> and <a href="List%20of%20characters%20in%20the%20Ace%20Attorney%20series%23Franziska%20von%20Karma">Franziska von Karma</a> from the "<a href="Ace%20Attorney">Ace Attorney</a>" series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in <a href="kanji">kanji</a>) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. <a href="Arthur%20%28Ghosts%20%27n%20Goblins%29">Arthur</a> from "<a href="Ghosts%20%27n%20Goblins%20%28series%29">Ghosts 'n Goblins</a>", and <a href="List%20of%20Street%20Fighter%20characters%23Ingrid">Ingrid</a> from "<a href="Capcom%20Fighting%20Evolution">Capcom Fighting Evolution</a>" were also scrapped.

The game is the first Capcom-designed "Vs". installment to be rendered fully in 3D. "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom" and its graphical characteristics were optimized for the Wii, which prevents the game from being <a href="porting">ported</a> to other consoles without completely re-building the game. Niitsuma explained that its Wii exclusivity was also due to a lack of Capcom fighting games for the console, and because the Wii's casual quality matches the "Vs." series trait of accessibility. The producer suggested that porting a sequel would be easier, but that Capcom would gauge the reception of the Wii game before making such plans. On November 7, 2012, Capcom USA's senior vice president Christian Svensson revealed that Capcom's rights with Tatsunoko have lapsed, meaning Capcom is no longer authorized to sell "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom" physically or digitally.

On May 6, 2009, Capcom listed two "mystery games" as part of their <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202009">Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009</a> (E3 2009) lineup. "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" magazine revealed "Capcom Mystery Game #1" to be the North American localization of "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes", with the new subtitle ""Ultimate All-Stars"". It was playable at the company's E3 booth. European and Australian releases were announced on later dates. The game was originally unintended for release outside Japan, but was <a href="Internationalization%20and%20localization">localized</a> by Capcom due to positive fan reception. Tatsunoko Production assisted Capcom with its character licensing issues; while Tatsunoko Production holds such rights in Japan, they are licensed to companies such as <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> in other countries. Niitsuma said that acquiring character licenses was difficult, as it was largely done one at a time, and characters cleared in North America had to be checked separately in Europe. Another issue was the possibility that Eighting would be occupied with other projects. Time constraints led Niitsuma to replace the character-specific minigames of "Cross Generation of Heroes" with "Ultimate All-Shooters", an expansion of PTX-40A's minigame. Artwork by <a href="UDON">UDON</a> replaced the animated character-specific endings.

A Capcom press release in June 2009 stated that the North American release would have more mini-games, an "enhanced" story mode, and support for online play. The roster would be expanded by five characters, but would lose one unnamed Tatsunoko character. However, Capcom later revised this press release, as it was incorrect, with the statement that they were "looking into adding new features to the game, including possible additions of several new characters from both Capcom and Tatsunoko and [...] exploring the option of online gameplay."

On September 9, 2009, Capcom announced the Japanese release of "Ultimate All-Stars". Starting on that day, the company periodically revealed the game's new characters; however, the full cast was leaked through JavaScript code on the game's official Japanese site. With the exception of <a href="The%20Genie%20Family">Hakushon Daimaō</a>, who was removed due to unspecified licensing issues, every playable character from the original Wii release was included. Hakushon Daimaō was also removed in "Ultimate All-Stars" Japanese release, due to both his unpopularity with players, and the game's status as a localization of the North American version. The new characters encompassed <a href="Frank%20West%20%28Dead%20Rising%29">Frank West</a> from "<a href="Dead%20Rising">Dead Rising</a>", <a href="Zero%20%28Mega%20Man%29">Zero</a> from "<a href="Mega%20Man%20X">Mega Man X</a>", Yatterman-2 from "<a href="Yatterman">Yatterman</a>", Joe the Condor from "<a href="Science%20Ninja%20Team%20Gatchaman">Gatchaman</a>", and the title character from "<a href="Tekkaman%20Blade">Tekkaman Blade</a>". Shinji Ueda served as a director along with Hidetoshi Ishizawa. Ishizawa admitted that, just as "Cross Generation of Heroes" was not initially planned to be released internationally, neither was "Ultimate All-Stars" planned to be released in Japan. However, fan appeals and the <a href="research%20and%20development">research and development</a> team's own hopes resulted in the game's Japanese localization.

An official launch event for "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All Stars" was held at the <a href="Nintendo%20World%20Store">Nintendo World Store</a> in the <a href="Rockefeller%20Center">Rockefeller Center</a> on January 23, 2010, featuring autograph signings by Niitsuma, giveaways, competitions, and playable demo kiosks. Hundreds of fans were expected to attend between 11 pm and 3 pm. The game was released in North America on January 26, in Japan on January 28, and in Europe on January 29. Capcom's Community Manager Seth Killian expressed satisfaction with the North American sales of "Ultimate All-Stars". "["Tatsunoko Vs Capcom"] certainly beat the initial expectations. It didn't set any land speed records, but it was a success," Killian stated. "And that's really saying something considering that we're talking about a game that was not only never coming out, but has a title that most people can't even pronounce." In Japan, "Ultimate All-Stars" sold 18,913 units as of January 2, 2011, and, as of December 27, 2009, "Cross Generation of Heroes" has sold 62,805 units.

Certain versions of "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars" are bundled with a <a href="Mad%20Catz">Mad Catz</a> arcade stick, whose artwork was produced by Japanese artist <a href="Shinkiro">Shinkiro</a>. Pre-orders from <a href="GameStop">GameStop</a> included eight of thirteen <a href="Lenticular%20printing">lenticular</a> trading cards. As a buying incentive, Capcom's Japanese online store offered a "Secret File" compilation book of concept art, illustrations and design notes; it is the twenty-seventh volume of the "Secret File" series, which was originally published between 1996 and 1999 as a supplement to Capcom games of the time. The store also included an audio CD with four vocal tracks from the game: the opening song from "Cross Generation of Heroes", "Across the Border", sung by <a href="Asami%20Abe">Asami Abe</a>; "Ultimate All-Stars" English re-recording of this song, sung by Anna Gholston, with rap by James C. Wilson; and the Japanese and English versions of Roll's theme song composed by <a href="Yoshinori%20Ono%20%28game%20producer%29">Yoshinori Ono</a>.

"<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>"s four reviewers each gave "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Cross Generation of Heroes" a score of 8/10. They believed that its variety of characters and its fighting system were strong points, but found its gameplay to be slightly flat, as skilled players are obligated to use Baroque Combos repeatedly. Licensing and resource issues made <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Ricardo Torres, <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s John Tanaka, <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> and other critics doubtful that the game would see an international release. Describing the game's cast of licensed characters, <a href="Adam%20Sessler">Adam Sessler</a> of "<a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>" stated that "clearing the American rights to show them all in one game would be a logistical nightmare." He also pointed out the largely unknown cast to non-Japanese audiences—a notion IGN's Mark Bozon agreed with. When "Ultimate All-Stars" debuted at E3 2009, it garnered numerous <a href="Video%20game%20genres">genre</a>-specific awards, and won the <a href="Game%20Critics%20Awards">Game Critics Award</a> for "Best Fighting Game".

"Tatsunoko vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars" received positive reviews, with an average score of 85% on review aggregate sites <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> and <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>. Critics praised its balance between accessibility and depth; Adam Sessler called it the perfect game for the Wii's demographic, and remarked that it allows "grandmas, kiddies and junkies" to perform intricate combos, while including deeper gameplay mechanics for the "more refined palate". Contrasting the game with previous "Vs." titles, <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> reviewer Randolph Ramsay stated that its use of fewer buttons "may seem less complex [...], but this simplicity belies the depth of each character's move set." <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Matt Edwards believed that, compared to the separate buttons for punches and kicks in "", "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom"s streamlined approach was moderately easy to learn. Edwards claimed that the game is a "slightly slower and more user-friendly "Marvel", without losing the ability to pull-off crazy 50+ hit combos."

Reviewers lauded the variety of "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom"s graphical presentation and character playstyles. Ben Kuchera of <a href="Ars%20Technica">Ars Technica</a> wrote that its over-the-top attacks can be "huge, colorful, screen-filling blasts of light and movement," and that combos "flash across the screen, claiming you landed billions of points of damage." Adam Sessler and <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>'s Richard Li found that each character played in a vastly different way; Li explained that there are characters who take advantage of sheer speed and long range moves, others who use momentum to apply pressure to opponents and those who rely on a single opportune moment to deal vast amounts of damage. Heidi Kemps of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" contrasted the game with "Marvel vs. Capcom 2", and noted that "every combatant in "Tatsunoko" feels carefully designed to be unique, intriguing, and most importantly, worth investing time into mastering." Bozon, Edwards, and VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole believed that the characters were well-animated, and chained attacks together seamlessly.

Li criticized Capcom for not providing an easy alternative to unlock characters since the multiple Arcade mode playthroughs needed to unlock them could be frustrating. Nintendo World Report's Neal Ronaghan mentioned it can get tedious, and echoing Li's sentiment, Ryan Scott of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> complained that "arcade mode needs to be left to die," as multiplayer is the primary reason for playing fighting games. Both Scott and Ramsay thought many of the other unlockables obtainable through Arcade mode didn't offer sufficient value. Reviewers had mixed experiences with its online component; <a href="GameDaily">GameDaily</a>'s Robert Workman reported that it ran fluidly, but Scott said that the game <a href="lag">lag</a>ged often enough to be unplayable. Edwards thought "the netcode hasn't shown itself to be particularly sturdy," but the situation may improve as the number of local players increase. Both Bozon and <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> said that performance depends on each player's connection; the latter explained that lag is more likely to occur when playing against a distant opponent.

The game's soundtrack was lauded, with Robert Workman of <a href="GameDaily">GameDaily</a> highlighting its "fantastic mix of strong techno tunes and dramatic battle themes." Ramsay cited its "convincing battle effects" and "catchy music"; he believed that the latter complemented the game's dynamic nature and presentation. Bozon and "<a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Official Nintendo Magazine</a>"s Chris Scullion expressed annoyance with the voice work of the top-down shooter minigame. Bozon explained that three of the four playable characters yell every time they fire.

Critics speculated on the commercial risk of localizing "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom" for the Wii. Kemps considered it a risky undertaking for Capcom, as the console isn't renowned for fighting titles, and as the game abandons the three-on-three matches of the "Marvel" titles—which popularized the "Vs." series—in favor of the two-on-two formula used in the older, more obscure "Vs." games. Kemps and Bozon pointed out that the game's Tatsunoko characters are largely unknown to non-Japanese audiences; this caused Bozon to liken the game to a <a href="dark%20horse">dark horse</a>, as he considered it to be one of the Wii's best titles. Li reported that "Many wondered why Capcom chose Nintendo's Wii as the exclusive platform [...], a multiplatform release would reach a broader audience, critics argued." The game's quality led Yin-Poole to question whether it would stay exclusive to the Wii; he speculated, "Perhaps "TvC" is a test, then. If it sells even remotely well, maybe we'll see a sequel on Microsoft and Sony's consoles. Or maybe, fingers crossed, it'll add further weight to the case for ["<a href="Marvel%20vs.%20Capcom%203">Marvel vs. Capcom 3</a>"]."

In 1995, he became the founding director of the newly created <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Gravitational%20Physics">Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics</a> in <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>, Germany.

Ehlers' research focused on the foundations of general relativity as well as on the theory's applications to <a href="astrophysics">astrophysics</a>. He formulated a suitable classification of <a href="Exact%20solutions%20in%20general%20relativity">exact solutions</a> to <a href="Einstein%27s%20field%20equations">Einstein's field equations</a> and proved the <a href="Ehlers%E2%80%93Geren%E2%80%93Sachs%20theorem">Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem</a> that justifies the application of simple, general-relativistic model universes to modern <a href="Physical%20cosmology">cosmology</a>. He created a <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>-oriented description of <a href="gravitational%20lens">gravitational lens</a>ing and clarified the relationship between models formulated within the framework of general relativity and those of <a href="Newtonian%20gravity">Newtonian gravity</a>. In addition, Ehlers had a keen interest in both the history and <a href="philosophy%20of%20physics">philosophy of physics</a> and was an ardent populariser of science.

Jürgen Ehlers was born in Hamburg. He attended public schools from 1936 to 1949, and then went on to study physics, mathematics and philosophy at <a href="Hamburg%20University">Hamburg University</a> from 1949 to 1955. In the winter term of 1955–56, he passed the high school teacher's examination ("<a href="Staatsexamen">Staatsexamen</a>"), but instead of becoming a teacher undertook graduate research with <a href="Pascual%20Jordan">Pascual Jordan</a>, who acted as his thesis advisor. Ehlers' doctoral work was on the construction and characterization of <a href="solution">solution</a>s of the <a href="Einstein%20field%20equations">Einstein field equations</a>. He earned his doctorate in physics from Hamburg University in 1958.

Prior to Ehlers' arrival, the main research of Jordan's group had been dedicated to a <a href="Scalar-tensor%20theory">scalar-tensor</a> modification of general relativity that later became known as <a href="Jordan%E2%80%93Brans%E2%80%93Dicke%20theory">Jordan–Brans–Dicke theory</a>. This theory differs from general relativity in that the <a href="gravitational%20constant">gravitational constant</a> is replaced by a variable <a href="Field%20%28physics%29">field</a>. Ehlers was instrumental in changing the group's focus to the structure and interpretation of Einstein's original theory. Other members of the group included Wolfgang Kundt, <a href="Rainer%20K.%20Sachs">Rainer K. Sachs</a> and Manfred Trümper.
The group had a close working relationship with <a href="Otto%20Heckmann">Otto Heckmann</a> and his student <a href="Engelbert%20Sch%C3%BCcking">Engelbert Schücking</a> at <a href="Hamburger%20Sternwarte">Hamburger Sternwarte</a>, the city's observatory. Guests at the group's colloquium included <a href="Wolfgang%20Pauli">Wolfgang Pauli</a>, Joshua Goldberg and <a href="Peter%20Bergmann">Peter Bergmann</a>.

In 1961, as Jordan's assistant, Ehlers earned his <a href="habilitation">habilitation</a>, qualifying him for a German professorship. He then held teaching and research positions in Germany and in the US, namely at the <a href="University%20of%20Kiel">University of Kiel</a>, <a href="Syracuse%20University">Syracuse University</a> and Hamburg University. From 1964 to 1965, he was at the <a href="Graduate%20Research%20Center%20of%20the%20Southwest">Graduate Research Center of the Southwest</a> in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>. From 1965 to 1971, he held various positions in <a href="Alfred%20Schild">Alfred Schild</a>'s group at the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>, starting as an <a href="associate%20professor">associate professor</a> and, in 1967, obtaining a position as full professor. During that time, he held visiting professorships at the universities of <a href="University%20of%20W%C3%BCrzburg">Würzburg</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Bonn">Bonn</a>.

In 1970, Ehlers received an offer to join the <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Physics%20and%20Astrophysics">Max Planck Institute for Physics and Astrophysics</a> in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> as the director of its gravitational theory department. Ehlers had been suggested by <a href="Ludwig%20Biermann">Ludwig Biermann</a>, the institute's director at the time. When Ehlers joined the institute in 1971, he also became an adjunct professor at Munich's <a href="Ludwig%20Maximilian%20University">Ludwig Maximilian University</a>. In March 1991, the institute split into the <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Physics">Max Planck Institute for Physics</a> and the <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Astrophysics">Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics</a>, where Ehlers' department found a home. Over the 24 years of his tenure, his research group was home to, among others, <a href="Gary%20Gibbons">Gary Gibbons</a>, John Stewart and Bernd Schmidt, as well as visiting scientists including <a href="Abhay%20Ashtekar">Abhay Ashtekar</a>, <a href="Demetrios%20Christodoulou">Demetrios Christodoulou</a> and <a href="Brandon%20Carter">Brandon Carter</a>.

One of Ehlers' <a href="postdoctoral%20student">postdoctoral student</a>s in Munich was Reinhard Breuer, who later became editor-in-chief of "Spektrum der Wissenschaft", the German edition of the popular-science journal "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>".

When German science institutions reorganized after <a href="German%20reunification">German reunification</a> in 1990, Ehlers lobbied for the establishment of an institute of the Max Planck Society dedicated to research on gravitational theory. On 9 June 1994, the Society decided to open the <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Gravitational%20Physics">Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics</a> in <a href="Potsdam">Potsdam</a>. The institute started operations on 1 April 1995, with Ehlers as its founding director and as the leader of its department for the foundations and mathematics of general relativity. Ehlers then oversaw the founding of a second institute department devoted to <a href="gravitational%20wave">gravitational wave</a> research and headed by <a href="Bernard%20F.%20Schutz">Bernard F. Schutz</a>. On 31 December 1998, Ehlers retired to become founding director <a href="emeritus">emeritus</a>.

Ehlers continued to work at the institute until his death on 20 May 2008. He left behind his wife Anita Ehlers, his four children, Martin, Kathrin, David, and Max, as well as five grandchildren.

Ehlers' research was in the field of general relativity. In particular, he made contributions to <a href="cosmology">cosmology</a>, the theory of <a href="gravitational%20lenses">gravitational lenses</a> and <a href="gravitational%20waves">gravitational waves</a>. His principal concern was to clarify general relativity's mathematical structure and its consequences, separating rigorous proofs from <a href="heuristic">heuristic</a> conjectures.

For his doctoral thesis, Ehlers turned to a question that was to shape his lifetime research. He sought exact solutions of <a href="Einstein%27s%20equations">Einstein's equations</a>: <a href="Universe%20Models">model universes</a> consistent with the laws of general relativity that are simple enough to allow for an explicit description in terms of basic mathematical expressions. These exact solutions play a key role when it comes to building general-relativistic models of physical situations. However, general relativity is a fully <a href="general%20covariance">covariant</a> theory – its laws are the same, independent of which <a href="coordinate">coordinate</a>s are chosen to describe a given situation. One direct consequence is that two apparently different exact solutions could correspond to the same model universe, and differ only in their coordinates. Ehlers began to look for serviceable ways of characterizing exact solutions "<a href="Invariant%20%28physics%29">invariantly</a>", that is, in ways that do not depend on coordinate choice. In order to do so, he examined ways of describing the intrinsic geometric properties of the known exact solutions.

During the 1960s, following up on his doctoral thesis, Ehlers published a series of papers, all but one in collaboration with colleagues from the Hamburg group, which later became known as the "Hamburg Bible".
The first paper, written with Jordan and Kundt, is a treatise on how to characterize exact solutions to Einstein's field equations in a systematic way. The analysis presented there uses tools from <a href="differential%20geometry">differential geometry</a> such as the <a href="Petrov%20classification">Petrov classification</a> of <a href="Weyl%20tensor">Weyl tensor</a>s (that is, those parts of the <a href="Riemann%20tensor">Riemann tensor</a> describing the <a href="curvature">curvature</a> of <a href="space-time">space-time</a> that are not constrained by Einstein's equations), <a href="isometry%20group">isometry group</a>s and <a href="Conformal%20map">conformal</a> transformations. This work also includes the first definition and classification of <a href="pp-waves">pp-waves</a>, a class of simple gravitational waves.

The following papers in the series were treatises on <a href="gravitational%20radiation">gravitational radiation</a> (one with Sachs, one with Trümper). The work with Sachs studies, among other things, <a href="vacuum%20solutions">vacuum solutions</a> with special <a href="algebra">algebra</a>ic properties, using the 2-component <a href="spinor">spinor</a> formalism. It also gives a systematic exposition of the geometric properties of bundles (in mathematical terms: congruences) of light beams. Spacetime geometry can influence the propagation of light, making them converge on or diverge from each other, or deforming the bundle's cross section without changing its area. The paper formalizes these possible changes in the bundle in terms of the bundle's expansion (convergence/divergence), and twist and shear (cross-section area-conserving deformation), linking those properties to spacetime geometry. One result is the "Ehlers-Sachs theorem" describing the properties of the shadow produced by a narrow beam of light encountering an opaque object. The tools developed in that work would prove essential for the discovery by <a href="Roy%20Kerr">Roy Kerr</a> of his <a href="Kerr%20solution">Kerr solution</a>, describing a rotating <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> – one of the most important exact solutions.

The last of these seminal papers addressed the general-relativistic treatment of the mechanics of continuous media. However useful the notion of a point mass may be in classical physics; in general relativity, such an idealized mass concentration into a single point of space is not even well-defined. That is why relativistic <a href="hydrodynamics">hydrodynamics</a>, that is, the study of continuous media, is an essential part of model-building in general relativity. The paper systematically describes the basic concepts and models in what the editor of the journal "<a href="General%20Relativity%20and%20Gravitation">General Relativity and Gravitation</a>", on the occasion of publishing an English translation 32 years after the original publication date, called "one of the best reviews in this area".

Another part of Ehlers' exploration of exact solutions in his thesis led to a result that proved important later. At the time Ehlers started his research on his doctoral thesis, the <a href="Golden%20age%20of%20general%20relativity">Golden age of general relativity</a> had not yet begun and the basic properties and concepts of black holes were not yet understood. In the work that led to his doctoral thesis, Ehlers proved important properties of the surface around a black hole that would later be identified as its <a href="horizon">horizon</a>, in particular that the <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a> inside cannot be static, but must change over time. The simplest example of this is the "Einstein-Rosen bridge", or <a href="Wormhole%23Schwarzschild%20wormholes">Schwarzschild wormhole</a> that is part of the Schwarzschild solution describing an idealized, spherically symmetric black hole: the interior of the horizon houses a bridge-like connection that changes over time, collapsing sufficiently quickly to keep any space-traveler from traveling through the wormhole.

In physics, <a href="Duality%20%28mathematics%29">duality</a> means that two equivalent descriptions of a particular physical situation exist, using different physical concepts. This is a special case of a physical <a href="Symmetry%20%28physics%29">symmetry</a>, that is, a change that preserves key features of a physical system. A simple example for a duality is that between the <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a> E and the <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a> B <a href="electrodynamics">electrodynamics</a>: In the complete absence of electrical charges, the replacement E formula_1 –B, B formula_1 E leaves <a href="Maxwell%27s%20equations">Maxwell's equations</a> invariant. Whenever a particular pair of expressions for B and E conform to the laws of electrodynamics, switching the two expressions around and adding a minus sign to the new B is also valid.

In his doctoral thesis, Ehlers pointed out a duality symmetry between different components of the <a href="Metric%20%28mathematics%29">metric</a> of a stationary <a href="vacuum">vacuum</a> <a href="spacetime">spacetime</a>, which maps solutions of Einstein's field equations to other solutions. This symmetry between the tt-component of the metric, which describes time as measured by clocks whose spatial coordinates do not change, and a term known as the "twist potential" is analogous to the aforementioned duality between E and B.

The duality discovered by Ehlers was later expanded to a larger symmetry corresponding to the <a href="special%20linear%20group">special linear group</a> formula_3. This larger <a href="symmetry%20group">symmetry group</a> has since become known as the "Ehlers group". Its discovery led to further generalizations, notably the infinite-dimensional <a href="Geroch%20group">Geroch group</a> (the Geroch group is generated by two <a href="commutativity">non-commuting</a> <a href="subgroup">subgroup</a>s, one of which is the Ehlers group). These so-called "hidden symmetries" play an important role in the <a href="Kaluza%E2%80%93Klein%20reduction">Kaluza–Klein reduction</a> of both general relativity and its generalizations, such as eleven-dimensional <a href="supergravity">supergravity</a>. Other applications include their use as a tool in the discovery of previously unknown solutions and their role in a proof that solutions in the stationary <a href="axi-symmetric">axi-symmetric</a> case form an <a href="integrable%20system">integrable system</a>.

The Ehlers–Geren–Sachs theorem, published in 1968, shows that in a given universe, if all freely falling observers measure the <a href="cosmic%20background%20radiation">cosmic background radiation</a> to have exactly the same properties in all directions (that is, they measure the background radiation to be <a href="isotropic">isotropic</a>), then that universe is an isotropic and homogeneous <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann–Lemaître</a> spacetime. Cosmic isotropy and homogeneity are important as they are the basis of the modern standard model of cosmology.

In the 1960s, Ehlers collaborated with <a href="Felix%20Pirani">Felix Pirani</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Schild">Alfred Schild</a> on a constructive-axiomatic approach to general relativity: a way of deriving the theory from a minimal set of elementary objects and a set of axioms specifying these objects' properties. The basic ingredients of their approach are primitive concepts such as <a href="Event%20%28relativity%29">event</a>, <a href="light">light</a> ray, <a href="Subatomic%20particle">particle</a> and <a href="free%20fall">freely falling particle</a>. At the outset, spacetime is a mere set of events, without any further structure. They postulated the basic properties of light and freely falling particles as axioms, and with their help constructed the <a href="differential%20topology">differential topology</a>, <a href="conformal%20structure">conformal structure</a> and, finally, the <a href="Metric%20%28mathematics%29">metric</a> structure of spacetime, that is: the notion of when two events are close to each other, the role of light rays in linking up events, and a notion of distance between events. Key steps of the construction correspond to idealized measurements, such the standard range finding used in <a href="radar">radar</a>. The final step derived Einstein's equations from the weakest possible set of additional axioms. The result is a formulation that clearly identifies the assumptions underlying general relativity.

In the 1970s, in collaboration with Ekkart Rudolph, Ehlers addressed the problem of rigid bodies in general relativity. Rigid bodies are a fundamental concept in classical physics. However, the fact that by definition their different parts move simultaneously is incompatible with the relativistic concept of the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> as a limiting speed for the propagation of signals and other influences. While, as early as 1909, <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a> had given a definition of rigidity that was compatible with relativistic physics, his definition depends on assumptions that are not satisfied in a general space-time, and are thus overly restrictive. Ehlers and Rudolph generalized Born's definition to a more readily applicable definition they called "pseudo-rigidity", which represents a more satisfactory approximation to the rigidity of classical physics.

With Peter Schneider, Ehlers embarked on an in-depth study of the foundations of <a href="gravitational%20lensing">gravitational lensing</a>. One result of this work was a 1992 monograph co-authored with Schneider and Emilio Falco. It was the first systematic exposition of the topic that included both the theoretical foundations and the observational results. From the viewpoint of astronomy, gravitational lensing is often described using a quasi-Newtonian approximation—assuming the <a href="gravitational%20field">gravitational field</a> to be small and the deflection angles to be minute—which is perfectly sufficient for most situations of astrophysical relevance. In contrast, the monograph developed a thorough and complete description of gravitational lensing from a fully relativistic space-time perspective. This feature of the book played a major part in its long-term positive reception. In the following years, Ehlers continued his research on the propagation of bundles of light in arbitrary spacetimes.

A basic derivation of the Newtonian limit of general relativity is as old as the theory itself. Einstein used it to derive predictions such as the <a href="anomalous%20perihelion%20precession">anomalous perihelion precession</a> of the planet <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a>. Later work by <a href="%C3%89lie%20Cartan">Élie Cartan</a>, <a href="Kurt%20Friedrichs">Kurt Friedrichs</a> and others showed more concretely how a geometrical generalization of <a href="Newtonian%20gravity">Newton's theory of gravity</a> known as <a href="Newton%E2%80%93Cartan%20theory">Newton–Cartan theory</a> could be understood as a (degenerate) limit of <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>. This required letting a specific parameter formula_4 go to zero. Ehlers extended this work by developing a "frame theory" that allowed for constructing the Newton–Cartan limit, and in a mathematically precise way, not only for the physical laws, but for any spacetime obeying those laws (that is, solutions of Einstein's equations). This allowed physicists to explore what the Newtonian limit meant in specific physical situations. For example, the frame theory can be used to show that the Newtonian limit of a <a href="Schwarzschild%20solution">Schwarzschild black hole</a> is a simple <a href="point%20particle">point particle</a>. Also, it allows Newtonian versions of exact solutions such as the <a href="Friedmann%E2%80%93Lema%C3%AEtre%E2%80%93Robertson%E2%80%93Walker%20metric">Friedmann–Lemaître models</a> or the <a href="G%C3%B6del%20metric">Gödel universe</a> to be constructed. Since its inception, ideas Ehlers introduced in the context of his frame theory have found important applications in the study of both the Newtonian limit of general relativity and of the <a href="Post-Newtonian%20expansion">Post-Newtonian expansion</a>, where Newtonian gravity is complemented by terms of ever higher order in formula_5 in order to accommodate relativistic effects.

General relativity is <a href="nonlinear%20system">non-linear</a>: the gravitational influence of two masses is not simply the sum of those masses' individual gravitational influences, as had been the case in Newtonian gravity. Ehlers participated in the discussion of how the <a href="back-reaction">back-reaction</a> from gravitational radiation onto a radiating system could be systematically described in a non-linear theory such as general relativity, pointing out that the standard <a href="quadrupole">quadrupole</a> formula for the energy flux for systems like the <a href="binary%20pulsar">binary pulsar</a> had not (yet) been rigorously derived: a priori, a derivation demanded the inclusion of higher-order terms than was commonly assumed, higher than were computed until then.

His work on the Newtonian limit, particularly in relation to <a href="physical%20cosmology">cosmological</a> solutions, led Ehlers, together with his former doctoral student Thomas Buchert, to a systematic study of <a href="Perturbation%20theory">perturbations</a> and inhomogeneities in a Newtonian cosmos. This laid the groundwork for Buchert's later generalization of this treatment of inhomogeneities. This generalization was the basis of his attempt to explain what is currently seen as the cosmic effects of a <a href="cosmological%20constant">cosmological constant</a> or, in modern parlance, <a href="dark%20energy">dark energy</a>, as a non-linear consequence of inhomogeneities in general-relativistic cosmology.

Complementing his interest in the foundations of general relativity and, more generally, of physics, Ehlers researched the history of physics. Up until his death, he collaborated in a project on the history of quantum theory at the <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20the%20History%20of%20Science">Max Planck Institute for the History of Science</a> in Berlin. In particular, he explored Pascual Jordan's seminal contributions to the development of <a href="quantum%20field%20theory">quantum field theory</a> between 1925 and 1928. Throughout his career, Ehlers had an interest in the philosophical foundations and implications of physics and contributed to research on this topic by addressing questions such as the basic status of scientific knowledge in physics.

Ehlers showed a keen interest in reaching a general audience. He was a frequent public lecturer, at universities as well as at venues such as the <a href="Urania%20%28Berlin%29">Urania</a> in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. He authored popular-science articles, including contributions to general-audience journals such as "Bild der Wissenschaft". He edited a compilation of articles on gravity for the German edition of "Scientific American".
Ehlers directly addressed physics teachers, in talks and journal articles on the teaching of relativity and related basic ideas, such as <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> as the language of physics.

Ehlers became a member of the <a href="Berlin-Brandenburg%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20and%20Humanities">Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities</a> (1993), the <a href="Akademie%20der%20Wissenschaften%20und%20der%20Literatur">Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur</a>, <a href="Mainz">Mainz</a> (1972), the <a href="German%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20Leopoldina">Leopoldina</a> in <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle</a> (1975) and the <a href="Bavarian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences%20and%20Humanities">Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities</a> in Munich (1979). From 1995 to 1998, he served as president of the <a href="International%20Society%20on%20General%20Relativity%20and%20Gravitation">International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation</a>. He also received the 2002 <a href="Max%20Planck%20Medal">Max Planck Medal</a> of the <a href="Deutsche%20Physikalische%20Gesellschaft">German Physical Society</a>, the <a href="Alessandro%20Volta">Volta</a> Gold Medal of <a href="Pavia%20University">Pavia University</a> (2005) and the medal of the Faculty of Natural Sciences of <a href="Charles%20University">Charles University</a>, <a href="Prague">Prague</a> (2007).

In 2008, the International Society on General Relativity and Gravitation instituted the "Jürgen Ehlers Thesis Prize" in commemoration of Ehlers. It is sponsored by the scientific publishing house <a href="Springer%20Science%2BBusiness%20Media">Springer</a> and is awarded triennially, at the society's international conference, to the best doctoral thesis in the areas of mathematical and numerical general relativity. Issue 9 of volume 41 of the journal "<a href="General%20Relativity%20and%20Gravitation">General Relativity and Gravitation</a>" was dedicated to Ehlers, in memoriam.

Ngo Dinh Diem presidential visit to Australia

The Ngô Đình Diệm presidential visit to Australia from 2 to 9 September 1957 was an official visit by the first president of the <a href="South%20Vietnam">Republic of Vietnam</a>. It was part of a year of travelling for <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Diệm</a>, who made official visits to the United States and other anti-communist countries. As with his American trip, Diệm was warmly and lavishly received during the height of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, garnering bipartisan praise from both the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party of Australia</a> of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> and the opposition <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> (ALP).

Diệm addressed the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Parliament of Australia</a> and was made an honorary <a href="Knight%20Grand%20Cross%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George</a>, one of the highest imperial honours that can be bestowed on a non-British subject—at the time, Australians were also <a href="British%20subject">British subject</a>s. Diệm did not engage in substantive political discussions with the Australian leaders and he spent most of his time at public functions. He was universally extolled by the media, which praised him for what they perceived to be a successful, charismatic, democratic and righteous rule in South Vietnam, overlooking his authoritarianism, <a href="election%20fraud">election fraud</a> and other corrupt practices. The Australian <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> leadership and media were particularly glowing towards the South Vietnamese head of state. A member of Vietnam's Catholic minority and the brother of Vietnam's leading archbishop, Diệm had pursued policies in Vietnam favoring his co-religionists. He exempted the Catholic Church from land redistribution, gave them more aid and job promotions, and allowed Catholic paramilitaries to attack Buddhists, who formed the religious majority.

Diệm's visit was a highmark in relations between Australia and South Vietnam. Over time, Diệm became unpopular with his foreign allies, who began to criticise his autocratic style and religious bias. By the time of his <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">assassination</a>, he had little support. Australia later sent troops to support South Vietnam in the anti-communist fight, but the bipartisanship evaporated during the mid-1960s as the ALP began to sympathise with <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> and <a href="opposition%20to%20the%20Vietnam%20War">opposition to the Vietnam War</a> grew. The ALP later withdrew support for and refused to accept refugees from South Vietnam after winning office, but on the <a href="1975%20Australian%20constitutional%20crisis">return</a> of the <a href="centre%20right">centre right</a> <a href="Coalition%20%28Australia%29">Liberal-National coalition</a> to power in 1975, <a href="Vietnamese%20Australian">Vietnamese refugees</a> were allowed to resettle in Australia in large numbers.

In 1933, the devoutly Catholic Diệm was appointed Interior Minister of Vietnam, serving under Emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a>. However, a few months thereafter he resigned and became a private citizen because the French colonialists would not give Vietnam any meaningful autonomy. During World War II, <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a> attacked <a href="French%20Indochina">Indochina</a> and wrested control from France, but when they were defeated by the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> in 1945, a power vacuum was created. The communist-dominated <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> of <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Ho Chi Minh</a> fought for Vietnamese independence, while the French attempted to regain control of their colony by creating the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a>-allied <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a> under Bảo Đại. A staunch anti-communist nationalist, Diệm opposed both and attempted to create his own movement, with little success. With both the French and the communists hostile to him, Diệm felt unsafe and went into self-imposed exile in 1950. He spent the next four years in the United States and Europe enlisting support, particularly among Vatican officials and fellow Catholic politicians in America. The success of the effort was helped by the fact that his elder brother <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Ngô Đình Thục</a> was the leading Catholic cleric in Vietnam and had studied with high-ranking Vatican officials in Rome a few decades earlier.

In 1954, the French lost the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">Battle of Dien Bien Phu</a> and the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Conference</a> was held to determine the future of French Indochina. The Viet Minh were given control of <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>, while the State of Vietnam controlled the territory south of the <a href="Vietnamese%20Demilitarized%20Zone">17th parallel</a>. The Geneva agreements, which the State of Vietnam did not sign, called for reunification elections to be held in 1956. Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as his prime minister, hoping that he would be able to attract American aid as the French withdrew from Southeast Asia. Diệm then <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam%20referendum%2C%201955">deposed Bảo Đại in a fraudulent referendum</a> and declared himself president of the newly proclaimed <a href="South%20Vietnam">Republic of Vietnam</a>. Diệm received support from the U.S. and other anti-communist countries in the midst of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. He refused to hold the national elections and asserted that Ho Chi Minh would rig the ballots in the north, although he had done so himself in deposing Bảo Đại.

Diem arrived in the capital <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> on 2 September 1957; his visit was the first by a foreign incumbent head of state to Australia. He had visited the US in May, and the visit to Australia was the second of three legs in a tour of anti-communist countries in the <a href="Asia%20Pacific">Asia Pacific</a> region; Diem had visited <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> in August and went on to <a href="South%20Korea">South Korea</a> after leaving Australia. The magnitude of the ceremonial welcome accorded to Diem was unseen since the visit in 1954 by Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>. According to Peter Edwards, a military historian at the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> specialising in the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>, "Everywhere he was feted as a man of courage, faith and vision", and he noted that Diem was received with "more ceremony and pageantry" than the visit of Queen Elizabeth II in 1954.

Diem travelled with five others, including the Minister for Public Works and Communications, the Health Minister, and the Permanent Secretary-General of the Department for National Defense. Ahead of his arrival, the South Vietnamese leader had specifically asked to visit Australian manufacturing sites in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, particularly those in the food processing, textile, shipbuilding and housing industries.

Upon disembarking from his plane at <a href="Canberra%20Airport">Canberra Airport</a> on the morning of Monday 2 September, Diem was photographed for "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" and described as a "small but striking figure in a royal blue silk frock coat, long white trousers and black <a href="mandarin%20%28bureaucrat%29">mandarin</a> hat". He was greeted by the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a> Sir <a href="William%20Slim">William Slim</a> and the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a> <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>, and was also introduced to the British High Commissioner Lord Carrington and Ambassador Sebald of the United States. He was given a <a href="21-gun%20salute">21-gun salute</a> and a <a href="guard%20of%20honour">guard of honour</a> by the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>, whose fighter jets flew overhead, before making a speech about bilateral relations. Diem said thanked Australia for its "unflagging support in our most critical hours" and praised relations as being of "a quality normally only found in countries united by long friendship". He said "From our common love for freedom and our determination to keep it, stem the solidarity and friendship between our two countries." The South Vietnamese leader was then hosted for a dinner reception at <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Canberra">Yarralumla, the residence of the Governor-General</a>. 

The centrepiece of Diem's visit was a speech to a joint sitting of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Parliament of Australia</a> on Tuesday, September 3, with both the <a href="Australian%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> and the <a href="Australian%20Senate">Senate</a> in attendance. President Diem said that "moral and spiritual rearmament" and the "moral unity" of the people were the key factors in fighting the spread of communism. After the speech, Menzies called for three cheers for Diem at an official parliamentary luncheon. <a href="H.V.%20Evatt">Doc Evatt</a>, the leader of the opposition <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> joined in, proclaiming that peace, stability and democracy had been achieved in South Vietnam. On the same day, Diem also visited the Australian War Memorial and the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>.

On Wednesday, 4 September, Diem visited the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%20Duntroon">Royal Military College Duntroon</a> in Canberra, where he watched and addressed a parade of Australian cadets, who were training to become officers. Diem told the students that they were "comrades of the <a href="Free%20World">Free World</a>" and that they would help to defend like-minded countries. At midday, Diem left the national capital to begin a two-day stint in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, the capital and largest city in the southern state of <a href="Victoria%2C%20Australia">Victoria</a>. He was flown to <a href="Melbourne%20Airport">Melbourne Airport</a> by a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> <a href="Convair">Convair</a> and met by a guard of honour formed by members of the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a>. Diem was met by <a href="Premier%20of%20Victoria">Premier of Victoria</a> Sir <a href="Henry%20Bolte">Henry Bolte</a> and Lieutenant-Governor Sir <a href="Edmund%20Herring">Edmund Herring</a>, and was the guest of honour at a reception hosted by Premier Bolte at Parliament House. On Thursday, 5 September, Diem attended official receptions at <a href="Melbourne%20Town%20Hall">Melbourne Town Hall</a> and at the residence of the Governor of Victoria, re-emphasising his themes of anti-communism and the bilateral focus on democracy. He also visited three factories and had a private audience with the Catholic <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Melbourne">Archbishop of Melbourne</a> <a href="Daniel%20Mannix">Daniel Mannix</a>, who was well known for his political power and advocacy in Australia. The next morning, before departing for Sydney, Diem inspected a textile factory in the inner-northern suburb of <a href="Carlton%2C%20Victoria">Carlton</a> and visited several large-scale public housing estates. At the time, Australia was undergoing a post-World War II population boom and was dealing with housing pressures, an issue that was also confronting South Vietnam following the large influx of northern refugees after the <a href="partition%20of%20Vietnam">partition in 1954</a>.

The guard of honour and a 21-gun salute that Diem received at Parliament House was repeated in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> and <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, where large crowds cheered Diem's arrival at the airport and the passing of his motorcade. After arriving in Sydney on Friday, September 6, around midday aboard the RAAF Convair, the South Vietnamese leader was taken outside the capital cities for two days during the weekend, so that he could see the <a href="Snowy%20Mountains%20Scheme">Snowy Mountains Scheme</a>, a large <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a> project in highland Victoria. He returned to Sydney on Sunday, September 8, and left Australia the following evening. In one of Diem's final functions in Sydney, a minor emergency occurred at the Australia Hotel during a banquet hosted by the Premier of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Cahill">Joseph Cahill</a>. A fire ignited in a pile of rubbish, causing alarm bells to sound for ten minutes, interrupting Premier Cahill when he was making his speech, but no evacuation was required.

At the end of the visit, Menzies bestowed on Diem an honorary <a href="Knight%20Grand%20Cross%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George</a>, one of the highest imperial honours that had been bestowed on someone who was not a British subject. In his final comments, Diem said "I have been enriched by this visit to Australia, for I have noted the vast material and spiritual resources of a people who are hard-working, upright, frank, and loyal in their social, political and international relations." He was met by Governor-General Slim, Prime Minister Menzies, the heads of the branches of the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a>, the New South Wales Police Commissioner, and given a guard of honour by 100 soldiers before departing on a <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> Super Constellation requisitioned for his use. Edwards said of the trip: "Australia had now associated Diem's survival with its national interest, publicly and without restraint", something that eventually extended to military support against the Vietnamese communists.

Diem spent little time on detailed defence and policy discussions with Australian officials during the trip, because of his extensive meetings with Catholic leaders. Although Diem had signalled his intentions to discuss defence relations during the visit, these did not materialise. At the end of the visit, Diem and Menzies released a bilateral statement, announcing that they would increase the magnitude of the <a href="Colombo%20Plan">Colombo Plan</a>, a program under which Asian students could study abroad in Western nations. However, there was little detail in the announcements relating to anti-communism, with only general expressions of Australian support, including a pledge to increase the amount of non-military aid for the <a href="South%20Vietnamese%20Civil%20Guard">South Vietnamese Civil Guard</a> and civilian aid equipment. Diem had previously stated that if North Vietnam attacked the south, he would send the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> to land in the <a href="Red%20River%20Delta">Red River Delta</a> in the north and retaliate. This was contrary to the air attack plans of the <a href="South%20East%20Asian%20Treaty%20Organization">South East Asian Treaty Organization</a> (SEATO), which had vowed to defend the south under the provisions of the Manila Treaty. Despite the public statements of support, the Australian government never shared the details of the SEATO plans with Diem.

The Australian media wrote uniformly glowing reports that heaped praise on Diệm, and generally presented him as a courageous, selfless and wise leader. "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" described Diệm as "One of the most remarkable men in the new Asia ... authoritarian in approach but liberal in principle". "The Age" compared Diệm favourably to <a href="Chiang%20Kai-shek">Chiang Kai-shek</a> and <a href="Syngman%20Rhee">Syngman Rhee</a>, the Presidents of the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a> and South Korea respectively. The trio were the respective leaders of the anti-communist halves of the three countries in Asia that had been divided along communist and anti-communist lines. "The Age" opined that Diệm was not "morally equivocal" but "incorruptible and intensely patriotic" compared to his anti-communist counterparts, and "the type of Asian leader whose straight talk and courageous manner should be valued". The editorial also noted Diem's strong religious opinions and linked to his strident anti-communism and opposition to neutralism. It further acclaimed him as "incorruptible and patriotic" and that he had restored order to a chaotic country. "<a href="The%20Canberra%20Times">The Canberra Times</a>" noted that Diệm's visit coincided with that of Foreign Minister <a href="Richard%20Casey%2C%20Baron%20Casey">Richard Casey</a> to <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a> for that country's independence celebrations. Australia had supported Malaya's successful fight against communism and the newspaper compared the two countries, predicting that they would succeed because "the leaders owe their authority to popular support". Like the politicians, the press overlooked the negative aspects and reality of Diệm's rule, such as his authoritarianism. Although Diệm was depicted as being extremely popular and democratic, he had made himself president when his brother rigged a 1955 referendum that allowed him to depose Bảo Đại; Diệm was subsequently credited with 133% of the votes in <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>. Diệm's family regime routinely engaged in corruption, <a href="ballot%20stuffing">ballot stuffing</a> and arbitrary arrests of all opposition. The newspapers also failed to mention that the South Vietnamese economy was largely being propped up by the <a href="Commercial%20Import%20Program">Commercial Import Program</a> run by the United States and that <a href="land%20reform">land reform</a> had failed.
The mainstream media depicted Diệm as a friendly and charismatic leader who related well to the populace. The "<a href="Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">Herald</a>" showed photographs of the president eating cheese, and inspecting the foliage at the Botanic Gardens. Diệm was depicted making friends with a young boy from a <a href="Collingwood%2C%20Victoria">Collingwood</a> public housing estate and having tea with South Vietnamese students studying abroad at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a>, with the females wearing the traditional "<a href="ao%20dai">ao dai</a>". In contrast, Diệm was generally regarded as aloof and distant from the population, rarely heading outside the presidential palace to mingle with his people, and holding military processions in honour of his ascension to power in front of empty grandstands.

The strongest support for Diệm came from the Australian Catholic media. Diệm was a Catholic in a majority Buddhist country, and he had close religious links with the Vatican, who had helped him rise to power. He had stayed in a seminary run by Cardinal <a href="Francis%20Spellman">Francis Spellman</a> in the United States in the early 1950s before his elevation to power. Diệm's elder brother Archbishop <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Th%E1%BB%A5c">Ngô Đình Thục</a> was the leading Catholic figure in Vietnam and a classmate of Spellman when the pair studied in Rome. Spellman was widely regarded as the most powerful Catholic figure in the United States and he helped to organise support for Diệm among American politicians, particularly Catholics. In 1957, Diệm dedicated his country to the <a href="Virgin%20Mary">Virgin Mary</a> and ruled on the basis of a Catholic doctrine known as <a href="personalism">personalism</a>. His younger brother <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a> ran the secret and autocratic Catholic <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20Lao%20Party">Cần Lao Party</a> (Personalist Labor Party), which provided a clandestine network of support and police-state mechanisms to protect Diệm's rule. It counted many leading public servants and military officers among its members. Diệm also maintained land policies that were preferential to the Roman Catholic Church, the largest property owner in the country. Their holdings were exempt from redistribution under land reform schemes, while the construction of Buddhist temples was restricted; military and civil service promotions were given preferentially to Catholics. Some Catholic priests ran their own private armies and in some areas, forced conversions, looting, shelling and demolition of pagodas occurred.

The "<a href="Catholic%20Weekly">Catholic Weekly</a>" described Diệm as "his nation's saviour from Red onslaught ... an ardent patriot of great courage and moral integrity and an able intellectual". The paper also praised Diệm's Catholic links, pointing out that Thục was a former classmate of the current <a href="Catholic%20Bishops%20and%20Archbishops%20of%20Sydney">Archbishop of Sydney</a> <a href="Norman%20Thomas%20Gilroy">Norman Thomas Gilroy</a> when they studied at the Vatican.

Diệm's achievements and support for Catholics were particularly praised by <a href="Bob%20Santamaria">Bob Santamaria</a>, the unofficial leader and guiding influence of the <a href="Democratic%20Labor%20Party%20%28historical%29">Democratic Labor Party</a> (DLP). The DLP had broken away from the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Australian Labor Party</a> (ALP), the nation's main <a href="centre-left">centre-left</a> <a href="social%20democracy">social democratic</a> party. The split occurred in the 1950s during the <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> scares, as the Catholic factions broke away to form the DLP on the basis that the ALP was too lenient towards communists. One of the reasons that Menzies strongly backed Diệm was to gain further favour with the DLP and accentuate the divisions among his left wing opponents.

Diệm's visit prompted increased interest in Vietnam by Australian Catholics, particularly supporters of the DLP. Australian Catholics came to see South Vietnam as an anti-communist and Vatican stronghold in Asia and as a result, became strong supporters of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. <a href="Harold%20Lalor">Harold Lalor</a>, a Jesuit priest and leading confidant of Santamaria, had studied with Thục in Rome. During the trip, Diệm met with Gilroy, the first Australian cardinal, as well as Santamaria and <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Melbourne">Archbishop of Melbourne</a> <a href="Daniel%20Mannix">Daniel Mannix</a>, both of whom praised him strongly. Mannix was one of the most powerful men in Australia during the era, and had great political influence.

The positive reception accorded to Diem in 1957 contrasted with increasingly negative Australian attitudes towards Vietnam. Over time, the media in both Australia and the United States began to pay more attention to Diem's autocratic style and religious bias, especially after the eruption of the <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist crisis</a> in 1963, and the iconic self-immolation of <a href="Th%C3%ADch%20Qu%E1%BA%A3ng%20%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c">Thích Quảng Đức</a>. After six months of civil unrest, Diem was <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">deposed</a> and <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">assassinated</a> in November 1963, and by that time, little goodwill remained. With new leadership in Saigon, and an escalation in the war against the communists, Australia sent in ground troops—including conscripts—to support South Vietnam, but over time, the bipartisanship of the 1950s evaporated. The centre-left ALP became more sympathetic to the communists and Labor leader <a href="Arthur%20Calwell">Arthur Calwell</a> stridently denounced South Vietnamese Prime Minister <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Cao%20K%E1%BB%B3">Nguyễn Cao Kỳ</a> as a "fascist dictator" and a "butcher" ahead of his 1967 visit—at the time Ky was the chief of the <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Air%20Force">Republic of Vietnam Air Force</a> and headed a military junta. Despite the controversy leading up to the visit, Ky's trip was a success. He dealt with the media effectively, despite hostile sentiment from some sections of the press and public. However, with the war becoming increasing destructive, and the death toll rising, <a href="opposition%20to%20the%20Vietnam%20War">opposition to the Vietnam War</a> grew. In 1970, Labor leader <a href="Gough%20Whitlam">Gough Whitlam</a> posed with the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> flag, and his deputy <a href="Jim%20Cairns">Jim Cairns</a>, the chairman of the <a href="Vietnam%20Moratorium">Vietnam Moratorium</a> Committee, led large anti-war protests. Labor won the 1972 federal election on an anti-war platform, and Whitlam withdrew Australian troops and recognised <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>, which welcomed his electoral success. Whitlam later refused to accept South Vietnamese refugees following the <a href="fall%20of%20Saigon">fall of Saigon</a> to the communists in April 1975. The Liberals—led by <a href="Malcolm%20Fraser">Malcolm Fraser</a>—condemned Whitlam, and after <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201975">defeating Labor in December 1975</a>, allowed South Vietnamese refugees to <a href="Vietnamese%20Australian">settle in Australia in large numbers</a>.

Restoration of the Everglades

The restoration of the Everglades is an ongoing effort to remedy damage inflicted on the environment of southern <a href="Florida">Florida</a> during the 20th century. It is the most expensive and comprehensive environmental repair attempt in history. The degradation of the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a> became an issue in the United States in the early 1970s after a proposal to construct an <a href="airport">airport</a> in the Big Cypress Swamp. Studies indicated the airport would have destroyed the ecosystem in <a href="South%20Florida">South Florida</a> and <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a>. After decades of destructive practices, both state and federal agencies are looking for ways to balance the needs of the <a href="natural%20environment">natural environment</a> in South Florida with urban and agricultural centers that have recently and rapidly grown in and near the Everglades.

In response to floods caused by hurricanes in 1947, the <a href="Central%20and%20Southern%20Florida%20Flood%20Control%20Project">Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project</a> (C&SF) was established to construct flood control devices in the Everglades. The C&SF built of canals and levees between the 1950s and 1971 throughout South Florida. Their last venture was the C-38 canal, which straightened the <a href="Kissimmee%20River">Kissimmee River</a> and caused catastrophic damage to animal habitats, adversely affecting water quality in the region. The canal became the first C&SF project to revert when the canal began to be backfilled, or refilled with the material excavated from it, in the 1980s.

When high levels of <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> and <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29%23Occupational%20exposure">mercury</a> were discovered in the waterways in 1986, <a href="water%20quality">water quality</a> became a focus for water management agencies. Costly and lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to determine who was responsible for monitoring and enforcing water quality standards. Governor <a href="Lawton%20Chiles">Lawton Chiles</a> proposed a bill that determined which agencies would have that responsibility, and set deadlines for pollutant levels to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups for not being strict enough on polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. Since then, the <a href="South%20Florida%20Water%20Management%20District">South Florida Water Management District</a> (SFWMD) and the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> have surpassed expectations for achieving lower phosphorus levels.

A commission appointed by Governor Chiles published a report in 1995 stating that South Florida was unable to sustain its growth, and the deterioration of the environment was negatively affecting daily life for residents in South Florida. The environmental decline was predicted to harm tourism and commercial interests if no actions were taken to halt current trends. Results of an eight-year study that evaluated the C&SF were submitted to the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> in 1999. The report warned that if no action was taken the region would rapidly deteriorate. A strategy called the <a href="Comprehensive%20Everglades%20Restoration%20Plan">Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan</a> (CERP) was enacted to restore portions of the Everglades, <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>, the <a href="Caloosahatchee%20River">Caloosahatchee River</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a> to undo the damage of the past 50 years. It would take 30 years and cost $7.8 billion to complete. Though the plan was passed into law in 2000, it has been compromised by political and funding problems.

The Everglades are part of a very large <a href="drainage%20basin">watershed</a> that begins in the vicinity of <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando</a>. The Okeechobee River drains into <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>, a lake with an average depth of . During the wet season when the lake exceeds its capacity, the water leaves the lake in a very wide and shallow river, approximately long and wide. This wide and shallow flow is known as "sheetflow". The land gradually slopes toward Florida Bay, the historical destination of most of the water leaving the Everglades. Before drainage attempts, the Everglades comprised , taking up a third of the Florida peninsula.

Since the early 19th century the Everglades have been a subject of interest for agricultural development. The first attempt to drain the Everglades occurred in 1882 when a <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> land developer named <a href="Hamilton%20Disston">Hamilton Disston</a> constructed the first canals. Though these attempts were largely unsuccessful, Disston's purchase of land spurred tourism and real estate development of the state. The political motivations of Governor <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte%20Broward">Napoleon Bonaparte Broward</a> resulted in more successful attempts at canal construction between 1906 and 1920. Recently reclaimed <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s were used for cultivating <a href="sugarcane">sugarcane</a> and vegetables, while urban development began in the Everglades.

The <a href="1926%20Miami%20Hurricane">1926 Miami Hurricane</a> and the <a href="1928%20Okeechobee%20Hurricane">1928 Okeechobee Hurricane</a> caused widespread devastation and flooding which prompted the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> to construct a dike around Lake Okeechobee. The four-story wall cut off water from the Everglades. Floods from hurricanes in 1947 motivated the U.S. Congress to establish the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project (C&SF), responsible for constructing of canals and levees, hundreds of pumping stations and other water control devices. The C&SF established Water Conservation Areas (WCAs) in 37% of the original Everglades, which acted as reservoirs providing excess water to the <a href="South%20Florida%20metropolitan%20area">South Florida metropolitan area</a>, or flushing it into the Atlantic Ocean or the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. The C&SF also established the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), which grows the majority of sugarcane crops in the United States. When the EAA was first established, it encompassed approximately 27% of the original Everglades.

By the 1960s, urban development and agricultural use had decreased the size of the Everglades considerably. The remaining 25% of the Everglades in its original state is protected in <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a>, but the park was established before the C&SF, and it depended upon the actions of the C&SF to release water. As Miami and other metropolitan areas began to intrude on the Everglades in the 1960s, political battles took place between park management and the C&SF when insufficient water in the park threw ecosystems into chaos. Fertilizers used in the EAA began to alter soil and <a href="hydrology">hydrology</a> in Everglades National Park, causing the proliferation of exotic plant species. However, a proposition to build a massive jetport in the Big Cypress Swamp in 1969 focused attention on the degraded natural systems in the Everglades. For the first time, the Everglades became a subject of environmental conservation.

Environmental protection became a national priority in the 1970s. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine declared it the Issue of the Year in January 1971, reporting that it was rated as Americans' "most serious problem confronting their community—well ahead of crime, drugs and poor schools". When South Florida experienced a severe drought from 1970 to 1975, with Miami receiving only of rain in 1971— less than average—media attention focused on the Everglades. With the assistance of governor's aide Nathaniel Reed and <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> biologist <a href="Arthur%20R.%20Marshall">Arthur R. Marshall</a>, politicians began to take action. Governor <a href="Reubin%20Askew">Reubin Askew</a> implemented the Land Conservation Act in 1972, allowing the state to use voter-approved bonds of $240 million to purchase land considered to be environmentally unique and irreplaceable. Since then, Florida has purchased more land for public use than any other state. In 1972 President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> declared the Big Cypress Swamp—the intended location for the Miami jetport in 1969—to be federally protected. <a href="Big%20Cypress%20National%20Preserve">Big Cypress National Preserve</a> was established in 1974, and <a href="Fakahatchee%20Strand%20State%20Preserve">Fakahatchee Strand State Preserve</a> was created the same year.

In 1976, Everglades National Park was declared an <a href="International%20Biosphere%20Reserve">International Biosphere Reserve</a> by <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>, which also listed the park as a <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a> in 1979. The <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar Convention</a> designated the Everglades a Wetland of International Importance in 1987. Only three locations on earth which have appeared on all three lists: Everglades National Park, <a href="Lake%20Ichkeul">Lake Ichkeul</a> in <a href="Tunisia">Tunisia</a>, and <a href="Srebarna%20Nature%20Reserve">Srebarna Lake</a> in <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>.

In the 1960s, the C&SF came under increased scrutiny from government overseers and conservation groups. Critics maintained its size was comparable to the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley%20Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a>'s dam-building projects during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, and that the construction had run into the billions of dollars without any apparent resolution or plan. The projects of the C&SF have been characterized as part of "crisis and response" cycles that "ignored the consequence for the full system, assumed certainty of the future, and succeeded in solving the momentary crisis, but set in motion conditions that exaggerate future crises". The last project, to build a canal to straighten the winding floodplain of the Kissimmee River that had historically fed Lake Okeechobee which in turn fed the Everglades, began in 1962. <a href="Marjory%20Stoneman%20Douglas">Marjory Stoneman Douglas</a> later wrote that the C&SF projects were "interrelated stupidity", crowned by the C-38 canal. Designed to replace a meandering river with a channel, the canal was completed in 1971 and cost $29 million. It supplanted approximately of marshland with retention ponds, dams, and vegetation. Loss of habitat has caused the region to experience a drastic decrease of waterfowl, wading birds, and game fish. The reclaimed floodplains were taken over by agriculture, bringing fertilizers and insecticides that washed into Lake Okeechobee. Even before the canal was finished, conservation organizations and sport fishing and hunting groups were calling for the restoration of the Kissimmee River.
Arthur R. Marshall led the efforts to undo the damage. According to Douglas, Marshall was successful in portraying the Everglades from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes to <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a>—including the atmosphere, climate, and limestone—as a single organism. Rather than remaining the preserve of conservation organizations, the cause of restoring the Everglades became a priority for politicians. Douglas observed, "Marshall accomplished the extraordinary magic of taking the Everglades out of the bleeding-hearts category forever". At the insistent urging of Marshall, newly elected Governor <a href="Bob%20Graham">Bob Graham</a> announced the formation of the "Save Our Everglades" campaign in 1983, and in 1985 Graham lifted the first shovel of backfill for a portion of the C-38 canal. Within a year the area was covered with water returning to its original state. Graham declared that by the year 2000, the Everglades would resemble its predrainage state as much as possible. The Kissimmee River Restoration Project was approved by Congress in the <a href="Water%20Resources%20Development%20Act%20of%201992">Water Resources Development Act of 1992</a>. The project was estimated to cost $578 million to convert only of the canal; the cost was designed to be divided between the state of Florida and the U.S. government, with the state being responsible for purchasing land to be restored. A project manager for the Army Corps of Engineers explained in 2002, "What we're doing on this scale is going to be taken to a larger scale when we do the restoration of the Everglades". The entire project is estimated to be completed by 2011.

Attention to water quality was focused in South Florida in 1986 when a widespread <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a> occurred in one-fifth of Lake Okeechobee. The bloom was discovered to be the result of fertilizers from the Everglades Agricultural Area. Although laws stated in 1979 that the chemicals used in the EAA should not be deposited into the lake, they were flushed into the canals that fed the Everglades Water Conservation Areas, and eventually pumped into the lake. Microbiologists discovered that, although phosphorus assists plant growth, it destroys <a href="periphyton">periphyton</a>, one of the basic building blocks of <a href="marl">marl</a> in the Everglades. Marl is one of two types of Everglades soil, along with <a href="peat">peat</a>; it is found where parts of the Everglades are flooded for shorter periods of time as layers of periphyton dry. Most of the phosphorus compounds also rid peat of dissolved oxygen and promote algae growth, causing native invertebrates to die, and sawgrass to be replaced with invasive <a href="Typha">cattails</a> that grow too tall and thick for birds and alligators to nest in. Tested water showed 500 parts per billion (ppb) of phosphorus near sugarcane fields. State legislation in 1987 mandated a 40% reduction of <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> by 1992.

Attempts to correct phosphorus levels in the Everglades met with resistance. The sugarcane industry, dominated by two companies named <a href="US%20Sugar%20Corporation">U.S. Sugar</a> and <a href="Flo-Sun">Flo-Sun</a>, was responsible for more than half of the crop in the EAA. They were well represented in state and federal governments by <a href="lobbyist">lobbyist</a>s who enthusiastically protected their interests. According to the Audubon Society, the sugar industry, nicknamed "Big Sugar", donated more money to political parties and candidates than <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a>. The sugar industry attempted to block government-funded studies of polluted water, and when the federal prosecutor in Miami faulted the sugar industry in legal action to protect Everglades National Park, Big Sugar tried to get the lawsuit withdrawn and the prosecutor fired. A costly legal battle ensued from 1988 to 1992 between the State of Florida, the U.S. government, and the sugar industry to resolve who was responsible for water quality standards, the maintenance of Everglades National Park and the <a href="Arthur%20R.%20Marshall%20Loxahatchee%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge</a>.

A different concern about water quality arose when <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29%23Occupational%20exposure">mercury</a> was discovered in fish during the 1980s. Because mercury is damaging to humans, warnings were posted for fishermen that cautioned against eating fish caught in South Florida, and scientists became alarmed when a <a href="Florida%20panther">Florida panther</a> was found dead near Shark River Slough with mercury levels high enough to be fatal to humans. When mercury is ingested it adversely affects the central nervous system, and can cause brain damage and birth defects. Studies of mercury levels found that it is <a href="bioaccumulate">bioaccumulate</a>d through the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>: animals that are lower on the chain have decreased amounts, but as larger animals eat them, the amount of mercury is multiplied. The dead panther's diet consisted of small animals, including <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a>s and young alligators. The source of the mercury was found to be waste incinerators and <a href="fossil%20fuel">fossil fuel</a> power plants that expelled the element in the atmosphere, which precipitated with rain, or in the dry season, dust. Naturally occurring bacteria in the Everglades that function to reduce <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a> also transform mercury deposits into <a href="methylmercury">methylmercury</a>. This process was more dramatic in areas where flooding was not as prevalent. Because of <a href="US%20emission%20standard">requirements</a> that reduced power plant and incinerator emissions, the levels of mercury found in larger animals decreased as well: approximately a 60% decrease in fish and a 70% decrease in birds, though some levels still remain a health concern for people.

In an attempt to resolve the political quagmire over water quality, Governor <a href="Lawton%20Chiles">Lawton Chiles</a> introduced a bill in 1994 to clean up water within the EAA that was being released to the lower Everglades. The bill stated that the "Everglades ecosystem must be restored both in terms of water quality and water quantity and must be preserved and protected in a manner that is long term and comprehensive". It ensured the <a href="Florida%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Protection">Florida Department of Environmental Protection</a> (DEP) and the <a href="South%20Florida%20Water%20Management%20District">South Florida Water Management District</a> (SFWMD) would be responsible for researching water quality, enforcing water supply improvement, controlling exotic species, and collecting taxes, with the aim of decreasing the levels of phosphorus in the region. It allowed for purchase of land where pollutants would be sent to "treat and improve the quality of waters coming from the EAA".

Critics of the bill argued that the deadline for meeting the standards was unnecessarily delayed until 2006—a period of 12 years—to enforce better water quality. They also maintained that it did not force sugarcane farmers, who were the primary polluters, to pay enough of the costs, and increased the threshold of what was an acceptable amount of phosphorus in water from 10 ppb to 50 ppb. Governor Chiles initially named it the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Act, but Douglas was so unimpressed with the action it took against polluters that she wrote to Chiles and demanded her name be stricken from it. Despite criticism, the Florida legislature passed the Act in 1994. The SFWMD stated that its actions have exceeded expectations earlier than anticipated, by creating Stormwater Treatment Areas (STA) within the EAA that contain a calcium-based substance such as lime rock layered between peat, and filled with <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> periphyton. Early tests by the Army Corps of Engineers revealed this method reduced phosphorus levels from 80 ppb to 10 ppb. The STAs are intended to treat water until the phosphorus levels are low enough to be released into the Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge or other WCAs.

The intrusion of urban areas into wilderness has had a substantial impact on wildlife, and several species of animals are considered endangered in the Everglades region. One animal that has benefited from endangered species protection is the American Alligator ("<a href="Alligator%20mississippiensis">Alligator mississippiensis</a>"), whose holes give refuge to other animals, often allowing many species to survive during times of drought. Once abundant in the Everglades, the alligator was listed as an endangered species in 1967, but a combined effort by federal and state organizations and the banning of alligator <a href="hunting">hunting</a> allowed it to rebound; it was pronounced fully recovered in 1987 and is no longer an endangered species. However, alligators' territories and average body masses have been found to be generally smaller than in the past, and because populations have been reduced, their role during droughts has become limited.

The American Crocodile ("<a href="Crocodylus%20acutus">Crocodylus acutus</a>") is also native to the region and has been designated as endangered since 1975. Unlike their relatives the alligators, crocodiles tend to thrive in brackish or salt-water habitats such as <a href="estuarine">estuarine</a> or marine coasts. Their most significant threat is disturbance by people. Too much contact with humans causes females to abandon their nests, and males in particular are often victims of vehicle collisions while roaming over large territories and attempting to cross <a href="U.S.%20Route%201%20in%20Florida">U.S. 1</a> and Card Sound Road in the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>. There are an estimated 500 to 1,000 crocodiles in southern Florida.
The most <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> of any animal in the Everglades region is the Florida panther ("<a href="Puma%20concolor%20coryi">Puma concolor coryi</a>"), a species that once lived throughout the southeastern United States: there were only 25–30 in the wild in 1995. The panther is most threatened by urban encroachment, because males require approximately for breeding territory. A male and two to five females may live within that range. When habitat is lost, panthers will fight over territory. After vehicle collisions, the second most frequent cause of death for panthers is intra-species aggression. In the 1990s urban expansion crowded panthers from southwestern Florida as <a href="Naples%2C%20Florida">Naples</a> and <a href="Ft.%20Myers%2C%20Florida">Ft. Myers</a> began to expand into the western Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp. Agencies such as the Army Corps of Engineers and the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> were responsible for maintaining the <a href="Clean%20Water%20Act">Clean Water Act</a> and the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>, yet still approved 99% of all permits to build in wetlands and panther territory. A limited genetic pool is also a danger. Biologists introduced eight female Texas cougars ("<a href="Puma%20concolor">Puma concolor</a>") in 1995 to diversify genes, and there are between 80 and 120 panthers in the wild .

Perhaps the most dramatic loss of any group of animals has been to <a href="Wader">wading birds</a>. Their numbers were estimated by eyewitness accounts to be approximately 2.5 million in the late 19th century. However, snowy egrets ("<a href="Egretta%20thula">Egretta thula</a>"), roseate spoonbills ("<a href="Platalea%20ajaja">Platalea ajaja</a>"), and reddish egrets ("<a href="Egretta%20rufescens">Egretta rufescens</a>") were hunted to the brink of extinction for the colorful feathers used in women's hats. After about 1920 when the fashion passed, their numbers returned in the 1930s, but over the next 50 years actions by the C&SF further disturbed populations. When the canals were constructed, natural water flow was restricted from the mangrove forests near the coast of Florida Bay. From one wet season to the next, fish were unable to reach traditional locations to repopulate when water was withheld by the C&SF. Birds were forced to fly farther from their nests to forage for food. By the 1970s, bird numbers had decreased 90%. Many of the birds moved to smaller colonies in the WCAs to be closer to a food source, making them more difficult to count. Yet they remain significantly fewer in number than before the canals were constructed.

Around 6 million people moved to South Florida between 1940 and 1965. With a thousand people moving to Miami each week, urban development quadrupled. As the human population grew rapidly, the problem of exotic plant and animal species also grew. Many species of plants were brought into South Florida from <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>, or <a href="Australia">Australia</a> as decorative landscaping. Exotic animals imported by the pet trade have escaped or been released. Biological controls that keep invasive species smaller in size and fewer in number in their native lands often do not exist in the Everglades, and they compete with the embattled native species for food and space. Of imported plant species, melaleuca trees ("<a href="Melaleuca%20quinquenervia">Melaleuca quinquenervia</a>") have caused the most problems. Melaleucas grow on average in the Everglades, as opposed to in their native Australia. They were brought to southern Florida as <a href="windbreak">windbreak</a>s and deliberately seeded in marsh areas because they absorb vast amounts of water. In a region that is regularly shaped by fire, melaleucas are fire-resistant and their seeds are more efficiently spread by fire. They are too dense for wading birds with large wingspans to nest in, and they choke out native vegetation. Costs of controlling melaleucas topped $2 million in 1998 for Everglades National Park. In Big Cypress National Preserve, melaleucas covered at their most pervasive in the 1990s.
Brazilian pepper ("<a href="Schinus%20terebinthifolius">Schinus terebinthifolius</a>") was brought to Southern Florida as an ornamental shrub and was dispersed by the droppings of birds and other animals that ate its bright red berries. It thrives on abandoned agricultural land growing in forests too dense for wading birds to nest in, similar to melaleucas. It grows rapidly especially after <a href="tropical%20cyclone">hurricanes</a> and has invaded pineland forests. Following <a href="Hurricane%20Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a>, scientists and volunteers cleared damaged pinelands of Brazilian pepper so the native trees would be able to return to their natural state.

The species that is causing the most impediment to restoration is the Old World climbing fern ("<a href="Lygodium%20microphyllum">Lygodium microphyllum</a>"), introduced in 1965. The fern grows rapidly and thickly on the ground, making passage for land animals such as black bears and panthers problematic. The ferns also grow as vines into taller portions of trees, and fires climb the ferns in "fire ladders" to scorch portions of the trees that are not naturally resistant to fire.

Several animal species have been introduced to Everglades waterways. Many tropical fish are released, the most detrimental being the blue tilapia ("<a href="Oreochromis%20aureus">Oreochromis aureus</a>"), which builds large nests in shallow waters. Tilapia also consume vegetation which would normally be used by young native fishes for cover and protection.

Reptiles have a particular affinity for the South Florida ecosystem. Virtually all lizards appearing in the Everglades have been introduced, such as the brown anole ("<a href="Anolis%20sagrei">Anolis sagrei</a>") and the tropical house gecko ("<a href="Hemidactylus%20mabouia">Hemidactylus mabouia</a>"). The <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> green iguana ("<a href="Iguana%20iguana">Iguana iguana</a>") can reproduce rapidly in wilderness habitats. However, the reptile that has earned media attention for its size and potential to harm children and domestic pets is the Burmese python ("<a href="Python%20bivittatus">Python bivittatus</a>"), which has spread quickly throughout the area. The python can grow up to long and competes with alligators for the top of the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>.

Though exotic birds such as parrots and parakeets are also found in the Everglades, their impact is negligible. Conversely, perhaps the animal that causes the most damage to native wildlife is the domestic or feral cat. Across the U.S., cats are responsible for approximately a billion bird deaths annually. They are estimated to number 640 per square mile; cats living in suburban areas have devastating effects on migratory birds and marsh rabbits.

<a href="Hurricane%20Andrew">Hurricane Andrew</a> struck Miami in 1992, with catastrophic damage to <a href="Homestead%20Air%20Force%20Base">Homestead Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Homestead%2C%20Florida">Homestead</a>. A plan to rejuvenate the property in 1993 and convert it into a commercial airport was met with enthusiasm from local municipal and commercial entities hoping to recoup $480 million and 11,000 jobs lost in the local community by the destruction and subsequent closing of the base. On March 31, 1994, the base was designated as a <a href="Military%20reserves">reserve</a> base, functioning only part-time. A cursory environmental study performed by the Air Force was deemed insufficient by local conservation groups, who threatened to sue in order to halt the acquisition when estimates of 650 flights a day were projected. Groups had previously been alarmed in 1990 by the inclusion of Homestead Air Force Base on a list of the U.S. Government's most polluted properties. Their concerns also included noise, and the inevitable collisions with birds using the mangrove forests as rookeries. The Air Force base is located between Everglades National Park and <a href="Biscayne%20National%20Park">Biscayne National Park</a>, giving it the potential to cause harm to both. In 2000, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of the Interior</a> <a href="Bruce%20Babbitt">Bruce Babbitt</a> and the director of the <a href="U.S.%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> expressed their opposition to the project, despite other <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Clinton Administration</a> agencies previously working to ensure the base would be turned over to local agencies quickly and smoothly as "a model of base disposal".
Although attempts were made to make the base more environmentally friendly, in 2001 local commercial interests promoting the airport lost federal support.

Despite the successes of the Everglades Forever Act and the decreases in mercury levels, the focus intensified on the Everglades in the 1990s as quality of life in the South Florida metropolitan areas diminished. It was becoming clear that urban populations were consuming increasingly unsustainable levels of natural resources. A report entitled "The Governor's Commission for a Sustainable South Florida", submitted to Lawton Chiles in 1995, identified the problems the state and municipal governments were facing. The report remarked that the degradation of the natural quality of the Everglades, Florida Bay, and other bodies of water in South Florida would cause a significant decrease in tourism (12,000 jobs and $200 million annually) and income from compromised commercial fishing (3,300 jobs and $52 million annually). The report noted that past abuses and neglect of the environment had brought the region to "a precipitous juncture" where the inhabitants of South Florida faced health hazards in polluted air and water; furthermore, crowded and unsafe urban conditions hurt the reputation of the state. It noted that though the population had increased by 90% over the previous two decades, registered vehicles had increased by 166%. On the quality and availability of water, the report stated, "[The] frequent water shortages ... create the irony of a natural system dying of thirst in a subtropical environment with over 53 inches of rain per year".

Restoration of the Everglades, however, briefly became a <a href="bipartisan">bipartisan</a> cause in national politics. A controversial penny-a-pound (2 cent/kg) tax on sugar was proposed to fund some of the necessary changes to be made to help decrease phosphorus and make other improvements to water. State voters were asked to support the tax, and environmentalists paid $15 million to encourage the issue. Sugar lobbyists responded with $24 million in advertising to discourage it and succeeded; it became the most expensive ballot issue in state history. How restoration might be funded became a political battleground and seemed to stall without resolution. However, in the 1996 election year, <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> senator <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a> proposed that Congress give the State of Florida $200 million to acquire land for the Everglades. <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> Vice President <a href="Al%20Gore">Al Gore</a> promised the federal government would purchase of land in the EAA to turn it over for restoration. Politicking reduced the number to , but both Dole's and Gore's gestures were approved by Congress.

As part of the Water Resources Development Act of 1992, Congress authorized an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project. A report known as the "Restudy", written by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District, was submitted to Congress in 1999. It cited indicators of harm to the system: a 50% reduction in the original Everglades, diminished water storage, harmful timing of water release, an 85 to 90% decrease in wading bird populations over the past 50 years, and the decline of output from commercial fisheries. Bodies of water including <a href="Lake%20Okeechobee">Lake Okeechobee</a>, the <a href="Caloosahatchee%20River">Caloosahatchee River</a>, <a href="St.%20Lucie%20River">St. Lucie</a> estuary, <a href="Lake%20Worth%20Lagoon">Lake Worth Lagoon</a>, <a href="Biscayne%20Bay">Biscayne Bay</a>, <a href="Florida%20Bay">Florida Bay</a>, and the Everglades reflected drastic water level changes, <a href="salinity">hypersalinity</a>, and dramatic changes in marine and freshwater ecosystems. The Restudy noted the overall decline in water quality over the past 50 years was caused by loss of wetlands that act as filters for polluted water. It predicted that without intervention the entire South Florida ecosystem would deteriorate. Canals took roughly of water to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico daily, so there was no opportunity for water storage, yet flooding was still a problem. Without changes to the current system, the Restudy predicted <a href="water%20restriction">water restriction</a>s would be necessary every other year, and annually in some locations. It also warned that revising some portions of the project without dedicating efforts to an overall comprehensive plan would be insufficient and probably detrimental.

After evaluating ten plans, the Restudy recommended a comprehensive strategy that would cost $7.8 billion over 20 years. The plan advised taking the following actions:

The implementation of all of the advised actions, the report stated, would "result in the recovery of healthy, sustainable ecosystems throughout south Florida". The report admitted that it did not have all the answers, though no plan could. However, it predicted that it would restore the "essential defining features of the pre-drainage wetlands over large portions of the remaining system", that populations of all animals would increase, and animal distribution patterns would return to their natural states. Critics expressed concern over some unused technology; scientists were unsure if the quarries would hold as much water as was being suggested, and whether the water would harbor harmful bacteria from the quarries. Overtaxing the aquifers was another concern—it was not a technique that had been previously attempted.

Though it was optimistic, the Restudy noted, It is important to understand that the 'restored' Everglades of the future will be different from any version of the Everglades that has existed in the past. While it certainly will be vastly superior to the current ecosystem, it will not completely match the pre-drainage system. This is not possible, in light of the irreversible physical changes that have made ("sic") to the ecosystem. It will be an Everglades that is smaller and somewhat differently arranged than the historic ecosystem. But it will be a successfully restored Everglades, because it will have recovered those hydrological and biological patterns which defined the original Everglades, and which made it unique among the world's wetland systems. It will become a place that kindles the wildness and richness of the former Everglades.

The report was the result of many cooperating agencies that often had conflicting goals. An initial draft was submitted to Everglades National Park management who asserted not enough water would be released to the park quickly enough—that the priority went to delivering water to urban areas. When they threatened to refuse to support it, the plan was rewritten to provide more water to the park. However, the <a href="Miccosukee">Miccosukee</a> Indians have a reservation in between the park and water control devices, and they threatened to sue to ensure their tribal lands and a $50 million casino would not be flooded. Other special interests were also concerned that businesses and residents would take second priority after nature. The Everglades, however, proved to be a bipartisan cause. The <a href="Comprehensive%20Everglades%20Restoration%20Plan">Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan</a> (CERP) was authorized by the <a href="Water%20Resources%20Development%20Act%20of%202000">Water Resources Development Act of 2000</a> and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000. It approved the immediate use of $1.3 billion for implementation to be split by the federal government and other sources.

The State of Florida reports that it has spent more than $2 billion on the various projects since CERP was signed. More than of Stormwater Treatment Areas (STA) have been constructed to filter of phosphorus from Everglades waters. An STA covering was constructed in 2004, making it the largest manmade wetland in the world. Fifty-five percent of the land necessary for restoration, totaling , has been purchased by the State of Florida. A plan named "Acceler8", to hasten the construction and funding of the project, was put into place, spurring the start of six of eight construction projects, including that of three large reservoirs.

Despite the bipartisan goodwill and declarations of the importance of the Everglades, the region still remains in danger. Political maneuvering continues to impede CERP: sugar lobbyists promoted a bill in the Florida legislature in 2003 that increased the acceptable amount of phosphorus in Everglades waterways from 10 ppb to 15 ppb and extended the deadline for the mandated decrease by 20 years. A compromise of 2016 was eventually reached. Environmental organizations express concern that attempts to speed up some of the construction through Acceler8 are politically motivated; the six projects Acceler8 focuses on do not provide more water to natural areas in desperate need of it, but rather to projects in populated areas bordering the Everglades, suggesting that water is being diverted to make room for more people in an already overtaxed environment. Though Congress promised half the funds for restoration, after the <a href="War%20in%20Iraq">War in Iraq</a> began and two of CERP's major supporters in Congress retired, the federal role in CERP was left unfulfilled. According to a story in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", state officials say the restoration is lost in a maze of "federal bureaucracy, a victim of '<a href="analysis%20paralysis">analysis paralysis</a>' ". In 2007, the release of $2 billion for Everglades restoration was approved by Congress, overriding President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>'s veto of the entire Water Development Project the money was a part of. Bush's rare veto went against the wishes of Florida Republicans, including his brother, Governor <a href="Jeb%20Bush">Jeb Bush</a>. A lack of subsequent action by the Congress prompted Governor <a href="Charlie%20Crist">Charlie Crist</a> to travel to <a href="Washington%20D.C.">Washington D.C.</a> in February 2008 and inquire about the promised funds. By June 2008, the federal government had spent only $400 million of the $7.8 billion legislated. <a href="Carl%20Hiaasen">Carl Hiaasen</a> characterized George W. Bush's attitude toward the environment as "long-standing indifference" in June 2008, exemplified when Bush stated he would not intervene to change the <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a>'s (EPA) policy allowing the release of water polluted with fertilizers and phosphorus into the Everglades.

Florida still receives a thousand new residents daily and lands slated for restoration and wetland recovery are often bought and sold before the state has a chance to bid on them. The competitive pricing of real estate also drives it beyond the purchasing ability of the state.  Because the State of Florida is assisting with purchasing lands and funding construction, some of the programs under CERP are vulnerable to state budget cuts. In June 2008 Governor Crist announced that the State of Florida will buy <a href="US%20Sugar%20Corporation">U.S. Sugar</a> for $1.7 billion. The idea came when sugar lobbyists were trying to persuade Crist to relax restriction of U.S. Sugar's practice of pumping phosphorus-laden water into the Everglades. According to one of the lobbyists who characterized it as a "duh moment", Crist said, "If sugar is polluting the Everglades, and we're paying to clean the Everglades, why don't we just get rid of sugar?" The largest producer of cane sugar in the U.S. will continue operations for six years, and when ownership transfers to Florida, of the Everglades will remain undeveloped to allow it to be restored to its pre-drainage state.

In September 2008 the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Research%20Council">National Research Council</a> (NRC), a nonprofit agency providing science and policy advice to the federal government, submitted a report on the progress of CERP. The report noted "scant progress" in restoration because of problems in budgeting, planning, and bureaucracy. The NRC report called the Everglades one of the "world's treasured ecosystems" that is being further endangered by lack of progress: "Ongoing delay in Everglades restoration has not only postponed improvements—it has allowed ecological decline to continue". It cited the shrinking <a href="Geography%20and%20ecology%20of%20the%20Everglades%23Tropical%20hardwood%20hammock">tree islands</a>, and the negative population growth of the endangered "<a href="Rostrhamus%20sociabilis">Rostrhamus sociabilis</a>" or Everglades snail kite, and "<a href="Ammodramus%20maritimus%20mirabilis">Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis</a>", the Cape Sable seaside sparrow. The lack of water reaching Everglades National Park was characterized as "one of the most discouraging stories" in implementation of the plan. The NRC recommended improving planning on the state and federal levels, evaluating each CERP project annually, and further acquisition of land for restoration. Everglades restoration was earmarked $96 million in federal funds as part of the <a href="American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act%20of%202009">American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a> with the intention of providing civil service and construction jobs while simultaneously implementing the legislated repair projects.

In January 2010, work began on the C-111 canal, built in the 1960s to drain irrigated farmland, to reconstruct it to keep from diverting water from Everglades National Park. Two other projects focusing on restoration were also scheduled to start in 2010. Governor Crist announced the same month that $50 million would be earmarked for Everglades restoration. In April of the same year, a federal district court judge sharply criticized both state and federal failures to meet deadlines, describing the cleanup efforts as being slowed by "glacial delay" and government neglect of environmental law enforcement "incomprehensible".

Columbia Slough

The Columbia Slough is a narrow waterway, about long, in the <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a> of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>. From its source in the <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland</a> suburb of <a href="Fairview%2C%20Oregon">Fairview</a>, the Columbia Slough meanders west through <a href="Gresham%2C%20Oregon">Gresham</a> and Portland to the <a href="Willamette%20River">Willamette River</a>, about from the Willamette's confluence with the Columbia. It is a remnant of the historic <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s between the mouths of the <a href="Sandy%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Sandy River</a> to the east and the Willamette River to the west. <a href="Levee">Levee</a>s surround much of the main <a href="Slough%20%28hydrology%29">slough</a> as well as many side sloughs, detached sloughs, and nearby lakes. <a href="Drainage%20district">Drainage district</a> employees control <a href="Fluid%20dynamics">water flows</a> with <a href="pumps">pumps</a> and <a href="floodgates">floodgates</a>. <a href="Tide">Tidal</a> fluctuations cause reverse flow on the lower slough.

The Columbia floodplain, formed by geologic processes including lava flows, volcanic eruptions, and the <a href="Missoula%20Floods">Missoula Floods</a>, is part of the <a href="Portland%20Basin%20%28geology%29">Portland Basin</a>, which extends across the Columbia River from <a href="Multnomah%20County%2C%20Oregon">Multnomah County, Oregon</a>, into <a href="Clark%20County%2C%20Washington">Clark County, Washington</a>. Five percent of Oregon's population, about 158,000 people, live in the slough <a href="drainage%20basin">watershed</a> of about . Municipal wells near the upper slough provide supplemental drinking water to Portland and nearby cities. The cities, the drainage districts, the county, and a regional government, <a href="Metro%20%28Oregon%20regional%20government%29">Metro</a>, have overlapping jurisdictions in the watershed. A regional agency operates <a href="Portland%20International%20Airport">Portland International Airport</a> along the middle slough and marine terminals near the lower slough. The <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a> (DEQ) and the city's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) deal with environmental issues.

Long before non-<a href="Indigenous%20peoples">indigenous people</a> explored the region, tribes of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> fished and hunted along the slough. In the early 19th century fur trappers and explorers including <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark</a> visited the area before large migrations of settlers began arriving from the east. The newcomers farmed, cut timber, built houses, and by the early 20th century established cities, shipping ports, roads, rail lines and industries near the slough. Increased investment in the floodplain led to larger losses during floods, and these losses prompted levee building that greatly altered the area. A flood pouring through a levee break in 1948 destroyed the city of <a href="Vanport%20City%2C%20Oregon">Vanport</a>, which was never rebuilt.

Used as a waste repository during the first half of the 20th century and cut off from the Columbia River by levees, the slough became one of Oregon's most <a href="water%20pollution">polluted</a> waterways. Early attempts to mitigate the pollution, which included raw sewage and <a href="industrial%20waste">industrial waste</a>, were unsuccessful. However, in 1952 Portland began sewage treatment, and over the next six decades the federal <a href="Clean%20Water%20Act">Clean Water Act</a> and similar legislation mandated further cleanup. State and local governments, often assisted by community volunteers, undertook projects related to public health, natural resources, and recreation in a region with many homes, industries, businesses, and roads. The businesses and industries in the watershed employ about 57,000 people, which is also frequented by more than 150 bird species and 26 fish species and animals including <a href="North%20American%20River%20Otter">otters</a>, <a href="beaver">beaver</a>, and <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s. One of the nation's largest freshwater urban wetlands, <a href="Smith%20and%20Bybee%20Wetlands%20Natural%20Area">Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area</a>, shares the lower slough watershed with a sewage treatment plant, marine terminals, a golf course, and a car racetrack. Watercraft able to portage over <a href="culvert">culvert</a>s and levees can travel the entire length of the slough. The <a href="40-Mile%20Loop">40-Mile Loop</a> and other hiking and biking trails follow the waterways and connect the parks.

"Slough" usually rhymes with "shoe" in the U.S. except in New England, where it usually rhymes with "now", the preferred British pronunciation. "Slough" may mean a place of deep mud or <a href="bog">mire</a>, a swamp, a river <a href="inlet">inlet</a> or backwater, or a creek in a <a href="marsh">marsh</a> or <a href="mudflat">tide flat</a>. The Columbia Slough is classified as a "stream" in the <a href="Geographic%20Names%20Information%20System">Geographic Names Information System</a> (GNIS) of the <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> (USGS). The slough takes its name from the Columbia River, of which it was historically a side channel or <a href="anabranch">anabranch</a>. <a href="Robert%20Gray%20%28sea%20captain%29">Robert Gray</a>, a Boston fur trader and whaler who sailed partway up the Columbia River in 1792, named the river after his ship, "<a href="Columbia%20Rediviva">Columbia Rediviva</a>". The Columbia part of the ship's name belonged to the tradition of naming things after explorer <a href="Christopher%20Columbus">Christopher Columbus</a>.

The Columbia Slough flows roughly parallel to and about south of the Columbia River in Multnomah County. It begins at Fairview Lake in the city of Fairview and immediately enters the city of Gresham. Less than later, it enters the city of Portland and continues generally westward for about another to its confluence with the Willamette River. Throughout its course, the slough is nearly level, above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> at the source and at the mouth. <a href="Semidiurnal%20tides">Semidiurnal tides</a> cause reverse currents on the lower of the slough.

Running slightly north of and parallel to <a href="U.S.%20Route%2030%20in%20Oregon">U.S. Route 30</a> (Sandy Boulevard), the slough flows by <a href="Jacob%20Zimmerman%20House">Zimmerman Heritage Farm</a> on the <a href="wikt%3Aleft%20bank">left bank</a> (south) about from the mouth, Big Four Corners Wetlands on the <a href="wikt%3Aright%20bank">right bank</a> shortly thereafter, and receives Wilkes Creek on the left shortly after that. At about <a href="river%20mile">river mile</a> (RM) 15.5 or river kilometer (RK) 24.9, it passes through a gated levee that separates the upper slough from the middle slough. Soon it passes Prison Pond Wetlands near Inverness Jail and connects to Johnson Lake Slough, all on the left. Shortly thereafter, it flows under <a href="Interstate%20205%20%28Oregon-Washington%29">Interstate 205</a>. From here and for most of the rest of its course, the slough runs parallel to and slightly north of Columbia Boulevard. Passing Johnson Lake on the left, it crosses the Colwood National Golf Course and flows by Portland International Airport and an <a href="Oregon%20Air%20National%20Guard">Oregon Air National Guard</a> base on the right. On the left is Whitaker Ponds Natural Area. Shortly thereafter, it receives Whitaker Slough on the left and crosses the Broadmoor Golf Course. Between from the mouth, it receives Buffalo Slough from the left and passes by the defunct Peninsula Drainage Canal (City Canal), which lies to the slough's right. At this point, it passes through a second gated levee that separates the middle slough from the lower slough and its tidal flow reversals.

In the next stretch, the Columbia Slough flows by <a href="Portland%20Meadows">Portland Meadows</a> horse racing track on the right and crosses under <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20Oregon">Interstate 5</a> at about RM 7 (RK 11). Beyond the interstate, to the slough's north lies <a href="Delta%20Park">Delta Park</a>, <a href="Portland%20International%20Raceway">Portland International Raceway</a>, and the Heron Lakes Golf Course. Until flooding destroyed it in 1948, the city of Vanport occupied this site. To the south is the Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant.

The slough flows through the Wapato Wetland and by the Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, including the former St. Johns Landfill, on the right at about RM 3 (RK 4.8) from the Willamette River, and by Pier Park on the left. Shortly thereafter, it turns sharply north for the rest of its course. It receives North Slough, connected to Bybee Lake, on the right, and passes through the Ramsey Lake Wetlands and <a href="Kelley%20Point%20Park">Kelley Point Park</a> before entering the Willamette River about from its confluence with the Columbia River. The mouth of the Columbia River is about further downstream at <a href="Astoria%2C%20Oregon">Astoria</a> on the Pacific Ocean.

Since 1989, the USGS has monitored the flow of the Columbia Slough at a <a href="stream%20gauge">stream gauge</a> from the mouth. The average flow recorded at this gauge is from a drainage area of undetermined size. The maximum flow was on December 5, 1995, and the minimum flow (biggest reverse flow) was −6,700 cubic feet per second (−190 m/s) on February 7, 1996, which coincided with a <a href="Willamette%20Valley%20Flood%20of%201996">flood</a> on the Columbia and Willamette rivers.

Draining about , the Columbia Slough watershed lies in the <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a> of the Columbia River between the <a href="River%20delta">mouths</a> of the <a href="Sandy%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Sandy River</a> to the east and the Willamette River. Parts of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, <a href="Maywood%20Park%2C%20Oregon">Maywood Park</a>, <a href="Wood%20Village%2C%20Oregon">Wood Village</a>, and <a href="unincorporated%20area">unincorporated</a> Multnomah County lie within the <a href="drainage%20basin">drainage basin</a> (watershed). As of 2005, about 158,000 people, 5 percent of Oregon's population, lived in the basin.

The watershed includes residential neighborhoods, agriculture, the airport, open spaces, 54 schools, interstate highways, railways, commercial businesses, and heavy and light industry. In general, the northern part is industrial and commercial; the southern part is residential, and agricultural areas lie to the east. As of 2001, single-family residential <a href="zoning">zones</a> covered 33 percent of the watershed, and mixed-use zones accounted for another 33 percent. The other zones were 12 percent industrial, 12 percent parks or open space; 6 percent <a href="multi-family%20residential">multi-family residential</a>, 3 percent commercial, and 2 percent were for farming or forests. As of 2005, about 3,900 businesses operated in the watershed and employed about 57,000 people.

Adjacent to the Columbia Slough basin are the watersheds of the Sandy River to the east, <a href="Johnson%20Creek%20%28Willamette%20River%29">Johnson Creek</a> to the south, the Willamette to the south and west, and the Columbia to the north. Lying slightly north of the watershed, large islands in the Columbia River include, from east to west, McGuire Island, <a href="Government%20Island%20%28Oregon%29">Government Island</a>, Lemon Island, and Tomahawk Island, which is connected to <a href="Hayden%20Island%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Hayden Island</a>. Bordered by the Columbia and two arms of the Willamette, <a href="Sauvie%20Island">Sauvie Island</a> lies just west of the mouth of the slough.

Many governmental entities share responsibility for the slough and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, and the government of Multnomah County affect the slough. <a href="Metro%20%28Oregon%20regional%20government%29">Metro</a>, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the <a href="Portland%20metropolitan%20area">Portland metropolitan area</a>, is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat in places like Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40-Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the slough. The <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">United States Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) has designated the <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a> (DEQ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal <a href="Clean%20Water%20Act">Clean Water Act</a>. The <a href="Port%20of%20Portland%20%28Oregon%29">Port of Portland</a>, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11 percent of the land in the slough watershed. Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the slough floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions.

In 2015, Portland's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) began issuing annual "report cards" for watersheds or fractions thereof that lie within the city. BES assigns grades for each of four categories: hydrology, water quality, habitat, and fish and wildlife. Hydrology grades depend on the amount of pavement and other <a href="impervious%20surface">impervious surface</a>s in the watershed and to what degree its streams flow freely, not dammed or diverted. Water-quality grades are based on measurements of <a href="Oxygen%20saturation">dissolved oxygen</a>, "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">E-coli</a>" bacteria, temperature, <a href="suspended%20solid">suspended solid</a>s, and substances such as mercury and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>. Habitat ranking depends on the condition of stream banks and floodplains, <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a>s, <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">tree canopies</a>, and other variables. The fish and wildlife assessment includes birds, fish, and <a href="Invertebrate">macroinvertebrate</a>s. In 2015, the BES grades for the Columbia Slough are hydrology, B− ; water quality, B− ; habitat, D− , and fish and wildlife, F.

The Columbia Slough is part of the roughly Portland Basin, which lies at the northern end of the <a href="Willamette%20Valley">Willamette Valley</a> of Oregon and extends north into <a href="Clark%20County%2C%20Washington">Clark County</a> in the state of <a href="Washington%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Washington</a>. The region is underlain by solidified <a href="lava">lava</a>s of the <a href="Columbia%20River%20Basalt%20Group">Columbia River Basalt Group</a> that are up to 16 million years old. Covered by later <a href="alluvium">alluvial</a> deposits, the basalts lie more than below the surface within the basin. About 10 million years ago, eruptions of Cascade Range volcanoes to the east sent flows of mud, ash, and eroded volcanic debris into the Columbia, which was powerful enough to carry the material downstream. Deposited above the basalt during the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> and early <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, these loose sands and gravels formed part of what is known as the Troutdale Formation. Extending to the <a href="Tualatin%20River">Tualatin River</a> Valley to the south and into Clark County on the north, the formation is an <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a> that is the primary source of drinking water for <a href="Vancouver%2C%20Washington">Vancouver</a> in Washington and an auxiliary source for Portland.

The Portland Basin is being pulled slowly apart between <a href="Fault%20%28geology%29">faults</a> in the <a href="Tualatin%20Mountains">Tualatin Mountains</a> (West Hills) on the west side of Portland, the East Bank fault along the east side of the Willamette River, and other fault systems near <a href="Gresham%2C%20Oregon">Gresham</a> further east. About 3 million years ago, many small volcanoes and cinder cones erupted through the thin, stretched crust of the basin and in the Cascade foothills to the southeast. Ash, cinders, and debris from these <a href="Boring%20Lava%20Field">Boring Lava Field</a> volcanoes added another layer of sediment to the Troutdale formation.

About 15,000 years ago, cataclysmic <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a> events known as the <a href="Missoula%20Floods">Missoula Floods</a> or Bretz Floods originating in the <a href="Clark%20Fork%20%28river%29">Clark Fork</a> region of northern <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> inundated the Columbia River basin many times. These floods deposited huge amounts of debris and sediment. Water filled the entire Columbia Gorge to overflowing and turned the Willamette Valley into a lake long, wide and deep. The floodwaters ripped the face off <a href="Rocky%20Butte">Rocky Butte</a> in Portland and deposited a gravel bar, <a href="Alameda%20Ridge">Alameda Ridge</a>, that runs parallel to and slightly south of the Columbia Slough.

Faults associated with the expanding Portland Basin are capable of producing significant earthquakes. More than a thousand earthquakes, many too small to be felt, have been recorded in the basin since 1841. The stronger ones reached about magnitude 5 on the <a href="Richter%20magnitude%20scale">Richter scale</a>. In 1892, one estimated at magnitude 5 shook downtown Portland for about 30 seconds. In 1962, one centered about north of Portland was estimated at between magnitude 4.9 and 5.2.

Based on records from 1961 to 1990, the watershed's average annual precipitation, as measured at Portland International Airport, is about . About falls from November through February and only about from June through September. Since temperatures are normally below freezing fewer than 30 days a year, most of this precipitation reaches the ground as rain.

Historically, most rain falling on the watershed was taken up by vegetation, flowed into wetlands, soaked into the ground, or evaporated. Heavy rain in the winter months recharged the <a href="groundwater">groundwater</a> and provided <a href="baseflow">baseflow</a>s to the slough during dry summers. Urban development, which replaced vegetation and water-absorbing soils with airport runways, house roofs, highways, warehouses, parking lots, and other hard surfaces, interrupted this cycle. In 1999, a study estimated that impervious surfaces covered 54 percent of the watershed. Storm <a href="surface%20runoff">runoff</a> that might have taken days to reach the historic slough reaches the developed slough in hours.

Until the 20th century, the slough and its side channels and associated ponds and lakes were part of the active Columbia River floodplain. When the historic river was high, the slough received water from it near Big Four Corners, about from the slough's mouth. In 1917, landowners formed three drainage districts—Peninsula Drainage District No. 1 (Pen 1), Peninsula Drainage District No. 2 (Pen 2), and Multnomah County Drainage District No. 1 (MCDD)—to control flooding. A fourth district, the Sandy Drainage Improvement Company (SDIC), manages water flow at the upper end of the slough's basin in Fairview and Troutdale. By 2008, the districts maintained of levees as well as water pumps, floodgates and other water control devices.

The upper slough extends from the slough's source at Fairview Lake, roughly from the mouth, to a gated levee known as the "mid-dike levee" about downstream. This sector, managed by MCDD, covers completely surrounded by levees. A northern side channel extends from the mid-dike levee to MCDD Pump Station No. 4 on the Columbia River (Marine Drive) levee near Big Four Corners. Water usually exits this sector through the open gates of the mid-dike levee, but to control threatening flows the MCDD can close the gate and pump water from the northern side channel directly into the Columbia. The pump's maximum capacity is .

The middle slough, also managed by MCDD, lies between the mid-dike levee and the "Pen 2 levee", from the mouth. This sector covers , is completely surrounded by levees, and contains many side sloughs, ponds, small lakes, and springs. Pump Station No. 1 rests on the Pen 2 levee, which is gated across the course of the slough. To control flows, MCDD can open or close the gates, and it can pump water from the middle slough to the lower slough when its flow is reversed by the tide or when gravity flow is insufficient. The pump's capacity is .

Water levels in the lower slough, managed by Pen 2 and Pen 1, depend more on Willamette River conditions than on pumping by MCDD. Incoming tides cause a variation in water surface elevation of between and roughly twice per day along the entire lower slough. Flow direction varies with the tide. Pen 2 and Pen 1, separated by Interstate 5, border the north side of the lower slough. Pen 2 manages east of the highway, and Pen 1 manages to the west (downstream). Multiple pump stations move water from lesser sloughs in both districts into the main slough. Parts of this subwatershed are unprotected by levees and are vulnerable to <a href="100-year%20flood">100-year flood</a>s.

 Historically Fairview Creek flowed north into the Columbia River through a wetlands slightly upstream of Big Four Corners. In the early 20th century, water managers dug an artificial channel connecting the Fairview Creek wetlands to the slough. In 1960, they built a dam on the west side of the wetlands to create Fairview Lake for water storage and recreation. It covers about and is deep. Fairview Creek forms in a wetland near Grant Butte and flows north for through the cities of Gresham and Fairview to reach the lake. Fairview Creek has two named tributaries, No Name Creek, and Clear Creek. A smaller stream, Osborn Creek, also flows into the lake, which empties through a <a href="weir">weir</a> and <a href="culvert">culvert</a> system into the upper slough.

With one exception, the streams feeding Fairview Lake are the watershed's only remaining creeks, although <a href="Spring%20%28hydrosphere%29">springs</a> also reach the surface. Wilkes Creek, the slough's only free flowing tributary, is about long and enters the upper slough from the south. Dozens of similar streams that once flowed into the slough from the south have all been piped or filled.
Many bodies of water in addition to the main slough channel lie within the drainage basin. The area around the middle slough contains several slough arms and small lakes, including Buffalo Slough, Whitaker Slough, Johnson Lake, Whitaker Ponds, and Prison Pond. In the lower slough, <a href="Smith%20and%20Bybee%20Wetlands%20Natural%20Area">Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area</a> at is one of the largest urban freshwater wetlands in the United States. A side slough called North Slough connects Bybee Lake and the main slough channel. A water control structure at the outlet from Bybee Lake to the North Slough regulates the lakes' levels.

Groundwater discharges from an <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a> near the surface supply an estimated flow between to the middle and upper sloughs. Rain infiltration and artificial <a href="sump">sump</a>s recharge this shallow aquifer. Geologists have identified four other major aquifers separated by relatively impermeable clays or other <a href="Stratum">strata</a> at various levels below the surface aquifer. The City of Portland's water bureau manages the Columbia South Shore Well Field that taps the deeper aquifers. As of 2004, 25 active wells drawing from depths ranging from could produce up to a day from the field. These were drilled between 1976 and 2003 to supplement the city's main water supply from the <a href="Bull%20Run%20Watershed">Bull Run Watershed</a> during droughts or emergencies. The Rockwood Water People's Utility District (PUD) and the City of Fairview have also drilled three wells near the upper slough.

 Archeological evidence suggests that <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> lived along the lower Columbia River as early as 10,000 years ago, including near what later became <a href="The%20Dalles%2C%20Oregon">The Dalles</a>, on the Columbia River about east of the Columbia Slough. By 2,000 to 3,000 years ago, the <a href="Clackamas%20%28tribe%29">Clackamas Indians</a> had settled along the <a href="Clackamas%20River">Clackamas River</a>, which empties into the Willamette River about south of the slough. The Clackamas tribe was a subgroup of the <a href="Chinookan%20languages">Chinookan</a> speakers who lived in the Columbia River Valley from <a href="Celilo%20Falls">Celilo Falls</a> to the Pacific Ocean. Clackamas lands included the lower Willamette River from <a href="Willamette%20Falls">Willamette Falls</a>, at what later became <a href="Oregon%20City%2C%20Oregon">Oregon City</a>, to the Willamette's confluence with the Columbia River. The Columbia River <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a> near the mouth of the Willamette contained many stream channels, lakes, and wetlands that flooded annually. Chinookan tribes hunted and fished there and traveled between the two big rivers via the protected waters of the slough. Their main food sources were salmon, <a href="sturgeon">sturgeon</a>, and <a href="camas%20%28plant%29">camas</a>.

In 1792, <a href="William%20Robert%20Broughton">Lieutenant William Broughton</a>, a British explorer, led the first trip by non-natives as far up the Columbia River as the mouth of the <a href="Sandy%20River%20%28Oregon%29">Sandy River</a>. He and his men camped on <a href="Sauvie%20Island">Sauvie Island</a>, which lies between the Willamette and Columbia rivers directly opposite the mouth of the slough. Broughton encountered many Chinookans while exploring and mapping geographic features including <a href="Hayden%20Island%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Hayden Island</a> and other islands in the Columbia just north of the slough. When <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Expedition">Lewis and Clark</a> visited the area in 1806, the Clackamas tribe consisted of about 1,800 people living in 11 villages. The explorers estimated that 800 people of the <a href="Multnomah%20%28tribe%29">Multnomah tribe</a> of Chinookans lived in five villages on Sauvie Island.

In 1825, the <a href="Hudson%27s%20Bay%20Company">Hudson's Bay Company</a> established its western administrative headquarters at <a href="Fort%20Vancouver">Fort Vancouver</a>, across the Columbia River from the slough. The British fort became the center for fur trading and other commerce throughout the Pacific Northwest, including what would later become the state of Oregon. By the 1830s, <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>, <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="measles">measles</a> and other diseases carried by non-indigenous explorers and traders had reduced the native population by up to 90 percent throughout the lower Columbia basin. The United States gained control over the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a>—including Fort Vancouver, the Portland Basin, and the slough—by treaty with Great Britain in 1846. By 1851, the Clackamas tribe's population had fallen to 88, and in 1855 the tribe signed a treaty surrendering its lands to the U.S.

 By 1850, <a href="White%20people">White</a> settlers established <a href="Donation%20Land%20Claim%20Act">donation land claims</a> in the Columbia Slough watershed. One settler, Lewis Love, became wealthy by cutting timber in the watershed and using the slough as part of a shipping route to downtown Portland. Other settlers logged the forests near the slough and built sawmills, fished, and farmed. In 1852, James John operated a ferry based on the peninsula of land between the Columbia and the Willamette River. The community of <a href="St.%20Johns%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">St. Johns</a>, <a href="plat">plat</a>ted in the same year on the peninsula, is named after him. Legislation creating the <a href="Port%20of%20Portland%20%28Oregon%29">Port of Portland</a> in 1891 improved St. Johns' prospects as a Willamette River port. In 1902, the U.S. Congress passed a <a href="Newlands%20Reclamation%20Act">Reclamation Act</a> that encouraged irrigation, flood control, and wetland development in places like the peninsula. In 1907, the <a href="Spokane%2C%20Portland%20and%20Seattle%20Railway">Spokane, Portland and Seattle Railway</a> began work on a rail line across the peninsula. The railway and the port improvements led to high expectations. "St. Johns, the City of Destiny", a 1909 editorial appearing in a <a href="Boosterism">booster</a> publication called "The Peninsula", said:

Nature has been more than lavish in her gifts to St. Johns. Travel as many miles as you like and go where you will, it is highly improbable that you will find a spot with so many magnificent nature advantages as has St. Johns. The fine stretch of level land on which the city is located, the deep water of the two rivers, the navigable sloughs and the superb scenery which nature has painted with a master hand, makes the location an ideal one in every respect either for industries or residences.
As Portland grew, it annexed St. Johns and expanded into the peninsula and other parts of the watershed. East of St. Johns, the <a href="Swift%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Swift Meatpacking Company</a> bought in 1906 and established the community of <a href="Kenton%2C%20Portland%2C%20Oregon">Kenton</a>. Other companies built packing plants and <a href="slaughterhouse">slaughterhouse</a>s along the slough, and by 1911 Portland had become the main livestock market for the <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>. These and other early 20th century businesses, including stockyards, a dairy farm, a shingle company, and a lumber mill, flushed waste products into the slough. Starting in 1910, north Portland's residential sewage also poured into the slough through pipes laid for the purpose.
In 1917, landowners along the slough had formed three drainage districts to control floods. They dug ditches, deepened existing water channels, and built levees to keep the rivers and the slough from flooding agricultural, industrial, and commercial property. Hoping to flush the slough with clean water from the river, city engineers created the crosscutting Peninsula Canal. The project largely failed because daily tides reversed the slough's flow and because both ends of the canal were at nearly the same elevation.

Over the next 30 years, more lumber and wood products companies opened along the slough, and tugboats moved log rafts up and down the waterway. Truck freight and other transportation companies built in the watershed. The city created the St. Johns Landfill on wetlands and small channels off the lower slough and built a new <a href="Portland%20International%20Airport">Portland Airport</a> on land along the middle slough. Activists and civic leaders, concerned about pollution on the Willamette River, led cleanup campaigns, but voters declined to pay for sewage treatment. Pollution eventually grew so bad on the slough that mill workers refused to handle logs that had been stored in its water.

After the start of the war with Japan, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> signed an order for <a href="internment">internment</a> of all the people of Japanese ancestry who lived on the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast</a>. About 1,700 of them lived in Portland, and some had farms or businesses near the slough. When the government removed them from their homes in 1942, it housed them temporarily in the <a href="Portland%20Metropolitan%20Exposition%20Center">Livestock Exposition Center</a> (Expo Center) in Kenton before sending them to internment camps further inland. They were not allowed to return until 1945.

The Vanport flood induced changes to the slough's system of levees, which were rebuilt and in some cases fortified to withstand a <a href="100-year%20flood">100-year flood</a>. Instead of repairing the levee along the Peninsula Canal, the city plugged it at both ends. The disaster also affected Oregon's system of higher education. After floodwaters destroyed the Vanport Extension Center, set up in 1946, the Oregon Board of Higher Education reestablished the school in downtown Portland, where it eventually became <a href="Portland%20State%20University">Portland State University</a>.

Debate about how to use the slough and its watershed continued through the rest of the century. In 1964, the Port of Portland, interested in industrial development, began to fill Smith, Bybee, and Ramsey lakes with <a href="dredging">dredge</a> sands from the Columbia. In the 1970s, the Oregon Legislature passed a law against filling Smith or Bybee lakes below a <a href="contour%20line">contour line</a> above <a href="mean%20sea%20level">mean sea level</a> except to enhance fish and wildlife habitat. Plans for a Willamette River Greenway project proposed by Oregon Governor <a href="Tom%20McCall">Tom McCall</a> in the late 1960s called for park and recreation areas along the Willamette and many of its tributaries but ignored the slough. Some planners argued that the slough was so filthy that more industry was all it was good for. They portrayed cleanup as a lofty but impractical goal.

At Oregon's request, the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> stripped the slough of its <a href="navigable">navigable</a> status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the slough, which could then be used for recreation. Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal <a href="Clean%20Water%20Act">Clean Water Act</a> and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act. In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, and the city later used <a href="urban%20renewal">urban renewal</a> funds to support industrial projects near the airport. In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.

After years of piping raw sewage directly into the waterway, Portland built its first sewage treatment plant next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system from all over the city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13 outfalls.

The city closed the St. Johns Landfill, adjacent to the lower slough, in 1991. Pressed by citizen action groups, it agreed in 1993 to establish a environmental conservation zone along the slough. In response to a threatened lawsuit, the city began a comprehensive cleanup of the slough in 1994, and a year later it received a $10 million grant from the EPA for the purpose.

Of the streams monitored in the lower Willamette basin by the <a href="Oregon%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Quality">Oregon Department of Environmental Quality</a> (DEQ) between 1986 and 1995, the Columbia Slough had the worst pollution scores. DEQ's measurements came from the slough at Landfill Road, from the mouth. On the Oregon Water Quality Index (OWQI) used by DEQ, water quality scores can vary from 10 (worst) to 100 (ideal). The average for the Columbia Slough was 22, or "very poor". By comparison, the average in the Willamette River at the <a href="Hawthorne%20Bridge">Hawthorne Bridge</a> in downtown Portland was 74 during the same years. Measurements of water quality at the Landfill Road site during the years covered by the DEQ report showed high concentrations of <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>s, <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> and <a href="nitrate">nitrate</a>s, <a href="Fecal%20coliforms">fecal coliform bacteria</a>, and suspended solids, and a high <a href="biochemical%20oxygen%20demand">biochemical oxygen demand</a>. High temperatures enhanced extreme <a href="eutrophication">eutrophication</a> in the summer.

The Port of Portland began efforts in 1997 to reduce the flow of aircraft deicing chemicals from the airport into the waterway, though it still diverted concentrated chemicals (mostly <a href="glycol">glycol</a>) directly into the slough during rare times of reservoir overflow. By 2012, the Port had completed work on an enhanced system that collects, stores, and treats the chemicals, and is more likely to direct runoff to the Columbia River than the slough.

By 2000 the City of Portland had spent about $200 million to nearly eliminate CSOs from entering the slough. It also replaced <a href="septic%20tank">septic tank</a> and <a href="cesspit">cesspool</a> systems near the middle and upper slough with <a href="sanitary%20sewer">sanitary sewer</a>s. BES analysis of water samples taken between 1995 and 2002 showed that by the end of this period DEQ water quality standards for "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>", the indicator organism for fecal contamination, were nearly always being met in the upper and middle sloughs and generally being met in the lower slough. Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the slough is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County Health Department and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> from the slough because they contain <a href="polychlorinated%20biphenyl">polychlorinated biphenyl</a>s (PCB) and <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s.

Development since 1850 has greatly altered the places in the watershed where plants and animals can thrive. In a report published in 2005, the Portland Bureau of Environmental Services (BES), using data from an early <a href="General%20Land%20Office">General Land Office</a> survey, compared the watershed of 1851 with that of 2003. The study showed that all of the watershed provided plant and wildlife <a href="habitat">habitat</a> in 1851, but by 2003 only 33 percent provided habitat. In 1851, water covered 10 percent of the watershed but that had been cut in half by 2003. Marshes and other <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s that had comprised 22 percent of the earlier watershed dwindled to 1 percent by 2003, while the percentage of land devoted to industry, commerce, and homes rose from 0 to 34. In addition, habitat remaining in 2003 was greatly disturbed, dominated by <a href="Rubus%20armeniacus">Himalayan blackberry</a> and other invasive <a href="species">species</a> and fragmented by roads. The <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian zone</a> along the slough was generally narrow or nonexistent and devoid of trees and shrubs in places, including along the levees.

In 2002 the city, the MCDD, and the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> began a project to improve habitat by creating of stream <a href="meander">meander</a>s and wetland terraces along the slough. Through its Watershed Revegetation Program, begun in 1996, the city worked with property owners to plant native vegetation and to remove invasive weeds. Through 2005, participants had replanted more than along nearly of riparian corridors in the slough watershed. Other strategies pursued by the city, Metro, and other interest groups include connecting separated habitats with a continuous riparian corridor, removing wildlife corridor barriers, restoring hydrological connections to the slough, and restoring the floodplain where feasible.

 Although reduced and altered, habitats in the watershed support a wide range of wildlife, some of which is found nowhere else in Portland. Many species that used the slough in 1850 still use it. This includes more than 150 species of birds, 26 species of fish of which 12 species are native several kinds of <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a>s, <a href="western%20pond%20turtle">western pond turtle</a>s, <a href="beaver">beaver</a>, <a href="muskrat">muskrat</a>, <a href="North%20American%20river%20otter">river otter</a>, and <a href="black-tailed%20deer">black-tailed deer</a>. Juvenile <a href="salmon">salmon</a> enter the lower slough as well as Smith and Bybee Lakes. <a href="Coastal%20cutthroat%20trout">Coastal cutthroat trout</a> inhabit Fairview Creek and Osborn Creek. Three species of native <a href="freshwater%20mussel">freshwater mussel</a> live in the slough and in Smith and Bybee Lakes. Crayfish have been found throughout the slough. <a href="Bald%20eagle">Bald eagle</a>s are among the resident birds, and <a href="great%20blue%20heron">great blue heron</a>s have established <a href="Rookery">rookeries</a> in the watershed. Migrants that visit the slough include more than a dozen species of ducks, geese, swans, and <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a>, as well as <a href="Neotropic%20ecozone">neotropical</a> shorebirds and songbirds. <a href="Invasive%20species">Invasive species</a> adapted to the slough include the <a href="Coypu">nutria</a>, <a href="common%20carp">common carp</a>, <a href="American%20bullfrog">bullfrog</a>, and <a href="European%20starling">European starling</a>.

The slough watershed lies in the Portland/Vancouver Basin ecoregion, part of the <a href="Willamette%20Valley%20%28ecoregion%29">Willamette Valley ecoregion</a> designated by the U.S. <a href="United%20States%20Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA). <a href="Populus%20trichocarpa">Black cottonwood</a>, <a href="Red%20Osier%20Dogwood">red osier dogwood</a>, <a href="willow">willow</a>, <a href="Quercus%20garryana">Oregon white oak</a>, and <a href="Fraxinus%20latifolia">Oregon ash</a> grow in scattered locations throughout the watershed, while <a href="Sagittaria">wapato</a> and Columbia <a href="Carex">sedge</a> thrive in a few places. In the slough itself, <a href="macrophyte">macrophyte</a>s and <a href="algae">algae</a> sometimes restrict water flow and reduce water quality. Golf courses and athletic fields near the slough consist mainly of non-native grasses. Developed plots with houses or businesses often have <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> street trees, grasses, occasional <a href="Pinophyta">conifers</a>, and a variety of native and non-native <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s. Invasive plants include <a href="Himalayan%20blackberry">Himalayan blackberry</a>, <a href="English%20ivy">English ivy</a>, <a href="reed%20canarygrass">reed canarygrass</a>, <a href="purple%20loosestrife">purple loosestrife</a>, and <a href="Japanese%20knotweed">Japanese knotweed</a>.

At the upper end of the slough, the City of Fairview manages Lakeshore Park, on the south edge of Fairview Lake. Slightly further north is <a href="Blue%20Lake%20Regional%20Park">Blue Lake Regional Park</a>, a recreational park with a lake, both managed by <a href="Metro%20%28Oregon%20regional%20government%29">Metro</a>. To the northeast is Chinook Landing Marine Park, also managed by Metro. At about , it is Oregon's largest public boating park on the Columbia River.

Big Four Corners Wetlands, managed by the <a href="Portland%20Parks%20%26amp%3B%20Recreation">Portland Parks & Recreation</a> Department (PPR), includes about of wetlands and forests about from the slough's confluence with the Willamette River. Providing habitat for deer, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s, and river otter as well as birds and amphibians, it is the fourth largest natural area in the city. Further downstream, a consortium of interest groups is restoring a natural area of about at Johnson Lake. <a href="Whitaker%20Ponds%20Nature%20Park">Whitaker Ponds Nature Park</a>, at about RM 10 (RK 16), is a site with a walking trail, canoe launch, garden, and wildflower meadow. West of Whitaker Ponds, the Columbia Children's Arboretum, with every <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20trees">state tree</a>, lies on a property managed by PPR.

<a href="Delta%20Park">Delta Park</a> is a large municipal park complex that straddles Interstate 5 between the slough and the Columbia River at the former <a href="Vanport%20City%2C%20Oregon">Vanport</a> site. East Delta Park, covering about , has a sports complex and a street-tree arboretum. <a href="Portland%20International%20Raceway">Portland International Raceway</a>, for car, motorcycle, and bicycle racing, occupies about of West Delta Park. Adjacent to the raceway is the Heron Lakes Golf Course, . The grounds include wetlands and interpretive signs about Vanport. <a href="Smith%20and%20Bybee%20Wetlands%20Natural%20Area">Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area</a>, a public park and nature reserve managed by Metro, lies just west of Delta Park. At about , it is one of the largest urban freshwater wetlands in the United States. <a href="Kelley%20Point%20Park">Kelley Point Park</a> covers at the tip of the peninsula between the Willamette and Columbia rivers.

Next to Columbia River, long segments of the <a href="40-Mile%20Loop">40-Mile Loop</a> skirt the north edge of the slough watershed, while other segments such as the north–south <a href="I-205%20Bike%20Path">I-205 Bike Path</a> cross it or, as in the case of the largely unfinished Columbia Slough Trail, run through it generally along an east–west axis. The 40 Mile Loop is a partly completed <a href="greenway%20%28landscape%29">greenway</a> trail around and through Portland and other parts of Multnomah County. Originally proposed by the <a href="Olmsted%20Brothers">Olmsted Brothers</a>, architects involved in the planning for Portland's <a href="Lewis%20and%20Clark%20Centennial%20Exposition">Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition</a> of 1905, it has expanded to a projected , encircling the city and connecting parks along the Columbia, Sandy, and Willamette rivers and <a href="Johnson%20Creek%20%28Willamette%20River%29">Johnson Creek</a>. The parks and other public spaces in the watershed have their own pedestrian paths, some of which are also bicycle paths that connect to the 40 Mile Loop. Many gaps lie between completed trail segments.

Along the east side of the slough watershed, the City of Gresham has opened a segment of the Gresham-Fairview Trail, a planned , north–south hiking and biking route between the <a href="Springwater%20Corridor">Springwater Corridor</a> along Johnson Creek and the 40 Mile Loop along the Columbia River. On the west side of the watershed, the Peninsula Crossing Trail connects Willamette Cove on the Willamette River in St. Johns with the 40 Mile Loop along the Columbia River. This linear hiking and biking trail crosses the lower slough and passes between Smith Lake and Heron Lakes Golf Course. The trail is level and accessible by <a href="wheelchair">wheelchair</a>. Amenities include a picnic area, seats carved from <a href="basalt">basalt</a>, and art installations.

Accessible to canoers and kayakers of all skill levels, the slough is essentially flat. A trip from source to mouth is possible via the main channel but requires <a href="portage">portage</a>s around levees and other obstacles. BES estimates the time required for a canoe trip of roughly along the main channel to be at least nine hours. Trips along the lower must be timed with the tides to allow paddling with the current. Eight launch sites, including one just below Fairview Lake at the headwaters and another at Kelley Point Park near the mouth, have been established along the slough.

Fantasy Black Channel

Fantasy Black Channel is the debut studio album by British <a href="dance-punk">dance-punk</a> band <a href="Late%20of%20the%20Pier">Late of the Pier</a>. It was released on 30 July 2008 in Japan through <a href="Toshiba%20EMI">Toshiba EMI</a> and on 4 August 2008 in the British Isles on <a href="Parlophone">Parlophone</a>, the band's primary label. Five tracks had already been released as <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> in the United Kingdom: "<a href="Bathroom%20Gurgle">Bathroom Gurgle</a>", "<a href="The%20Bears%20Are%20Coming">The Bears Are Coming</a>", "<a href="Space%20and%20the%20Woods">Space and the Woods</a>" and "<a href="Focker%20%28song%29">Focker</a>" as a <a href="double%20A-side">double A-side</a>, and "<a href="Heartbeat%20%28Late%20of%20the%20Pier%20song%29">Heartbeat</a>". The record peaked at number 28 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, but failed to chart in the United States.

The album was recorded in <a href="frontman">frontman</a> Sam Eastgate's bedroom in <a href="Castle%20Donington">Castle Donington</a>, England, and at several locations in London. It went through a fractured creative process that lasted for more than two years. It was eventually produced by Eastgate and <a href="DJ">DJ</a> <a href="Erol%20Alkan">Erol Alkan</a> between 2007 and 2008. "Fantasy Black Channel" does not contain a unifying musical or lyrical theme; rather, it is a <a href="collage">collage</a> of all the ideas, genres, and studio effects that fascinated the band members and Alkan, especially during live recording sessions. The record was very well received by critics. It was often treated as one of the best British albums of 2008 because of its eclecticism and spirit of invention. Late of the Pier did not record any further albums following the death of <a href="drummer">drummer</a> Ross Dawson in 2015.

Having officially formed a band under the name Late of the Pier in 2004, childhood friends Sam Eastgate, Andrew Faley, Sam Potter, and the late Ross Dawson initially developed the sound of their first album by listening to the <a href="alternative%20dance">alternative dance</a> music of British ensemble <a href="The%20Prodigy">The Prodigy</a> and the <a href="grunge">grunge music</a> of American band <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>. They soon branched out into listening to diverse genres from the last 40 years of music, including <a href="Motown">Motown</a> and <a href="soul%20music">soul</a>. Potter has treated their conception of "Fantasy Black Channel" as a reaction to "mediocre, complacent <a href="indie%20music">indie</a>-schmindie bands who find a sound and stick to it; whose songs sound exactly the same", while lead writer and composer Eastgate has pointed out that they wanted to "take people past their own limits". The nascent recording stages took place in Eastgate's bedroom, where unconventional <a href="time%20signatures">time signatures</a> and experimental <a href="chord%20%28music%29">chords</a> were performed because, at the time, no band member could play an instrument properly.

Late of the Pier started using the album <a href="working%20title">working title</a> "Interesting Adventure" in 2006 after practising in Eastgate's bedroom for about a year and previewed their new material at the Liars Club in Nottingham. After receiving contract offers from Parlophone and <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a>, the band members signed to Parlophone because the label gave them total autonomy over the recording process without pressuring them to be commercially successful immediately. The record deal was followed by the recording of an <a href="EP%20%28music%29">EP</a> titled "<a href="Zarcorp%20Demo">Zarcorp Demo</a>", from which a <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> single, "Space and the Woods", was released in March 2007. Eastgate has claimed that the band members were influenced by the <a href="1980s%20in%20music">music of the 1980s</a> during these formative stages of "Fantasy Black Channel" even though none of them were born before 1986.

In late 2007, Late of the Pier formally met renowned DJ Erol Alkan after seeing him play a <a href="dj%20set">set</a> at the Liars Club. Alkan called them "THE most exciting band around" and offered the band members help in the recording process of "Fantasy Black Channel". They accepted and made him producer for the album because of the immediate rapport that developed between the two parties. Dawson has explained the choice of producer by suggesting that Alkan is famous for playing broad genres of music and that he understands the properties and crossover of <a href="dance%20music">dance</a> and guitar music. Alkan fully embraced the band members' ideas and immediately understood what they were trying to achieve. "Bathroom Gurgle" was recorded by the new collaboration and was released as a limited edition single in September 2007.

The production process for "Fantasy Black Channel" gathered pace around December 2007. Late of the Pier usually proceeded by taking bedroom recordings into the studio, where they were refined by Alkan into "a more presentable package". They tried unconventional techniques in the style of <a href="avant%20garde">avant garde</a> producer <a href="Joe%20Meek">Joe Meek</a> during the live studio recording sessions, including stamping in baths and <a href="reamping">reamping</a> guitars through air vents. When tracks were <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> after being recorded, the band members, Alkan, and <a href="audio%20engineer">engineer</a> Jimmy Robertson worked in tandem and unanimously decided when a track had finished undergoing the studio effects process. No songs changed after this point, even when one of the parties had further ideas. At the time, in an interview with the band, Stuart Turnbull of the <a href="BBC%20Collective">BBC Collective</a> indicated that Alkan managed to "channel Late of the Pier's sonic attack into something more focused yet still undeniably different".

The record was nearly completed by end January 2008. Late of the Pier stopped recording to embark on a <a href="headliner">headlining</a> UK tour during February, in which they previewed new material. "The Bears Are Coming" was released as a <a href="vinyl%20record">vinyl</a> single in March 2008. The band toured until the end of April 2008 to promote another single—a double A-side containing a reworked "Space and the Woods" and "Focker"—from the as-yet-unreleased "Fantasy Black Channel". Studio work with Alkan restarted in May 2008 to put the finishing touches on the album; the final version was christened as "a compilation of hits" and "anti-pop <a href="pop%20music">pop</a>". The album was recorded during six months in different studios and the band members have admitted that the variety in venues partially explains why it sounds disjointed. The idea of having a single 45-minute track instead of a track list of songs was mooted at the end of May 2008, but was not followed through.

"Fantasy Black Channel"'s track listing and UK CD release date of 11 August 2008 were confirmed on 11 June. Faley has claimed that "the album fell into place itself, like the songs basically told us where they wanted to go on the album". Late of the Pier picked the record's name at random after first contemplating using "Peggy Patch and Her Sequenced Dress". The <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a> was designed by a friend of the band members from <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>, Jon Bergman. A final EP containing material already released in 2007 and 2008, "Echoclistel Lambietroy", was released in July 2008 as part of the marketing campaign for the forthcoming album. Potter has summed the record's conception by concluding, "I think in the three years to build up to the album, we never actually thought of a track list, and we never really kind of considered the fact that it should sound like an album. I think we recorded all the songs and then they were there and it was like, 'Oh, we have to kind of stitch this together and make it sound like one piece.'"

The writing process for "Fantasy Black Channel" was largely unplanned. The verses of "Broken" were conceived late at night and are inspired by <a href="insomnia">insomnia</a>. It took Eastgate a long time to describe how he was feeling "in a way that sounded original" for such a common theme in pop music. The lyrics in the chorus are about the first time Late of the Pier drove to London and got lost. "Space and the Woods" tries to weigh up what is more important: a person or an inanimate object, or an absence of anything, while "The Bears Are Coming" concerns "a silent threat". The idea for the lyric "A heartbeat, a flicker, a line" in "Heartbeat" came to Eastgate while recording the song and hearing its time signature always changing.

The lyricist cannot remember writing "White Snake" and did not know there was a <a href="Whitesnake">band of the same name</a> in existence. "Focker" evolved out of a demo, called "6/8 Focker", Eastgate sang through a <a href="guitar%20amp">guitar amp</a> with initially indecipherable lyrics. "The Enemy Are the Future" gets its name from a sentence in a promotional leaflet for the <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> band <a href="The%20Enemy%20%28UK%20band%29">The Enemy</a>. Eastgate has explained that for "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" he randomly "shouted lots of short phrases" and then tried to make sense of what he said. The process led to stylised lines like "Falling over aeroplanes and wanting to be a derelict".

"Fantasy Black Channel" is largely built on sonic experiments and the use of studio and computer techniques. The opening track, "Hot Tent Blues", is an <a href="instrumental">instrumental</a> short which contains seven layers of electric guitar run through a <a href="Zoom%20Corporation">Zoom</a> 506 <a href="effects%20units">bass guitar pedal</a>. "Broken" was conceived during a jam session between Eastgate's guitar <a href="riff">riff</a>s and Dawson's drumming, while a demo of "Space and the Woods" similar to the Nirvana song "<a href="All%20Apologies">All Apologies</a>" was reworked and remixed in the studio. Eastgate credits Storm Mortimer, who used to drive Late of the Pier around London, as the muse for "The Bears Are Coming". She often sang impromptu and the frontman eventually borrowed a page of her songs and added an <a href="afrobeat">afrobeat</a>-inspired rhythm to it. Eastgate and Dawson wanted to create a track that evoked the idea of "coming out of the jungle" and credit varied musical acts like <a href="Slagsm%C3%A5lsklubben">Slagsmålsklubben</a>, <a href="Prince%20%28musician%29">Prince</a>, <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, Mr Flash, FrYars, and <a href="Lutricia%20McNeal">Lutricia McNeal</a> as inspiration.
"Random Firl" was one of Alkan's favourites and he persuaded Late of the Pier to re-record it like a <a href="classical%20music">classical</a> piece of music rather than in a rock-oriented way. The <a href="vocal%20harmonies">vocal harmonies</a> at the end of the song were added during one of the last days of recording when the pressure to complete the album was high. "Heartbeat" is based on an old <a href="acid%20house">acid house</a> demo track that Eastgate created during his childhood using a <a href="Roland%20TB-303">Roland TB-303</a> electronic <a href="synthesiser">synthesiser</a>-<a href="music%20sequencer">sequencer</a>. The track features complex time signature progressions and a <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a> played by Potter on the <a href="sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29">sampler</a> at the end. "Whitesnake" was inspired by the music of <a href="Devo">Devo</a>, <a href="Roxy%20Music">Roxy Music</a>, and <a href="Dandi%20Wind">Dandi Wind</a>, while "VW" is based on a 2001 demo recorded in Eastgate's attic. In the studio, Late of the Pier hired <a href="brass%20section">brass player</a>s to perform the <a href="horn%20section">horn section</a>s and create new <a href="scale%20%28music%29">scales</a>. Once the instrumentals were recorded, the band members purposefully decided to mix their own playing lower in certain sections of the song so that listeners could hear the <a href="French%20horn">horns</a> more clearly.

"Focker" was created using a <a href="loop%20%28music%29">looped</a> riff from "6/8 Focker". Eastgate then conceived a drum solo and remixed and rearranged the last 20 seconds of the song. "The Enemy Are the Future" was created during a <a href="hungover">hungover</a> jam session, where all band members played individually and not in tandem. Dawson performed around 40 different beats one after another all in different timings. The session was recorded using a <a href="tape%20player">tape player</a> and a track was moulded in the studio. Four different endings were recorded and three were spliced together at the end. "Mad Dogs and Englishmen", whose riff is based on an old French <a href="samba">samba</a> song, was borne out of an interplay between Eastgate on the guitar and Faley on the bass. The last track on the album, "Bathroom Gurgle", includes "a squelchy grind of the riff" purpose-built for the Liars Club audience during the band's first ever gigs. Eastgate has explained, "I had these two themes, which looped round on each other which I sang very exasperated <a href="Annie%20Lennox">Annie Lennox</a> style vocals over." The fast <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of the first half of the song was juxtaposed against a section of "slow drama".

Media response to "Fantasy Black Channel" was highly favourable; aggregating website <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> reports a <a href="standard%20score">normalised</a> rating of 81% based on 18 critical reviews. <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s K. Ross Hoffman described the album as "glorious and galvanising" and labelled it "a convoluted construction crammed with so many immediately gratifying moments that it takes multiple listens to extricate them all". John Burgess of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" explained that a new favourite song, riff, or wayward moment can be found every time that the album is listened to. Tim Chester of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" concluded, "It takes a certain kind of mind to make this. While others whinge about living and dying in <a href="cul-de-sac">cul-de-sac</a> towns shackled by cul-de-sac imaginations, LOTP's vision is housed on <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a>'s '<a href="The%20World%20%28archipelago%29">The World</a>' island-creation project."

Some reviewers classified "Fantasy Black Channel" into the British <a href="new%20rave">new rave</a> genre and musical scene. Others claimed that they could hear impressions of Roxy Music frontman <a href="Bryan%20Ferry">Bryan Ferry</a> and musician <a href="Gary%20Numan">Gary Numan</a> in the recording. <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>'s Adam Moerder commented that it contains several new rave compositions which are aesthetically dubious. Chris Baynes of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> claimed that the band members "wear their influences pretty much inked onto their sleeves", but concluded that the album is exciting and excitable in equal measure. According to Late of the Pier, comparisons to <a href="Klaxons">Klaxons</a> and new rave are the results of lazy journalism, especially for a scene the band has never been in. Eastgate has explained that musical influences are often subconscious, even though the band members tried not to listen to anything but their own work while recording the album. Nick Mitchell of "<a href="The%20Skinny%20%28magazine%29">The Skinny</a>" pointed out that the record is "an unrestrained, unclassifiable, unexpectedly triumphant romp through blaring influences and genres, from the 70s camp rock of <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a> and <a href="David%20Bowie">Bowie</a> to the primitive <a href="electronic%20music">electronics</a> of Gary Numan, with echoes of 90s computer games and snatches of modern <a href="house%20music">house</a>".

"Fantasy Black Channel" figured in several publications' end-of-year best album lists for 2008, notably, at number three by "<a href="Clash%20%28magazine%29">Clash</a>", at number five by <a href="Fact%20Magazine%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">"FACT"</a>, and at number 18 by "<a href="NME">NME</a>". It was ranked at number 16 in <a href="HMV%27s%20Poll%20of%20Polls">HMV's Poll of Polls</a> for 2008, which aggregates the votes of prominent British critics to decide the commercial group's Album Of The Year. Earlier in 2008, Rory Carroll of "<a href="Artrocker">Artrocker</a>" claimed that the record would have been a late entrant for the <a href="Mercury%20Music%20Prize">Mercury Music Prize</a>, and would have probably won the award, if nominations had been made in August rather than July 2008. Because of their work on the album, Late of the Pier received a nomination for Best New Band at the 2009 <a href="NME%20Awards">"NME" Awards</a>. Two tracks were also nominated: "Bathroom Gurgle" and "Heartbeat", in the Best Dancefloor Filler and Best Video categories respectively. In 2009, "Clash" placed "Fantasy Black Channel" at number 40 in its list of the 50 Greatest Albums, 2004–2009, while "FACT" included it at number 99 in its editorial staff list of the 100 Best: Albums of the Decade.

SECR K and SR K1 classes

The SECR K class was a type of <a href="2-6-4">2-6-4</a> <a href="tank%20locomotive">tank locomotive</a> designed in 1914 by <a href="Richard%20Maunsell">Richard Maunsell</a> for express passenger duties on the <a href="South%20Eastern%20and%20Chatham%20Railway">South Eastern and Chatham Railway</a> (SECR), which operated between London and south-east England. The <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">Southern Railway</a> (SR) K1 class was a three-cylinder variant of the K class, designed in 1925 to suit a narrower <a href="loading%20gauge">loading gauge</a>. They were among the first non-<a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> (GWR) types to use and improve upon the basic design principles of power and standardisation established by GWR <a href="Chief%20Mechanical%20Engineer">Chief Mechanical Engineer</a> (CME) <a href="George%20Jackson%20Churchward">George Jackson Churchward</a>. The locomotives were based on the <a href="GWR%204300%20Class">GWR 4300 class</a>, improved by the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a>'s ideals of simplicity and ease of maintenance.

The K class was designed to be mechanically similar to the <a href="SECR%20N%20class">SECR N class</a> <a href="2-6-0">2-6-0</a> mixed-traffic locomotives. The class was one of the earliest to use the 2-6-4 wheel arrangement in Britain. Production began towards the end of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, and the prototype rolled out of <a href="Ashford%20railway%20works">Ashford Works</a> three years after design work was completed due to wartime production constraints. The class replaced obsolete <a href="4-4-0">4-4-0</a> passenger locomotives in an SECR fleet standardisation programme.

Twenty-one locomotives were built: twenty K class (two cylinders) and one K1 class (three cylinders), the first in 1917 and the remainder between 1925 and 1926. They operated over the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Operations">Eastern section</a> of the Southern Railway network and were given the names of rivers, being referred as the River class from 1925. Crews referred to the K and K1 classes as "Rolling Rivers" because of their instability when travelling at speed. They were rebuilt as 2-cylinder <a href="SR%20U%20class">SR U class</a> and 3-cylinder <a href="SR%20U1%20class">SR U1 class</a> 2-6-0s (respectively) following a <a href="Sevenoaks%20railway%20accident">railway accident at Sevenoaks, Kent</a> in 1927. They continued in service with <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a> (BR) until the last was withdrawn in 1966. One K class rebuild (No. 31806) is preserved on the <a href="Swanage%20Railway">Swanage Railway</a> in Dorset and as of 2016 is operational.

Three factors dictated the type of locomotive that could operate on the <a href="South%20Eastern%20and%20Chatham%20Railway">South Eastern and Chatham Railway</a> (SECR): the heavy passenger train loadings; the poor track quality; and the weak, lightly built bridges. On the lines of the former <a href="London%2C%20Chatham%20and%20Dover%20Railway">London, Chatham and Dover Railway</a> (LCDR) – inherited by the SECR in 1899 – beach pebbles had been used for <a href="track%20ballast">ballast</a> instead of conventional ballast, which has irregular shapes that lock together to keep the track in place. These economies in construction meant that only locomotives with low <a href="axle%20loading">axle loading</a>s could operate safely over the track. The SECR was therefore unable to follow a coherent strategy to reduce the number of locomotive types inherited from the two constituent railways. Despite increased passenger and freight traffic between and the <a href="Kent">Kent</a>ish coast during the first decades of the 20th century, the Operating Department had to use mismatched classes of underpowered and obsolete <a href="4-4-0">4-4-0</a> and <a href="0-6-0">0-6-0</a> locomotives, which could operate within the restrictions imposed by the infrastructure. This resulted in frequent <a href="double-heading">double-heading</a>, adding to operational costs.

Richard Maunsell was appointed CME of the SECR in 1913, following the enforced retirement of <a href="Harry%20Wainwright">Harry Wainwright</a>, who had left a range of competent but unspectacular locomotive classes that struggled to cope with the increased train lengths and loadings. Maunsell reviewed the situation and planned to introduce six standard classes – using only two boiler designs – which would work the entire traffic of the railway. The first of these was the <a href="SECR%20N%20class">N class</a> <a href="2-6-0">2-6-0</a>, which gave the SECR a capable <a href="mixed-traffic%20locomotive">mixed-traffic locomotive</a>. For the express passenger design that could cope with the heavy <a href="boat%20train">boat train</a>s, Maunsell wanted to enlarge the existing <a href="SECR%20L%20class">L class</a> <a href="4-4-0">4-4-0</a> with <a href="Walschaerts%20valve%20gear">Walschaerts valve gear</a> and an enlarged <a href="superheater">superheater</a>, but this design would have resulted in a too heavy <a href="axle%20loading">axle loading</a>. Maunsell's newly recruited assistants, G.H. Pearson and <a href="Harold%20Holcroft">Harold Holcroft</a> from the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> at <a href="Swindon%20railway%20works">Swindon</a> and <a href="James%20Clayton%20%28engineer%29">James Clayton</a> from the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a> at <a href="Derby%20Railway%20Works">Derby</a>, had recently been involved in the design of large passenger tank engines and persuaded him to use the <a href="2-6-4">2-6-4</a> <a href="Whyte%20notation">wheel arrangement</a>, which would allow the class to operate at high speeds on the poor-quality track in north Kent.

The 2-6-4 wheel arrangement was not in common use in Great Britain at this time, as many railway companies operated routes that required locomotives with greater fuel capacity, or short branch lines that necessitated smaller locomotives. The 2-6-4 tank engine design had only been used once before for <a href="standard%20gauge">standard gauge</a> locomotives in Britain, on the <a href="Great%20Central%20Railway">Great Central Railway</a>'s <a href="GCR%20Class%201B">1B class</a> freight locomotives of 1914. However, the configuration was ideal for the SECR, because of its shorter mainlines, and allowed for a long wheelbase with a leading axle to permit greater stability at speed on track curves. The tightness of the curves on the former LCDR mainlines had constrained the size of locomotives operating on the SECR, as they had been hastily erected during the nineteenth century to compete with those of the <a href="South%20Eastern%20Railway%20%28UK%29">South Eastern Railway</a> (SER). The longer locomotive could also accommodate a larger <a href="Fire-tube%20boiler">boiler</a> than a 4-4-0, giving sufficient power to avoid double-heading of locomotives on heavier trains.

The K class design used a "<a href="Bissel%20bogie">Bissel bogie</a>" leading axle and a plain trailing <a href="bogie">bogie</a>. The trailing bogie permitted the use of a large coal bunker that was capable of sustaining the locomotive over the run between London Charing Cross and , and side water tanks of capacity were used, negating the need for a <a href="Tender%20%28rail%29">tender</a>. The coupled wheelbase between the rear and centre driving wheels was reduced from that used on the mechanically identical N class to to accommodate the bogie. The cab was fully enclosed, although the set of four small front <a href="spectacle%20plate">spectacle plate</a>s (the windows on the front face of the cab for forward visibility) were the same as those used on the N class.

The K class was designed by Maunsell's team in 1914 as part of his proposed standardisation programme following the <a href="SECR%20N%20class">N class</a>, but the designs were not shown to the railway directors until early 1915 to enable all six designs to be shown at once. The design incorporated the principles of power and reliability established by <a href="George%20Jackson%20Churchward">George Churchward</a>, using a <a href="Belpaire%20firebox">Belpaire firebox</a> that sloped downwards towards the cab instead of a round-topped version, a regulator located in the <a href="smokebox">smokebox</a>, long-travel valves for free running at high speeds, a sharply tapered and <a href="Steam%20dome">domeless</a> boiler, and a right-hand driving position. The inclusion of these features is attributed to Holcroft, Maunsell's personal assistant, who had worked on the <a href="GWR%204300%20Class">GWR 4300 class</a> and the N class. <a href="James%20Clayton%20%28engineer%29">James Clayton</a>, Maunsell's Chief Locomotive Draughtsman, brought simpler and more functional <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a> influences to the design, such as the shape of the cab and the <a href="Drumhead">drumhead-type</a> smokebox, which sat on a saddle that was of wider diameter than the fully lagged and clad boiler. The latter was fitted with Ross pop <a href="safety%20valve">safety valve</a>s and pressed to .

Other innovations by Maunsell's team included greater <a href="Superheater">superheating</a> surface area, locating the boiler water <a href="top%20feed">top feed</a> inside a dome-like cover with external <a href="Check%20valve">clackboxes</a> and water feed pipes mounted on either side, outside Walschaerts valve gear, and parts that could be shared with similar locomotive classes to reduce maintenance costs. The firebox was narrower towards the rear and featured a continuously sloping grate, whilst the ashpan was fitted with front and rear damper doors, the latter adjusted to clear the rear driving axle. The lower part of the coal bunker incorporated a water tank of capacity. This was connected to two <a href="Tank%20locomotive">side tanks</a> by two rectangular pipes on either side of the locomotive that also formed supports for the cab <a href="footplate">footplate</a>.

In January 1915 Maunsell received authority to build six examples, but, as with the N class, production was delayed due to the use of the <a href="Ashford%20railway%20works">Ashford works</a> for wartime armaments manufacture. Assembly began in 1917 and the first, No. 790, emerged in July of that year. It was based at <a href="Bricklayers%20Arms%20railway%20station">Bricklayers Arms depot</a>, preceding the earlier N class design into service by one month. Further construction was deferred until after Ashford had caught up with the maintenance backlog caused by the war.

Ten more locomotives were ordered by the SECR from Ashford works in June 1920, and to speed delivery the construction of <a href="Locomotive%20frame">frames</a>, <a href="Cylinder%20%28locomotive%29">cylinders</a> and side tanks was subcontracted to the <a href="Royal%20Arsenal">Royal Arsenal</a> at <a href="Woolwich">Woolwich</a>. However, further severe delays at Ashford caused by the backlog of repair work meant that the boilers had to be supplied by the <a href="North%20British%20Locomotive%20Company">North British Locomotive Company</a>. Construction of these locomotives had not begun by 1 January 1923, when the <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">Railways Act 1921</a> merged the SECR with other railways in southern England to form the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Southern Railway</a>.

Maunsell was appointed CME of the newly formed Southern Railway in 1923, and inherited the 1920 SECR order for ten K class locomotives. The order was still outstanding in 1924, although most of the component parts had been made. On 14 January 1925, Maunsell ordered No. 790 to be overhauled and trialled on the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Operations">Central section</a>. As the locomotive proved suitable for the operating conditions of this section, the Southern Railway's Locomotive Committee proceeded with the assembly of the K class parts using outside contractors. Nine sets of parts (Nos. A791–A799) were conveyed to <a href="Armstrong%20Whitworth">Armstrong Whitworth</a> for assembly and the finished locomotives delivered in May and June 1925. These were <a href="Vacuum%20brake%23Dual%20brakes">dual-fitted</a> with <a href="vacuum%20brake">vacuum</a> and <a href="Westinghouse%20Air%20Brake%20Company">Westinghouse</a> <a href="Railway%20air%20brake">(air)</a> brakes for use with the former <a href="London%2C%20Brighton%20and%20South%20Coast%20Railway">London, Brighton and South Coast Railway</a> (LBSCR) rolling stock on the Central section. Other differences from the prototype included the relocation of the regulator to the dome and an increase in superheater area. The tenth set of parts was retained by Ashford and used for the first member of the K1 class later that year.

In May 1925 Maunsell ordered a further ten locomotives from <a href="Brighton%20railway%20works">Brighton works</a> (Nos. A800–A809), which only had vacuum brakes for the SECR stock on the Eastern section. They were delivered between July and December 1926. This group had modified suspension on the bogie and leading axle, in an attempt to address complaints from the crews of rough riding experienced with earlier members of the class. A further 20 members of the class were ordered in March 1926 (ten each from Ashford and Brighton works), despite strong reservations expressed by the Operating Department concerning "the wisdom or desirability of placing so many large passenger tanks in service". These were allocated the numbers A610–A629, and work had begun on building the frames and cylinders when the order was cancelled following an <a href="Sevenoaks%20railway%20accident">accident at Sevenoaks in 1927</a> involving locomotive No. A800. These numbers were later allocated to the first production batch of U class locomotives.

In August 1919, a proposal was put to the SECR’s Locomotive, Carriage and Wagon Committee for 2 and 3-cylinder tank engines of <a href="2-8-0">2-8-0</a> wheel arrangement for heavy shunting of freight wagons. They were to use the same boiler as the K and <a href="SECR%20N%20class">N classes</a> and the general layout was similar to designs used by the GWR in South Wales. Nothing came of this proposal because of other commitments and the absorption of the SECR into the Southern Railway. In 1922, Holcroft suggested that 3-cylinder 2-6-0 <a href="Tender%20%28rail%29">tender</a> locomotives with driving wheels should be built instead of tank locomotives. Despite the benefit of a greater operational range, Holcroft's immediate superior, Clayton, refused to pass this suggestion on to Maunsell. The 3-cylinder principle was therefore applied to the K class.

At the Southern Railway’s January 1925 Locomotive Committee meeting, when it was decided to use outside contractors to build the K class, Maunsell received authority to retain one set of parts at Ashford works to construct a prototype 3-cylinder 2-6-4 tank. The modification was based upon that used on N class No. 822 to produce a 3-cylinder locomotive in 1922, although it retained the driving wheels and shorter wheelbase of the K class. The modification was the inclusion of an additional (inside) cylinder between the <a href="frame%20%28locomotive%29">frames</a>, and a crank axle was fitted to the middle driving wheels. The axle was connected to the inside cylinder assembly by a <a href="connecting%20rod">connecting rod</a> inclined at 1 in 8 to clear the front driving axle. This arrangement was supplemented by two smaller-diameter outside cylinders with bore (compared to the cylinders of the K class), and a greater chimney diameter. The resulting prototype 3-cylinder "K1" was narrower than the K class and hence could work on routes with restricted <a href="loading%20gauge">loading gauge</a>. As with No. 822, this locomotive used <a href="Holcroft%20valve%20gear">Holcroft's derivative</a> of the <a href="Gresley%20conjugated%20valve%20gear">Gresley conjugated valve gear</a> to drive the inside cylinder. To accommodate this, the boiler had to be raised by above the inside gear, raising the centre of gravity on the locomotive.

The main visual difference between the K and K1 classes was at the front end: the K1 incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the third cylinder and associated Holcroft valve gear assembly from the elements. It also featured a new cab design with redesigned single front spectacle plates, and a pair of substantially constructed steps were fitted behind both outside cylinders to provide access to the running plate. The lack of a middle cylinder on the K class locomotives had allowed the provision of a footplate that curved from the buffers to the water tanks. The K1 prototype emerged from Ashford works as No. A890, and underwent trials from 1 December 1925 before entering regular service. Only one locomotive of the K1 class was built; plans to build a further ten (Nos. A891-A900) alongside a batch of five <a href="SECR%20N1%20class">N1 class</a> 2-6-0s were cancelled after the Sevenoaks accident in August 1927. Following rebuilding as a 2-6-0 tender locomotive in 1928, No. A890 was reclassified U1 and was the forerunner of twenty more basically similar locomotives built in 1931.

The K class prototype operated without a name until 1925, when the Southern Railway's publicity department decided to name all express passenger locomotives. The locomotives constructed from 1925 were named after rivers found within the Southern Railway's operating area, and the class became known collectively as the River class. The first-completed Southern Railway K class No. A791 was named "River Adur" whilst the former SECR prototype was given the name "River Avon"; names were also allocated to the cancelled 1926 batch of locomotives. The K1 class locomotive No. A890 was named "River Frome". The names were displayed on a rectangular brass nameplate fitted to the water tank sides.

The K class was intended to haul the SECR's Kent expresses, and was trialled between Charing Cross, , and . A trial non-stop run between and by No. 790 pulling a train of had proved the water capacity of the side tanks to be insufficient for such runs. No. 790 was also tested on fast Cannon Street, and Tonbridge trains during the spring of 1922, although rough riding between the latter two stations meant slower speeds over that part of route on subsequent runs.

The Southern Railway's motive power re-organisation following <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">the Grouping of 1923</a> expanded the class for operations over the Central section. The Westinghouse-fitted Armstrong Whitworth batch was used on the air-braked and expresses and regular passenger service trains to <a href="Portsmouth%20and%20Southsea%20railway%20station">Portsmouth</a>. The vacuum-braked Brighton batch was run-in on the Portsmouth route in preparation for operating the <a href="North%20Downs%20Line">Redhill–Reading line</a>, the class regularly hauling the daily <a href="Birkenhead%20Woodside%20railway%20station">Birkenhead</a>–Dover through train. The K1 was mainly rostered to haul the early evening express from Cannon Street to Dover Marine.

The K class proved successful on well-maintained track. It was capable of high speeds on express passenger duties, although their use was limited by the lower storage capacity of tank locomotives, which meant the K and K1 classes were prone to water shortages on the long Kent Coast routes, and precluded them from working many of the former <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">London and South Western Railway</a> (LSWR) routes west of London. The need to save weight meant that compromises were made in some aspects of the design. The boiler size was constrained by the SECR’s axle-loading restrictions, with the result that the design’s full steaming potential was not realised. The failure to capitalise upon a larger boiler would also affect Maunsell’s subsequent 2-6-0 classes, as they were given the same boiler despite their lower axle-loadings.

On the Southern Railway's Central and Eastern sections, crews complained that the locomotives rolled heavily and unpredictably on the cheaply laid track of the former SECR and LBSCR networks, leading to their nickname, "Rolling Rivers". The rolling was in part caused by the type of coil suspension and steadying springs used on the Bissel truck and bogie axles, which caused adverse springing on poor track. These were modified in later batches, with limited success. The rough-riding was also attributed to the <a href="Locomotive%20frame">frames</a>, which were of insubstantial construction to save weight. The bracing proved incapable of counteracting the stresses applied to the frames when travelling at speed and caused excessive vibration on the footplate at higher outputs.

The K1 prototype was slightly faster and more powerful than the K class, and gave a smoother ride at low speeds. It was also found to have a wider route availability due to the smaller outside cylinders. However, the <a href="Holcroft%20valve%20gear">Holcroft valve gear</a> proved to be difficult to maintain in everyday service. This locomotive was also noted for particularly poor riding characteristics at high speed, derailing twice in 1927. The first derailment occurred at , near <a href="Maidstone">Maidstone</a> on 31 March, when the flanges of the lead coupled wheel mounted the rails at . The second derailment was at on 20 August, when the lead driving wheel mounted and completely dropped off the rails at , derailing the train and causing serious damage to the track. These derailments were attributed to the slightly higher centre of gravity of the boiler on the K1. Although the official reports of these accidents blamed the poor quality of the track, a group of directors sought to have both classes banned from use on passenger services, but were overruled by the Southern Railway's Chairman of the Board of Directors, <a href="Everard%20Baring">Everard Baring</a> on grounds of cost.


The K and K1 classes suffered from stability problems when travelling at speed over points and curves. The locomotive would initially roll (briefly lean heavily) to one side, followed by several further rolls of gradually reducing amplitude, combined with a side-slipping movement that caused the driving wheels to mount the rails. Several minor derailments of members of the class were followed by the serious <a href="Sevenoaks%20railway%20accident">derailment of No. A800 "River Cray" at Sevenoaks</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, in August 1927, caused by a combination of a surge in the water tanks and the flanges of the locomotive's lead driving wheels mounting the rail at speed due to poor quality track-work. The locomotive was hauling a Cannon Street to express with a <a href="Pullman%20%28car%20or%20coach%29">Pullman carriage</a> when the leading driving wheels derailed at over <a href="catch%20points">catch points</a> in a <a href="Cutting%20%28transportation%29">cutting</a>. Several carriages were flung against a road bridge, injuring 40 and killing 13 passengers.

In the days following the accident, two K and K1 class engines were trialled on the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a>'s (LNER) <a href="Great%20Northern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29">Great Northern</a> mainline under the supervision of that company's CME, <a href="Nigel%20Gresley">Nigel Gresley</a>, to gain an unbiased review of their riding qualities. Locomotives No. A803 (K) and No. A890 (K1), and <a href="LSWR%20N15%20class">King Arthur class</a> No. E782, were tested on the well-maintained LNER line between and in October 1927, where few problems were found with locomotive stability. On runs between <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">Kings Cross</a> and with the LNER's <a href="dynamometer%20car">dynamometer car</a>, No. A890 was recorded at a top speed of and A803 at , with no problems in riding. When these engines returned from the LNER, the Southern Railway's General Manager, <a href="Herbert%20Ashcombe%20Walker">Sir Herbert Walker</a> ordered further trials to be led by <a href="John%20Aspinall%20%28engineer%29">Sir John Aspinall</a> on the <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Operations">Western section</a> main line near . These were terminated by the Southern Railway's Operating Department, as the riding of the locomotives at speeds near rendered the locomotives unsafe. The instability of No. A890 at speed was attributed to the helical springs on the Bissel truck and bogie.

The 1928 accident inquiry did not attach blame to the Southern Railway for track maintenance or locomotive performance issues, and noted that the prototype had run for eight years over the same stretch of line without complaint. However, it identified the Brighton batch and No. A890 as being more susceptible to rolling on sharp curves with weak rail joints, although the entire class operated without incident on the former LBSCR network. The management of the Southern Railway realised that to have any success in operating the K class tanks on other parts of the network, vast stretches of track would require upgrading. With the prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst the necessary upgrading took place, the management recommended the class be fully withdrawn from service. To recoup the expense of constructing the engines, Maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to the new <a href="SR%20U%20class">SR U class</a> 2-6-0 tender engine design in 1928. This decision also reduced the adverse publicity generated by the accident. However, many of the components discarded during the rebuilding process would later be re-used on another 2-6-4 tank locomotive designed to haul heavy freight on short trips: the 3-cylinder <a href="SR%20W%20class">W class</a> of 1932.

The rebuilding of the class as tender locomotives was cheaper than relaying track, particularly as in most respects the class had performed well. Rebuilding took place at <a href="Ashford%20Works">Ashford</a>, <a href="Brighton%20Works">Brighton</a> and <a href="Eastleigh%20railway%20works">Eastleigh railway works</a> between March and December 1928, where the water tanks, rear bogie and coal bunker were removed. The straight-sided variant of Maunsell tender was attached, allowing a greater operational range for the locomotives. The rear bogies were later used on the <a href="SR%20W%20class">SR W class</a> 2-6-4 tank locomotives (the only subsequent use of this wheel arrangement by the Southern Railway, and their use was restricted to freight operations around London). The solitary K1 class locomotive was rebuilt in June 1928, and so became the three-cylinder prototype of the <a href="SR%20U1%20class">SR U1 class</a>. The <a href="Holcroft%20valve%20gear">Holcroft valve gear</a> was later replaced with a third set of <a href="Walschaerts%20valve%20gear">Walschaerts valve gear</a> in February 1932, thus reducing maintenance. None of the rebuilds retained their names.

As members of the U and U1 classes, rebuilds were used mainly on <a href="Mixed-traffic%20locomotive">mixed-traffic</a> as well as secondary passenger duties on lines between the main routes. They were used all over the Southern Railway network, but were little-used over the steep track gradients west of Exeter. The smaller-wheeled <a href="SECR%20N%20class">N class</a> was preferred amongst crews for the same duties, as high-speed running was rare away from the main lines in the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a>. Heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid's <a href="SR%20West%20Country%20and%20Battle%20of%20Britain%20classes">Unrebuilt "Light Pacifics"</a>, which were within weight restrictions in this area. The 21 rebuilt locomotives entered British Railways service in 1948. From 1955 a few were given replacement <a href="locomotive%20frame">frames</a> at overhaul: these had a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and the smokebox.

Withdrawals took place between 1962 and 1966, by which time many of the rebuilds were based at <a href="Guildford%20%28Surrey%29%20railway%20station">Guildford</a> <a href="Motive%20power%20depot">shed</a>. Work was taken over by <a href="Oliver%20Bulleid">Oliver Bulleid</a>'s <a href="SR%20West%20Country%20and%20Battle%20of%20Britain%20classes">"Light Pacifics"</a>, and the electrification of much of the former Southern Railway network was imminent, making all the 2-6-0s surplus to requirements from 1963. The final rebuild was withdrawn from service in June 1966.

The K class prototype was painted in an unlined <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Livery%20and%20numbering%20system">dark grey</a> livery with white lettering and numbering. This Maunsell grey livery was introduced by the SECR as a wartime economy measure. On <a href="Railways%20Act%201921">Grouping in 1923</a>, the SR replaced the liveries of the constituent companies with a standard <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Livery%20and%20numbering%20system">sage green</a> livery (the colour being that previously used by Urie on the <a href="London%20and%20South%20Western%20Railway">LSWR</a>) with black and white lining, primrose yellow numbering and "Southern" on the tender. From 1925, the K and K1 classes were repainted in a darker <a href="Southern%20Railway%20%28Great%20Britain%29%23Livery%20and%20numbering%20system">olive green</a> livery, introduced by Maunsell, with plain white lining and primrose yellow markings. When rebuilt into the U and U1 classes, the locomotives were repainted in the olive green livery with "Southern" added to the tender tank. This was carried into the Second World War when labour shortages meant that many U class locomotives were painted in plain black, with the result that by 1945 all the class were running in black.

The class prototype was initially numbered 790, with the rest following consecutively with a prefix "A" to denote a locomotive designed for the former SECR. The system of prefixes had been adopted by the SR to distinguish between locomotives with identical numbers acquired from different companies, and the K1 class became No. A890 when built in 1925. This system was replaced from 1928 by a renumbering of all locomotives into one sequence, in which the K class rebuilds became Nos. 1790–1809, and the K1 class rebuild became No. 1890.

The K and K1 classes were absorbed by <a href="British%20Railways">British Railways</a> as part of the U and U1 classes in 1948, which were given the BR <a href="power%20classification">power classification</a> 4MT (mixed-traffic) in 1950. This was later revised to 4P3F in the light of operational experience on freight trains. The locomotives at first retained their Southern Railway livery, with "British Railways" added to the tender when repaints were due. From 1949 to 1955, the U and U1 class locomotives were gradually repainted in the British Railways mixed-traffic lined black livery with red, cream and grey lining and the British Railways crest on the tender. Numbers were changed to the British Railways standard numbering system: the series 31790–31809 was allocated to the K class rebuilds, and 31890 to the K1 class.

Sir Nigel Gresley's independent report on the K and K1 classes during the mainline stability trials stated that they were well designed, mechanically reliable and capable of hauling expresses at high speeds on well-maintained track, which meant that they could have been useful additions to the Southern Railway's suburban commuter fleet. However, they were undoubtedly prone to rough riding and instability, and not only on the poorest quality tracks. The restricted water capacity also limited their use outside the Southern Railway's Central section. The impending electrification of the <a href="Brighton%20Main%20Line">Brighton Main Line</a>, scheduled for 1932 also meant that fewer duties suitable for heavy passenger tank locomotives would be available in the 1930s. The lack of a suitable role for both classes was considered when the decision was made to rebuild them as <a href="SR%20U%20class">U</a>/<a href="SR%20U1%20class">U1</a> tender engines following <a href="Sevenoaks%20railway%20accident">the Sevenoaks disaster</a>. In rebuilt form they continued to operate until the 1960s, and were capable of attaining speeds in excess of 70 mph (110 km/h) with a greater degree of stability.

One K class rebuild has survived: No. A806 "River Torridge" – converted to U class No. 1806 – was rescued from <a href="Woodham%20Brothers">Woodham Brothers</a> scrap yard in <a href="Barry%2C%20Vale%20of%20Glamorgan">Barry, Vale of Glamorgan</a>, <a href="South%20Wales">South Wales</a> in October 1976 for use on the <a href="Watercress%20Line">Watercress Line</a>. It was restored to ex-British Railways condition as No. 31806. In August 2014, the locomotive entered service with the <a href="Swanage%20Railway">Swanage Railway</a>.

Turning Point (2008 wrestling)

Turning Point (2008) was a <a href="professional%20wrestling">professional wrestling</a> <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> (PPV) <a href="List%20of%20TNA%20pay-per-view%20events">event</a> produced by the <a href="Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a> (TNA) <a href="professional%20wrestling%20promotion">promotion</a>, which took place on November 9, 2008 at the <a href="Impact%20Wrestling%20Zone">TNA Impact! Zone</a> in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>. It was the fourth in the <a href="TNA%20Turning%20Point">Turning Point</a> chronology and the first under its name to take place in November. It was originally scheduled for December, but TNA moved it to November in late 2008 for an unknown reason. It was the eleventh event in the 2008 TNA PPV schedule. Eight <a href="professional%20wrestling%20matches">professional wrestling matches</a>, with three involving championships, were featured on the event's <a href="card%20%28sports%29">card</a>.

The main event was for the <a href="TNA%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship">TNA World Heavyweight Championship</a>, in which then-champion <a href="Sting%20%28wrestler%29">Sting</a> defeated the challenger <a href="A.J.%20Styles">A.J. Styles</a>. <a href="Kevin%20Nash">Kevin Nash</a> versus <a href="Samoa%20Joe">Samoa Joe</a> was also featured on the card. Nash defeated Joe in the contest. A <a href="falls%20count%20anywhere%20match">falls count anywhere match</a> pitting <a href="Kurt%20Angle">Kurt Angle</a> against <a href="Abyss%20%28wrestler%29">Abyss</a> was promoted for the undercard, which Angle won. The <a href="TNA%20Legends%20Championship">TNA Legends Championship</a> was defended for the first time by <a href="Booker%20T%20%28wrestler%29">Booker T</a> against <a href="Christian%20Cage">Christian Cage</a> during the show. Booker T was the victor in the bout, thus retaining the championship.

The "<a href="Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter">Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>" reported 30,000 viewers. Turning Point had an attendance of 1,100 people. Bryan and Chris Sokol of the professional wrestling section of the <a href="Canadian%20Online%20Explorer">Canadian Online Explorer</a> website rated Turning Point a 7 out of 10, which was just above the <a href="Turning%20Point%20%282007%29">2007 event's</a> rating of 6.5. In his review, Phil Allely of the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>'s "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>" newspaper felt Turning Point was "a thoroughly enjoyable show".

In October 2017, with the launch of the <a href="Global%20Wrestling%20Network">Global Wrestling Network</a>, the event became available to stream on demand.

On the first day of 2008, TNA updated their official website to publicize the official dates for all of their PPV events to take place that year. The next installment in the Turning Point chronology was scheduled for December 14, 2008. The date was later changed to December 21, and the location was announced as the <a href="Impact%20Wrestling%20Zone">TNA Impact! Zone</a> in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>. In October 2008, three events were rescheduled: <a href="Genesis%20%282009%29">Genesis</a>, <a href="Final%20Resolution%20%28December%202008%29">Final Resolution</a>, and Turning Point. The first moved was Turning Point to the Genesis event date of November 9, while Final Resolution was announced for some time in December. Genesis was later announced to be taking place in <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a> on January 11, 2009. The song <a href="Indestructible%20%28Disturbed%20song%29">Indestructible</a> by the rock band <a href="Disturbed%20%28band%29">Disturbed</a> was used as the official theme of the event. The promotional poster for the gathering, featuring <a href="Mick%20Foley">Mick Foley</a>, was released through PPV providers.

Turning Point featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and <a href="Narrative%20thread">storylines</a>. Wrestlers were portrayed as either <a href="Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">villains</a> or <a href="Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">heroes</a> in the scripted events which built tension and culminated with a wrestling match or series of matches.
Heading into Turning Point, TNA's main storyline was an <a href="Kayfabe">on-screen</a> <a href="Feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">rivalry</a> between professional wrestling veterans, who played the villains and called themselves <a href="The%20Main%20Event%20Mafia">The Main Event Mafia</a> (<a href="Sting%20%28wrestler%29">Sting</a>, <a href="Kurt%20Angle">Kurt Angle</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Nash">Kevin Nash</a>, <a href="Booker%20T%20%28wrestler%29">Booker T</a>, and <a href="Scott%20Steiner">Scott Steiner</a>), and the younger talent of the company, who played the heroic characters and were led by <a href="A.J.%20Styles">A.J. Styles</a> and <a href="Samoa%20Joe">Samoa Joe</a>. Multiple smaller rivalries broke off from this storyline, such as one over the <a href="TNA%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship">TNA World Heavyweight Championship</a> between the reigning champion, Sting, and the challenger, Styles. It began on August 10 at TNA's <a href="Hard%20Justice%20%282008%29">Hard Justice</a> PPV event when Sting assaulted Styles after his encounter with Angle. Sting then defeated Joe, an ally of Styles, at TNA's <a href="Bound%20for%20Glory%20IV">Bound for Glory IV</a> PPV event on October 12 after an assist from Nash, which later sparked a rivalry between Joe and Nash. Sting's and Styles' rivalry soon escalated to a point where storyline co-owner of TNA Mick Foley announced on the October 30 episode of TNA's television program "<a href="TNA%20Impact%21">TNA Impact!</a>" that the two would fight for the championship at Turning Point.

The build to the encounter between Joe and Nash began in December 2007. On December 2, 2007 at the previous <a href="Turning%20Point%20%282007%29">Turning Point</a> event, Joe was scheduled to take part in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20tag%20team%20match%20types%23Multiple%20man%20teamed%20matches">six-man tag team match</a>, partnering with Nash and Nash's longtime <a href="Legit%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">real-life</a> friend <a href="Scott%20Hall%20%28wrestler%29">Scott Hall</a> to face <a href="The%20Angle%20Alliance">The Angle Alliance</a> (Angle, Styles, and <a href="Travis%20Tomko">Tomko</a>). Hall, however, missed the event citing "food poisoning", leaving Joe legitimately angered by the excuse. Joe went on to make an on-camera statement in the ring insulting Hall. Following the incident, TNA began a storyline in which Joe was unhappy with his position in the company for various reasons and had continuous conflicts with Nash. After time, Nash became Joe's on-screen mentor, which led to Joe defeating Angle on April 13 at TNA's <a href="Lockdown%20%282008%29">Lockdown</a> PPV event to become the new TNA World Heavyweight Champion. Joe and Nash's partnership seemed to come to a close after Nash disappeared from TNA television in mid-2008. He returned at Bound for Glory IV where he cost Joe the championship in his match against Sting. On the October 30 episode of "Impact!", Foley announced that Joe would face Nash at Turning Point.

Another bout advertised for the event was Angle versus <a href="Abyss%20%28wrestler%29">Abyss</a> in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Falls%20Count%20Anywhere%20match">falls count anywhere match</a>. At Bound for Glory IV, Angle lost to TNA founder and on-screen co-owner <a href="Jeff%20Jarrett">Jeff Jarrett</a> with Foley as <a href="Referee%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Special%20outside%20referee">Special Guest Enforcer</a>. On the "Impact!" after Bound for Glory IV, Angle challenged Jarrett to another match at Turning Point, however, Jarrett refused. Angered by Jarrett's refusal, Angle began assaulting several wrestlers in TNA to persuade Jarrett into accepting the challenge. On the October 23 episode of "Impact!", Angle challenged Jarrett again to a rematch, which Jarrett again refused. Jarrett, however, recommended Abyss as Angle's opponent, who was a casualty of Angle's attacks the previous week. On the October 30 episode of "Impact!", Angle fought Abyss in a contest which ended in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%23Disqualification">disqualification</a> after Angle struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting Angle against Abyss in a falls count anywhere match at Turning Point.

On the October 23 episode of "Impact!", Booker T introduced a new <a href="Championship%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">championship</a> named the <a href="TNA%20Television%20Championship">TNA Legends Championship</a> and declared himself the inaugural champion. Afterwards, <a href="Christian%20%28wrestler%29">Christian Cage</a>, who had remained neutral in the storyline, entered the arena and challenged Booker T to defend the championship against him at Turning Point. Booker T accepted after he added the stipulation that if Cage lost the encounter he would have to join The Main Event Mafia. Later on the October 30 episode of "Impact!", the match was made official when it was promoted for the event.

The event featured employees other than the wrestlers involved in the matches. There were four overall commentators for the event; <a href="Mike%20Tenay">Mike Tenay</a> and <a href="Don%20West%20%28wrestling%29">Don West</a> provided <a href="English%20language">English</a> commentary, while <a href="Hector%20Guerrero">Hector Guerrero</a> and Willie Urbina served as the <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> announce team. There were three <a href="ring%20announcer">ring announcer</a>s for the spectacle as the normal ring announcer, <a href="David%20Penzer">David Penzer</a>, was used for all but two contests. Retired Army veteran Sean M. Autrey served as the special guest ring announcer for the <a href="Rhino%20%28wrestler%29">Rhino</a> and <a href="Shawn%20Daivari">Sheik Abdul Bashir</a> encounter. <a href="Jeremy%20Borash">Jeremy Borash</a> announced the competitors for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match, using a style similar to <a href="professional%20boxing">professional boxing</a> as made famous by <a href="Michael%20Buffer">Michael Buffer</a>. <a href="Shane%20Sewell">Shane Sewell</a>, <a href="Earl%20Hebner">Earl Hebner</a>, <a href="Rudy%20Charles">Rudy Charles</a>, <a href="Mark%20%26quot%3BSlick%26quot%3B%20Johnson">Mark "Slick" Johnson</a>, and Andrew Thomas participated as <a href="Referee%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">referees</a> for the encounters. Borash and <a href="Lauren%20Brooke%20%28interviewer%29">Lauren Thompson</a> were used as interviewers throughout the event. Besides wrestlers who were appearing in a wrestling role, Jeff Jarrett, Mick Foley, Scott Steiner, and <a href="Matt%20Morgan%20%28wrestler%29">Matt Morgan</a> were also featured in backstage segments. Other than contractual employees being featured, the group <a href="Insane%20Clown%20Posse">Insane Clown Posse</a> (ICP) and Scott Hall were seen in attendance. This was later revealed to have been scripted to occur, as TNA had asked ICP to attend the event, but were unaware of Hall being their guest.

The event commenced with a ten-man <a href="X%20Division">X Division</a> <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Basic%20elimination%20matches">elimination</a> rankings match, which involved <a href="Eric%20Young%20%28wrestler%29">Eric Young</a>, <a href="Xavier%20Woods">Consequences Creed</a>, <a href="Doug%20Williams%20%28wrestler%29">Doug Williams</a>, <a href="Homicide%20%28wrestler%29">Homicide</a>, <a href="Jay%20Lethal">Jay Lethal</a>, <a href="Jimmy%20Rave">Jimmy Rave</a>, <a href="Petey%20Williams">Petey Williams</a>, <a href="Sonjay%20Dutt">Sonjay Dutt</a>, <a href="Hiroshi%20Tanahashi">Tanahashi</a>, and <a href="Volador%20Jr.">Volador</a>. The match was announced as following <a href="Lucha%20Libre%23Style%20of%20wrestling">lucha libre tag team rules</a>, in which a participant could be replaced if thrown from the ring to the floor, but not eliminated from the match unless by pinfall or submission. The order of elimination determined the standings in the X Division towards a future <a href="TNA%20X%20Division%20Championship">TNA X Division Championship</a> match, in storyline. Homicide was injured during the match, thus was declared eliminated after a bad fall to the outside area. Lethal and Young were the final two men in the contest. Young was the victor in the match after slamming Lethal into the mat with a <a href="Suplex%23Northern%20Lights%20suplex">bridging back suplex</a> at 17 minutes.

A <a href="Tag%20team%23Tag%20team%20match%20rules">tag team match</a> pitting the team of <a href="Nicole%20Raczynski">Roxxi</a> and <a href="Shantelle%20Malawski">Taylor Wilde</a> against the team of <a href="Kia%20Stevens">Awesome Kong</a> and <a href="Cheerleader%20Melissa">Raisha Saeed</a>, who were accompanied by <a href="Trenesha%20Biggers">Rhaka Khan</a>, was held. After various maneuvers were performed by each competitor, Wilde gained the pinfall victory on Saeed after forcing her back into the mat with a <a href="Suplex%23German%20suplex">bridging German suplex</a> at eight minutes.

Rhino fought Sheik Abdul Bashir in the <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Variations%20of%20singles%20matches">following bout</a>. Ten-year Army veteran Sean M. Autrey served as the special guest ring announcer for the encounter. The match lasted nine minutes, and came to a finish when Rhino pinned Bashir after a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Spear">tackle</a>.

The <a href="TNA%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">TNA World Tag Team Championship</a> was contested between the reigning champions <a href="Beer%20Money%2C%20Inc.">Beer Money, Inc.</a> (<a href="James%20Storm">James Storm</a> and <a href="Robert%20Roode">Robert Roode</a>), who were accompanied by <a href="Jacqueline%20Moore">Jacqueline</a>, and <a href="The%20Motor%20City%20Machineguns">The Motor City Machineguns</a> of <a href="Alex%20Shelley">Alex Shelley</a> and <a href="Chris%20Sabin">Chris Sabin</a>. After several tag team maneuvers from both teams, Storm spat <a href="beer">beer</a> in Sabin's face, blinding him. This allowed Beer Money to lift up and slam Sabin back-first to the mat with their <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20double-team%20maneuvers%23Powerbomb%2C%20neckbreaker%20combination">Drinking While Investing (DWI)</a> tag team maneuver to gain the pinfall and retain the championship at 17 minutes.

The fifth match was Booker T's defense of the TNA Legends Championship against Christian Cage, with the added stipulation that if Cage lost, he would be forced to join The Main Event Mafia. Booker T was accompanied by <a href="Sharmell%20Sullivan-Huffman">Sharmell</a> for the bout. The match lasted for 11 minutes, ending when Booker T pinned Cage with a <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Roll-up">roll-up</a>.

A Falls Count Anywhere match between Kurt Angle and Abyss followed, lasting 17 minutes. At one point during the encounter while Abyss was standing on the concrete floor and Angle was on the stage, Angle performed a running leap off the stage into a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20aerial%20techniques%23Senton">somersault senton</a>, connecting with Abyss on the floor. Angle was the victor in the bout, after throwing Abyss off of a scaffold through the Spanish announcers' table, then descending and covering Abyss for the pinfall.

Kevin Nash fought Samoa Joe in the seventh contest of the night. The match lasted 12 minutes. At two points during the match, Nash performed his signature <a href="Powerbomb%23Release%20powerbomb">Jackknife Powerbomb</a> with Joe kicking out before the three count. This led to Nash hitting Joe in the groin and placing his feet on the ropes for leverage in his winning pin attempt.

The <a href="Card%20%28sports%29%23Main%20event">main event</a> was for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion, Sting, and the challenger, A.J. Styles. During the 15 minutes the match lasted, Styles executed his aerial technique the <a href="A.J.%20Styles%23In%20wrestling">Spiral Tap</a>, in which he jumps off one of the top padded <a href="turnbuckle">turnbuckle</a>s, spins and flips in mid-air before landing on his opponent. He then ascended the turnbuckle to perform the maneuver once again, but was distracted by Angle and Booker T. Later, Styles missed a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20attacks%23Backflip%20kick">pele kick</a> on Sting, which allowed Sting to counter with a <a href="Pin%20%28professional%20wrestling%29%23Small%20package">small package pin</a> on Styles to retain the championship.

On the November 13 episode of "Impact!", Cage was to be inducted into The Main Event Mafia (MEM), however, they instead turned on and assaulted him. This led to Cage's occasional tag team partner, Rhino, becoming involved in the overall storyline as the leader of the group <a href="The%20TNA%20Front%20Line">The TNA Front Line</a> after he was attacked by MEM on the November 20 episode of "Impact!". During that same telecast, Angle versus Rhino was announced as TNA's Final Resolution event, with the added stipulations that if Angle won he would gain an opportunity to face Jeff Jarrett, while if Rhino won, then Angle was to be released from his TNA contract. Angle went on to defeat Rhino at the event, which led to Angle defeating Jarrett in a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23No%20Disqualification%20match">no disqualification match</a> at TNA's Genesis event in January 2009.

Sting and Styles went on to have another match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Final Resolution. This time, the team of Sting, Steiner, Nash, and Booker T faced off against Styles, Joe, and two mystery partners (The TNA Front Line) in an <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20tag%20team%20match%20types%23Multiple%20man%20teamed%20matches">eight-man tag team match</a>. The stipulations were if anyone from Styles' team pinned a member of Sting's team, then Styles won the TNA Title, while if anyone from Sting's team pinned a member of Styles' team, then Sting retained the title. The match was announced on the November 20 episode of "Impact!". Styles' mystery partners were revealed on the November 27 episode of "Impact!" as <a href="Dudley%20Boyz">Team 3D</a> (<a href="Devon%20Hughes">Brother Devon</a> and <a href="Mark%20LoMonaco">Brother Ray</a>). Sting went on to retain the title at Final Resolution after he pinned Joe.

Eric Young got his TNA X Division Championship match on the November 13 episode of "Impact!" against then-champion Sheik Abdul Bashir. Though he defeated him to become the new champion, a week later the decision was reversed and Young was forced to relinquish the title belt to Bashir due to a controversial ending to their match. Young and Bashir fought for the championship once again at Final Resolution, with referee Shane Sewell interfering in the bout like he had done in the previous encounter, which allowed Young to gain the victory. Afterwards, <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20authority%20figures%23Management%20Director">Management Director</a> <a href="Jim%20Cornette">Jim Cornette</a> stripped Young of the championship. This set up a <a href="Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling%20tournaments%23TNA%20X%20Division%20Championship%20Tournament">tournament for the title</a>, ending at Genesis where Alex Shelley defeated Chris Sabin to become the new champion.

A total of 1,100 people attended the event. In late 2008, "<a href="Dave%20Meltzer%23Wrestling%20Observer%20Newsletter">The Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a>" reported that the number of pay-per-view purchasers for the event was believed to be 30,000. <a href="Canadian%20Online%20Explorer">Canadian Online Explorer</a> writers Bryan and Chris Sokol rated the entire event a 7 out of 10, which was .5 above the 2007 event's rating of 6.5 by Chris Sokol. The falls count anywhere match was given the highest rating during their review, at 8 out of 10. The lowest rating was given to the women's tag team match and the Rhino versus Bashir bout, at 5 out of 10. The main event match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship was rated 7 out of 10. <a href="Wade%20Keller">Wade Keller</a> of the "Pro Wrestling Torch" stated during his review that the falls count anywhere match "had an epic feeling for a falls count anywhere brawl. It had various chapters, many convincing near falls, several creative big spots, and the crowd was into it." While regarding the main event, Keller stated he thought it was a "good match." James Caldwell, also of the "Pro Wrestling Torch", mentioned during his review that Joe versus Nash had "good drama" due to the storyline "with a big game veteran vs. a big game 'Young Lion' in a compelling match-up. Joe losing should be treated as a huge deal with proper follow-up to move Joe up to the next level. If he's losing, it needs to mean something for his overall growth." Phil Allely, a journalist for "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>", stated he felt the event was "a thoroughly enjoyable show". The event was released by <a href="TNA%20Home%20Video">TNA Home Video</a> on DVD on March 24, 2009 as part of the "TNA Wrestling: Cross The Line Vol. 2" box set, which included the December 2008 Final Resolution event and the Genesis 2009 event.

BP Pedestrian Bridge

The BP Pedestrian Bridge, or simply BP Bridge, is a <a href="girder%20bridge">girder</a> <a href="footbridge">footbridge</a> in the <a href="Chicago%20Loop">Loop</a> <a href="Community%20areas%20of%20Chicago">community area</a> of <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago, Illinois</a>, United States. It spans <a href="Columbus%20Drive%20%28Chicago%29">Columbus Drive</a> to connect <a href="Maggie%20Daley%20Park">Maggie Daley Park</a> (formerly, Daley Bicentennial Plaza) with <a href="Millennium%20Park">Millennium Park</a>, both parts of the larger <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a>. Designed by <a href="Pritzker%20Prize">Pritzker Prize</a>-winning architect <a href="Frank%20Gehry">Frank Gehry</a> and structurally engineered by <a href="Skidmore%2C%20Owings%20and%20Merrill">Skidmore, Owings and Merrill</a>, it opened along with the rest of Millennium Park on July 16, 2004. Gehry had been courted by the city to design the bridge and the neighboring <a href="Jay%20Pritzker%20Pavilion">Jay Pritzker Pavilion</a>, and eventually agreed to do so after the <a href="Pritzker%20family">Pritzker family</a> funded the Pavilion.

Named for energy firm <a href="BP">BP</a>, which donated <a href="U.S.%20Dollar">$</a>5 million toward its construction, it is the first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP Bridge is described as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of <a href="sheet%20metal">sheet metal</a>. The bridge is known for its <a href="aesthetics">aesthetics</a>, and Gehry's style is seen in its <a href="Biomorphism">biomorphic</a> allusions and extensive sculptural use of <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> plates to express abstraction.

The <a href="Pedestrian%20separation%20structure">pedestrian bridge</a> serves as a <a href="noise%20barrier">noise barrier</a> for traffic sounds from Columbus Drive. It is a connecting link between Millennium Park and destinations to the east, such as the nearby lakefront, other parts of Grant Park and a <a href="parking%20garage">parking garage</a>. BP Bridge uses a concealed <a href="box%20girder">box girder</a> design with a concrete base, and its deck is covered by hardwood floor boards. It is designed without <a href="handrail">handrail</a>s, using stainless steel <a href="parapet">parapet</a>s instead. The total length is , with a five percent <a href="grade%20%28slope%29">slope</a> on its inclined surfaces that makes it <a href="barrier%20free">barrier free</a> and <a href="Accessibility">accessible</a>. Although the bridge is closed in winter because ice cannot be safely removed from its wooden walkway, it has received favorable reviews for its design and aesthetics.

Since the mid-19th century, Grant Park has been Chicago's "front yard", with <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> to the east and the Loop to the west. <a href="Columbus%20Drive%20%28Chicago%29">Columbus Drive</a> runs north–south through Grant Park, with Daley Bicentennial Plaza in the northeast corner of the park. West of Columbus Drive, the northwest corner of the park had been <a href="Illinois%20Central%20Railroad">Illinois Central</a> rail yards and parking lots until 1997, when it became available for development by the city as Millennium Park. Millennium Park is also north of Monroe Street and the <a href="Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">Art Institute</a>, east of <a href="Michigan%20Avenue%20%28Chicago%29">Michigan Avenue</a>, and south of <a href="Randolph%20Street%20%28Chicago%29">Randolph Street</a>. For 2007, Millennium Park trailed only <a href="Navy%20Pier">Navy Pier</a> as a Chicago tourist attraction.
In February 1999, the city announced it was negotiating with Frank Gehry to design a <a href="proscenium">proscenium</a> arch and orchestra enclosure for a <a href="band%20shell">band shell</a> in the new park, as well as a <a href="pedestrian%20bridge">pedestrian bridge</a> crossing Columbus Drive between Millennium Park and Daley Bicentennial Plaza. The city also sought donors to cover the cost of Gehry's work, which would eventually become Jay Pritzker Pavilion and the BP Pedestrian Bridge. At the time, the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" dubbed Gehry "the hottest architect in the universe" in reference to the acclaim for his <a href="Guggenheim%20Museum%20Bilbao">Guggenheim Museum Bilbao</a>. Millennium Park project manager Edward Uhlir said "Frank is just the cutting edge of the next century of architecture", and noted that no other architect was being sought. Gehry was approached several times by <a href="Skidmore%2C%20Owings%20%26amp%3B%20Merrill">Skidmore, Owings & Merrill</a> architect <a href="Adrian%20Smith%20%28architect%29">Adrian Smith</a> on behalf of the city. In April 1999, the city announced that the Pritzker family had donated $15 million to fund Gehry's band shell and an additional nine donors committed a total of $10 million more to the park. That same day, Gehry agreed to the design request.

In November 1999, when he unveiled his initial plans for the bridge and band shell, Gehry admitted the bridge's design was underdeveloped because funding for it was not yet committed. Even at this early point, the need for a sound barrier for Columbus Drive traffic noise was recognized, although Gehry indicated this might take the form of a <a href="berm">berm</a>, or raised barrier. The need to fund a bridge to span the eight-lane Columbus Drive was evident, but some planning for the park was delayed in anticipation of details on the redesign of <a href="Soldier%20Field">Soldier Field</a>. In January 2000, the city announced plans to expand the park to include features that became "<a href="Cloud%20Gate">Cloud Gate</a>", "<a href="Crown%20Fountain">Crown Fountain</a>", the <a href="McDonald%27s%20Cycle%20Center">McDonald's Cycle Center</a>, and the BP Pedestrian Bridge. Later that month, Gehry unveiled his next design, which depicted a winding bridge.

While the neighboring Jay Pritzker Pavilion changed relatively little from Gehry's 1999 design when built, the bridge went through several proposed designs. The proposal made in early 2000, which was expected to be executed in 2002, included a bridge that was a mere long and wide. That design was not approved, and <a href="Chicago%20Mayor">Chicago Mayor</a> <a href="Richard%20M.%20Daley">Richard M. Daley</a>'s disapproval of Gehry's subsequent design of an bridge caused Gehry to come up with ten more designs. The first of these plans was for a Z-shaped bridge that would have run northwest–southeast with western ramps in Millennium Park, leading south, and eastern ramps in the empty north section of Daley Bicentennial Plaza, leading north. It would have required elevators to conform to the <a href="Americans%20with%20Disabilities%20Act">Americans with Disabilities Act</a>. This plan was abandoned because it would have segregated the handicapped. Gehry had only designed two bridges previously, both in the mid-1990s (Pferdeturm <a href="%C3%BCstra">USTRA</a> Bridge in <a href="Hanover%2C%20Germany">Hanover, Germany</a> and Financial Times Millennium Bridge in <a href="London%2C%20United%20Kingdom">London, United Kingdom</a>) but neither was built.

The final design for the bridge was revealed in an exhibit at the <a href="Chicago%20Cultural%20Center">Chicago Cultural Center</a> on June 10, 2000. As designed and built, the bridge is long and wide, with a Columbus Drive clearance. The clearance was designed to slightly exceed the standard set by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Transportation">United States Department of Transportation</a> <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a> for urban area interstate bridge clearances, and to allow for additional future layers of pavement below. This height is also greater than the maximum vehicle height of set by the Illinois Vehicle Code. According to the "Chicago Tribune" the width of the "trenchlike" area spanned is approximately , while "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" reports the bridge is over ten times longer than Columbus Drive is wide.

BP Bridge begins in Millennium Park between the <a href="Trellis%20%28agriculture%29">trellis</a> system over the Jay Pritzker Pavilion's great lawn and the <a href="Lurie%20Garden">Lurie Garden</a>; the design was changed so that the west ramp coincided with the boardwalk of the Lurie Garden seam. The bridge winds its way northward along the eastern edge of Millennium Park before crossing Columbus Drive in a C-shaped curve, above underground <a href="parking%20garage">parking garage</a> entrances. In Daley Bicentennial Plaza the bridge has an S-shape, then turns east. BP Bridge is designed so that its inclined surfaces have a continuous five percent <a href="Grade%20%28slope%29">slope</a> rather than landings and switchback ramps, which provides easy access for the physically challenged. The gently sloped ramp eliminates the need for lifts or any of the other common types of ramps (L-shaped, switchback, U-shaped, straight), and helped the park earn the 2005 Barrier-Free America Award for its exemplary <a href="barrier-free">barrier-free</a> design.
Gehry had hoped to design the bridge so that it could be constructed without a support column in the center of Columbus Drive. However, "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" architecture critic <a href="Blair%20Kamin">Blair Kamin</a> notes that if he had done so, the bridge might not have been as sleek. Building the bridge without the column would have required load-bearing <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a>s (<a href="Beam%20%28structure%29">beams</a> supported only on one side) from structural positions on opposite sides of the street; this would have been expensive and labor-intensive, because it would have required excavating large portions of the parking garages on both sides of the street. Moreover, on the Daley Bicentennial Plaza side, the optimal location for the supporting cantilever would have been at the location of the Monroe Street Garage. Thus, the preferred bridge design was altered to avoid problems related to the underground parking garages.

The bridge is both a connector and a viewing platform for the park. It was designed to link the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and the entire Loop to the west with the Lake Michigan lakefront to the east. It was also designed to be a berm <a href="noise%20barrier">noise barrier</a> blocking noise on the eight-lane Columbus Drive from the Park's outdoor band shell (Jay Pritzker Pavilion), by deflecting traffic sounds upward.

The bridge, which uses steel <a href="girder">girder</a>s, reinforced concrete <a href="abutment">abutment</a>s and <a href="Deck%20%28bridge%29">deck slabs</a>, hardwood deck, and a stainless steel <a href="wikt%3Aveneer">veneer</a>, cost between $12.1 and $14.5 million. It contains large sculptural plates of <a href="curvilinear">curvilinear</a> stainless steel instead of more standard flat plates. The bridge's curvilinear design gives it a flowing, natural look, instead of the linear, rigid form of standard bridges. Although its steel girders rest on concrete <a href="column">pylons</a> and most of the bridge is solid concrete, the bridge uses a hollow <a href="box%20girder">box girder</a> design to minimize weight, as the ground that supports the bridge covers underground parking garages. The concrete base and box girder are flanked by a hollow stainless steel skeleton. Despite its hollow structure, and the fact that it is designed as a concealed <a href="beam%20bridge">beam bridge</a>, the <a href="footbridge">footbridge</a> is built to highway standards and can support a full capacity load of pedestrians. The bridge is designed without standard <a href="handrail">handrail</a>s and uses waist-high <a href="parapet">parapet</a>s as <a href="guard%20rail">guard rail</a>s instead.

The bridge was built using 22-<a href="Sheet%20metal%20gauge">gauge</a> stainless steel <a href="Stainless%20steel%23Stainless%20steel%20grades">type 316</a> plates ( thick), with an <a href="Brushed%20metal">angel hair finish</a> and a flat interlocking panel process. Stainless steel type 316 is known for its excellent <a href="welding">welding</a> characteristics, as well as for its resistance to <a href="pitting">pitting</a>. According to the "Chicago Tribune", the bridge materials used in construction include 2,000 <a href="dry%20rot">rot</a>-resistant Brazilian <a href="hardwood">hardwood</a> boards for the deck, 115,000 stainless steel <a href="screw">screw</a>s and 9,800 <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless steel</a> <a href="Roof%20shingle">shingle</a> plates. According to Architecture Metal Expertise, the bridge has "10,400 stainless steel trapezoidal panels in 17 different shop fabricated configurations [which] involved 1,000 shop hours". The sheet metal work totaled 5,900 field hours over a six-month period. During construction, about 200 shingles were installed per day. The bridge includes two types of structural steel: steel that is thick and in diameter for the approaches and box girders for the span.

<a href="CATIA">CATIA</a> software was used to handle the complex geometric layout. To ensure accurate fitting and alignment to the sloping, curving sides of the bridge, 4,400 custom-made convex, concave and radiused cladding panels were fabricated on site by sheet metal contractor Custom Metal Fabricators (CMF). CMF used of stainless steel sheet to cover the sides, which have a combined perimeter length of . CMF built special heated enclosures so that work could continue on site through the winter. They designed, fabricated and installed custom <a href="Stainless%20steel%23Stainless%20steel%20grades">type 4</a> brushed stainless steel parapets serving in the place of handrails on the bridge. CMF earned the 2005 Tom Guilfoy Memorial Architectural Sheet Metal Award, by the California chapter of the <a href="Sheet%20Metal%20and%20Air%20Conditioning%20Contractors%27%20National%20Association">Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' National Association</a> for the project. In 2005 it received a Merit Award from the <a href="American%20Iron%20and%20Steel%20Institute%23National%20Steel%20Bridge%20Alliance">National Steel Bridge Alliance</a>, and an Excellence in Structural Engineering award from the <a href="Structural%20Engineers%20Association%20of%20Illinois%20%28SEAOI%29">Structural Engineers Association of Illinois</a>.

On the day that the two halves of the bridge were joined, each side of Columbus Drive was closed for a 12-hour period and a <a href="Crane%20%28machine%29">crane</a> was used to install the girders. Before bringing the crane to the location, <a href="screw%20jack">screw jack</a>s were used to shore up the underground garage roof to hold the crane's weight.

The landscaping surrounding the bridge was redesigned by <a href="landscape%20architect">landscape architect</a> Terry Guen. <a href="Honey%20locust">Honey locust</a>s, <a href="ash%20tree">ash</a> and <a href="maple%20tree">maple tree</a>s were removed and replaced with three varieties of <a href="magnolia">magnolia</a> and more than two dozen ornamental and <a href="Canopy%20%28forest%29">canopy</a> trees along the eastern foot of the bridge in Daley Bicentennial Plaza. Other preliminary construction work included setting reinforcing rods for the bridge in the concrete roof deck of the parking garage located under the park.

Before its official opening, the bridge had a May 22, 2004, private ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by Gehry and Mayor Daley. During the weekend of the ribbon-cutting, Gehry was awarded an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a> from the <a href="School%20of%20the%20Art%20Institute%20of%20Chicago">School of the Art Institute of Chicago</a>. The BP Pedestrian Bridge officially opened, along with the rest of Millennium Park, on July 16, 2004. It remained unnamed at the ribbon-cutting, but before the July park opening, energy firm BP had paid for the bridge sponsorship and naming rights.

Timothy Gilfoyle, author of "Millennium Park: Creating a Chicago Landmark", notes that a controversy surrounds the "tasteless" corporate naming of several of the Park's features, including the bridge, which was named after an <a href="Oil%20major">oil company</a>. It is well documented that naming rights were sold for high fees, and Gilfoyle was not the only one who chastised park officials for selling naming rights to the highest bidder. Public interest groups have crusaded against commercialization of Chicago parks. However, many of the donors have a long history of local philanthropy and the funds were essential to providing necessary financing for several features of the park.

After the park opened, some of the bridge's foibles became apparent. The bridge has had to be closed during the winter because freezing conditions make it unsafe. Since the bridge is over an expressway-like trench of Columbus Drive, shoveling the snow onto passing cars is not an option and the Brazilian hardwood would be damaged by <a href="rock%20salt">rock salt</a>. The city not only mandates that the bridge be swept and washed daily, but also that the parapets be wiped free of fingerprints.

The bridge has also had controversial closures in the summer, which were related to larger park concerns. On September 8, 2005, <a href="Toyota%20Motor%20Sales%20USA">Toyota Motor Sales USA</a> paid $800,000 to rent the bridge and all but four venues in the park from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. On August 7, 2006, <a href="Allstate">Allstate</a> paid $700,000 to rent the bridge and most of the park for a day. The exclusion of commuters who normally walk through the park and tourists lured by its attractions was controversial, though the city said the money raised paid for free public programs in Millennium Park.

The bridge is noted for its sculptural characteristics and Kamin describes it as a delightful pleasure that was designed to emphasize its artistic elements while de-emphasizing its concrete and steel support system. "The New York Times" notes that the artist <a href="Anish%20Kapoor">Anish Kapoor</a>'s attempts to hide the seams of "<a href="Cloud%20Gate">Cloud Gate</a>" were an interesting contrast to Gehry's architectural efforts. Gehry took pride in making the BP Pedestrian Bridge flaunt its seams.

Beginning with Gehry's earliest bridge designs, the bridge was expected to complement the neighboring Pritzker Pavilion. Some have suggested that the bridge and the pavilion are mere extensions of Gehry's work in other cities. For example, according to Gilfoyle, both structures embody Gehry's established asymmetrical style, evoking fluid, continuous motion and sculptural abstraction. They also feature metallic <a href="facades">facades</a> and aesthetic curves, but they are said to be more refined, reduced and dynamic than much of his other work.

Since the 1960s, Gehry has made artistic use of <a href="Scale%20%28zoology%29">scaled</a> animals such as fish and snakes, which first appeared in his architectural designs in the 1980s. Many references to the bridge describe it as <a href="snake">snake</a>like for its winding path, and some even refer to the stainless steel plates as scales with discussion of <a href="reptile">reptilian</a> forms. Kamin calls it "a bridge that resembles a giant silver snake, complete with a scaly skin", while Gehry said he thought the bridge looked like a river, but added he might be the only one who thought that.

The way the bridge flows in a continuum of unexpected directions is a break from Gehry's other work and other more traditional urban and architectural forms nearby. <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning architecture critic Kamin gave the bridge four stars (out of a possible four) in his review and admires how "computers have given Gehry unparalleled formal freedom" to design "the complexity of its geometry" and multidimensional curvatures. The bridge provides views of both the Historic Michigan Boulevard District and Lake Michigan in a way that Kamin says makes it a <a href="Belvedere%20%28structure%29">belvedere</a>. Kamin also recommends anyone having a bad day to stroll across the bridge, adding, "You won't get where you're going quickly, but you'll feel a whole lot better once you're done."
