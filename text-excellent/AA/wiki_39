Burke and Hare murders

The Burke and Hare murders were a series of 16 killings committed over a period of about ten months in 1828 in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland. They were undertaken by William Burke and William Hare, who sold the corpses to <a href="Robert%20Knox">Robert Knox</a> for <a href="dissection">dissection</a> at his <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a> lectures.

Edinburgh was a leading European centre of <a href="anatomy">anatomical</a> study in the early 19th century, in a time when the demand for <a href="cadaver">cadaver</a>s led to a shortfall in legal supply. Scottish law required that corpses used for medical research should only come from those who had died in prison, <a href="suicide">suicide</a> victims, or from <a href="wikt%3Afoundling">foundlings</a> and orphans. The shortage of corpses led to an increase in <a href="body%20snatching">body snatching</a> by what were known as "resurrection men". Measures to ensure graves were left undisturbed exacerbated the shortage. When a lodger in Hare's house died, Hare turned to his friend Burke for advice and they decided to sell the body to Knox. They received what was, for them, the generous sum of £7 10s. A little over two months later, when Hare was concerned that a lodger suffering from fever would deter others from staying in the house, he and Burke murdered her and sold the body to Knox. The men continued their murder spree, probably with the knowledge of their wives. Burke and Hare's actions were uncovered after other lodgers discovered their last victim, Margaret Docherty, and contacted the police.

A forensic examination of Docherty's body indicated she had probably been suffocated, but this could not be proven. Although the police suspected Burke and Hare of other murders, there was no evidence on which they could take action. An offer was put to Hare granting <a href="legal%20immunity">immunity</a> from prosecution if he <a href="Turn%20state%27s%20evidence">turned king's evidence</a>. He provided the details of Docherty's murder and confessed to all 16 deaths; formal charges were made against Burke and his wife for three murders. At the subsequent trial Burke was found guilty of one murder and <a href="Capital%20punishment">sentenced to death</a>. The case against his wife was found <a href="not%20proven">not proven</a>—a Scottish legal <a href="verdict">verdict</a> to <a href="acquittal">acquit</a> an individual but not declare them innocent. Burke was <a href="hanged">hanged</a> shortly afterwards; his corpse was dissected and his skeleton displayed at the Anatomical Museum of <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh%20Medical%20School">Edinburgh Medical School</a> where, as at 2018, it remains.

The murders raised public awareness of the need for bodies for medical research and contributed to the passing of the <a href="Anatomy%20Act%201832">Anatomy Act 1832</a>. The events have made appearances in literature, and been portrayed on screen, either in heavily fictionalised accounts or as the inspiration for fictional works.

In the early 19th century Edinburgh had several pioneering <a href="anatomy">anatomy</a> teachers, including <a href="Alexander%20Monro%20%28secundus%29">Alexander Monro</a>, his son who was <a href="Alexander%20Monro%20%28tertius%29">also called Alexander</a>, <a href="John%20Bell%20%28surgeon%29">John Bell</a>, <a href="John%20Goodsir">John Goodsir</a> and <a href="Robert%20Knox">Robert Knox</a>, all of whom developed the subject into a modern science. Because of their efforts, Edinburgh became one of the leading European centres of anatomical study, alongside <a href="Leiden">Leiden</a> in the Netherlands and the Italian city of <a href="Padua">Padua</a>. The teaching of anatomy—crucial in the study of surgery—required a sufficient supply of <a href="cadaver">cadaver</a>s, the demand for which increased as the science developed. Scottish law determined that suitable corpses on which to undertake the dissections were those who died in prison, <a href="suicide">suicide</a> victims, and the bodies of <a href="wikt%3Afoundling">foundlings</a> and orphans. With the rise in prestige and popularity of medical training in Edinburgh, the legal supply of corpses failed to keep pace with the demand; students, lecturers and grave robbers—also known as <a href="Body%20snatching">resurrection men</a>—began an illicit trade in exhumed cadavers.

The situation was confused by the legal position. Disturbing a grave was a criminal offence, as was the <a href="Grave%20robbery">taking of property from the deceased</a>. Stealing the body was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was £8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker <a href="human%20decomposition">decomposition</a>, and £10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.

By the 1820s the residents of Edinburgh had taken to the streets to protest at the increase in grave robbing. To avoid corpses being disinterred, bereaved families used several techniques in order to deter the thieves: guards were hired to watch the graves, and watchtowers were built in several cemeteries; some families hired a large stone slab that could be placed over a grave for a short period—until the body had begun to decay past the point of being useful for an anatomist. Other families used a <a href="mortsafe">mortsafe</a>, an iron cage that surrounded the coffin. The high levels of vigilance from the public, and the techniques used to deter the grave robbers, led to what the historian Ruth Richardson describes as "a growing atmosphere of crisis" among anatomists because of the shortage of corpses. The historian Tim Marshall considers the situation meant "Burke and Hare took graverobbing to its logical conclusion: instead of digging up the dead, they accepted lucrative incentives to destroy the living".

Knox was an anatomist who had qualified as a doctor in 1814. After contracting <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> as a child, he was blind in one eye and badly disfigured. He undertook service as an army physician at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Battle of Waterloo</a> in 1815, followed by a posting in England and then, during the <a href="Xhosa%20Wars%23Fifth%20War%20%281818%E2%80%9319%29">Cape Frontier War</a> (1819), in southern Africa. He eventually settled in his home town of Edinburgh in 1820. In 1825 he became a fellow of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20Edinburgh">Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh</a>, where he lectured on anatomy. He undertook dissections twice a day, and his advertising promised "a full demonstration on fresh anatomical subjects" as part of every course of lectures he delivered; he stated that his lessons drew over 400 pupils. Clare Taylor, his biographer in the "Dictionary of National Biography", observes that he "built up a formidable reputation as a teacher and lecturer and almost single-handedly raised the profile of the study of anatomy in Britain". Another biographer, Isobel Rae, considers that without Knox, the study of anatomy in Britain "might not have progressed as it did".

William Burke was born in 1792 in <a href="Urney%2C%20County%20Tyrone">Urney</a>, <a href="County%20Tyrone">County Tyrone</a>, Ireland, one of two sons to middle-class parents. Burke, along with his brother, Constantine, had a comfortable upbringing, and both joined the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> as teenagers. Burke served in the Donegal militia until he met and married a woman from <a href="County%20Mayo">County Mayo</a>, where they later settled. The marriage was short-lived; in 1818, after an argument with his father-in-law over land ownership, Burke deserted his wife and family. He moved to Scotland and became a labourer, working on the <a href="Union%20Canal%20%28Scotland%29">Union Canal</a>. He settled in the small village of <a href="Maddiston">Maddiston</a> near <a href="Falkirk">Falkirk</a>, and set up home with Helen McDougal, whom he affectionately nicknamed Nelly; she became his second wife. After a few years, and when the works on the canal were finished, the couple moved to Tanners Close, Edinburgh, in November 1827. They became <a href="Hawker%20%28trade%29">hawkers</a>, selling second-hand clothes to impoverished locals. Burke then became a <a href="Shoemaking">cobbler</a>, a trade in which he experienced some success, earning upwards of £1 a week. He became known locally as an industrious and good-humoured man who often entertained his clients by singing and dancing to them on their doorsteps while plying his trade. Although raised as a <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, Burke became a regular worshipper at <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> religious meetings held in the <a href="Grassmarket">Grassmarket</a>; he was seldom seen without a bible.
William Hare was probably born in <a href="County%20Armagh">County Armagh</a>, <a href="County%20Londonderry">County Londonderry</a> or in <a href="Newry">Newry</a>. His age and year of birth are unknown; when arrested in 1828 he gave his age as 21, but one source states that he was born between 1792 and 1804. Information on his earlier life is scant, although it is possible that he worked in Ireland as an agricultural labourer before travelling to Britain. He worked on the Union Canal for seven years before moving to Edinburgh in the mid-1820s, where he worked as a coal man's assistant. He lodged at Tanner's Close, in the house of a man named Logue and his wife, Margaret Laird, in the nearby <a href="West%20Port%2C%20Edinburgh">West Port</a> area of the town. When Logue died in 1826, Hare may have married Margaret. Based on contemporary accounts, Brian Bailey in his history of the murders describes Hare as "illiterate and uncouth—a lean, quarrelsome, violent and amoral character with the scars from old wounds about his head and brow". Bailey describes Margaret, who was also an Irish immigrant, as a "hard-featured and debauched <a href="wikt%3Avirago">virago</a>".

In 1827 Burke and McDougal went to <a href="Penicuik">Penicuik</a> in <a href="Midlothian">Midlothian</a> to work on the harvest, where they met Hare. The men became friends; when Burke and McDougal returned to Edinburgh, they moved into Hare's Tanner's Close <a href="lodging%20house">lodging house</a>, where the two couples soon acquired a reputation for hard drinking and boisterous behaviour.

On 29 November 1827 Donald, a lodger in Hare's house, died of <a href="edema">dropsy</a> shortly before receiving a quarterly army pension while owing £4 of back rent. After Hare bemoaned his financial loss to Burke, the pair decided to sell Donald's body to one of the local anatomists. A carpenter provided a coffin for a burial which was to be paid for by the local parish. After he left, the pair opened the coffin, removed the body—which they hid under the bed—filled the coffin with <a href="Bark%20%28botany%29">bark</a> from a local <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tanner</a>s and resealed it. After dark, on the day the coffin was removed for burial, they took the corpse to Edinburgh University, where they looked for a purchaser. According to Burke's later testimony, they asked for directions to Professor Monro, but a student sent them to Knox's premises in Surgeon's Square. Although the men dealt with juniors when discussing the possibility of selling the body, it was Knox who arrived to fix the price at £7 10s. Hare received £4 5s while Burke took the balance of £3 5s; Hare's larger share was to cover his loss from Donald's unpaid rent. According to Burke's official confession, as he and Hare left the university, one of Knox's assistants told them that the anatomists "would be glad to see them again when they had another to dispose of".

There is no agreement as to the order in which the murders took place. Burke made two confessions but gave different sequences for the murders in each statement. The first was an official one, given on 3 January 1829 to the <a href="sheriff-substitute">sheriff-substitute</a>, the <a href="procurator%20fiscal">procurator fiscal</a> and the assistant sheriff-clerk. The second was in the form of an interview with the "<a href="Edinburgh%20Courant">Edinburgh Courant</a>" that was published on 7 February 1829. These in turn differed from the order given in Hare's statement, although the pair were agreed on many of the points of the murders. Contemporary reports also differ from the confessions of the two men. More recent sources, including the accounts written by Brian Bailey, Lisa Rosner and <a href="Owen%20Dudley%20Edwards">Owen Dudley Edwards</a>, either follow one of the historic versions or present their own order of events.

Most of the sources agree that the first murder in January or February 1828 was either that of a <a href="miller">miller</a> named Joseph lodging in Hare's house, or Abigail Simpson, a salt seller. The historian Lisa Rosner considers Joseph the more likely; a pillow was used to smother the victim, while later ones were suffocated by a hand over the nose and mouth. The novelist <a href="Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a>, who took a keen interest in the case, also thought the miller was the more likely first victim, and highlighted that "there was an additional motive to reconcile them to the deed", as Joseph was suffering from a fever and had become delirious. Hare and his wife were concerned that having a potentially infectious lodger would be bad for business. Hare again turned to Burke and, after providing their victim with <a href="whisky">whisky</a>, Hare suffocated Joseph while Burke lay across the upper torso to restrict movement. They again took the corpse to Knox, who this time paid £10. Rosner considers the method of murder to be ingenious: Burke's weight on the victim stifled movement—and thus the ability to make noise—while it also prevented the chest from expanding should any air get past Hare's suffocating grip. In Rosner's opinion, the method would have been "practically undetectable until the era of modern forensics".

The order of the two victims next after Joseph is also unclear; Rosner puts the sequence as Abigail Simpson followed by an English male lodger from Cheshire, while Bailey and Dudley Edwards each have the order as the English male lodger followed by Simpson. The unnamed Englishman was a travelling seller of matches and tinder who fell ill with <a href="jaundice">jaundice</a> at Hare's lodging house. As with Joseph, Hare was concerned with the effect this illness might have on his business, and he and Burke employed the same "<a href="modus%20operandi">modus operandi</a>" they had with the miller: Hare suffocating their victim while Burke lay over the body to stop movement and noise. Simpson was a pensioner who lived in the nearby village of <a href="Gilmerton">Gilmerton</a> and visited Edinburgh to supplement her pension by selling salt. On 12 February 1828—the only exact date Burke quoted in his confession—she was invited into the Hares' house and plied with enough alcohol to ensure she was too drunk to return home. After murdering her, Burke and Hare placed the body in a tea-chest and sold it to Knox. They received £10 for each body, and Burke's confession records of Simpson's body that "Dr Knox approved of its being so fresh ... but [he] did not ask any questions". In either February or March that year an old woman was invited into the house by Margaret Hare. She gave her enough whisky to fall asleep, and when Hare returned that afternoon, he covered the sleeping woman's mouth and nose with the bed tick (a stiff mattress cover) and left her. She was dead by nightfall and Burke joined his companion to transport the corpse to Knox, who paid another £10.
Burke met two women in early April: Mary Paterson (also known as Mary Mitchell) and Janet Brown, in <a href="the%20Canongate">the Canongate</a> area of Edinburgh. He bought the two women alcohol before inviting them back to his lodging for breakfast. The three left the tavern with two bottles of whisky and went instead to his brother's house. After his brother left for work, Burke and the women finished the whisky and Paterson fell asleep at the table; Burke and Brown continued talking but were interrupted by McDougal, who accused them of having an affair. A row broke out between Burke and McDougal—during which he threw a glass at her, cutting her over the eye—Brown stated that she did not know Burke was married and left; McDougal also left, and went to fetch Hare and his wife. They arrived shortly afterwards and the two men locked their wives out of the room, then murdered Paterson in her sleep. That afternoon the pair took the body to Knox in a tea-chest, while McDougal kept Paterson's skirt and petticoats; they were paid £8 for the corpse, which was still warm when they delivered it. Fergusson—one of Knox's assistants—asked where they had obtained the body, as he thought he recognised her. Burke explained that the girl had drunk herself to death, and they had purchased it "from an old woman in the Canongate". Knox was delighted with the corpse, and stored it in whisky for three months before dissecting it. When Brown later searched for her friend, she was told that she had left for Glasgow with a travelling salesman.

At some point in early-to-mid 1828 a Mrs Haldane, whom Burke described as "a stout old woman", lodged at Hare's premises. After she became drunk, she fell asleep in the stable; she was smothered and sold to Knox. Several months later Haldane's daughter (either called Margaret or Peggy) also lodged at Hare's house. She and Burke drank together heavily and he killed her, without Hare's assistance; her body was put into a tea-chest and taken to Knox where Burke was paid £8. The next murder occurred in May 1828, when an old woman joined the house as a lodger. One evening while she was intoxicated, Burke smothered her—Hare was not present in the house at the time; her body was sold to Knox for £10. Then came the murder of Effy (sometimes spelt Effie), a "cinder gatherer" who scavenged through bins and rubbish tips to sell her findings. Effy was known to Burke, and had previously sold him scraps of leather for his cobbling business. Burke tempted her into the stable with whisky, and when she was drunk enough he and Hare killed her; Knox gave £10 for the body. Another victim was found by Burke too drunk to stand. She was being helped by a local constable back to her lodgings when Burke offered to take her there himself; the policeman obliged, and Burke took her back to Hare's house where she was killed. Her corpse raised a further £10 from Knox.

Burke and Hare murdered two lodgers in June, "an old woman and a dumb boy, her grandson", as Burke later recalled in his confession. While the boy sat by the fire in the kitchen, his grandmother was murdered in the bedroom by the usual method. Burke and Hare then picked up the boy and carried him to the same room where he was also killed. Burke later said that this was the murder that disturbed him the most, as he was haunted by his recollection of the boy's expression. The tea-chest that was usually used by the couple to transport the bodies was found to be too small, so the bodies were forced into a herring barrel and taken to Surgeons' Square, where they fetched £8 each. According to Burke's confession, the barrel was loaded onto a cart which Hare's horse refused to pull further than the <a href="Grassmarket">Grassmarket</a>. Hare called a porter with a handcart to help him transport the container. Once back in Tanner's Close, Hare took his anger out on the horse by shooting it dead in the yard.

On 24 June Burke and McDougal departed for Falkirk to visit the latter's father. Burke knew that Hare was short of cash and had even pawned some of his clothes. When the couple returned, they found that Hare was wearing new clothes and had surplus money. After he was asked, Hare denied that he had sold another body. Burke checked with Knox, who confirmed Hare had sold a woman's body for £8. It led to an argument between the two men and they came to blows. Burke and his wife moved into the home of his cousin, John Broggan (or Brogan), two streets away from Tanner's Close.

The breach between the two men did not last long. In late September or early October Hare was visiting Burke when Mrs Ostler (also given as Hostler), a washerwoman, came to the property to do the laundry. The men got her drunk and killed her; the corpse was with Dr Knox that afternoon, for which the men received £8. A week or two later one of McDougal's relatives, Ann Dougal (also given as McDougal) was visiting from <a href="Falkirk">Falkirk</a>; after a few days the men killed her by their usual technique and received £10 for the body. Burke later claimed that about this time Margaret Hare suggested killing Helen McDougal on the grounds that "they could not trust her, as she was a Scotch woman", but he refused.

Burke and Hare's next victim was a familiar figure in the streets of Edinburgh, James Wilson, an 18-year-old man with a limp caused by deformed feet. He was <a href="Developmental%20disability">mentally disabled</a> and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson <a href="Vagrancy%20%28people%29">lived on the streets</a> and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret Hare locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like excess whisky—he preferred <a href="Snuff%20%28tobacco%29">snuff</a>—he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. When the body was examined the following day by Knox and his students, several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.
The final victim, killed on 31 October 1828, was Margaret Docherty, a middle-aged Irish woman. Burke lured her into the Broggan lodging house by claiming that his mother was also a Docherty from the same area of Ireland, and the pair began drinking. At one point Burke left Docherty in the company of Helen McDougal while he went out, ostensibly to buy more whisky, but actually to get Hare. Two other lodgers—Ann and James Gray—were an inconvenience to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare's lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret Hare had joined in. At around 9:00 pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children, and saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows at some point in the evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at the end of the bed.

The next day the Grays returned, and Ann became suspicious when Burke would not let her approach a bed where she had left her stockings. When they were left alone in the house in the early evening, the Grays searched the straw and found Docherty's body, showing blood and saliva on the face. On their way to alert the police, they ran into McDougal who tried to bribe them with an offer of £10 a week; they refused. While the Grays reported the murder to the police, Burke and Hare removed the body and took it to Knox's surgery. The police search located Docherty's bloodstained clothing hidden under the bed. Burke and his wife gave different times for Docherty's departure from the house, which raised enough suspicion for the police to take them in for questioning. Early the following morning the police went to Knox's dissecting-rooms where they found Docherty's body; James Gray identified her as the woman he had seen with Burke and Hare. Hare and his wife were arrested that day, as was Broggan; all denied any knowledge of the events.

In total 16 people were murdered by Burke and Hare. Burke stated later that he and Hare were "generally in a state of intoxication" when the murders were carried out, and that he "could not sleep at night without a bottle of whisky by his bedside, and a twopenny candle to burn all night beside him; when he awoke he would take a drink from the bottle—sometimes half a bottle at a draught—and that would make him sleep." He also took <a href="opium">opium</a> to ease his conscience.

On 3 November 1828 a warrant was issued for the detention of Burke, Hare and their wives; Broggan was released without further action. The four suspects were kept apart and statements taken; these conflicted with the initial answers given on the day of their arrests. After Dr Alexander Black, a police surgeon, examined Docherty's body, two forensic specialists were appointed, <a href="Robert%20Christison">Robert Christison</a> and William Newbigging; they reported that it was probable the victim had been murdered by suffocation, but this could not be medically proven. On the basis of the report from the two doctors, the Burkes and Hares were charged with murder. As part of his investigation Christison interviewed Knox, who asserted that Burke and Hare had watched poor lodging houses in Edinburgh and purchased bodies before anyone claimed them for burial. Christison thought Knox was "deficient in principle and heart", but did not think he had broken the law.

Although the police were sure murder had taken place, and that at least one of the four was guilty, they were uncertain whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's son. On 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.

<a href="Sir%20William%20Rae%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir William Rae</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Advocate">Lord Advocate</a>, followed a regular technique: he focused on one individual to extract a confession on which the others could be convicted. Hare was chosen and, on 1 December, he was offered immunity from prosecution if he <a href="Turn%20state%27s%20evidence">turned king's evidence</a> and provided the full details of the murder of Docherty and any other; because he could not be brought to <a href="spousal%20privilege">testify against his wife</a>, she was also exempt from prosecution. Hare made a full confession of all the deaths and Rae decided sufficient evidence existed to secure a prosecution. On 4 December formal charges were laid against Burke and McDougal for the murders of Mary Paterson, James Wilson and Mrs Docherty.

Knox faced no charges for the murders because Burke's statement to the police exonerated the surgeon. Public awareness of the news grew as newspapers and <a href="street%20literature">broadsides</a> began releasing further details. Opinion was against the doctor and, according to Bailey, many in Edinburgh thought he was "a sinister ringmaster who got Burke and Hare dancing to his tune". Several broadsides were published with editorials stating that he should have been in the dock alongside the murderers, which influenced public opinion. A new word was coined from the murders: "<a href="wikt%3Aburke">burking</a>", to smother a victim or to commit an <a href="anatomy%20murder">anatomy murder</a>, and a rhyme began circulating around the streets of Edinburgh:

The trial began at 10:00 am on Christmas Eve 1828 before the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justiciary">High Court of Justiciary</a> in Edinburgh's <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Edinburgh">Parliament House</a>. The case was heard by the <a href="Lord%20Justice%20Clerk">Lord Justice-Clerk</a>, <a href="David%20Boyle%2C%20Lord%20Boyle">David Boyle</a>, supported by the Lords <a href="Alexander%20Maconochie%2C%20Lord%20Meadowbank">Meadowbank</a>, Pitmilly and Mackenzie. The court was full shortly after the doors were opened at 9:00 am, and a large crowd gathered outside Parliament House; 300 constables were on duty to prevent disturbances, while infantry and cavalry were on standby as a further precaution.

The case ran through the day and night to the following morning; Rosner notes that even a formal postponement of the case for dinner could have raised questions about the validity of the trial. When the charges were read out, the two defence counsels objected to McDougal and Burke being tried together. <a href="Sir%20James%20Wellwood%20Moncreiff%2C%209th%20Baronet">James Moncrieff</a>, Burke's defence lawyer, protested that his client was charged "with three unconnected murders, committed each at a different time, and at a different place" in a trial with another defendant "who is not even alleged to have had any concern with two of the offences of which he is accused". Several hours were spent on legal arguments about the objection. The judge decided that to ensure a fair trial, the indictment should be split into separate charges for the three murders. He gave Rae the choice as to which should be heard first; Rae opted for the murder of Docherty, given they had the corpse and the strongest evidence.

In the early afternoon Burke and McDougal pleaded not guilty to the murder of Docherty. The first witnesses were then called from a list of 55 that included Hare and Knox; not all the witnesses on the list were called and Knox, with three of his assistants, avoided being questioned in court. One of Knox's assistants, David Paterson—who had been the main person Burke and Hare had dealt with at Knox's surgery—was called and confirmed the pair had supplied the doctor with several corpses.

In the early evening Hare took the stand to give evidence. Under cross-examination about the murder of Docherty, Hare claimed Burke had been the sole murderer and McDougal had twice been involved by bringing Docherty back to the house after she had run out; Hare stated that he had assisted Burke in the delivery of the body to Knox. Although he was asked about other murders, he was not obliged to answer the questions, as the charge related only to the death of Docherty. After Hare's questioning, his wife entered the witness box, carrying their baby daughter who was suffering from <a href="whooping%20cough">whooping cough</a>. Margaret used the child's coughing fits as a way to give herself thinking time for some of the questions, and told the court that she had a very poor memory and could not remember many of the events.

The final prosecution witnesses were the two doctors, Black and Christison; both said they suspected foul play, but that there was no forensic evidence to support the suggestion of murder. There were no witnesses called for the defence, although the pre-trial declarations by Burke and McDougal were read out in their place. The prosecution summed up their case, after which, at 3:00 am, Burke's defence lawyer began his final statement, which lasted for two hours; McDougal's defence lawyer began his address to the jury on his client's behalf at 5:00 am. Boyle then gave his summing up, directing the jury to accept the arguments of the prosecution. The jury retired to consider its verdict at 8:30 am on Christmas Day and returned fifty minutes later. It delivered a guilty verdict against Burke for the murder of Docherty; the same charge against McDougal they found <a href="not%20proven">not proven</a>. As he passed the <a href="Capital%20punishment">death sentence</a> against Burke, Boyle told him:

McDougal was released at the end of the trial and returned home. The following day she went to buy whisky and was confronted by a mob who were angry at the not proven verdict. She was taken to a police building in nearby <a href="Fountainbridge">Fountainbridge</a> for her own protection, but after the mob laid siege to it, she escaped through a back window to the main police station off Edinburgh's High Street. She tried to see Burke, but permission was refused; she left Edinburgh the next day, and there are no clear accounts of her later life. On 3 January 1829, on the advice of both Catholic priests and Presbyterian clergy, Burke made another confession. This was more detailed than the official one provided prior to his trial; he placed much of the blame for the murders on Hare.

On 16 January 1829 a petition on behalf of James Wilson's mother and sister, protesting against Hare's immunity and intended release from prison, was given lengthy consideration by the High Court of Justiciary and rejected by a vote of 4 to 2. Margaret Hare was released on 19 January and travelled to Glasgow to find a passage back to Ireland. While waiting for a ship she was recognised and attacked by a mob. She was given shelter in a police station before being given a police escort onto a Belfast-bound vessel; no clear accounts exist of what became of her after she landed in Ireland.
Burke was <a href="hanged">hanged</a> on the morning of 28 January 1829 in front of a crowd possibly as large as 25,000; views from windows in the tenements overlooking the scaffold were hired at prices ranging from 5 to 20 shillings. On 1 February his corpse was publicly dissected by Professor Monro in the anatomy theatre of the university's <a href="Old%20College%2C%20University%20of%20Edinburgh">Old College</a>. Police had to be called when large numbers of students gathered demanding access to the lecture for which a limited number of tickets had been issued. A minor riot ensued; calm was restored only after one of the university professors negotiated with the crowd that they would be allowed to pass through the theatre in batches of fifty, after the dissection. During the procedure, which lasted for two hours, Monro dipped his quill pen into Burke's blood and wrote "This is written with the blood of Wm Burke, who was hanged at Edinburgh. This blood was taken from his head".

Burke's skeleton was given to the Anatomical Museum of the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh%20Medical%20School">Edinburgh Medical School</a> where, as at 2018, it remains. His <a href="death%20mask">death mask</a> and a book said to be <a href="Anthropodermic%20bibliopegy">bound with his tanned skin</a> can be seen at <a href="Surgeons%27%20Hall">Surgeons' Hall Museum</a>.

Hare was released on 5 February 1829—his extended stay in custody had been undertaken for his own protection—and was assisted in leaving Edinburgh in disguise by the mailcoach to <a href="Dumfries">Dumfries</a>. At one of its stops he was recognised by a fellow-passenger, <a href="Erskine%20Douglas%20Sandford">Erskine Douglas Sandford</a>, a junior counsel who had represented Wilson's family; Sandford informed his fellow passengers of Hare's identity. On arrival in Dumfries the news of Hare's presence spread and a large crowd gathered at the hostelry where he was due to stay the night. Police arrived and arranged for a decoy coach to draw off the crowd while Hare escaped through a back window and into a carriage which took him to the town's prison for safekeeping. A crowd surrounded the building; stones were thrown at the door and windows and street lamps were smashed before 100 <a href="special%20constables">special constables</a> arrived to restore order. In the small hours of the morning, escorted by a sheriff officer and militia guard, Hare was taken out of town, set down on the Annan Road and instructed to make his way to the English border. There were no subsequent reliable sightings of him and his eventual fate is unknown.
Knox refused to make any public statements about his dealings with Burke and Hare. The common thought in Edinburgh was that he was culpable in the events; he was lampooned in caricature and, in February, a crowd gathered outside his house and burned an effigy of him. A committee of inquiry cleared him of complicity, and reported that they had "seen no evidence that Dr Knox or his assistants knew that murder was committed in procuring any of the subjects brought to his rooms". He resigned from his position as curator of the College of Surgeons' museum, and was gradually excluded from university life by his peers. He left Edinburgh in 1842 and lectured in Britain and mainland Europe. While working in London he fell foul of the regulations of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Royal College of Surgeons</a> and was debarred from lecturing; he was removed from the roll of fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1848. From 1856 he worked as a pathological anatomist at the <a href="The%20Royal%20Marsden%20NHS%20Foundation%20Trust">Brompton Cancer Hospital</a> and had a medical practice in Hackney until his death in 1862.

The question of the supply of cadavers for scientific research had been promoted by the English <a href="philosopher">philosopher</a> <a href="Jeremy%20Bentham">Jeremy Bentham</a> before the crimes of Burke and Hare took place. A <a href="Parliamentary%20select%20committees%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">parliamentary select committee</a> had drafted a "Bill for preventing the unlawful disinterment of human bodies, and for regulating Schools of Anatomy" in mid 1828—six months before the murders were detected. This was rejected in 1829 by the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>.

The murders committed by Burke and Hare raised public awareness of the need for bodies for medical purposes, and of the trade that doctors had conducted with grave robbers and murderers. The East London murder of a 14-year-old boy and the subsequent attempt to sell the corpse to the medical school at <a href="King%27s%20College%20London">King's College London</a> led to an investigation of the <a href="London%20Burkers">London Burkers</a>, who had recently turned from grave robbing to murder to obtain corpses; two men were hanged in December 1831 for the crime. A bill was quickly introduced into Parliament, and gained <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> nine months later to become the <a href="Anatomy%20Act%201832">Anatomy Act 1832</a>. This Act authorised dissection on bodies from <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>s unclaimed after 48 hours, and ended the practice of anatomising as part of the death sentence for murder.

The events of the West Port murders have made appearances in fiction. They are referred to in <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>'s 1884 short story "<a href="The%20Body%20Snatcher">The Body Snatcher</a>", and <a href="Marcel%20Schwob">Marcel Schwob</a> told their story in the last chapter of "Imaginary Lives" (1896), while the Edinburgh-based author <a href="Elizabeth%20Byrd">Elizabeth Byrd</a> used the events in her novels "Rest Without Peace" (1974) and "The Search for Maggie Hare" (1976). The murders have also been portrayed on stage and screen, usually in heavily fictionalised form.

David Paterson, Knox's assistant, contacted Walter Scott to ask the novelist if he would be interested in writing an account of the murders, but he declined, despite Scott's long-standing interest in the events. Scott later wrote:

Shah Rukh Khan

Shah Rukh Khan (born Shahrukh Khan; 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor, film producer, and television personality. Referred to in the media as the "<a href="Padishah">Badshah</a> of Bollywood", "King of Bollywood" and "King Khan", he has appeared in more than 80 <a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a> films, and earned <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">numerous accolades</a>, including 14 <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>. For his contributions to film, the Government of India honoured him with the <a href="Padma%20Shri">Padma Shri</a>, and the Government of France awarded him both the <a href="Ordre%20des%20Arts%20et%20des%20Lettres">Ordre des Arts et des Lettres</a> and the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Légion d'honneur</a>. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the <a href="Non-resident%20Indian%20and%20person%20of%20Indian%20origin">Indian diaspora</a> worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, he has been described as one of the most successful film stars in the world.

Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s. He made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with "<a href="Deewana%20%281992%20film%29">Deewana</a>". Early in his career, Khan was recognised for portraying villainous roles in the films "<a href="Darr">Darr</a>" (1993), "<a href="Baazigar">Baazigar</a>" (1993) and "<a href="Anjaam">Anjaam</a>" (1994). He then rose to prominence after starring in a series of romantic films, including "<a href="Dilwale%20Dulhania%20Le%20Jayenge">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</a>" (1995), "<a href="Dil%20To%20Pagal%20Hai">Dil To Pagal Hai</a>" (1997), "<a href="Kuch%20Kuch%20Hota%20Hai">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>" (1998), "<a href="Mohabbatein">Mohabbatein</a>" (2000) and "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</a>" (2001). Khan earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in "<a href="Devdas%20%282002%20Hindi%20film%29">Devdas</a>" (2002), a NASA scientist in "<a href="Swades">Swades</a>" (2004), a hockey coach in "<a href="Chak%20De%21%20India">Chak De! India</a>" (2007) and a man with <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> in "<a href="My%20Name%20Is%20Khan">My Name Is Khan</a>" (2010). His highest-grossing films include the romantic comedy "<a href="Chennai%20Express">Chennai Express</a>" (2013), the heist comedy "<a href="Happy%20New%20Year%20%282014%20film%29">Happy New Year</a>" (2014), the action film "<a href="Dilwale%20%282015%20film%29">Dilwale</a>" (2015), and the crime film "<a href="Raees%20%28film%29">Raees</a>" (2017). Many of his films display themes of Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.

As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company <a href="Red%20Chillies%20Entertainment">Red Chillies Entertainment</a> and its subsidiaries, and is the co-owner of the <a href="Indian%20Premier%20League">Indian Premier League</a> cricket team <a href="Kolkata%20Knight%20Riders">Kolkata Knight Riders</a>. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. The media often label him as "Brand SRK" because of his many endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. Khan's philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a>'s Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children's education and the <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a>'s Crystal Award in 2018 for his leadership in championing women's and children's rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in <a href="Indian%20culture">Indian culture</a>, and in 2008, "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world.

Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> family in <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>. He spent the first five years of his life in <a href="Mangalore">Mangalore</a>, where his maternal grandfather, Ifthikar Ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s. According to Khan, his paternal grandfather, Jan Muhammad, an ethnic <a href="Pashtuns">Pashtun</a>, was from <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Khan's father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">Indian independence</a> activist in Peshawar, <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a> (present-day <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>). As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's <a href="Qissa%20Khawani%20Bazaar">Qissa Khawani Bazaar</a>. Meer was a follower of <a href="Khan%20Abdul%20Ghaffar%20Khan">Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan</a>, and affiliated with the <a href="Indian%20National%20Congress">All Indian National Congress</a>. He moved to New Delhi in 1948 after the <a href="partition%20of%20India">partition of India</a>. Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, was the daughter of a senior government engineer. His parents were married in 1959. Khan described himself on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> as "half <a href="Hyderabadi%20Muslims">Hyderabadi</a> (mother), half Pathan (father), [and] some <a href="Kashmiri%20people">Kashmiri</a> (grandmother)". His paternal cousins in Peshawar claim that the family is of <a href="Hindkowans">Hindkowan</a> origin from Kashmir, not Pashtun, and also contradict the claim that his grandfather was from Afghanistan.

Khan grew up in the <a href="Rajendra%20Nagar%2C%20Delhi">Rajendra Nagar</a> neighbourhood of Delhi. His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments. Khan attended <a href="St.%20Columba%27s%20School%2C%20Delhi">St. Columba's School</a> in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football, and received the school's highest award, the Sword of Honour. Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play. Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a>, <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a>, and <a href="Mumtaz%20%28actress%29">Mumtaz</a>. One of his childhood friends and acting partners was <a href="Amrita%20Singh">Amrita Singh</a>, who became a Bollywood actress. Khan enrolled at <a href="Hansraj%20College">Hansraj College</a> (1985–88) to earn his bachelor's degree in Economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi's Theatre Action Group (TAG), where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director <a href="Barry%20John%20%28theatre%20director%29">Barry John</a>. After Hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in <a href="Mass%20Communication">Mass Communication</a>s at <a href="Jamia%20Millia%20Islamia">Jamia Millia Islamia</a>, but left to pursue his acting career. He also attended the <a href="National%20School%20of%20Drama">National School of Drama</a> in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood. His father died of cancer in 1981, and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes. After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh, born in 1960, fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her. Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> mansion.

Although Khan was given the birth name Shahrukh Khan, he prefers his name to be written as Shah Rukh Khan, and is commonly referred to by the acronym SRK. He married <a href="Gauri%20Khan">Gauri Chibber</a>, a <a href="Punjabi%20Hindu">Punjabi Hindu</a>, in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991, after a six-year courtship. They have a son Aryan (born 1997) and a daughter Suhana (born 2000). In 2013, they became parents of a third child, a son named AbRam, who was born through a surrogate mother. Both his elder children have expressed interest in entering the entertainment industry; Khan has stated that Aryan, who is studying film at the <a href="USC%20School%20of%20Cinematic%20Arts">USC School of Cinematic Arts</a> in California, aspires to become a writer-director, while Suhana, who served as assistant director for Khan's film "<a href="Zero%20%282018%20film%29">Zero</a>" (2018), will also enroll to study acting in the United States for higher education. According to Khan, while he strongly believes in <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, he also values his wife's religion. His children follow both religions; at home the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> is situated next to the <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a> deities.

Khan's first starring role was in <a href="Lekh%20Tandon">Lekh Tandon</a>'s television series "Dil Dariya", which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the 1989 series "<a href="Fauji%20%28TV%20series%29">Fauji</a>" becoming his television debut instead. In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai. This led to further appearances in <a href="Aziz%20Mirza">Aziz Mirza</a>'s television series "<a href="Circus%20%28TV%20series%29">Circus</a>" (1989–90) and <a href="Mani%20Kaul">Mani Kaul</a>'s miniseries "<a href="Idiot%20%281992%20film%29">Idiot</a>" (1991). Khan also played minor parts in the serials "Umeed" (1989) and "<a href="Wagle%20Ki%20Duniya">Wagle Ki Duniya</a>" (1988–90), and in the English-language <a href="television%20film">television film</a> "<a href="In%20Which%20Annie%20Gives%20It%20Those%20Ones">In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones</a>" (1989). His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a>, but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.

Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991, citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death. He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood, and was quickly signed to four films. His first offer was for <a href="Hema%20Malini">Hema Malini</a>'s directorial debut "<a href="Dil%20Aashna%20Hai">Dil Aashna Hai</a>", and by June, he had started his first shoot. His film debut was in "<a href="Deewana%20%281992%20film%29">Deewana</a>", which was released in June 1992. In it he starred alongside <a href="Divya%20Bharti">Divya Bharti</a> as the second male lead behind <a href="Rishi%20Kapoor">Rishi Kapoor</a>. "Deewana" became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood career; he earned the <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Male%20Debut%20Award">Filmfare Best Male Debut Award</a> for his performance. Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male lead, "<a href="Chamatkar">Chamatkar</a>", "Dil Aashna Hai", and the comedy "<a href="Raju%20Ban%20Gaya%20Gentleman">Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman</a>", which was his first of many collaborations with the actress <a href="Juhi%20Chawla">Juhi Chawla</a>. His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>", Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was "sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next."

Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: an obsessive lover in "<a href="Darr">Darr</a>", and a murderer in "<a href="Baazigar">Baazigar</a>". "Darr" marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker <a href="Yash%20Chopra">Yash Chopra</a> and his company <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a>. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase "I love you, K-k-k-Kiran" were popular with audiences. For "Darr" he received a nomination for the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance%20in%20a%20Negative%20Role">Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role</a>, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to <a href="Paresh%20Rawal">Paresh Rawal</a> for "<a href="Sir%20%28film%29">Sir</a>". "Baazigar", in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula. In "The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture", Sonal Khullar called the character "the consummate anti-hero". His performance in "Baazigar", which would be his first of many appearances with actress <a href="Kajol">Kajol</a>, won Khan his first <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Filmfare Award for Best Actor</a>. In 2003, the "Encyclopedia of Hindi Cinema" stated that Khan "defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero". Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with <a href="Deepa%20Sahi">Deepa Sahi</a> in "<a href="Maya%20Memsaab">Maya Memsaab</a>", although parts of it were censored by the <a href="Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Certification">Central Board of Film Certification</a>. The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.

In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in <a href="Kundan%20Shah">Kundan Shah</a>'s comedy-drama film "<a href="Kabhi%20Haan%20Kabhi%20Naa">Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa</a>" opposite <a href="Deepak%20Tijori">Deepak Tijori</a> and <a href="Suchitra%20Krishnamurthy">Suchitra Krishnamurthy</a>, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance">Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance</a>, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> referred to it as Khan's best performance, saying "He is spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart." Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in "<a href="Anjaam">Anjaam</a>", co-starring <a href="Madhuri%20Dixit">Madhuri Dixit</a> and Deepak Tijori. At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man's career in Bollywood. Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking "insane risks" and "pushing the envelope" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career in Bollywood. The director <a href="Mukul%20S.%20Anand">Mukul S. Anand</a> called him "the new face of the industry" at the time.

Khan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was <a href="Rakesh%20Roshan">Rakesh Roshan</a>'s melodramatic thriller "<a href="Karan%20Arjun">Karan Arjun</a>". Co-starring <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a> and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. His most significant release that year was <a href="Aditya%20Chopra">Aditya Chopra</a>'s directorial debut, the romance "<a href="Dilwale%20Dulhania%20Le%20Jayenge">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</a>", in which he played a young <a href="Non-resident%20Indian%20and%20person%20of%20Indian%20origin">Non-resident Indian</a> (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol's character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a "romantic hero". Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an "all time blockbuster" by <a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a>, with a gross of over worldwide. It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the <a href="Maratha%20Mandir">Maratha Mandir</a> theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015. The film won ten <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>, including the second of Khan's Best Actor Awards. The director and critic <a href="Raja%20Sen">Raja Sen</a> said, "Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting."

In 1996, all four of Khan's releases failed critically and commercially, but the following year, his starring role opposite <a href="Aditya%20Pancholi">Aditya Pancholi</a> and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza's romantic comedy "<a href="Yes%20Boss%20%28film%29">Yes Boss</a>" earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination. Later in 1997, he starred in <a href="Subhash%20Ghai">Subhash Ghai</a>'s diasporic-themed social drama "<a href="Pardes%20%28film%29">Pardes</a>", portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States.
Khan's final release of 1997 was a second collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance "<a href="Dil%20To%20Pagal%20Hai">Dil To Pagal Hai</a>". He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a <a href="love%20triangle">love triangle</a> between Madhuri Dixit and <a href="Karisma%20Kapoor">Karisma Kapoor</a>. The film and his performance met with critical praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare.

Khan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi Chawla and <a href="Sonali%20Bendre">Sonali Bendre</a> in Mahesh Bhatt's action comedy "<a href="Duplicate%20%281998%20film%29">Duplicate</a>", the first of his many collaborations with <a href="Yash%20Johar">Yash Johar</a>'s production company <a href="Dharma%20Productions">Dharma Productions</a>. The film was not well received, but "India Today" lauded Khan for his energetic performance. The same year, Khan won critical praise for his performance as an <a href="All%20India%20Radio">All India Radio</a> correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (<a href="Manisha%20Koirala">Manisha Koirala</a>) in "<a href="Dil%20Se..">Dil Se..</a>", the third instalment of <a href="Mani%20Ratnam">Mani Ratnam</a>'s trilogy of terror films. In his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in <a href="Karan%20Johar">Karan Johar</a>'s romance "<a href="Kuch%20Kuch%20Hota%20Hai">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>", in which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and <a href="Rani%20Mukerji">Rani Mukerji</a>. The writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as "the" blockbuster of the 1990s, a "pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment." Khan won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second consecutive year, although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol.

The roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers, and according to author <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a>, established him as an icon of romance in India. He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar. Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars, although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.

Khan's only release in 1999 was "<a href="Baadshah%20%281999%20film%29">Baadshah</a>", in which he starred opposite <a href="Twinkle%20Khanna">Twinkle Khanna</a>. Although the film underperformed at the box office, it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Comedian%20Award%232000s">Best Performance in a Comic Role</a>, which he lost to <a href="Govinda%20%28actor%29">Govinda</a> for "<a href="Haseena%20Maan%20Jaayegi">Haseena Maan Jaayegi</a>". Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited. The company's first production, "<a href="Phir%20Bhi%20Dil%20Hai%20Hindustani">Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani</a>" (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure. It was released one week after "<a href="Kaho%20Naa...%20Pyaar%20Hai">Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai</a>", starring <a href="Hrithik%20Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a>, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan. Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan's predictable mannerisms, saying "Frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little." Khan did a supporting role in <a href="Kamal%20Hassan">Kamal Hassan</a>'s "<a href="Hey%20Ram">Hey Ram</a>" (2000), which was made simultaneously in <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> and <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan. He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with <a href="Kamal%20Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a>. On Khan's performance, T. Krithika Reddy of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" wrote, "Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance."

In 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the title role in <a href="Santosh%20Sivan">Santosh Sivan</a>'s historical epic "<a href="A%C5%9Boka%20%28film%29">Aśoka</a>", a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor <a href="Ashoka">Ashoka</a>. The film was screened at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice Film Festival</a> and the <a href="2001%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2001 Toronto International Film Festival</a> to a positive response, but it performed poorly at Indian box offices. As losses continued to mount for the production company, Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited. In December 2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in <a href="Krishna%20Vamsi">Krishna Vamsi</a>'s "". He was subsequently diagnosed with a <a href="prolapsed%20disc">prolapsed disc</a>, and attempted multiple <a href="Alternative%20medicine">alternative therapies</a>. None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films. By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo <a href="anterior%20cervical%20discectomy%20and%20fusion">anterior cervical discectomy and fusion</a> surgery at <a href="Wellington%20Hospital%2C%20London">Wellington Hospital, London</a>. Khan resumed shooting in June 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually.
Successes during this time included Aditya Chopra's "<a href="Mohabbatein">Mohabbatein</a>" (2000), and Karan Johar's family drama "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</a>" (2001), which Khan cites as a turning point in his career. Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men. Khan's performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor</a> for "Mohabbatein". "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..." remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.

In 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya Rai in <a href="Sanjay%20Leela%20Bhansali">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a>'s period romance "<a href="Devdas%20%282002%20Hindi%20film%29">Devdas</a>". At a cost of over , it was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time, yet recovered its costs, earning worldwide. The film earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Khan, and a <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Not%20in%20the%20English%20Language">BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language</a>. Khan next starred in "<a href="Kal%20Ho%20Naa%20Ho">Kal Ho Naa Ho</a>" (2003), a comedy-drama written by Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year. Co-starring with <a href="Jaya%20Bachchan">Jaya Bachchan</a>, <a href="Saif%20Ali%20Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a>, and <a href="Preity%20Zinta">Preity Zinta</a>, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences. Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production of Aziz Mirza's "<a href="Chalte%20Chalte%20%282003%20film%29">Chalte Chalte</a>", and they parted ways, despite the film's success.

2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into <a href="Red%20Chillies%20Entertainment">Red Chillies Entertainment</a>, adding his wife Gauri as a producer. In the company's first production, he starred in <a href="Farah%20Khan">Farah Khan</a>'s directorial debut, the action comedy <a href="masala%20film">masala film</a> "<a href="Main%20Hoon%20Na">Main Hoon Na</a>". A fictionalised account of <a href="India%E2%80%93Pakistan%20relations">India–Pakistan relations</a>, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain. Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra's romance film "<a href="Veer-Zaara">Veer-Zaara</a>", which was screened at the <a href="Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">55th Berlin Film Festival</a> to critical praise. It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over , and "Main Hoon Na" was the second-highest earner with .
In his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a <a href="NASA">NASA</a> scientist who patriotically returns to India to rekindle his roots in <a href="Ashutosh%20Gowariker">Ashutosh Gowariker</a>'s social drama "<a href="Swades">Swades</a>" (meaning "Homeland"), which became the first Indian picture to be shot inside the NASA research centre at the <a href="Kennedy%20Space%20Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> in Florida.
Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of "Bollywoodised realism", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in Hindi cinema. In December 2013, "The Times of India" reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film. <a href="Derek%20Elley">Derek Elley</a> of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" found Khan's performance "unsettling" as "a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian peasants", but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date. He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for "Swades". "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" later included his performance in the 2010 issue of Bollywood's "Top 80 Iconic Performances".

In 2005, Khan starred in <a href="Amol%20Palekar">Amol Palekar</a>'s fantasy drama, "<a href="Paheli">Paheli</a>". The film was India's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the <a href="79th%20Academy%20Awards">79th Academy Awards</a>. He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama "<a href="Kabhi%20Alvida%20Naa%20Kehna">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>" (2006), the story of two unhappily married people in New York City who begin extramarital affairs. The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Preity Zinta, <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a>, Rani Mukerji and <a href="Kirron%20Kher">Kirron Kher</a>, emerged as India's highest-grossing film in the overseas market, earning more than worldwide. Both his roles in "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna" and the action film "<a href="Don%20%282006%20Hindi%20film%29">Don</a>", a remake of the <a href="Don%20%281978%20film%29">1978 film of the same name</a>, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards, despite his performance as the <a href="Don%20%28character%29">titular character</a> in "Don" being negatively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.
In 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coaches the <a href="India%20women%27s%20national%20field%20hockey%20team">Indian women's national hockey team</a> to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films' semi-fictional "<a href="Chak%20De%21%20India">Chak De! India</a>". Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university's hockey team, essentially portrayed himself as a "cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim". Faring well in both India and abroad, Khan garnered another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance, which <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> of <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a> considers to have been "without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks", portraying Kabir Khan "like a real flesh-and-blood human being". "Filmfare" included his performance in their 2010 issue of the "Top 80 Iconic Performances". In the same year, Khan starred
alongside <a href="Arjun%20Rampal">Arjun Rampal</a>, <a href="Deepika%20Padukone">Deepika Padukone</a> and <a href="Shreyas%20Talpade">Shreyas Talpade</a> in Farah Khan's reincarnation melodrama "<a href="Om%20Shanti%20Om">Om Shanti Om</a>", portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad. "Om Shanti Om" earned Khan his second nomination of the year for Best Actor at Filmfare. Khalid Mohammed from "Hindustan Times" wrote, "the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature stylespontaneous and intuitively intelligent".

Khan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic drama "<a href="Rab%20Ne%20Bana%20Di%20Jodi">Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi</a>" (2008) opposite <a href="Anushka%20Sharma">Anushka Sharma</a>, at that time a newcomer. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" believed the dual role to have been "tailor-made" for Khan, giving him the opportunity to display his talents, although Deep Contractor from "Epilogue" thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj. In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in <a href="Mudassar%20Aziz">Mudassar Aziz</a>'s "<a href="Dulha%20Mil%20Gaya">Dulha Mil Gaya</a>". He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had <a href="arthroscopy">arthroscopic surgery</a> in February 2009. He performed an extended, special appearance in the 2009 film "<a href="Billu">Billu</a>", playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khana fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical <a href="item%20number">item number</a>s with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone. As head of the film's production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from "Billu Barber" to "Billu" after hairdressers across the country complained that the word "barber" was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.

After refusing the role that subsequently went to <a href="Anil%20Kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a> in <a href="Danny%20Boyle">Danny Boyle</a>'s "<a href="Slumdog%20Millionaire">Slumdog Millionaire</a>" (2008), Khan began shooting "<a href="My%20Name%20Is%20Khan">My Name Is Khan</a>" (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol. The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">11 September attacks</a>. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a "symbol of assertive <a href="rasa%20%28aesthetics%29">rasa</a> values" and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood. To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition. Upon release, "My Name is Khan" became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India, and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor Dilip Kumar. Jay Wesissberg from "Variety" noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger's sufferer with "averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts", believing it to have been a "standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society's gold seal of approval".

In 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in <a href="Anubhav%20Sinha">Anubhav Sinha</a>'s science fiction superhero film "<a href="Ra.One">Ra.One</a>", his first work in this genre, as a favour to his children. The film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed as Bollywood's most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of . Despite negative media coverage of the film's box office performance, "Ra.One" was a financial success with a gross of . The film, and Khan's portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero G, though they criticised his portrayal of the videogame designer Shekhar. Khan's second release of 2011 was "<a href="Don%202">Don 2</a>", a sequel to "Don" (2006). To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively and performed most of the stunts himself. His performance earned him positive reviews from critics; <a href="Nikhat%20Kazmi">Nikhat Kazmi</a> of "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" said, "Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts". The year's highest grossing Bollywood production abroad, it was showcased at the <a href="62nd%20Berlin%20International%20Film%20Festival">62nd Berlin International Film Festival</a>.

Khan's only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra's last picture, the drama "<a href="Jab%20Tak%20Hai%20Jaan">Jab Tak Hai Jaan</a>", which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite <a href="Katrina%20Kaif">Katrina Kaif</a> and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that Khan's first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one. "Jab Tak Hai Jaan" was a moderate financial success earning over worldwide. The film was showcased at the 2012 <a href="Marrakech%20International%20Film%20Festival">Marrakech International Film Festival</a> in Morocco, along with "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...", "Veer-Zaara", and "Don 2". At the following <a href="Zee%20Cine%20Awards">Zee Cine Awards</a>, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra's other past heroines.

In 2013, Khan starred in <a href="Rohit%20Shetty">Rohit Shetty</a>'s action comedy "<a href="Chennai%20Express">Chennai Express</a>" for Red Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and a fair amount of criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture, although the film included a tribute to <a href="Tamil%20cinema">Tamil cinema</a> star <a href="Rajinikanth">Rajinikanth</a>. The critic Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for "re-rendering every old trick in the acting book". Despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad, surpassing "<a href="3%20Idiots">3 Idiots</a>" to briefly become the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Bollywood%20films">highest grossing Bollywood film of all time</a>, with a gross of almost in worldwide ticket sales. On 7 March 2013a day before <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Day">International Women's Day</a>"The Times of India" reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success. In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan's ensemble comedy "<a href="Happy%20New%20Year%20%282014%20film%29">Happy New Year</a>", which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan and <a href="Boman%20Irani">Boman Irani</a>; his third collaboration with the director. Although Khan's unidimensional character was criticised, the film became a major commercial success grossing worldwide.

Khan next appeared alongside Kajol, <a href="Varun%20Dhawan">Varun Dhawan</a> and <a href="Kriti%20Sanon">Kriti Sanon</a> in Rohit Shetty's comedy-drama "<a href="Dilwale%20%282015%20film%29">Dilwale</a>" (2015). The film garnered negative reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of . <a href="Namrata%20Joshi">Namrata Joshi</a> of "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" commented, "With "Dilwale", Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer". Joshi also felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired. He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in <a href="Maneesh%20Sharma">Maneesh Sharma</a>'s thriller "<a href="Fan%20%28film%29">Fan</a>" (2016). <a href="Peter%20Bradshaw">Peter Bradshaw</a> of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" considered the film to be "exhausting, bizarre yet watchable" and thought that Khan was aptly "creepy" as the obsessive admirer. The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to mainstream formula. Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (played by <a href="Alia%20Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a>) in <a href="Gauri%20Shinde">Gauri Shinde</a>'s coming-of-age film "<a href="Dear%20Zindagi">Dear Zindagi</a>".

In <a href="Rahul%20Dholakia">Rahul Dholakia</a>'s crime-drama film "<a href="Raees%20%28film%29">Raees</a>" (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-heroa bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of "<a href="The%20Telegraph%20%28Calcutta%29">The Telegraph</a>" thought Khan's performance to be "inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms". Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning about worldwide. Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (played by Anushka Sharma) in <a href="Imtiaz%20Ali%20%28director%29">Imtiaz Ali</a>'s "<a href="Jab%20Harry%20Met%20Sejal">Jab Harry Met Sejal</a>" (2017). Writing for "<a href="Mint%20%28newspaper%29">Mint</a>", Uday Bhatia criticised Khan's pairing with Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed "similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age". The film proved to be a box office flop. Khan next reunited with Sharma and Katrina Kaif in <a href="Aanand%20L%20Rai">Aanand L Rai</a>'s comedy-drama "<a href="Zero%20%282018%20film%29">Zero</a>" (2018), in which he played Bauua Singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle. The film received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan's performance. Writing for "Hindustan Times", Raja Sen commended his "dominating performance and tremendous energy" and <a href="Anna%20M.%20M.%20Vetticad">Anna M. M. Vetticad</a> of "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>" called him an "excellent fit" for the role for allowing his "naturally energetic personality, comic timing and charm to take flight". Commercially, it failed to do well. According to a Box Office India report, Khan's stardom was impacted by his films failing to do well.

Khan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited. After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment, which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising. As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films. Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of "Ra.One" (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film's characters. Khan has occasionally done <a href="Playback%20singer">playback singing</a> for his films. In "Josh" (2000) he sang the popular song "Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila". He also sang in "Don" (2006) and "Jab Tak Hai Jaan" (2012). For "<a href="Always%20Kabhi%20Kabhi">Always Kabhi Kabhi</a>" (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition.

In addition to his early television serial appearances, Khan has hosted numerous televised awards shows, including the Filmfare, Zee Cine, and <a href="Screen%20Awards">Screen Awards</a>. In 2007, he replaced Amitabh Bachchan for one season as the host of "<a href="Kaun%20Banega%20Crorepati">Kaun Banega Crorepati</a>", the Indian version of "<a href="Who%20Wants%20to%20Be%20a%20Millionaire%3F">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a>", and a year later, Khan began hosting "<a href="Kya%20Aap%20Paanchvi%20Pass%20Se%20Tez%20Hain%3F">Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?</a>", the Indian version of "<a href="Are%20You%20Smarter%20Than%20a%205th%20Grader%3F">Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?</a>".

Contrary to his earlier television anchoring jobs, "Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout" performed poorly. It aired for only one season and became the lowest rated show hosted by a Bollywood star. In 2017, Khan began hosting "<a href="TED%20Talks%20India%20Nayi%20Soch">TED Talks India Nayi Soch</a>", a talk show produced by <a href="TED%20%28conference%29">TED Conferences, LLC</a> which started aired on <a href="STAR%20Plus">STAR Plus</a>.

Khan started an association with the "Temptations" series of concert tours by singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside Arjun Rampal, Priyanka Chopra, and other Bollywood stars in Temptations 2004, a stage show that toured 22 venues across the world. The show played to 15,000 spectators at <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a>'s Festival City Arena.

The team performed poorly on the field during the first three years. Their performance improved over time, and they became the champions for the first time in <a href="2012%20Indian%20Premier%20League">2012</a> and repeated the feat in <a href="2014%20Indian%20Premier%20League">2014</a>. The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14).

Khan performed alongside <a href="Sunidhi%20Chauhan">Sunidhi Chauhan</a> and <a href="Shriya%20Saran">Shriya Saran</a> at the opening ceremony of the <a href="Indian%20Premier%20League">IPL</a> 2011 season, where they danced to Tamil songs.

In May 2012, the <a href="Mumbai%20Cricket%20Association">Mumbai Cricket Association</a> (MCA) banned him from the <a href="Wankhede%20Stadium">Wankhede Stadium</a> for five years for getting into an argument with the security staff after a match between KKR and the <a href="Mumbai%20Indians">Mumbai Indians</a>. Khan had, however, stated that he acted only after children, including his daughter, were being "manhandled" by the security staff and that the officials were extremely high-handed and aggressive in their behavior, he had been abused with communal indecent comment. Later MCA officials had accused him of being drunk in one version of the story, hitting the guard and of completely uncharacteristically abusing a female supporter of Mumbai Indians after the match in another version of the story, which Khan had maintained it was done to support their action and for cheap publicity. Wankhede guard later contradicted MCA officials' claim and said Shah Rukh Khan had not hit him. Khan later apologized to his fans after his team won the final match. MCA revoked the ban in 2015 and in 2016, Mumbai Police informed that no 'cognisable offence' was made out against Khan and they had come to the conclusion that Shah Rukh Khan was not drunk and did not use abusive language before minors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2012.

Shah Rukh Khan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in India, and is often referred to as "King Khan", "The <a href="Padishah">Baadshah</a> of Bollywood", or "The King of Bollywood". Anupama Chopra cites him as an "ever present celebrity", with two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads, and gigantic billboards lining the streets of Indian cities. He is the object of a sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion. "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" named Khan as one of their fifty most powerful people globally in 2008 and called him "the world's biggest movie star". In 2011 he was declared "the biggest movie star you've never heard of...perhaps the world's biggest movie star, period" by Steven Zeitchik of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" and has been called the world's biggest movie star in other international media outlets. According to a popularity survey, 3.2 billion people around the world know Shah Rukh Khan, more than who know <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>. Khan is one of the wealthiest celebrities in India, topping the "Forbes" India's "Celebrity 100 list" in 2012, 2013 and 2015. His wealth has been estimated at US$400–600 million. Khan owns several properties in India and abroad, including a apartment in London, and a villa on the <a href="Palm%20Jumeirah">Palm Jumeirah</a> in Dubai.

Khan frequently appears on listings of the most popular, stylish and influential people in India. He has regularly featured among the top ten on "The Times of India"s list of the 50 most desirable men in India, and in a 2007 poll by the magazine "<a href="Eastern%20Eye">Eastern Eye</a>" he was named the sexiest man in Asia. Khan is often referred to as "Brand SRK" by media organisations because of his many brand endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. He is one of the highest paid Bollywood endorsers and one of the most visible celebrities in television advertising, with up to a six per cent share of the television advertisement market. Khan has endorsed brands including <a href="Pepsi">Pepsi</a>, <a href="Nokia">Nokia</a>, <a href="Hyundai">Hyundai</a>, <a href="Dish%20TV">Dish TV</a>, <a href="D%27decor">D'decor</a>, <a href="Lux%20%28soap%29">LUX</a> and <a href="TAG%20Heuer">TAG Heuer</a>. Books have been published about him, and his popularity has been documented in several non-fiction films, including the two-part documentary "<a href="The%20Inner%20and%20Outer%20World%20of%20Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan</a>" (2005), and the <a href="Discovery%20Travel%20%26amp%3B%20Living">Discovery Travel & Living</a> channel's ten-part miniseries "Living with a SuperstarShah Rukh Khan" (2010). In 2007, Khan became the third Indian actor to have his wax statue installed at London's <a href="Madame%20Tussauds">Madame Tussauds</a> museum, after Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan. Additional versions of the statue were installed at Madame Tussauds' museums in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, New York and Washington.

Khan has been brand ambassador of various governmental campaigns, including <a href="Pulse%20Polio">Pulse Polio</a> and the <a href="National%20AIDS%20Control%20Organisation">National AIDS Control Organisation</a>. He is a member of the board of directors of the <a href="Make-A-Wish%20Foundation">Make-A-Wish Foundation</a> in India, and in 2011 he was appointed by <a href="UNOPS">UNOPS</a> as the first global ambassador of the <a href="Water%20Supply%20and%20Sanitation%20Collaborative%20Council">Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council</a>.

Grand Coulee Dam

Grand Coulee Dam is a concrete <a href="gravity%20dam">gravity dam</a> on the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, built to produce <a href="hydroelectric">hydroelectric</a> power and provide irrigation water. Constructed between 1933 and 1942, Grand Coulee originally had only two powerhouses. The third powerhouse, completed in 1974 to increase energy production, makes Grand Coulee the largest power station in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> by <a href="Nameplate%20capacity">nameplate-capacity</a> at 6,809 MW.

The proposal to build the dam was the focus of a bitter debate during the 1920s between two groups. One group wanted to irrigate the ancient <a href="Grand%20Coulee">Grand Coulee</a> with a gravity canal while the other pursued a high dam and pumping scheme. The dam supporters won in 1933, but for fiscal reasons the initial design was for a "low dam" tall which would generate electricity without supporting irrigation. That year, the <a href="U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">U.S. Bureau of Reclamation</a> and a consortium of three companies called MWAK (Mason-Walsh-Atkinson Kier Company) began construction. After visiting the construction site in August 1934, President <a href="Franklin%20Delano%20Roosevelt">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a> endorsed the "high dam" design which, at high, would provide enough electricity to pump water into the Columbia basin for irrigation. <a href="U.S.%20Congress">Congress</a> approved the high dam in 1935 and it was completed in 1942. The first waters overtopped Grand Coulee's spillway on of that year.

Power from the dam fueled the growing industries of the Northwest United States during <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>. Between 1967 and 1974, the third powerplant was constructed. The decision to construct the additional facility was influenced by growing energy demand, regulated river flows stipulated in the <a href="Columbia%20River%20Treaty">Columbia River Treaty</a> with Canada, and competition with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Through a series of upgrades and the installation of <a href="pumped-storage">pump-generators</a>, the dam now supplies four power stations with an installed capacity of 6,809 <a href="megawatt">MW</a>. As the centerpiece of the <a href="Columbia%20Basin%20Project">Columbia Basin Project</a>, the dam's reservoir supplies water for the irrigation of .

The <a href="reservoir">reservoir</a> is called <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt%20Lake">Franklin Delano Roosevelt Lake</a>, named after the United States President who presided over the dam's authorization and completion. Creation of the reservoir forced the relocation of over 3,000 people, including <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a>s whose ancestral lands were partially flooded. While the dam does not contain fish passage, neither does the next downstream dam, <a href="Chief%20Joseph%20Dam">Chief Joseph Dam</a>. This means no salmon reach the Grand Coulee Dam. The second large dam downstream, <a href="Rocky%20Reach%20Dam">Rocky Reach Dam</a>, has an intricate system of fish ladders to accommodate yearly salmon spawning and migration.

The <a href="Grand%20Coulee">Grand Coulee</a> is an ancient river bed on the <a href="Columbia%20Plateau">Columbia Plateau</a> created during the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> Epoch (Calabrian) by retreating glaciers and floods. Originally, geologists believed a glacier that diverted the Columbia River formed the Grand Coulee, but it was revealed in the mid-late 20th century that massive floods from <a href="Lake%20Missoula">Lake Missoula</a> carved most of the gorge. The earliest known proposal to irrigate the Grand Coulee with the Columbia River dates to 1892, when the "Coulee City News" and "The Spokesman Review" reported on a scheme by a man named Laughlin McLean to construct a dam across the Columbia River, high enough that water would back up into the Grand Coulee. A dam that size would have its reservoir encroach into Canada, which would violate treaties. Soon after the Bureau of Reclamation was founded, it investigated a scheme for pumping water from the Columbia River to irrigate parts of central Washington. An attempt to raise funds for irrigation failed in 1914, as Washington voters rejected a bond measure.

In 1917, William M. Clapp, a lawyer from <a href="Ephrata%2C%20Washington">Ephrata, Washington</a>, proposed the Columbia be dammed immediately below the Grand Coulee. He suggested a concrete dam could flood the plateau, just as nature blocked it with ice centuries ago. Clapp was joined by James O'Sullivan, another lawyer, and by Rufus Woods, publisher of "<a href="The%20Wenatchee%20World">The Wenatchee World</a>" newspaper in the nearby agricultural centre of <a href="Wenatchee%2C%20Washington">Wenatchee</a>. Together, they became known as the "Dam College". Woods began promoting the Grand Coulee Dam in his newspaper, often with articles written by O'Sullivan.

The dam idea gained popularity with the public in 1918. Backers of reclamation in Central Washington split into two camps. The "pumpers" favored a dam with pumps to elevate water from the river into the Grand Coulee from which canals and pipes could irrigate farmland. The "ditchers" favored diverting water from northeast Washington's <a href="Pend%20Oreille%20River">Pend Oreille River</a> via a gravity canal to irrigate farmland in Central and Eastern Washington. Many locals such as Woods, O'Sullivan and Clapp were pumpers, while many influential businessmen in Spokane associated with the <a href="Washington%20Water%20and%20Power%20Company">Washington Water and Power Company</a> (WWPC) were staunch ditchers. The pumpers argued that hydroelectricity from the dam could cover costs and claimed the ditchers sought to maintain a monopoly on electric power.

The ditchers took several steps to ensure support for their proposals. In 1921, WWPC secured a preliminary permit to build a dam at <a href="Kettle%20Falls">Kettle Falls</a>, about upstream from the Grand Coulee. If built, the Kettle Falls Dam would have lain in the path of the Grand Coulee Dam's reservoir, essentially blocking its construction. WWPC planted rumors in the newspapers, stating exploratory drilling at the Grand Coulee site found no granite on which a dam's foundations could rest, only clay and fragmented rock. This was later disproved with Reclamation-ordered drilling. Ditchers hired General <a href="George%20W.%20Goethals">George W. Goethals</a>, engineer of the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>, to prepare a report. Goethals visited the state and produced a report backing the ditchers. The Bureau of Reclamation was unimpressed by Goethals' report, believing it filled with errors. In , President <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> visited Washington state and expressed support for irrigation work there, but died a month later. His successor, <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>, had little interest in irrigation projects. The Bureau of Reclamation, desirous of a major project that would bolster its reputation, was focusing on the <a href="Boulder%20Canyon%20Project">Boulder Canyon Project</a> that resulted in the <a href="Hoover%20Dam">Hoover Dam</a>. Reclamation was authorized to conduct a study in 1923, but the project's cost made federal officials reluctant. The Washington state proposals received little support from those further east, who feared the irrigation would result in more crops, depressing prices. With President Coolidge opposed to the project, bills to appropriate money for surveys of the Grand Coulee site failed.
In 1925, Congress authorized a <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> study of the Columbia River. This study was included in the Rivers and Harbors Act of , which provided for studies on the navigation, power, flood control and irrigation potential of rivers. In , the Army Corps responded with the first of the "308 Reports" named after the 1925 House Document No. 308 (69th Congress, 1st Session). With the help of Washington's Senators, <a href="Wesley%20Jones">Wesley Jones</a> and <a href="Clarence%20Dill">Clarence Dill</a>, Congress ordered $600,000 in further studies to be carried out by the Army Corps and <a href="Federal%20Power%20Commission">Federal Power Commission</a> on the Columbia River Basin and <a href="Snake%20River">Snake River</a>s. U.S. Army Major John Butler was responsible for the upper Columbia River and Snake River and in 1932, his 1,000-page report was submitted to Congress. It recommended the Grand Coulee Dam and nine others on the river, including some in Canada. The report stated electricity sales from the Grand Coulee Dam could pay for construction costs. Reclamation—whose interest in the dam was revitalized by the report—endorsed it.

Although there was support for the Grand Coulee Dam, others argued there was little need for more electricity in the Northwest and crops were in surplus. The Army Corps did not believe construction should be a federal project and saw low demand for electricity. Reclamation argued energy demand would rise by the time the dam was complete. The head of Reclamation, <a href="Elwood%20Mead">Elwood Mead</a>, stated he wanted the dam built no matter the cost. President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, who took office in March, 1933, supported the dam because of its irrigation potential and the power it would provide, but he was uneasy with its price tag. For this reason, he supported a "low dam" instead of the "high dam". He provided in federal funding, while Washington State provided $377,000. In 1933, Washington governor <a href="Clarence%20Martin">Clarence Martin</a> set up the Columbia Basin Commission to oversee the dam project, and Reclamation was selected to oversee construction.

On July 16, 1933, a crowd of 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site, and excavation soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and hydroelectricity, though at a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.

Before and during construction, workers and engineers experienced problems. Contracts for companies to construct the various parts of the dam were difficult to award as few companies were sizable enough to fill them. This forced companies to consolidate. In addition, Native American graves had to be relocated and temporary <a href="fish%20ladder">fish ladder</a>s had to be constructed. During construction additional problems included landslides and the need to protect newly poured concrete from freezing. Construction on the downstream <a href="Grand%20Coulee%20Bridge">Grand Coulee Bridge</a> began in and more considerable earth-moving began in August. Excavation for the dam's foundation required the removal of of dirt and stone. To reduce the amount of trucking required in the excavation, a <a href="conveyor%20belt">conveyor belt</a> nearly long was built. To further secure the foundation, workers drilled holes into the granite and filled any fissures with grout, creating a <a href="grout%20curtain">grout curtain</a>. At times, excavated areas collapsed from overburden. In order to secure these areas from further movement and continue excavation, 3-inch (76 mm) diameter pipes were inserted into the mass and chilled with cold liquid from a refrigeration plant. This froze the earth and secured it so construction could continue.

Final contract bidding for the dam began , 1934, in Spokane, and four bids were submitted. One bid was from a lawyer with no financial backing; another was from actress <a href="Mae%20West">Mae West</a> which consisted of nothing more than a poem and promise to divert the river. Of the two serious bids, the lowest bid was from a consortium of three companies: Silas Mason Co. from Louisville, Kentucky, Walsh Construction Co. of <a href="Davenport%2C%20Iowa">Davenport, Iowa</a> and New York and Atkinson-Kier Company of <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> and <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>. The consortium was known as MWAK and their bid was $29,339,301, almost 15% lower than the option submitted by the next bidder, <a href="Six%20Companies%2C%20Inc.">Six Companies, Inc.</a>, which was building <a href="Hoover%20Dam">Hoover Dam</a> at the time.

Two large <a href="cofferdam">cofferdam</a>s were constructed for the dam, but they were parallel to the river rather than straddling its width, so drilling into the canyon walls was not required. By the end of 1935 about 1,200 workers completed the west and east cofferdams. The west cofferdam was long, thick and was constructed above the bedrock. The cofferdams allowed workers to dry portions of the riverbed and begin constructing the dam, while water continued to flow down the center of the riverbed. In , once the west foundation was complete, portions of the west cofferdam were dismantled, allowing water to flow through part of the dam's new foundation. In , MWAK had begun constructing cofferdams above and below the channel between the east and west cofferdams. By December, the entire Columbia River was diverted over the foundations constructed within the east and west cofferdams. On , 1936, the "Wenatchee Daily World" announced the river was diverted and by early the next year, people were arriving in large numbers to see the riverbed.

On August 4, 1934, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> visited the construction site and was impressed by the project and its purpose. He spoke to workers and spectators, closing with this statement: "I leave here today with the feeling that this work is well undertaken; that we are going ahead with a useful project, and we are going to see it through for the benefit of our country." Soon afterward, Reclamation was allowed to proceed with the high dam plan but faced the problems of transitioning the design and negotiating an altered contract with MWAK. In , for an additional , MWAK and <a href="Six%20Companies%2C%20Inc.">Six Companies, Inc.</a> agreed to join together as Consolidated Builders Inc. and construct the high dam. Six Companies had just finished the Hoover Dam and was nearing completion of <a href="Parker%20Dam">Parker Dam</a>. The new design, chosen and approved by the Reclamation office in Denver, included several improvements, one of which was the irrigation pumping plant.

Roosevelt envisioned the dam would fit into his <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> under the Public Works Administration; it would create jobs, farming opportunities and would pay for itself. In addition, as part of a larger public effort, Roosevelt wanted to keep electricity prices low by limiting private ownership of utility companies, which could charge high prices for energy. Many opposed a federal takeover of the project, including its most prominent supporters, but Washington State lacked the resources to fully realize the project. In , with the help of Roosevelt and a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> decision allowing the acquisition of public land and Indian Reservations, Congress authorized funding for the upgraded high dam under the 1935 River and Harbors Act. The most significant legislative hurdle for the dam was over.

On December 6, 1935, Governor Clarence Martin presided over the ceremonial first <a href="concrete">concrete</a> pour. During construction, bulk concrete was delivered on site by rail-cars where it was further processed by eight large mixers before being placed in form. Concrete was poured into columns by crane-lifted buckets, each supporting eight tons of concrete. To cool the concrete and facilitate curing, about of piping was placed throughout the hardening mass. Cold water from the river was pumped into the pipes, reducing the temperature within the forms from to . This caused the dam to contract about eight inches in length; the resulting gaps were filled with grout.

Until the project began, the stretch of the Columbia River where the dam was to rise was as yet unbridged, making it difficult to move men and materials. In , the Grand Coulee Bridge (a permanent highway bridge) was opened after major delays caused by high water; three additional and temporary bridges downstream had moved vehicles and workers along with sand and gravel for cement mixing. In , MWAK completed the lower dam and Consolidated Builders Inc. began constructing the high dam. The west power house was completed in and about 5,500 workers were on site that year. Between 1940 and 1941, the dam's eleven floodgates were installed on the <a href="spillway">spillway</a> and the dam's first generator went into operation in . The reservoir was full and the first water flowed over the dam's spillway on , 1942, while work was officially complete on , 1943. The last of the original 18 generators did not operate until 1950.

In 1933, Reclamation began efforts to purchase land behind the dam as far as upstream for the future reservoir zone. The reservoir, known later as Lake Roosevelt, flooded and Reclamation acquired an additional around the future shoreline. Within the zone were eleven towns, two railroads, three state highways, about one hundred and fifty miles of country roads, four sawmills, fourteen bridges, four telegraph and telephone systems, and many power lines and cemeteries. All facilities had to be purchased or relocated, and 3,000 residents were relocated. The Anti-Speculation Act was passed in 1937, limiting the amount of land farmers could own to prevent inflated prices. The government appraised the land and offered to purchase it from the affected residents. Many refused to accept the offers, and Reclamation filed condemnation suits. Members of the <a href="Colville%20Confederated%20Tribes">Colville Confederated</a> and <a href="Spokane%20tribe">Spokane tribe</a>s who had settlements within the reservoir zone were also resettled. The Acquisition of Indian Lands for Grand Coulee Dam Act of , 1940, allowed the Secretary of the Interior to acquire land on the Colville and Spokane Reservations, eventually accounting for . By 1942, all land had been purchased at market value: a cost of that included the relocation of farms, bridges, highways and railroads. Relocation reimbursement was not offered to property owners, which was common until U.S. laws changed in 1958.

In late 1938, the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> began clearing what would be of trees and other plants. The cut timber was floated downstream and sold to the highest bidder, Lincoln Lumber Company, which paid $2.25 per thousand board feet. The pace of clearing was accelerated in when it was declared a national defense project, and the last tree was felled on , 1941. The felling was done by Reclamation Supervising Engineer Frank A. Banks and State WPA Administrator Carl W. Smith during a ceremony. 2,626 people living in five main camps along the Columbia worked on the project. When it was finished, had been spent in labor.

Workers building the dam received an average of 80<a href="Cent%20%28currency%29">¢</a> an hour; the payroll for the dam was among the largest in the nation. The workers were mainly pulled from <a href="Grant%20County%2C%20Washington">Grant</a>, <a href="Lincoln%20County%2C%20Washington">Lincoln</a>, <a href="Douglas%20County%2C%20Washington">Douglas</a>, and <a href="Okanogan%20County%2C%20Washington">Okanogan</a> counties and women were allowed to work only in the dorms and the cookhouse. Around 8,000 people worked on the project, and Frank A. Banks served as the chief construction engineer. Bert A. Hall was the chief inspector who would accept the dam from the contractors. Orin G. Patch served as the chief of concrete. Construction conditions were dangerous and 77 workers died.

To prepare for construction, housing for workers was needed along with four bridges downstream of the dam site, one of which, the <a href="Grand%20Coulee%20Bridge">Grand Coulee Bridge</a>, exists today. The Bureau of Reclamation provided housing and located their administrative building at Engineer's Town, which was directly downstream of the construction site on the west side of the river. Opposite Engineer's Town, MWAK constructed Mason City in 1934. Mason city contained a hospital, post office, electricity and other amenities along with a population of 3,000. Three-bedroom houses in the city were rented for $32 a month. Of the two living areas, Engineer's City was considered to have the better housing. Several other living areas formed around the construction site in an area known as Shack Town, which did not have reliable access to electricity and the same amenities as the other towns. Incorporated in 1935, the city of <a href="Grand%20Coulee%2C%20Washington">Grand Coulee</a> supported workers as well and is just west of the dam on the plateau. MWAK eventually sold Mason City to Reclamation in 1937 before its contract was completed. In 1956, Reclamation combined both Mason City and Engineer's Town to form the <a href="Coulee%20Dam%2C%20Washington">city of Coulee Dam</a>. It was incorporated as a city in .

With the onset of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, power generation was given priority over irrigation. In 1943, Congress authorized the <a href="Columbia%20Basin%20Project">Columbia Basin Project</a> and the Bureau of Reclamation began construction of irrigation facilities in 1948. Directly to the west and above the Grand Coulee Dam, the <a href="North%20Dam">North Dam</a> was constructed. This dam, along with the <a href="Dry%20Falls%20Dam">Dry Falls Dam</a> to the south, enclosed and created <a href="Banks%20Lake">Banks Lake</a>, which covered the northern of the <a href="Grand%20Coulee">Grand Coulee</a>. Additional dams, such as the Pinto and <a href="O%27Sullivan%20Dam">O'Sullivan Dam</a>s, were constructed alongside siphons and canals, creating a vast irrigation supply network called the Columbia Basin Project. Irrigation began between 1951 and 1953 as six of the 12 pumps were installed and Banks Lake was filled.

After World War II, the growing demand for electricity sparked interest in constructing another power plant supported by the Grand Coulee Dam. One obstacle to an additional power plant was the great seasonality of the Columbia River's <a href="streamflow">streamflow</a>. Today the flow is closely managed—there is almost no seasonality. Historically, about 75% of the river's annual flow occurred between April and September. During low flow periods, the river's <a href="Discharge%20%28hydrology%29">discharge</a> was between and while maximum spring runoff flows were around . Only nine out of the dam's eighteen generators could run year-round. The remaining nine operated for less than six months a year. In 1952, <a href="U.S.%20Congress">Congress</a> authorized $125,000 for Reclamation to conduct a feasibility study on the Third Powerplant which was completed in 1953 and recommended two locations. Nine identical 108 MW generators were recommended, but as matters stood, they would be able to operate only in periods of high water.

Further regulation of the Columbia's flows was necessary to make the new power plant feasible. It would require water storage and regulation projects in Canada and a treaty to resolve the many economic and political issues involved. The Bureau of Reclamation and <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> explored alternatives that would not depend on a treaty with Canada, such as raising the level of <a href="Flathead%20Lake">Flathead Lake</a> or <a href="Pend%20Oreille%20Lake">Pend Oreille Lake</a>, but both proposals faced strong local opposition. The <a href="Columbia%20River%20Treaty">Columbia River Treaty</a>, which had been discussed between the U.S. and Canada since 1944, was seen as the answer. Efforts to build the Third Powerplant were also influenced by competition with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, which had constructed power plants on the <a href="Volga%20River">Volga River</a> larger than Grand Coulee. On , 1964, the Columbia River Treaty was ratified and included an agreement by Canada to construct the <a href="Duncan%20Dam">Duncan</a>, <a href="Keenleyside%20Dam">Keenleyside</a>, <a href="Mica%20Dam">Mica Dam</a>s upstream and the U.S. would build the <a href="Libby%20Dam">Libby Dam</a> in Montana. Shortly afterward, Washington Senator <a href="Henry%20M.%20Jackson">Henry M. Jackson</a>, who was influential in constructing the new power plant, announced Reclamation would present the project to Congress for appropriation and funding. To keep up with Soviet competition and increase the generating capacity it was determined the generators could be upgraded to much larger designs. With the possibility of international companies bidding on the project, the Soviets who had just installed a 500 MW hydroelectric generator on the <a href="Yenisei%20River">Yenisei River</a> indicated their interest. To avoid the potential embarrassment of an international rival building a domestic power plant, the Department of the Interior declined international bidding. The Third Powerplant was approved and President <a href="Lyndon%20Johnson">Lyndon Johnson</a> signed its appropriation bill on , 1966.
Between 1967 and 1974, the dam was expanded to add the Third Powerplant, with architectural design by <a href="Marcel%20Breuer">Marcel Breuer</a>. Beginning in , this involved demolishing the northeast side of the dam and building a new fore-bay section. The excavation of of dirt and rock had been completed before the new long section of dam was built. The addition made the original dam almost a mile long. Original designs for the powerhouse had twelve smaller units but were altered to incorporate six of the largest generators available. To supply them with water, six diameter <a href="penstock">penstock</a>s were installed. Of the new turbines and generators, three 600 MW units were built by <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20Corporation">Westinghouse</a> and three 700 MW units by <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a>. The first new generator was commissioned in 1975 and the final one in 1980. The three 700 MW units were later upgraded to 805 MW by <a href="Siemens">Siemens</a>.

After power shortages in the Northwest during the 1960s, it was determined the six remaining planned pumps be <a href="pumped-storage">pump-generators</a>. When energy demand is high, the pump-generators can generate electricity with water from the Banks Lake feeder canal adjacent to the dam at a higher elevation. By 1973, the Pump-Generating Plant was completed and the first two generators (P/G-7 and P/G-8) were operational. In 1983, two more generators went online, and by the final two were operational. The six pump-generators added 314 MW to the dam's capacity. In , the Pump-Generating Plant was officially renamed the John W. Keys III Pump-Generating Power Plant after <a href="John%20W.%20Keys">John W. Keys III</a>, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's commissioner from 2001 to 2006.

A major overhaul of the Third Powerplant, which contains generators numbered G19 through G24, began in and will be continuing for many years. Among the projects to be completed before the generators themselves can begin to be overhauled include replacing underground 500 kV oil-filled cables for G19, G20 and G21 generators with overhead transmission lines (started in ), new 236 MW transformers for G19 and G20 (started in ), and several other projects. Planning, design, procurement and site preparation for the 805 MW G22, G23 and G24 generator overhauls are scheduled to begin in 2011, with the overhauls themselves to start in 2013 with the G22 generator, then G23 starting in 2014, and finally G24 starting in 2016, with planned completions in 2014, 2016 and 2017, respectively. The generator overhauls for G19, G20 and G21 have not been scheduled as of 2010.

The dam's primary goal, irrigation, was postponed as the wartime need for electricity increased. The dam's powerhouse began production around the time <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a> began, and its electricity was vital to the war effort. The dam powered aluminum <a href="smelter">smelter</a>s in <a href="Longview%2C%20Washington">Longview</a> and <a href="Vancouver%2C%20Washington">Vancouver, Washington</a>, <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> factories in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> and Vancouver, and Portland's shipyards. In 1943, its electricity was also used for <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> production in <a href="Richland%2C%20Washington">Richland, Washington</a>, at the <a href="Hanford%20Site">Hanford Site</a>, which was part of the top-secret <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. The demand for power at that project was so great that in 1943, two generators originally intended for the <a href="Shasta%20Dam">Shasta Dam</a> were installed at Grand Coulee to hurry the generator installation schedule.

Water is pumped via the Pump-Generating Plant's diameter pipes from <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt%20Lake">Lake Roosevelt</a> to a feeder canal. From the feeder canal, the water is transferred to Banks Lake which has an active storage of . The plant's twelve 65,000–70,000 horsepower pumps can transfer up to to the lake. Currently, the Columbia Basin Project irrigates with a potential for . Over 60 different crops are grown within the project and distributed throughout the United States.

Grand Coulee Dam supports four different power houses containing 33 hydroelectric generators. The original Left and Right Powerhouses contain 18 main generators and the Left has an additional three service generators for total installed capacity of 2,280 MW. The first generator was commissioned in 1941 and all 18 were operating by 1950. The Third Powerplant contains a total of six main generators with a 4,215 MW installed capacity. Generators G-19, G-20 and G-21 in the Third Powerplant have a 600 MW installed capacity but can operate at a maximum capacity of 690 MW which brings the overall maximum capacity of the dam's power facilities to 7,079 MW. The Pump-Generating Plant contains six pump-generators with an installed capacity of 314 MW. When pumping water into Banks Lake they consume 600 MW of electricity. Each generator is supplied with water by an individual <a href="penstock">penstock</a>. The largest of these feed the Third Powerplant and are in diameter and can supply up to . The dam's power facilities originally had an installed capacity of 1,974 MW but expansions and upgrades have increased generation to 6,809 MW installed, 7,079 MW maximum. Grand Coulee Dam generates 21 TWh of electricity annually. This means the dam generates about 2,397 MW of power on average, which results in a total <a href="capacity%20factor">plant factor</a> efficiency of 35%. In 2014, 20.24 TWh of electricity was generated.

Grand Coulee Dam's <a href="spillway">spillway</a> is long and is an overflow, drum-gate controlled type with a maximum capacity. A record flood in May and flooded lowland below the dam and highlighted its limited flood control capability at the time, as its spillway and turbines hit a record flow of . The flood damaged downstream riverbanks and deteriorated the face of the dam and its <a href="flip%20bucket">flip bucket</a> at the base (toe) of the spillway. The flood spurred the Columbia River Treaty and its provisions for dams constructed upstream in Canada, which would regulate the Columbia's flow.

The <a href="Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">Bureau of Reclamation</a> in 1932 estimated the cost of constructing Grand Coulee Dam (not including the Third Powerplant) to be $168 million; its actual cost was $163 million in 1943 ($ in dollars). Expenses to finish the power stations and repair design flaws with the dam throughout the 1940s and '50s added another $107 million, bringing the total cost to $270 million ($ in dollars), about 33% over estimates. The Third Powerplant was estimated to cost in 1967, but higher construction costs and labor disputes drove the project's final cost in 1973 to ($ in dollars), about 55% over estimates. Despite estimates being exceeded, the dam became an economic success, particularly with the Third Powerplant exhibiting a benefit-cost ratio of 2:1. Although Reclamation has only irrigated about half of the land predicted, the gross value of crop output (in constant dollars) had doubled from 1962 to 1992, largely due to different farming practices and crop choices. The Bureau expects the money earned from supplying power and irrigation water will pay off the cost of construction by 2044.

The dam had severe negative consequences for the local <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> tribes whose traditional way of life revolved around <a href="salmon">salmon</a> and the original shrub steppe habitat of the area. Because it lacks a <a href="fish%20ladder">fish ladder</a>, Grand Coulee Dam permanently blocks fish migration, removing over of natural spawning habitat. By largely eliminating <a href="anadromous">anadromous</a> fish above the Okanogan River, the Grand Coulee Dam also set the stage for the subsequent decision not to provide for fish passage at <a href="Chief%20Joseph%20Dam">Chief Joseph Dam</a> (built in 1953). Chinook, Steelhead, Sockeye and Coho salmon (as well as other important species including Lamprey) are now unable to spawn in the reaches of the Upper Columbia Basin. The extinction of the spawning grounds upstream from the dam has prevented the Spokane and other tribes from holding the first salmon ceremony.

Grand Coulee Dam flooded over 21,000 acres (85 km) of prime bottom land where Native Americans had been living and hunting for thousands of years, forcing the relocation of settlements and graveyards. The <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Office of Indian Affairs</a> negotiated with the <a href="United%20States%20Bureau%20of%20Reclamation">United States Bureau of Reclamation</a> on behalf of tribes who were concerned about the flooding of their grave sites. The Acquisition of Indian Lands for Grand Coulee Dam, 54 Stat.703 Act of June 20, 1940 allowed the Secretary of the Interior to remove human remains to new Native American grave sites. The burial relocation project started in September 1939. Human remains were put into small containers and many artifacts were discovered, but the methods of collection destroyed archaeological evidence. Various estimates for the number of relocated graves in 1939 include 915 graves reported by the Bureau of Reclamation Reclamation, or 1,388 reported by Howard T. Ball, who supervised the field work. Tribal leaders reported another 2,000 graves in 1940, but the Bureau of Reclamation would not continue grave relocation, and the sites were soon covered by water.

The town of <a href="Inchelium%2C%20Washington">Inchelium, Washington</a>, home to around 250 Colville Indians, was submerged and later relocated. <a href="Kettle%20Falls">Kettle Falls</a>, once a primary Native American fishing grounds, was also inundated. The average catch of over 600,000 salmon per year was eliminated. In one study, the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> estimated the annual loss was over fish. In , the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation hosted a three-day event called the "Ceremony of Tears", marking the end of fishing at Kettle Falls. Within a year after the Ceremony, the falls were inundated. The town of <a href="Kettle%20Falls%2C%20Washington">Kettle Falls, Washington</a>, was relocated.

The Columbia Basin Project has affected habitat ranges for species such as mule deer, pygmy rabbits and burrowing owls, resulting in decreased populations. However, it has created new habitats such as wetlands, and <a href="Riparian%20zone">riparian corridors</a>. The environmental impact of the dam effectively ended the traditional way of life of the native inhabitants. The government eventually compensated the <a href="Confederated%20Tribes%20of%20the%20Colville%20Reservation">Colville Indians</a> in the 1990s with a lump settlement of approximately , plus annual payments of approximately . As of 2011, the Spokane tribe still seeks compensation, currently through congressional bill H.R. 3097.

To compensate for the lack of ladder, three fisheries have been created above the dam, releasing into the upper Columbia River. One half of the fish are reserved for the displaced tribes, and one quarter of the reservoir is reserved for tribal hunting and boating.

Built in the late 1970s, the Visitor Center contains many historical photos, geological samples, turbine and dam models, and a theater. The building was designed by <a href="Marcel%20Breuer">Marcel Breuer</a>, and resembles a generator rotor. Since , on summer evenings, the <a href="Laser%20Light%20Show%20%28Grand%20Coulee%20Dam%29">laser light show at Grand Coulee Dam</a> is projected onto the dam's wall. The show includes full-size images of battleships and the <a href="Statue%20of%20Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>, as well as some environmental comments. Tours of the Third Powerplant are available to the public and last about an hour. Visitors take a shuttle to view the generators and also travel across the main dam span (otherwise closed to the public) as the formerly used glass elevator is indefinitely out of service.

Folk singer <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a> wrote some of his most famous songs while working in the area in the 1940s. 1941 after a brief stay in Los Angeles, Guthrie and his family moved north to Oregon on the promise of a job. <a href="Gunther%20von%20Fritsch">Gunther von Fritsch</a> was directing a documentary about the <a href="Bonneville%20Power%20Administration">Bonneville Power Administration</a>'s construction of the Grand Coulee Dam on the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a>, and needed a narrator. Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen. The original project was expected to take 12 months, but as filmmakers became worried about casting a political figure like Guthrie, they minimized his role. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Department of the Interior</a> hired him for one month to write songs about the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary's soundtrack. Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest. Guthrie said he "couldn't believe it, it's a paradise", which appeared to inspire him creatively. In one month Guthrie wrote 26 songs, including three of his most famous: "<a href="Roll%20On%2C%20Columbia%2C%20Roll%20On">Roll On, Columbia, Roll On</a>", "<a href="Pastures%20of%20Plenty">Pastures of Plenty</a>", and "<a href="Grand%20Coulee%20Dam%20%28song%29">Grand Coulee Dam</a>". The surviving songs were released as "<a href="The%20Columbia%20River%20Collection%20%28Woody%20Guthrie%20Album%29">Columbia River Songs</a>". The film "Columbia River" was completed in 1949 and featured Guthrie's music. Guthrie had been commissioned in 1941 to provide songs for the project, but it had been postponed by WWII.

Rani Mukerji

Rani Mukerji (; born 21 March 1978) is an Indian film actress. One of the most popular and highest-paid <a href="Hindi%20film">Hindi film</a> actresses in the 2000s, Mukerji has received <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Rani%20Mukerji">several awards</a>, including seven <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>. Her roles have been cited in the media as a significant departure from previous screen portrayals of Indian women.

Although Mukerji was born into the <a href="Mukherjee-Samarth%20family">Mukherjee-Samarth family</a>, in which her parents and relatives were members of the Indian film industry, she did not aspire to pursue a career in film. However, while still a teenager she dabbled with acting by playing a supporting role in <a href="Ram%20Mukherjee">her father</a>'s Bengali language film "<a href="Biyer%20Phool">Biyer Phool</a>" (1996) and accepted a leading role in the 1996 social drama "<a href="Raja%20Ki%20Aayegi%20Baraat">Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat</a>" on the insistence of her mother. She then began a full-time career in films and the 1998 action drama <a href="Ghulam%20%28film%29">"Ghulam"</a> was her first commercial success. She gained wider recognition for a supporting role in the romance "<a href="Kuch%20Kuch%20Hota%20Hai">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>" (1998). The year 2002 marked a turning point for Mukerji when she was cast by <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a> as the star of the drama "<a href="Saathiya%20%28film%29">Saathiya</a>".

By 2004, Mukerji had established herself as a leading actress of Bollywood with roles in the romantic comedy "<a href="Hum%20Tum">Hum Tum</a>" and the dramas "<a href="Yuva">Yuva</a>" and "<a href="Veer-Zaara">Veer-Zaara</a>". She achieved further success for portraying a deaf, blind and mute woman in the acclaimed drama "<a href="Black%20%282005%20film%29">Black</a>" (2005), a con woman in "<a href="Bunty%20Aur%20Babli">Bunty Aur Babli</a>" (2005) and an unhappily married woman in "<a href="Kabhi%20Alvida%20Naa%20Kehna">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>" (2006). Mukerji then collaborated with Yash Raj Films on several unsuccessful films which led critics to bemoan her choice of roles. The semi-biographical thriller "<a href="No%20One%20Killed%20Jessica">No One Killed Jessica</a>" (2011), in which she played a headstrong journalist, proved to be her first box office hit in four years. She followed it by starring in the successful thrillers "" (2012) and "<a href="Mardaani">Mardaani</a>" (2014), and the comedy-drama "<a href="Hichki">Hichki</a>" (2018). The latter emerged as her highest-grossing release.

In addition to acting in films, Mukerji is involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. She has participated in concert tours and stage shows, and featured as a talent judge for the 2009 reality show "<a href="Dance%20Premier%20League">Dance Premier League</a>". Reticent to discuss her personal life in public, Mukerji is married to filmmaker <a href="Aditya%20Chopra">Aditya Chopra</a>, with whom she has a daughter.

Rani Mukerji was born in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> on 21 March 1978. Her father, <a href="Ram%20Mukherjee">Ram Mukherjee</a> (born to the <a href="Mukherjee-Samarth%20family">Mukherjee-Samarth family</a>), is a former film director and one of the founders of Filmalaya Studios. Her mother, Krishna Mukherjee, is a former <a href="playback%20singer">playback singer</a>. Her elder brother, Raja Mukherjee, is a film producer and director. Her maternal aunt, <a href="Debashree%20Roy">Debashree Roy</a>, is a Bengali film actress and her paternal cousin, <a href="Kajol">Kajol</a>, is a Hindi film actress and her contemporary. Another paternal cousin, <a href="Ayan%20Mukerji">Ayan Mukerji</a>, is a scriptwriter and film director. Despite her parents and most of her relatives being members of the Indian film industry, Mukerji was uninterested in pursuing a career in film. She said, "There were already too many actresses at home and I wanted to be someone different".

Mukerji received her education at Maneckji Cooper High School in <a href="Juhu">Juhu</a> and graduated with a degree in <a href="Home%20Science">Home Science</a> from <a href="SNDT%20Women%27s%20University">SNDT Women's University</a>. She is a trained <a href="Odissi%20dance">Odissi dance</a>r and began learning the dance form while in the tenth grade. As part of an annual tradition, the Mukherjee family celebrates the festival of <a href="Durga%20Puja">Durga Puja</a> in the suburban neighbourhood of <a href="Santacruz%2C%20Mumbai">Santacruz</a> every year. Mukerji, a practising <a href="Hindu">Hindu</a>, takes part in the festivities with her entire family.

In 1994, director <a href="Salim%20Khan">Salim Khan</a> approached Mukerji to play the lead female role in his directorial, "<a href="Aa%20Gale%20Lag%20Jaa%20%281994%20film%29">Aa Gale Lag Jaa</a>". Her father disapproved of a full-time career in film at such a young age, so she rejected the offer. At the age of eighteen, Mukerji experimented with acting by portraying a supporting role in her father's <a href="Cinema%20of%20West%20Bengal">Bengali language film</a> "<a href="Biyer%20Phool">Biyer Phool</a>" (1996). The film starred <a href="Prosenjit">Prosenjit</a> and <a href="Indrani%20Haldar">Indrani Haldar</a> in lead roles and narrates the story of two sisters; Mukerji played the younger sibling of Haldar's character. Soon after, Khan approached her with another film offer to play the protagonist of the social drama "<a href="Raja%20Ki%20Aayegi%20Baraat">Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat</a>", Mukerji accepted the role due to her mother's insistence that she continue to pursue acting on an experimental basis. Before she began work on the film, Mukerji trained at Roshan Taneja's acting institute.

Mukerji portrayed a rape victim who is forced to marry her rapist in "Raja Ki Aayegi Baraat", which released in 1996. Although the film was a commercial failure, Mukerji's performance was praised, and she won a special recognition trophy at the annual <a href="Screen%20Awards">Screen Awards</a> ceremony. Following the film's poor showing at the box office, Mukerji returned to college to complete her education. However, inspired by her cousin Kajol's success in Bollywood, she decided to pursue a full-time career in films.

In 1998, Mukerji starred opposite <a href="Aamir%20Khan">Aamir Khan</a> in <a href="Vikram%20Bhatt">Vikram Bhatt</a>'s "<a href="Ghulam%20%28film%29">Ghulam</a>" (1998), her first commercial success. Though her role in the film was small, the song "<a href="Aati%20Kya%20Khandala">Aati Kya Khandala</a>" earned her widespread recognition. Due to Mukerji's broken voice texture, Bhatt hired a dubbing artist with a much higher pitched voice to dub for her lines. When asked if the director's decision to not use her voice in the film affected her, she said that her voice was dubbed as it "did not suit the character".

Later that year, <a href="Karan%20Johar">Karan Johar</a> cast Mukerji opposite <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> and Kajol in his directorial debut "<a href="Kuch%20Kuch%20Hota%20Hai">Kuch Kuch Hota Hai</a>". The role was originally written for <a href="Twinkle%20Khanna">Twinkle Khanna</a>, but when she rejected it, Johar signed Mukerji on the insistence of Khan and <a href="Aditya%20Chopra">Aditya Chopra</a>. Johar had originally intended that a dubbing artist dub Mukerji's lines in the film, but she improved her diction and eventually dubbed for her own lines. She portrayed Tina Malhotra, a college student who is in a relationship with Khan's character. Writing for "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>", film critic Nandita Chowdhury considered Mukerji to be the scene-stealer and added, "Oozing oomph from every pore, she [..] proves herself an actress whose time has come." "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai" proved a breakthrough for Mukerji; it emerged as a <a href="blockbuster%20%28entertainment%29">blockbuster</a> in India and abroad with earnings of over , and won eight <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>, including a <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> trophy for Mukerji.

Following the success of "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai", Mukerji played leading roles in the social drama "<a href="Mehndi">Mehndi</a>" (1998) and the comedy "<a href="Hello%20Brother%20%281999%20film%29">Hello Brother</a>" (1999). Both these films were critical and commercial disappointments which failed to propel her career forward.

By 2000, Mukerji wanted to avoid being type-cast as a "standard Hindi film heroine" and thus decided to portray more challenging roles in addition to the archetypical glamorous female lead. However, none of her film releases in 2000 were particularly notable. In "<a href="Badal">Badal</a>" and "<a href="Bichhoo">Bichhoo</a>", two male-centric action dramas (both featuring <a href="Bobby%20Deol">Bobby Deol</a> in the lead), she played roles that were met with little acclaim from the critics but were successful at the box-office. A supporting role in <a href="Kamal%20Haasan">Kamal Haasan</a>'s bilingual film "<a href="Hey%20Ram">Hey Ram</a>" proved more rewarding. The film was a partly fictionalised account of <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>'s assassination and Mukerji portrayed the character of Aparna Ram, a Bengali school teacher who is raped and murdered during communal riots in Calcutta. The controversial subject matter of "Hey Ram" led to poor box office earnings, but the film was critically acclaimed and selected as <a href="List%20of%20Indian%20submissions%20for%20the%20Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">India's official entry to the Oscars</a> that year. Mukerji found success in the comedy "<a href="Hadh%20Kar%20Di%20Aapne">Hadh Kar Di Aapne</a>" but her next "<a href="Kahin%20Pyaar%20Na%20Ho%20Jaaye%20%282000%20film%29">Kahin Pyaar Na Ho Jaaye</a>" failed critically and commercially. The romantic comedy "<a href="Har%20Dil%20Jo%20Pyar%20Karega">Har Dil Jo Pyar Karega</a>", however, earned her a Best Supporting Actress nomination at Filmfare and was well received by the critics and audiences. Padmaraj Nair of "<a href="Screen%20%28magazine%29">Screen</a>" found Mukerji's role to be "too meagre for her to prove herself" but added that "she is quite adequate in whatever scenes she has been given".

The year 2001 was a disappointing one for Mukerji. In a review for her first release of the year, "<a href="Chori%20Chori%20Chupke%20Chupke">Chori Chori Chupke Chupke</a>", a drama based on <a href="Surrogate%20mother">surrogate childbirth</a>, film critic Sukanya Verma found Mukerji to be "handicapped with a role that doesn't give her much scope besides weeping and sobbing" and preferred the "meatier" role of her co-star <a href="Preity%20Zinta">Preity Zinta</a>. In "<a href="Bas%20Itna%20Sa%20Khwaab%20Hai">Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai</a>" and "", films that failed to garner praise, Mukerji played the love interests of <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a> and <a href="Anil%20Kapoor">Anil Kapoor</a> respectively. In a review for the latter, Sarita Tanwar wrote that "[Mukerji] has very little to do except being part of some magnificently picturised songs".

Mukerji's career marked a turning point in 2002 when <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a>, a leading production company in India, cast her for two high-profile productions: "<a href="Mujhse%20Dosti%20Karoge%21">Mujhse Dosti Karoge!</a>", a romantic comedy co-starring <a href="Hrithik%20Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a> and <a href="Kareena%20Kapoor">Kareena Kapoor</a>, and "<a href="Saathiya%20%28film%29">Saathiya</a>", a remake of the <a href="Tamil%20film">Tamil</a> box office hit "<a href="Alaipayuthey">Alaipayuthey</a>". "Mujhse Dosti Karoge!" was heavily promoted before release and proved a success internationally, but failed to earn profits in India. The romantic drama "Saathiya" proved a major turning point in her career, winning her a <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress</a> in addition to a <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Actress%20Award">Best Actress</a> nomination at the same ceremony. Mukerji was director <a href="Shaad%20Ali">Shaad Ali</a>'s only choice to play the lead role; he said, "She was born to play this role. She looked the character. She looked vulnerable. She looked the right age. She was perfect". The film co-starred <a href="Vivek%20Oberoi">Vivek Oberoi</a>, and her paternal aunt <a href="Tanuja">Tanuja</a>, and proved an economic success. Mukerji's portrayal of Suhani Sharma, a medical student who deals with the tensions and discontent of being married at a young age, met with critical acclaim. The <a href="BBC">BBC</a> stated that "Mukerji plays the character of a middle class girl with great conviction", and Udita Jhunjhunwala of "<a href="Mid%20Day">Mid Day</a>" added, "Her expressions and acting are understated in a role that fits her like a glove."

In 2003, Mukerji replaced <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a> to play the lead female role opposite Shah Rukh Khan in <a href="Aziz%20Mirza">Aziz Mirza</a>'s romance "<a href="Chalte%20Chalte%20%282003%20film%29">Chalte Chalte</a>". Media reports suggested that Rai was replaced after feuding with her then boyfriend <a href="Salman%20Khan">Salman Khan</a> on the film's sets, but Shah Rukh Khan insisted that Mukerji had been the original choice for the role. The film's concept was similar to "Saathiya" and dealt with misunderstandings between a married couple. Mukerji said, "[Unlike "Saathiya"], "Chalte Chalte" deals with a more mature and deeper form of love. It is about how a man and woman react to situations. [..] You cannot really get very different with the characters, but you can put them against a different background". The film was well received by both critics and audiences, and the following year Mukerji received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. Also that year, she starred in <a href="Milan%20Luthria">Milan Luthria</a>'s romantic comedy "<a href="Chori%20Chori%20%282003%20film%29">Chori Chori</a>" opposite Ajay Devgan, <a href="Sudhir%20Mishra">Sudhir Mishra</a>'s suspense drama "<a href="Calcutta%20Mail">Calcutta Mail</a>", alongside Anil Kapoor and <a href="Manisha%20Koirala">Manisha Koirala</a>, and <a href="J.P.%20Dutta">J.P. Dutta</a>'s ensemble <a href="war%20film">war film</a> "<a href="LOC%20Kargil">LOC Kargil</a>". None of these films fared well critically or commercially.

The year 2004 marked the beginning of the most successful period in Mukerji's career. At the <a href="50th%20Filmfare%20Awards">50th Filmfare Awards</a> in 2005, Mukerji won both the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards, becoming the only actress to win both awards in the same year. The Best Supporting Actress win was for <a href="Mani%20Ratnam">Mani Ratnam</a>'s "<a href="Yuva">Yuva</a>" (2004), a <a href="composite%20film">composite film</a> that featured an ensemble cast including Ajay Devgan, Abhishek Bachchan, Vivek Oberoi, Kareena Kapoor and <a href="Esha%20Deol">Esha Deol</a>. The film narrates the story of three youngsters from different strata of society whose lives intersect by a car accident; Mukerji was cast as Shashi Biswas, a financially deprived Bengali housewife who is abused by her husband, a local goon (played by Bachchan). <a href="Taran%20Adarsh">Taran Adarsh</a> wrote, "Amongst the leading ladies, it is Rani Mukerji who is the best of the lot. The role demanded an actress of substance and Rani more than lives up to the expectations." She won the Best Actress award for her starring role in Kunal Kohli's "<a href="Hum%20Tum">Hum Tum</a>" (2004), a romantic comedy about two headstrong individuals who meet at different stages of their lives. The film pitted her opposite <a href="Saif%20Ali%20Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a> and proved one of the biggest commercial successes of the year. "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" found Mukerji's portrayal of Rhea Prakash to be "self assuredly competent" and Tanmaya Kumar Nanda of <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a> wrote, "Rani is her usual collected self, changing into the many hues of her character with the ease of a chameleon".

Later that year, Mukerji achieved further success when <a href="Yash%20Chopra">Yash Chopra</a> cast her alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta in his <a href="romantic%20drama">romantic drama</a> "<a href="Veer-Zaara">Veer-Zaara</a>". The film narrates the story of star-crossed lovers, Veer Pratap Singh (played by Khan) and a <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>i woman, Zaara Hayaat Khan (played by Zinta); Mukerji played the role of Saamiya Siddiqui, a Pakistani lawyer embroiled in a court case involving Singh. With a worldwide gross of over , "Veer-Zaara" emerged as <a href="Bollywood%20films%20of%202004">the highest-grossing film of the year</a>; it was screened at the <a href="Berlin%20Film%20Festival">Berlin Film Festival</a> and met with critical acclaim. Mukerji's role was praised by the critics; BBC noted, "[I]ts Rani Mukerjee who deserves praise for her acting. To act through your eyes and not using dialogue is an art. Rani for one, has perfected this." She won the <a href="IIFA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> trophy at the <a href="IIFA%20Awards">IIFA Awards</a> ceremony, and received a nomination in the same category at Filmfare.

In 2005, "<a href="Outlook%20%28magazine%29">Outlook</a>" magazine published that Mukerji had established herself as the most successful actress of contemporary Hindi cinema. Her first film role that year was opposite <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a> in <a href="Sanjay%20Leela%20Bhansali">Sanjay Leela Bhansali</a>'s highly acclaimed "<a href="Black%20%282005%20film%29">Black</a>", a drama about an alcoholic man who dedicates his life to teach a blind and deaf girl how to communicate. Bhansali wrote the part of the blind-deaf girl specifically for Mukerji, who was initially hesitant to take on the role due to its "challenging" subject matter. Once Bhansali enforced his faith in her, she agreed and began intensely studying sign language with professionals at the <a href="Helen%20Keller">Helen Keller</a> Institute in Mumbai. "Black" won several awards including two <a href="National%20Film%20Awards">National Film Awards</a> and eleven Filmfare Awards, and <a href="Richard%20Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> of "<a href="Time%20Magazine">TIME</a>" featured it as the fifth best film of the year. Mukerji's performance met with unanimous acclaim; "<a href="Empire%20%28magazine%29">Empire</a>" called the performance "astonishing", "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" included her work in their listing of Indian cinema's "80 Most Iconic performances" and wrote, "Rani has left an indelible mark with this role that usually comes once in a lifetime for most". She became the only actress to win both the Best Actress and Best Actress – Critics trophies at the Filmfare Awards ceremony.

That year, Mukerji received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her work opposite Abhishek Bachchan in "<a href="Bunty%20Aur%20Babli">Bunty Aur Babli</a>", a comedy film which marked her fifth collaboration with Yash Raj Films. She played the title character of Vimmi "Babli" Saluja, a <a href="con%20woman">con woman</a>. The film was the <a href="Bollywood%20films%20of%202005">second highest-grossing film of 2005</a> and Mukerji's third major success in two consecutive years. Film critic <a href="Namrata%20Joshi">Namrata Joshi</a> wrote that "Rani plays to the gallery with ease" and Taran Adarsh wrote that she "sinks her teeth into the role and comes out with flying colours". She followed it with <a href="Amol%20Palekar">Amol Palekar</a>'s <a href="fantasy%20film">fantasy film</a> "<a href="Paheli">Paheli</a>", reuniting her with Shah Rukh Khan. The film was a box office flop in India but was given a strong international release; it was screened at the <a href="Sundance%20Film%20Festival">Sundance Film Festival</a> and was India's submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the <a href="79th%20Academy%20Awards">79th Academy Awards</a>. <a href="Raja%20Sen">Raja Sen</a> of Rediff.com was impressed by the film as well as Mukerji's performance which he called "another perfectly played part". Mukerji's fourth and final release of the year was the highly anticipated period film "". Director <a href="Ketan%20Mehta">Ketan Mehta</a> initially approached her for a cameo appearance, which was developed into an "important part" after she gave her consent to star in the film. Her role was that of Heera, a <a href="prostitute">prostitute</a> who forms the love interest of the title character (played by Aamir Khan). Derek Elley of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" mentioned that Mukerji made "the most of her feisty nautch-girl," despite having "a small role for a star of her caliber."

Mukerji turned down an offer from <a href="Mira%20Nair">Mira Nair</a> to star in the Hollywood film "<a href="The%20Namesake%20%28film%29">The Namesake</a>", choosing instead to collaborate once again with her friend Karan Johar in "<a href="Kabhi%20Alvida%20Naa%20Kehna">Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna</a>" (2006), an urban drama dealing with infidelity and dysfunctional relationships. The high-profile production featured an ensemble cast of Amitabh Bachchan, Shah Rukh Khan, Abhishek Bachchan, Preity Zinta and <a href="Kirron%20Kher">Kirron Kher</a>, and told the story of two unhappily married couples in New York which results in an extra-marital affair. Mukerji played Maya Talwar, a woman layered with self-doubt and question about the relationship between her husband (played by Abhishek Bachchan) and herself. "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna" was a popular release, emerging as a major economic success with gross earnings of over . <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> of <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a> wrote, "Rani looks a million bucks and she dives under the skin of her character to make that part one that we will remember for a long time". The role won Mukerji a third consecutive <a href="IIFA%20Best%20Actress%20Award">IIFA Best Actress Award</a> and among other nods, earned her a sixth Best Actress nomination at Filmfare. The poorly received melodrama "<a href="Baabul%20%282006%20film%29">Baabul</a>" was her final appearance that year.

Following the failure of "Baabul", Yash Raj Films cast Mukerji in <a href="Siddharth%20Anand">Siddharth Anand</a>'s family drama "<a href="Ta%20Ra%20Rum%20Pum">Ta Ra Rum Pum</a>" in the role of a popular racing driver's (played by Saif Ali Khan) wife and the mother of two. Mukerji was excited to play the part of a mother for the first time, and modelled her character after her own mother. Released in 2007, the film was an economic success, but received mixed reactions from the critics. <a href="Khalid%20Mohamed">Khalid Mohamed</a> hailed Mukerji's performance as "near flawless" but Rajeev Masand thought that neither she nor Khan "are able to make much of an impression because their characters are so unidimensional and boring."
The <a href="woman%27s%20film">woman's film</a> "<a href="Laaga%20Chunari%20Mein%20Daag">Laaga Chunari Mein Daag</a>" from director <a href="Pradeep%20Sarkar">Pradeep Sarkar</a> was Mukerji's second release that year. She described the film as a "journey of a girl into womanhood and her sacrifices for her family". Her portrayal earned her a seventh Best Actress nomination at Filmfare, she played the role of Vibhavari Sahay, a young girl of limited means who is forced to moonlight as a prostitute to fend for her family. <a href="Jaya%20Bachchan">Jaya Bachchan</a>, Abhishek Bachchan, <a href="Konkana%20Sen%20Sharma">Konkana Sen Sharma</a> and <a href="Kunal%20Kapoor">Kunal Kapoor</a> co-starred in the film which released to poor box office returns and little praise from the critics. "The Indian Express" noted that Mukerji was responsible for "hold[ing] the film together, even if her part, both as the ingénue and the hooker, doesn't have freshness".

Mukerji played a prostitute for the third time in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's "<a href="Saawariya">Saawariya</a>", an adaptation of <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoevsky">Fyodor Dostoevsky</a>'s "<a href="White%20Nights%20%28short%20story%29">White Nights</a>", co-starring <a href="Ranbir%20Kapoor">Ranbir Kapoor</a> and <a href="Sonam%20Kapoor">Sonam Kapoor</a>. Mukerji said, "I play very different kinds of prostitutes in "Saawariya" and "Laaga Chunari Mein Daag". The woman in "Saawariya" has no problem with her profession, whereas in the other film it's completely different". "Saawariya" was her only release in three years that was not produced by Yash Raj Films. The film was a box office flop and met with polarising reactions from the critics. Mukerji's performance was received favourably and she earned her second Filmfare nomination that year, this time for Best Supporting Actress. By the end of 2007, Mukerji's popularity had begun to wane. Rediff.com attributed this to her "monotonous pairing" with the same set of actors; "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" published that she had become an "exclusive Yash Raj heroine" which hindered other directors to approach her for roles.

After a series of serious roles, Mukerji sought to play a part that would be a "clutter-breaker" for her. She found the role in Kunal Kohli's "<a href="Thoda%20Pyaar%20Thoda%20Magic">Thoda Pyaar Thoda Magic</a>" (2008), a children's film about an angel who comes to Earth to help four troubled kids. In a particularly scathing review, Khalid Mohamed criticised Mukerji's choice of roles and wrote, "As a Geeta Poppins, she's one-dimensional, either darting full blast smiles or tetchy scowls. Her costumes, too, are uneasy-on-the-eyes". The film had low box office returns and further contributed to a decline in Mukerji's career prospects. An "India Today" article spoke of her "running out of luck at the box office" and mentioned her decline in endorsements.

In an attempt to overcome this decline in her career, Mukerji lost weight and underwent a complete makeover. In 2009, she collaborated for the ninth time with Yash Raj Films on "<a href="Dil%20Bole%20Hadippa%21">Dil Bole Hadippa!</a>", a romantic comedy opposite <a href="Shahid%20Kapoor">Shahid Kapoor</a>. Mukerji had high expectations from the film in which she played a cricket-obsessed Punjabi village girl masquerading as a man; it was hugely hyped before release and had its world premiere at the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>. "<a href="The%20Economic%20Times">The Economic Times</a>" critic Gaurav Malani was disappointed with the picture and wrote, "Rani Mukherjee comes up with a spirited performance but her mock sob-whine-whimper do[es] not amuse anymore. Also after a point you dislike visualizing the charming actress as the moustached male player." The film was Mukerji's fourth economic failure in a row. When questioned about her recent spate of flops with the Yash Raj Films banner, she stated, "An actor is here to act and pick great roles and scripts. I was getting great roles from Yash Raj at that point, roles that any actor would give an arm to do. I stand by those films regardless of their fate". Later that year, she featured as a talent judge for the <a href="Sony%20Entertainment%20Television">Sony Entertainment Television</a> reality show "<a href="Dance%20Premier%20League">Dance Premier League</a>". She said that appearing on television would make her "more accessible" to the audiences and help her "gain visibility" when she was "not doing too many films". Mukerji did not make any screen appearances in 2010.

Film critic Aniruddha Guha of "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" described Mukerji's performance in the 2011 film "<a href="No%20One%20Killed%20Jessica">No One Killed Jessica</a>" as "one of her best performances till date". The film (co-starring <a href="Vidya%20Balan">Vidya Balan</a>) was Mukerji's first commercial success since "Ta Ra Rum Pum", and was especially noted for being a success despite the absence of a prominent male actor. The film was a semi-biographical thriller based on the <a href="Murder%20of%20Jessica%20Lal">Jessica Lal murder case</a> in which Mukerji played the fictional character of Meera Gaity, a foul-mouthed television journalist who is deeply involved with the case. To promote the film, she reprised the role of Gaity on the "<a href="C.I.D.%20%28India%20TV%20series%29">C.I.D.</a>" television series. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Telegraph%20%28Kolkata%29">The Telegraph</a>" she said, "It was such a different role to portray. It wasn't a role that was typical of a Hindi film heroine. Meera was more like a hero. It was a character that actually took the story forward. [..] Meera made a lot of things happen. It wasn't something that I had ever done before. I actually had to play a man!" Certain critics, however, were critical of her performance, including <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> of <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a>, who called her role, "the fatal, false note in "No One Killed Jessica"," arguing that "the character is written superficially and Rani's portrayal of her is equally banal. It's all about externals. She argues a lot and proudly labels herself a bitch but her hair stays perfectly in place and in the end, she even gets to do a super-hero-like slow motion walk." Nonetheless, the role earned her several awards and nominations, including a third Best Supporting Actress trophy at Filmfare.

After the success of "No One Killed Jessica", Mukerji accepted a leading role in <a href="Sachin%20Kundalkar">Sachin Kundalkar</a>'s "<a href="Aiyyaa">Aiyyaa</a>" (2012), a <a href="comedy%20of%20manners">comedy of manners</a> co-starring <a href="Prithviraj%20Sukumaran">Prithviraj</a>. She played Meenakshi Deshpande, a woman with a heightened sense of smell who develops a one-sided attraction towards Prithiviraj's character. Critically and commercially unsuccessful. Rediff.com criticised her decision to star in the film, writing that she "gets no support from the way her character is written". Greater success came for her portrayal of Roshni Shekhawat, a mother who has lost her only child in a boating accident, in <a href="Reema%20Kagti">Reema Kagti</a>'s psychological thriller "". Co-starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor, the film had worldwide earnings of over . Ronnie Schieb of "Variety" described Mukerji as "vivid in a quietly sympathetic role", and she received Best Supporting Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including Filmfare.

The following year, Mukerji starred in the <a href="anthology%20film">anthology film</a> "<a href="Bombay%20Talkies%20%28film%29">Bombay Talkies</a>" consisting of four short films. Mukerji was part of the segment entitled "Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh" in which she played Gayatri, a journalist who discovers that her husband (played by <a href="Randeep%20Hooda">Randeep Hooda</a>) is <a href="homosexual">gay</a>; it was her fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar. The film was screened at the <a href="2013%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2013 Cannes Film Festival</a> as part of the centenary year celebrations of Indian cinema. Despite poor box office returns, "Bombay Talkies" met with widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed to Johar's segment. Tushar Joshi of "Daily News and Analysis" said that Mukerji was successful in "proving [that] she's the queen of subtlety when it comes to stripping off the make-up and letting herself fly".

In 2014, Mukerji appeared in Pradeep Sarkar's crime thriller "<a href="Mardaani">Mardaani</a>", in which she played the lead role of Shivani Shivaji Roy, a <a href="Marathi%20people">Maharashtrian</a> policewoman involved in a kidnapping case that leads her to uncover secrets of <a href="human%20trafficking">human trafficking</a> in India. She took on the role "to show all girls what the reality is, what the world has come to, and how they need to protect themselves". In preparation, she interacted with senior officials of Mumbai's <a href="Mumbai%20Police">crime branch</a>, and learned the Israeli self-defense technique of <a href="Krav%20Maga">Krav Maga</a>. Rajeev Masand found Mukerji to be the prime asset of the film, adding that by "investing Shivani with both physical strength and emotional courage, she gives us a hero that's hard not to root for". Writing for "Hindustan Times", Anupama Chopra also praised her performance, writing that she not only "imbues Shivani with steely resolve but also gives her emotional depth". The film was a commercial success and garnered Mukerji another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.

Following the birth of her child, Mukerji took a four-year hiatus to focus on her daughter and was persuaded by her husband, Aditya Chopra, to return to acting. She was keen to work on a project that would accommodate her parental commitments and found it in the comedy-drama "<a href="Hichki">Hichki</a>" (2018). Inspired by <a href="Brad%20Cohen">Brad Cohen</a>'s autobiography "Front of the Class", the film tells the story of Naina Mathur, an aspiring teacher suffering from <a href="Tourette%20syndrome">Tourette syndrome</a> who must prove herself by educating underprivileged children. In preparation, Mukerji interacted with Cohen and she trained to make her character's motor and vocal <a href="tic">tic</a>s appear spontaneous and not rehearsed. "Hichki" received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise directed at Mukerji's portrayal of Tourette syndrome. In a mixed review, <a href="Anna%20M.%20M.%20Vetticad">Anna M. M. Vetticad</a> of "<a href="Firstpost">Firstpost</a>" wrote that Mukerji "lifts "Hichki" every time she is on the scene, bringing empathy and charm to Naina's character without at any moment soliciting the audience's pity." It earned worldwide, a majority of which came from the Chinese box office, and its success led Mukerji to express an interest in working more frequently in the future. She gained another Best Actress nomination at Filmfare.

As of December 2018, Mukerji has committed to star in a sequel to "Mardaani", which will be directed by Gopi Puthran, who wrote the first film.

Despite constant media attention, Mukerji remains guarded about her personal life. Unlike many other celebrities, Mukerji limits her interactions with the media and is sometimes labelled a recluse; she said in a 2011 interview, "Today actors have become more open with the media. But this has posed a problem for actors like me because if I don't do that, then I end up being called reclusive. So now I have changed myself and am easily approachable." Mukerji has collaborated frequently and maintained a close friendship with actors Shah Rukh Khan and Aamir Khan, and filmmaker Karan Johar. The nature of Mukerji's relationship with filmmaker <a href="Aditya%20Chopra">Aditya Chopra</a> was the topic of fervent tabloid reporting in India, though she refused to publicly talk about it. On 21 April 2014, she married Chopra at a private ceremony in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. On 9 December 2015, she gave birth to their daughter, named Adira.

Alongside her acting career, Mukerji has been actively involved with several humanitarian causes and is vocal about issues faced by women and children. Mukerji was appointed as an ambassador by <a href="Procter%20%26amp%3B%20Gamble">Procter & Gamble</a> and the <a href="NGO">NGO</a> <a href="Child%20Rights%20and%20You">Child Rights and You</a> for their joint venture, Shiksha, to endorse the cause of children's education. In 2011 she set up a Stroke Treatment Fund, in association with the Indian Stroke Association, to pay for the treatment of financially deprived stroke-affected patients.

Mukerji has made public appearances to support other charities and causes. In March 2004, she visited the Indian army unit in <a href="Pokhran">Pokhran</a>, <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a> to interact with the <a href="soldier">jawan</a> troops, for the NDTV reality show "Jai Jawan". A decade later, in August 2014 she visited the jawans again at Baramulla.
In February 2005, Mukerji and several other Bollywood actors participated in the 2005 HELP! Telethon Concert to raise money for the victims of the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake</a>. In March 2006, Mukerji celebrated her birthday with the physically challenged children of the Helen Keller Institute; she had previously worked with them while preparing for her role in "Black". In November 2010, she was part of a fund raising auction for the "Because I am a Girl" charity campaign. In 2014, Mukerji attended a charity dinner on child abuse in London, where she was felicitated by <a href="Prince%20Charles">Prince Charles</a> for raising awareness on the issue through her work in "Mardaani".

Mukerji has participated in several concert tours and televised award ceremonies. Her first concert tour, "Magnificent Five", was in 1999 in which she performed with actors Aamir Khan, Aishwarya Rai, <a href="Akshaye%20Khanna">Akshaye Khanna</a> and Twinkle Khanna. The "Temptations 2004" concert had Mukerji perform alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Preity Zinta, <a href="Arjun%20Rampal">Arjun Rampal</a> and <a href="Priyanka%20Chopra">Priyanka Chopra</a> in nineteen stage shows worldwide. The following year, she participated in the "Temptations 2005" concert in New Delhi with Shah Rukh Khan, <a href="Fardeen%20Khan">Fardeen Khan</a>, <a href="Ameesha%20Patel">Ameesha Patel</a> and <a href="Malaika%20Arora%20Khan">Malaika Arora Khan</a>; the show was organised to help raise funds for the National Centre For Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP). In 2010, Mukerji performed at a concert in the Army Stadium of <a href="Dhaka">Dhaka</a>, <a href="Bangladesh">Bangladesh</a> with several Bollywood actors including Shah Rukh Khan, Rampal and <a href="Ishaa%20Koppikar">Ishaa Koppikar</a>. For the "Temptations Reloaded" concert of 2012 in <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a>, Mukerji performed alongside Shah Rukh Khan, Zinta and <a href="Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</a>, for the 2013 concert of the same name in <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, she performed with Shah Rukh Khan, <a href="Madhuri%20Dixit">Madhuri Dixit</a> and <a href="Jacqueline%20Fernandez">Jacqueline Fernandez</a>, and in 2014 she performed in <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> with Shah Rukh Khan, Dixit, <a href="Yo%20Yo%20Honey%20Singh">Yo Yo Honey Singh</a> and <a href="Arijit%20Singh">Arijit Singh</a>.

Mukerji has been described by the critics as one of the most accomplished actresses of Bollywood. As part of a career analysis, Sukanya Verma noted that Mukerji made a "rather unconventional debut in films" (she played a rape victim in "Raja Ki Aayegi Baarat"), and after a few years of oscillating between success and failure, she "achieved the status of a star, performer and showgirl". <a href="Indo-Asian%20News%20Service">Indo-Asian News Service</a> reported that during her initial years in the industry, Mukerji was referred to as the successful Kajol's poor cousin and was written off by the critics for being "plump" and "short". Raja Sen added that despite the odds being against her, Mukerji "slogged her way with grit" and emerged as "the most powerful leading lady in Bollywood". Film critic <a href="Baradwaj%20Rangan">Baradwaj Rangan</a> of the "New Sunday Express" writes that Mukerji's unusual "sandpaper-scratchy, I'm-recovering-from-a-bad-cold" voice sets her apart from her contemporaries and "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">The Times of India</a>" has credited her for breaking the "fairness myth" of Bollywood.

Reema Kagti, the director of "Talaash: The Answer Lies Within", said of Mukerji, "Rani likes to prepare a lot. She gets obsessive about the role and wants to know everything about her character. What's her character's back-story, what is going on in her head at a specific point". In an interview with "Daily News and Analysis", Mukerji described her approach to acting:

A month before I start shooting, I sit with my director, try to understand how he has visualised the character on the screen and take notes. Then I start working on the most basic thing — the look. It's very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided because if I look the character, it makes it all the more believable. Once that is achieved, I go into the finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [..] I have to get the accent right. 

To avoid getting "saturated", Mukerji prefers portraying "drastically different roles", and is credited in the media as "one of the most versatile actresses" of Bollywood. She has played roles in both high-profile mainstream productions and lesser-publicised films of independent filmmakers; "Hindustan Times" published that Mukerji has made this progression so "natural[ly] [..] that it's gone virtually unnoticed". Namrata Joshi of "Outlook" adds that she is unafraid to take risks and portray roles that "none of her contemporaries have been able to do". Mukerji has garnered a reputation for playing roles that are a significant departure from the traditional portrayal of women in mainstream Indian cinema; in "Hum Tum" she played a widow who engages in pre-marital sex, in "Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna" she played a married woman who is involved in an extra-marital affair with a married man, and in "Bichhoo" and "No One Killed Jessica" she smokes, drinks, and utters expletives. The media cites her an "unconventional beauty" — her husky voice, eyes and smile being her distinctive features.

At the peak of her career Mukerji was frequently referred to as one of the most popular and attractive Indian celebrities, was one of the highest-paid actresses in Bollywood, and the <a href="brand%20ambassador">brand ambassador</a> for a number of products. "Filmfare" featured her in their listing of the "Ten Most Powerful Names of Bollywood" for two consecutive years (2005–2006). In 2006, "<a href="Eastern%20Eye%20%28newspaper%29">Eastern Eye</a>" ranked her as one of "Asia's Sexiest Women". Mukerji ranked first on Box Office India's '"Top Actresses" listing for two consecutive years (2005–2006). She featured in Rediff.com's annual listing of the "Top Bollywood Actresses" in 2002-07, 2012, 2014 and 2018 and topped the list for three consecutive years (2004–2006). She was also featured by Rediff.com in their listing of "Bollywood's Best Actresses Ever", "Bollywood's Most Beautiful Actresses", and "Bollywood's Best Dressed Women". Since 2007, Mukerji's popularity was on a decline and she lost out on her brand endorsements to a number of younger actresses. In 2013, the American Embassy in India honoured her with a special trophy for her contributions to Indian cinema. In October 2017, Mukerji was honoured with the "Outstanding Contribution to Cinema Award" by the <a href="Government%20of%20Mauritius">Government of Mauritius</a>.

For her roles in the films "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai" (1998), "Yuva" (2004) and "No One Killed Jessica" (2011), Mukerji won the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress</a>. She also won the <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress</a> for her roles in "Saathiya" (2002) and "Black" (2005), and received the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Filmfare Award for Best Actress</a> for her roles in "Hum Tum" (2004) and "Black" (2005).

Quainton Road railway station

Quainton Road railway station was opened in 1868 in under-developed countryside near <a href="Quainton">Quainton</a>, in the English county of <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, from <a href="London">London</a>. Built by the <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a>, it was the result of pressure from the <a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Campbell%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">3rd Duke of Buckingham</a> to route the railway near his home at <a href="Wotton%20House">Wotton House</a> and to open a railway station at the nearest point to it. Serving a relatively underpopulated area, Quainton Road was a crude railway station, described as "extremely primitive".

The Duke of Buckingham built a short <a href="Horsecar">horse-drawn</a> <a href="Tramway%20%28industrial%29">tramway</a> to transport goods between his estates at Wotton and a terminus adjacent to the station. He extended it soon afterwards to provide a passenger service to the town of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a>, and the tramway was converted to locomotive operation, known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Brill Tramway</a>. All goods to and from the Brill Tramway passed through Quainton Road, making it relatively heavily used despite its geographical isolation, and traffic increased further when construction began on <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Rothschild">Ferdinand de Rothschild</a>'s mansion of <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a>. The plan of extending the Brill Tramway to Oxford, which would have made Quainton Road a major <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a>, was abandoned. Instead, the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the Brill Tramway were absorbed by London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR), which already operated the line from Aylesbury to London. The MR rebuilt Quainton Road and re-sited it to a more convenient location, allowing through running between the Brill Tramway and the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway. When the <a href="Great%20Central%20Railway">Great Central Railway</a> (GCR) from the north of England opened, Quainton Road became a significant junction at which trains from four directions met, and by far the busiest of the MR's rural stations.

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership to become the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a> of the <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a>'s <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>, including Quainton Road. The LPTB aimed to move away from freight operations, and saw no way in which the rural parts of the MR could be made into viable passenger routes. In 1935 the Brill Tramway was closed. From 1936 Underground trains were withdrawn north of Aylesbury, leaving the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> (successor to the GCR) as the only operator using the station, although Underground services were restored for a short period in the 1940s. In 1963 stopping passenger services were withdrawn but fast passenger trains continued to pass through. In 1966 the line was closed to passenger traffic and local goods trains ceased using the station. The line through the station was singled and used by occasional freight trains only.

In 1969 the Quainton Road Society was formed with the aim of preserving the station. In 1971, it absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking over its collection of historic railway equipment. The station was fully restored and reopened as a museum, the <a href="Buckinghamshire%20Railway%20Centre">Buckinghamshire Railway Centre</a>. In addition to the original station buildings, the museum has also acquired the former <a href="Oxford%20Rewley%20Road%20railway%20station">Oxford Rewley Road railway station</a> and a London Transport building from <a href="Wembley%20Park%20tube%20station">Wembley Park</a>, both of which have been reassembled on the site. Although no scheduled trains pass through Quainton Road, the station remains connected to the railway network. Freight trains still use this line, and passenger trains still call at the station for special events at the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre.

On 15 June 1839 entrepreneur and former <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Buckingham%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Buckingham</a>, <a href="Sir%20Harry%20Verney%2C%202nd%20Baronet">Sir Harry Verney, 2nd Baronet</a>, opened the <a href="Cheddington%20to%20Aylesbury%20Line">Aylesbury Railway</a>. Built under the direction of <a href="Robert%20Stephenson">Robert Stephenson</a>, it connected the <a href="London%20and%20Birmingham%20Railway">London and Birmingham Railway</a>'s <a href="Cheddington%20railway%20station">Cheddington railway station</a>, on the <a href="West%20Coast%20Main%20Line">West Coast Main Line</a>, to <a href="Aylesbury%20High%20Street%20railway%20station">Aylesbury High Street railway station</a> in eastern <a href="Aylesbury">Aylesbury</a>, the first station in the <a href="Aylesbury%20Vale">Aylesbury Vale</a>. On 1 October 1863 the <a href="Wycombe%20Railway">Wycombe Railway</a> opened a branch line from <a href="Princes%20Risborough%20railway%20station">Princes Risborough railway station</a> to <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury railway station</a> on the western side of Aylesbury, making Aylesbury the terminus of two small and unconnected branch lines.

Meanwhile, to the north of Aylesbury, the <a href="Buckinghamshire%20Railway">Buckinghamshire Railway</a> was being built by Sir Harry Verney. The scheme consisted of a line running roughly south-west to north-east from Oxford to <a href="Bletchley">Bletchley</a>, and a line running south-east from <a href="Brackley">Brackley</a> via <a href="Buckingham">Buckingham</a>, joining roughly halfway along the Oxford–Bletchley line. The first section opened on 1 May 1850, and the rest opened on 20 May 1851. The Buckinghamshire Railway intended to extend the line southwards to connect to its station at Aylesbury, but this extension was not built.

<a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Campbell%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville</a> (10 September 1823 – 26 March 1889), the only son of <a href="Richard%20Plantagenet%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%202nd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Richard Plantagenet Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos</a>, was in serious financial difficulties by the middle of the 19th century. The 2nd Duke had spent heavily on artworks, womanising, and attempting to influence elections, and by 1847 he was nicknamed "the Greatest Debtor in the World". Over of the family's estates, and their London home at <a href="Buckingham%20House%2C%20Pall%20Mall">Buckingham House</a>, were sold to meet debts, and the family seat of <a href="Stowe%20House">Stowe House</a> was seized by bailiffs as security and its contents sold. The only property remaining in the control of the Grenville family was the family's relatively small ancestral home of <a href="Wotton%20House">Wotton House</a>, and its associated lands around <a href="Wotton%20Underwood">Wotton Underwood</a> in Buckinghamshire. Deeply in debt, the Grenvilles began to look for ways to maximise profits from their remaining farmland around Wotton, and to seek business opportunities in the emerging fields of heavy industry and engineering. Richard Plantagenet Campbell Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, who became the <a href="Marquess%20of%20Chandos">Marquess of Chandos</a> on the death of his grandfather <a href="Richard%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Chandos</a> in 1839, was appointed chairman of the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a> (LNWR) on 27 May 1857. On the death of his father on 29 July 1861 he became the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos, and resigned from the chairmanship of the LNWR, returning to Wotton House to manage the family's remaining estates.

On 6 August 1860 the <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> (A&B), with the 3rd Duke (then still Marquess of Chandos) as chairman and Sir Harry Verney as deputy chairman, was incorporated by Act of Parliament with the object of connecting the Buckinghamshire Railway (by now operated by the LNWR) to Aylesbury. The 2nd Duke used his influence to ensure the new route would run via <a href="Quainton">Quainton</a>, near his remaining estates around Wotton, instead of the intended more direct route via <a href="Pitchcott">Pitchcott</a>. Beset by financial difficulties, the line took over eight years to build, eventually opening on 23 September 1868. The new line was connected to the Wycombe Railway's Aylesbury station, and joined the existing Buckinghamshire Railway lines at the point where the Oxford–Bletchley line and the line to Buckingham already met. <a href="Verney%20Junction%20railway%20station">Verney Junction railway station</a> was built at the point where the lines joined, named after Sir Harry who owned the land on which it was built, since there was no nearby town. Aylesbury now had railways to the east, north and southwest, but no line southeast towards London and the Channel ports.

Quainton Road station was built on a curve in the line at the nearest point to the Duke's estates at Wotton. Six miles (10 km) northwest of Aylesbury, it was southwest of the small village of Quainton and immediately northwest of the road connecting Quainton to <a href="Akeman%20Street">Akeman Street</a>. The railway towards Aylesbury crossed the road via a <a href="level%20crossing">level crossing</a> immediately southeast of the station. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway had spent most of their limited budget on the construction of the line itself. Details of the design of the original Quainton Road station are lost, but it is likely that the station had a single timber-covered earth platform and minimal buildings; it was described in 1890 as being extremely primitive.

With a railway now running near the boundary of the Wotton House estate at Quainton Road, the 3rd Duke decided to open a small-scale agricultural railway to connect the estate to the railway. The line was intended purely for the transport of construction materials and agricultural produce, and not passengers. The line was to run roughly southwest from Quainton Road to a <a href="Wotton%20%28Metropolitan%20Railway%29%20railway%20station">new railway station</a> near Wotton Underwood. Just west of the station at Wotton the line split. One section would run west to <a href="Wood%20Siding%20railway%20station">Wood Siding</a> near Brill. A short stub called Church Siding would run northwest into the village of Wotton Underwood itself, terminating near the parish church, and a 1 mile 57 chain (1 mile 1,254 yards; 2.8 km) siding would run north to a coal siding near <a href="Kingswood%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Kingswood</a>.

Construction began on the line on 8 September 1870. It was built as cheaply as possible, using the cheapest available materials and winding around hills wherever feasible to avoid expensive earthworks. The station platforms were crude earth banks high, held in place by wooden planks. As the Duke intended that the line be worked by <a href="horsecar">horses</a>, it was built with <a href="baulk%20road">longitudinal sleepers</a> to reduce the risk of them tripping.

On 1 April 1871 the section between Quainton Road and Wotton was formally opened by the Duke in a brief ceremony. At the time of its opening the line was unnamed, although it was referred to as "The Quainton Tramway" in internal correspondence. The extension from Wotton to Wood Siding was complete by 17 June 1871; the opening date of the northern branch to Kingswood is not recorded, but it was not yet fully open in February 1873. The London and North Western Railway immediately began to operate a dedicated service from Quainton Road, with three vans per week of milk collected from the Wotton estate shipped to <a href="Broad%20Street%20railway%20station%20%28England%29">Broad Street</a>. Passengers were not carried, other than estate employees and people accompanying livestock.

The tramway did not link to the A&B, but had its own station at Quainton Road at a right angle to the A&B. A diameter <a href="turntable%20%28rail%29">turntable</a> at the end of the tramway linked to a spur from the A&B. This spur ran behind a goods shed, joining the A&B line to the northwest of the road. The Tramway had no buildings at Quainton Road, using the A&B's facilities when necessary. As the tramway ran on the east side of the road, opposite the station, the spur line had its own level crossing to reach the main line. In 1871 permission was granted to build a direct connection between the two lines, but it was not built.

In late 1871 the residents of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a>, the former seat of the <a href="Mercian%20kings">Mercian kings</a> and the only significant town near Wotton House, petitioned the Duke to extend the route to Brill and to run a passenger service on the line. In January 1872 a passenger timetable was published for the first time, and the line was officially named the "Wotton Tramway", but it was commonly known as the "Brill Tramway" from its opening to passengers until closure. The new terminus of <a href="Brill%20railway%20station">Brill</a> opened in March 1872. With horses unable to cope with the loads being carried, the Tramway was upgraded for <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a> use. The lightly laid track with longitudinal sleepers limited the locomotive weight to a maximum of nine tons, lighter than almost all locomotives then available, so it was not possible to use standard locomotives. Two <a href="traction%20engine">traction engine</a>s converted for railway use were bought from <a href="Aveling%20and%20Porter">Aveling and Porter</a> at a cost of £398 (about £ as of 2019) each. The locomotives were chosen on grounds of weight and reliability, and had a top speed on the level of only , taking 95–98 minutes to travel the six miles (10 km) between Brill and Quainton Road, an average speed of .

The line was heavily used for the shipment of bricks from the brickworks around Brill, and of cattle and milk from the dairy farms on the Wotton estate. By 1875 the line was carrying around 40,000 gallons (180,000 l; 48,000 US gal) of milk each year. Delivery of <a href="linseed%20cake">linseed cake</a> to the dairy farms and of coal to the area's buildings were also important uses of the line. The line also began to carry large quantities of manure from London to the area's farms, carrying 3,200 tons (3,300 t) in 1872. As it was the only physical link between the Tramway and the national railway network, almost all of this traffic passed through Quainton Road station.

By the mid-1870s the slow speed of the Aveling and Porter locomotives and their unreliability and inability to handle heavy loads were recognised as major problems for the Tramway. In 1874 <a href="Ferdinand%20de%20Rothschild">Ferdinand de Rothschild</a> bought a site near the Tramway's <a href="Waddesdon%20Road%20railway%20station">Waddesdon station</a> to use as a site for his country mansion of <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a>. The Tramway's management recognised that the construction works would lead to a significant increase in the haulage of heavy goods, and that the Aveling and Porter engines would be unable to cope with the increased loads. The newly established engineering firm of <a href="W.%20G.%20Bagnall">W. G. Bagnall</a> wrote to the Duke offering to hire a locomotive to him for trials. The offer was accepted, and on 18 December 1876 the locomotive was delivered. The tests were generally successful and an order was placed to buy a locomotive from Bagnall for £640 (about £ in 2019) which was delivered on 28 December 1877. With trains now hauled by the Bagnall locomotive (the Kingswood branch generally remained worked by horses, and occasionally by the Aveling and Porter engines), traffic levels soon rose. Milk traffic rose from 40,000 gallons carried in 1875 to 58,000 gallons (260,000 l; 70,000 US gal) in 1879, and in 1877 the Tramway carried a total of 20,994 <a href="long%20ton">tons</a> (21,331 t) of goods. In early 1877 the Tramway was shown on "<a href="George%20Bradshaw%23Bradshaw%27s%20railway%20timetables">Bradshaw</a>" maps for the first time, and from May 1882 "Bradshaw" included its timetable.
Although the introduction of the Bagnall locomotives and the traffic generated by the works at Waddesdon Manor had boosted the line's fortunes, it remained in serious financial difficulty. The only connection with the national railway network was by the turntable at Quainton Road. Although the 3rd Duke of Buckingham was both the owner of the Wotton Tramway and Chairman of the A&B, the latter regarded the Tramway as a nuisance, and in the 1870s pursued a policy of charging disproportionately high fees for through traffic between the Tramway and the main line, with the intention of forcing the Tramway out of business. A&B trains would deliberately miss connections with the Tramway, causing milk shipped via Quainton Road to become unsellable. The Tramway sought legal advice and was informed that the Duke would be likely to win a legal action against the A&B. However, the A&B was in such a precarious financial position that any successful legal action against it would likely have forced its through Quainton Road to close, severing the Tramway's connection with the national network. Many Tramway passengers changed trains at Quainton Road to continue their journey on the A&B; in 1885, 5,192 passengers did so. The Tramway's management suggested that the A&B subsidise the Tramway to the sum of £25 (about £ in 2019) per month to allow passenger services to continue, but the A&B agreed to pay only £5 (about £ in 2019) per month. By the mid-1880s the Tramway was finding it difficult to cover the operating expenses of either goods or passenger operations.

In 1837 <a href="Euston%20railway%20station">Euston railway station</a> opened, the first railway station connecting London with the industrial heartlands of the West Midlands and Lancashire. Railways were banned by a Parliamentary commission from operating in London itself, and thus the station was built on what was then the northern boundary of the built-up area. Other main line termini soon followed at <a href="London%20Paddington%20station">Paddington</a> (1838), <a href="Bishopsgate%20railway%20station">Bishopsgate</a> (1840), <a href="Fenchurch%20Street%20railway%20station">Fenchurch Street</a> (1841), <a href="London%20King%27s%20Cross%20railway%20station">King's Cross</a> (1852) and <a href="St%20Pancras%20railway%20station">St Pancras</a> (1868). All were built outside the built-up area, making them inconvenient to reach.

<a href="Charles%20Pearson">Charles Pearson</a> (1793–1862) had proposed the idea of an underground railway connecting the City of London with the relatively distant main-line termini in around 1840. Construction began in 1860. On 9 January 1863 the line opened as the <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR), the world's first underground passenger railway. The MR was successful and grew steadily, extending its services and acquiring other local railways north and west of London. In 1872 <a href="Edward%20Watkin">Edward Watkin</a> (1819–1901) was appointed its Chairman. A director of many railway companies, he had a vision of unifying a string of railways to create a single line from Manchester via London to an intended <a href="Channel%20Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a> and on to France. In 1873 Watkin entered negotiations to take control of the A&B and the section of the former Buckinghamshire Railway north from Verney Junction to Buckingham. He planned to extend the MR north from London to Aylesbury and the Tramway southwest to Oxford, creating a through route from London to Oxford. Rail services between Oxford and London at this time were poor: although still an extremely roundabout route, this scheme would have formed the shortest route from London to Oxford, Aylesbury, Buckingham and Stratford upon Avon. The Duke of Buckingham was enthusiastic, and authorisation was sought from Parliament. Parliament did not share the enthusiasm of Watkin and the Duke, and in 1875 the Buckinghamshire and Northamptonshire Union Railway Bill was rejected. Watkin did, however, receive consent in 1881 to extend the MR to Aylesbury.

With the MR extension to Aylesbury approved, in March 1883 the Duke announced his own scheme to extend the Tramway to Oxford. The turntable at Quainton Road would be replaced by a junction to the south of the turntable to allow through running of trains. The stretch from Quainton Road to Brill would be straightened and improved to main-line standards, and the little-used stations at Waddesdon Road and Wood Siding would be closed. From Brill, the line would pass in a tunnel through Muswell Hill to the south of Brill, and on via <a href="Boarstall">Boarstall</a> before crossing from Buckinghamshire into Oxfordshire at <a href="Stanton%20St.%20John">Stanton St. John</a>, calling at <a href="Headington">Headington</a> on the outskirts of Oxford and terminating at a station to be built in the back garden of 12 High Street, <a href="St%20Clement%27s%2C%20Oxford">St Clement's</a>, near <a href="Magdalen%20Bridge">Magdalen Bridge</a>.

At the line would have been by far the shortest route between Oxford and Aylesbury, compared with via the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> (GWR), which had absorbed the Wycombe Railway, and via the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway and the LNWR. The Act of Parliament authorising the scheme received the <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> on 20 August 1883, and the new Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company, including the Duke of Buckingham, Ferdinand de Rothschild and Harry Verney among its directors, was created. The scheme caught the attention of the expansionist Metropolitan Railway, who paid for the survey to be conducted. Despite the scheme's powerful backers, the expensive Muswell Hill tunnel deterred investors and the company found it difficult to raise capital. De Rothschild promised to lend money for the scheme in return for guarantees that the line would include a passenger station at Westcott, and that the Duke would press the A&B into opening a station at the nearest point to Waddesdon Manor. <a href="Waddesdon%20railway%20station">Waddesdon Manor railway station</a> was duly opened on 1 January 1897.

The new company was unable to raise sufficient investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had been given only five years by Parliament to build it. On 7 August 1888, less than two weeks before the authorisation was due to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received the Royal Assent for a revised and much cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad (O&AT), this envisaged the extension being built to the same light specifications as the existing Tramway.

On 26 March 1889 the 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos died, aged 65. By this time the construction of the MR extension to Aylesbury was well underway, and on 1 July 1891 the MR formally absorbed the A&B. Sir Harry Verney died on 12 February 1894, and on 31 March 1894 the MR took over the operation of the A&B from the GWR. On 1 July 1894 the MR extension to Aylesbury was completed, giving the MR a unified route from London to Verney Junction. The MR embarked on a programme of upgrading and rebuilding the stations along the newly acquired line.

Construction from Brill to Oxford had not yet begun. Further Acts of Parliament were granted in 1892 and 1894 varying the proposed route slightly and allowing for its electrification, but no work was carried out other than some preliminary surveying. On 1 April 1894, with the proposed extension to Oxford still intended, the O&AT exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Tramway. Work began on upgrading the line in preparation for the extension. The line from Quainton Road to Brill was relaid with improved rails on <a href="Sleeper%20%28rail%29">transverse sleepers</a>, replacing the original flimsy rails and longitudinal sleepers. At around this time two <a href="Manning%20Wardle">Manning Wardle</a> locomotives were brought into use.

The rebuilding of the Tramway greatly improved service speeds, reducing journey times between Quainton Road and Brill to between 35 and 43 minutes. The population of the area had remained low; in 1901 Brill had a population of only 1,206. Passenger traffic remained a relatively insignificant part of the Tramway's business, and in 1898 passenger receipts were only £24 per month (about £ in 2019).
Quainton Road had seen little change since its construction by the A&B in 1868, and in 1890 was described by "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as "one of the most primitive-looking stations in the British Isles". While the line to Brill was being upgraded, the MR were rebuilding and re-siting Quainton Road as part of its improvement programme, freeing space for a direct link between the former A&B and the O&AT to be built. The new station was re-sited to the southeast of the road, on the same side as the turntable connection with the Tramway.

By 1899 the MR and the O&AT were cooperating closely. Although the line had been upgraded in preparation for the Oxford extension and had been authorised as a railway in 1894, construction of the extension had yet to begin. On 27 November the MR arranged to lease the Tramway from the O&AT, for an annual fee of £600 (about £ in 2019) with an option to buy the line outright. From 1 December 1899, the MR took over all operations on the Tramway. The O&AT's single passenger coach, a relic of Wotton Tramway days, was removed from its wheels and used as a <a href="platelayer">platelayer</a>'s hut at Brill. An elderly <a href="Brown%2C%20Marshalls%20and%20Co.%20Ltd.">Brown, Marshalls and Co</a> passenger coach was transferred to the line to replace it, and a section of each platform was raised to accommodate the higher doors of this coach, using earth and old railway sleepers.

<a href="Metropolitan%20Railway%20D%20Class">D class</a> locomotives, introduced by the MR to improve services on the former Tramway line, damaged the track, and in 1910 the line between Quainton Road and Brill was relaid to MR standards using old track removed from the inner London MR route, still considered adequate for light use on a rural branch line. Following this track upgrading, the speed limit was increased to . The MR was unhappy with the performance and safety record of the D Class locomotives, and sold them to other railways between 1916 and 1922, replacing them with <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway%20A%20Class">A class</a> locomotives.

In 1893 another of Edward Watkin's railways, the <a href="Manchester%2C%20Sheffield%20and%20Lincolnshire%20Railway">Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway</a>, had been authorised to build a new line from <a href="Annesley%20railway%20station">Annesley</a> in <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a> south to Quainton Road. Watkin had intended to run services from Manchester and Sheffield via Quainton Road and along the MR to <a href="Baker%20Street%20tube%20station">Baker Street</a>. Following Watkin's retirement in 1894, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway obtained permission for a separate station in London near Baker Street at <a href="Marylebone%20station">Marylebone</a>, and the line was renamed the <a href="Great%20Central%20Railway">Great Central Railway</a> (GCR). The new line joined the MR just north of Quainton Road, and opened to passengers on 15 March 1899.

Although it served a lightly populated area, the opening of the GCR made Quainton Road an important junction station at which four railway lines met. The number of passengers using the station rose sharply. It had many passengers in comparison to other stations in the area. In 1932, the last year of private operation, the station saw 10,598 passenger journeys, earning a total of £601 (about £ in 2019) in passenger receipts.

Quainton Road was by far the busiest of the MR's rural passenger stations north of Aylesbury. Verney Junction railway station saw only 943 passenger journeys in the same year, and the five other stations on the Brill Tramway had a combined passenger total of 7,761.

Following Watkin's retirement relations between the GCR and the MR deteriorated badly. The GCR route to London ran over the MR from Quainton Road to London, and to reduce reliance on the hostile MR, GCR General Manager <a href="William%20Pollitt">William Pollitt</a> decided to create a link with the Great Western Railway and a route into London that bypassed the MR. In 1899 the <a href="Great%20Western%20and%20Great%20Central%20Joint%20Railway">Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway</a> began construction of a new line, commonly known as the Alternative Route, to link the GWR at Princes Risborough to the GCR at <a href="Grendon%20Underwood">Grendon Underwood</a>, about three miles (5 km) north of Quainton Road. Although formally an independent company, the new line was operated as a part of the GCR. A substantial part of GCR traffic to and from London was diverted onto the Alternative Route, reducing the significance of Quainton Road as an interchange and damaging the profitability of the MR.

On 1 July 1933 the MR, along with London's other underground railways aside from the short <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Waterloo & City Railway</a>, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB). Despite being from London, Quainton Road became part of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> network. By this time, the lines from Quainton Road to Verney Junction and Brill were in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from improving road haulage had drawn away much of the Tramway's custom in particular, and Brill trains would often run without a single passenger.

<a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Managing Director of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Group</a> from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services and concentrate on the electrification and improvement of the core routes in London. He saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes. On 1 June 1935 the LPTB gave the required six months' notice to the O&AT that it intended to terminate operations on the Brill Tramway.

The last scheduled passenger train on the Brill Tramway left Quainton Road in the afternoon of 30 November 1935. Hundreds of people gathered, and a number of members of the Oxford University Railway Society travelled from Oxford in an effort to buy the last ticket. Accompanied by firecrackers and <a href="Detonator%20%28railway%29">fog signals</a>, the train ran to Brill, where the passengers posed for a photograph. Late that evening, a two-coach staff train pulled out of Brill, accompanied by a band bearing a white flag and playing <a href="Auld%20Lang%20Syne">Auld Lang Syne</a>. The train stopped at each station, picking up the staff, documents and valuables from each. At 11.45 pm the train arrived at Quainton Road, greeted by hundreds of locals and railway enthusiasts. At the stroke of midnight, the rails connecting the Tramway to the main line were ceremonially severed.

Quainton Road remained open, but with the closure of the Brill Tramway it was no longer a significant junction. A connection between the GCR and the former Buckinghamshire Railway at <a href="Calvert%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Calvert</a> was opened in 1942, leaving the A&B route to Verney Junction with no purpose other than as a <a href="Detour">diversionary route</a>. It was closed to passengers on 6 July 1936. London Transport passenger services beyond Aylesbury were withdrawn, leaving the former GCR (part of the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Eastern%20Railway">London and North Eastern Railway</a> after 1923) as the only passenger services to Quainton Road.

London Transport reduced the A&B route between Quainton Road and Verney Junction to a single track in 1939–40. LT continued to operate freight services until 6 September 1947, when the Quainton Road–Verney Junction route closed altogether, leaving the former GCR route from Aylesbury via <a href="Rugby%20railway%20station">Rugby</a> as the only service through Quainton Road. London Transport services were briefly restored in 1943 with the extension of the Metropolitan line's London–Aylesbury service to Quainton Road, but this service was once more withdrawn in 1948.
Quainton Road closed to passengers on 4 March 1963 and to goods on 4 July 1966. On 3 September 1966 the GCR line from Aylesbury to Rugby was abandoned, leaving only the stretch from Aylesbury to Calvert, running through the now-closed Quainton Road, open for freight trains. This was reduced to a single track shortly afterwards. The <a href="signal%20box">signal box</a> at Quainton Road was abandoned on 13 August 1967, and the <a href="railroad%20switch">points</a> connecting to the goods yard were disconnected.

While other closed stations on the former MR lines north of Aylesbury were generally demolished or sold, in 1969 the Quainton Railway Society was formed to operate a working museum at the station. On 24 April 1971 the society absorbed the London Railway Preservation Society, taking custody of its collection of historic railway equipment. The station was maintained in working order and used as a bookshop and ticket office, and the sidings—still intact, although disconnected from the railway line in 1967—were used for locomotive restoration work.

The Quainton Railway Society, which operates the station as the <a href="Buckinghamshire%20Railway%20Centre">Buckinghamshire Railway Centre</a>, restored the main station building to its 1900 appearance. A smaller building on the former Brill platform, once a shelter for passengers waiting for Brill and down trains, was used first as a store then as a shop for a number of years before its current use to house an exhibit on the history of the Brill Tramway. A former London Transport building from <a href="Wembley%20Park%20tube%20station">Wembley Park</a> was dismantled and re-erected at Quainton Road to serve as a maintenance shed. From 1984 until 1990, the station briefly came back into passenger use, when special Saturday Christmas shopping services between Aylesbury and were operated by <a href="British%20Rail">British Rail</a> <a href="Network%20SouthEast">Network SouthEast</a> on Saturdays only, and stopped at Quainton Road. From August Bank Holiday 1971 until the 1987 season, and again from August Bank Holiday 2001 the station has had special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre - these shuttles now run regularly each Spring and August Bank Holiday weekend.
<a href="Oxford%20Rewley%20Road%20railway%20station">Rewley Road</a>, the Oxford terminus of Harry Verney's Buckinghamshire Railway and of the <a href="Oxford%20to%20Cambridge%20Line">Oxford to Cambridge Line</a>, closed to passengers on 1 October 1951 with trains diverted to the former GWR <a href="Oxford%20railway%20station">Oxford General</a>, the current Oxford station. In co-operation with the <a href="Science%20Museum%20at%20Wroughton">Science Museum</a>, Rewley Road was dismantled in 1999, the main station building and part of the platform canopy being moved to Quainton Road for preservation and improved visitor facilities with the main shop and office of the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre, thus maintaining it as a working building. A number of former Ministry of Supply food warehouses in what is now the extended Down Yard have been converted for various uses by the Society, including storage and exhibition of rolling stock.

Although the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre's steam trains run on the sidings which were disconnected from the network in 1967, the station still has a working railway line passing through it, used for occasional special passenger trains from Aylesbury in connection with events at the Centre. Regular freight trains are mainly <a href="landfill">landfill</a> trains from waste transfer depots in Greater London to the former <a href="quarry">brick pits</a> at Calvert.

As one of the best-preserved period railway stations in England, Quainton Road is regularly used as a filming location for period drama, and programmes such as "<a href="The%20Jewel%20in%20the%20Crown%20%28TV%20series%29">The Jewel in the Crown</a>", the "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" serial "<a href="Black%20Orchid%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Black Orchid</a>" and "<a href="Midsomer%20Murders">Midsomer Murders</a>" have been filmed there. the Buckinghamshire Railway Centre are negotiating for a reconnection of the link between their sidings and the main line to allow their locomotives to run to Aylesbury when the line is not in use by freight trains, and to rebuild part of the Brill Tramway between Quainton Road and Waddesdon Road.

Silky shark

The silky shark ("Carcharhinus falciformis"), also known by numerous names such as blackspot shark, grey whaler shark, olive shark, ridgeback shark, sickle shark, sickle-shaped shark and sickle silk shark, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="requiem%20shark">requiem shark</a>, in the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Requiem%20shark">Carcharhinidae</a>, named for the smooth texture of its skin. It is one of the most abundant sharks in the <a href="pelagic%20zone">pelagic zone</a>, and can be found around the world in tropical waters. Highly mobile and <a href="fish%20migration">migratory</a>, this shark is most often found over the edge of the <a href="continental%20shelf">continental shelf</a> down to . The silky shark has a slender, streamlined body and typically grows to a length of . It can be distinguished from other large requiem sharks by its relatively small first <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a> with a curving rear margin, its tiny second dorsal fin with a long free rear tip, and its long, sickle-shaped <a href="pectoral%20fin">pectoral fin</a>s. It is a deep, metallic bronze-gray above and white below.

With prey often scarce in its oceanic environment, the silky shark is a swift, inquisitive, and persistent hunter. It feeds mainly on <a href="bony%20fish">bony fish</a>es and <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, and has been known to drive them into compacted <a href="shoaling%20and%20schooling">schools</a> before launching open-mouthed, slashing attacks. This species often trails schools of <a href="tuna">tuna</a>, a favored prey. Its sense of hearing is extremely acute, allowing it to localize the low-frequency noises generated by other feeding animals, and, by extension, sources of food. The silky shark is <a href="viviparous">viviparous</a>, meaning that the developing <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s are sustained by a <a href="placenta">placenta</a>l connection to their mother. Significant geographical variation is seen in its <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life history</a> details. Reproduction occurs year-round except in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, where it follows a seasonal cycle. Females give birth to litters of up to 16 pups annually or biennially. The newborn sharks spend their first months in relatively sheltered reef nurseries on the outer continental shelf, growing substantially before moving into the open ocean.

The large size and cutting teeth of the silky shark make it potentially dangerous, and it has behaved aggressively towards divers. However, <a href="shark%20attack">attacks</a> are rare, as few humans enter its oceanic habitat. Silky sharks are valued for their <a href="shark%20fin%20soup">fins</a>, and to a lesser extent their <a href="shark%20meat">meat</a>, hide, <a href="shark%20liver%20oil">liver oil</a>, and jaws. Because of their abundance, they form a major component of <a href="commercial%20fishing">commercial</a> and <a href="artisan%20fishing">artisanal shark fisheries</a> in many countries. Furthermore, their association with tuna results in many sharks being taken as <a href="bycatch">bycatch</a> in tuna fisheries. Although slow-reproducing like most other sharks, the wide distribution and large population size of the silky shark was once thought to buffer the species against these fishing pressures. However, data now suggest that silky shark numbers are declining around the world, which prompted the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a> to reassess its <a href="conservation%20status">conservation status</a> to Vulnerable in 2017.

A scientific description of the silky shark was first published by the German biologists <a href="Johannes%20Peter%20M%C3%BCller">Johannes Müller</a> and <a href="Friedrich%20Gustav%20Jakob%20Henle">Jakob Henle</a> under the name "Carcharias (Prionodon) falciformis", in their 1839 "Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen". Subsequent authors have assigned this species to the genus "Carcharhinus". Because Müller and Henle's <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> was a 53-cm-long female <a href="fetus">fetus</a> from <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, adult silky sharks were historically not recognized as "C. falciformis" and were described as a separate species, "Carcharhinus floridanus", by <a href="Henry%20Bryant%20Bigelow">Henry Bigelow</a>, <a href="William%20Charles%20Schroeder">William Schroeder</a>, and <a href="Stewart%20Springer">Stewart Springer</a> in 1943. <a href="Jack%20Garrick">Jack Garrick</a>, Richard Backus, and <a href="Robert%20Henry%20Gibbs">Robert Gibbs, Jr.</a> synonymized "C. floridanus" with "C. falciformis" in 1964.

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "falciformis" is Latin for "sickle-shaped", which refers to the outline of the dorsal and pectoral fins. The silky shark's <a href="common%20name">common name</a> comes from the fine texture of its skin compared to other sharks, a product of its tiny, densely packed <a href="dermal%20denticle">dermal denticle</a>s. It may also be referred to as blackspot shark (usually used for <a href="blackspot%20shark">"C. sealei"</a>), grey reef shark (usually used for <a href="grey%20reef%20shark">"C. amblyrhynchos"</a>), grey whaler shark, olive shark, reef shark, ridgeback shark, sickle shark, sickle silk shark, sickle-shaped shark, silk shark, and silky whaler.

<a href="Fossil">Fossil</a>ized teeth belonging to the silky shark have been found in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>: from the vicinity of two <a href="baleen%20whale">baleen whale</a>s, one in mud dating to the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>-<a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> ("circa" 12,000 years ago) and the other in Goose Creek Limestone dating to the <a href="Late%20Pliocene">Late Pliocene</a> ("circa" 3.5 million years ago – Mya), as well as from the <a href="Pungo%20River">Pungo River</a>, dating to the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> (23–5.3 Mya). Fossil teeth have also been found in Pliocene <a href="stratum">strata</a> at the Cava Serredi <a href="quarry">quarry</a> in <a href="Tuscany">Tuscany</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. "Carcharhinus elongatus", an earlier representative of its lineage with smooth-edged teeth, is known from <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a> (34–23 Mya) deposits in the Old Church formation of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and the Ashley formation of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a>. A set of poorly described, <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> (56–34 Mya) teeth resembling those of this species are known from <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

Initial efforts to resolve the evolutionary relationships of the silky shark were inconclusive; based on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, <a href="Jack%20Garrick">Jack Garrick</a> in 1982 suggested the <a href="blackspot%20shark">blackspot shark</a> ("C. sealei") as its closest relative. In 1988, <a href="Leonard%20Compagno">Leonard Compagno</a> assigned it <a href="phenetic">phenetic</a>ally to an informal "transitional group" also containing the <a href="blacknose%20shark">blacknose shark</a> ("C. acronotus"), the <a href="blacktip%20reef%20shark">blacktip reef shark</a> ("C. melanopterus"), the <a href="nervous%20shark">nervous shark</a> ("C. cautus"), the <a href="copper%20shark">copper shark</a> ("C. brachyurus"), and the <a href="night%20shark">night shark</a> ("C. signatus").

More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> analysis, based on <a href="allozyme">allozyme</a> sequence data, found that the silky shark is part of a group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the <a href="sandbar%20shark">sandbar shark</a> ("C. plumbeus") and the <a href="bignose%20shark">bignose shark</a> ("C. altimus"), while the silky shark is the <a href="basal%20%28phylogeny%29">basal</a> member of the other branch and the sister <a href="taxon">taxon</a> to a <a href="clade">clade</a> containing the <a href="Caribbean%20reef%20shark">Caribbean reef shark</a> ("C. perezi"), <a href="Galapagos%20shark">Galapagos shark</a> ("C. galapagensis"), <a href="oceanic%20whitetip%20shark">oceanic whitetip shark</a> ("C. longimanus"), <a href="dusky%20shark">dusky shark</a> ("C. obscurus"), and <a href="blue%20shark">blue shark</a> ("Prionace glauca"). Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 <a href="ribosomal%20DNA">ribosomal DNA</a> analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.

The silky shark has a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a> in marine waters warmer than . In the Atlantic Ocean, it is found from the U.S. state of Massachusetts to Spain in the north, and from southern Brazil to northern Angola in the south, including the Mediterranean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. It occurs throughout the Indian Ocean, as far south as Mozambique in the west and Western Australia in the east, including the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. In the Pacific Ocean, the northern extent of its range runs from southern China and Japan to southern Baja California and the Gulf of California, while the southern extent runs from Sydney, Australia, to northern New Zealand to northern Chile. Based on life history differences, four distinct populations of silky sharks have been identified in <a href="ocean%20basin">ocean basin</a>s worldwide: in the northwestern Atlantic, in the western and central Pacific, in the eastern Pacific, and in the Indian Ocean.

Primarily an inhabitant of the <a href="open%20ocean">open ocean</a>, the silky shark is most common from the surface to a depth of , but may dive to or more. Tracking studies in the tropical eastern Pacific and northern Gulf of Mexico have found that cruising silky sharks spend 99% of their time within of the surface, and 80–85% of their time in water with a temperature of ; the pattern was constant regardless of day or night. This species favors the edges of <a href="continental%20shelf">continental and insular shelves</a>, often over deepwater <a href="reef">reef</a>s and around islands. Its range extends farther north and south along continental margins than in oceanic waters. On occasion, it may venture into coastal waters as shallow as . Silky sharks are highly mobile and <a href="fish%20migration">migratory</a>, though the details of their movements are little-known. Tagging data have recorded individual sharks moving up to per day, and covering distances up to . Larger sharks generally move longer distances than smaller ones. In the Pacific Ocean and possibly elsewhere, it spends the summer at slightly higher latitudes, particularly during warmer <a href="El%20Ni%C3%B1o">El Niño</a> years. In the northern Atlantic, most sharks follow the <a href="Gulf%20Stream">Gulf Stream</a> northward along the <a href="U.S.%20East%20Coast">U.S. East Coast</a>. In the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a>, it is most common in late spring and summer.

Slim and streamlined, the silky shark has a fairly long, rounded snout with barely developed flaps of skin in front of the nostrils. The circular, medium-sized eyes are equipped with <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a>s (protective third eyelids). Short, shallow furrows are present at the corners of the mouth. Fourteen to 16 and 13–17 tooth rows are found on either side of the upper and lower jaws, respectively (typically 15 for both). The upper teeth are triangular and strongly serrated, with a notch in the posterior edge; they are erect at the center and become more oblique towards the sides. The lower teeth are narrow, erect, and smooth-edged. The five pairs of <a href="gill%20slit">gill slit</a>s are moderate in length.

The <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal</a> and <a href="pectoral%20fin">pectoral fin</a>s are distinctive and help to distinguish the silky shark from similar species. The first dorsal fin is relatively small, measuring less than a tenth as high as the shark is long, and originates behind the free rear tips of the pectoral fins. It has a rounded apex, an "S"-shaped rear margin, and a free rear tip about half as long as the fin is tall. The second dorsal fin is tiny, smaller than the <a href="anal%20fin">anal fin</a>, with a drawn-out free rear tip up to three times as long as the fin is tall. A narrow dorsal ridge runs between the dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are narrow and sickle-shaped, and particularly long in adults. The anal fin originates slightly ahead of the second dorsal fin and has a deep notch in the posterior margin. The <a href="caudal%20fin">caudal fin</a> is fairly high with a well-developed lower lobe.

The skin is densely covered by minute, overlapping <a href="dermal%20denticle">dermal denticle</a>s. Each dermal denticle is diamond-shaped and bears horizontal ridges leading to posterior marginal teeth, which increase in number as the shark grows. The back is metallic golden-brown to dark gray and the belly is snowy white, which extends onto the flank as a faint lighter stripe. The fins (except for the first dorsal) darken at the tips; this is more obvious in young sharks. The coloration quickly fades to a dull gray after death. One of the largest members of its genus, the silky shark commonly reaches a length of , with a maximum recorded length and weight of and , respectively. Females grow larger than males.

The silky shark is one of the three most common <a href="pelagic%20zone">pelagic</a> sharks along with the <a href="blue%20shark">blue</a> and <a href="oceanic%20whitetip%20shark">oceanic whitetip shark</a>s, and counts among the most numerous large oceanic animals in the world with a population of at least tens of millions. Compared to the other two species, it is less strictly pelagic with the greatest numbers found in offshore waters associated with land, where food is more readily obtained than farther out in the truly open ocean. The silky shark is an active, inquisitive, and aggressive <a href="predator">predator</a>, though it will defer to the slower but more powerful oceanic whitetip shark in competitive situations. When approaching something of interest, it may seem inattentive, sedately circling and sometimes swinging its head from side to side. However, it can respond with startling swiftness to any shift in its immediate surroundings. This shark is often found around floating objects such as logs or tethered naval buoys.

Younger silky sharks are known to form large, loosely organized aggregations, possibly for mutual defense. During migrations, over a thousand individuals may gather. These groups are generally segregated by size, and in the Pacific perhaps also by sex. Silky sharks within a group have been observed to "tilt", presenting their full lateral profile towards each other, as well as gape their jaws or puff out their gills. On occasion, sharks have also been seen suddenly charging straight up, veering away just before reaching the surface and gliding back down to deeper water. The significance of these behaviors is unknown. When confronted, the silky shark may perform a <a href="shark%20threat%20display">threat display</a>, in which it arches its back, drops its tail and pectoral fins, and elevates its head. The shark then proceeds to swim in tight loops with a stiff, jerky motion, often turning broadside towards the perceived threat.

Potential predators of the silky shark include larger sharks and <a href="killer%20whale">killer whale</a>s ("Orcinus orca"). Known parasites of this shark include the <a href="isopod">isopod</a> "Gnathia trimaculata", the <a href="copepod">copepod</a> "Kroeyerina cortezensis", and the <a href="tapeworm">tapeworm</a>s "Dasyrhynchus variouncinatus" and "Phyllobothrium" sp. Silky sharks frequently intermingle with schools of <a href="scalloped%20hammerhead">scalloped hammerhead</a>s ("Sphyrna lewini"), and have been known to follow <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s. One account from the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> describes 25 silky sharks following a large pod of <a href="bottlenose%20dolphin">bottlenose dolphin</a>s ("Tursiops" sp.), along with 25 <a href="grey%20reef%20shark">grey reef shark</a>s ("C. amblyrhynchos") and a lone <a href="silvertip%20shark">silvertip shark</a> ("C. albimarginatus"). Silky sharks are themselves accompanied by juvenile <a href="pilot%20fish">pilot fish</a> ("Naucrates ductor"), which "ride" the pressure wave ahead of the shark, as well as by <a href="Carangidae">jacks</a>, which snatch scraps of food and rub against the shark's skin to scrape off parasites.

The silky shark is an opportunistic predator, feeding mainly on <a href="bony%20fish">bony fish</a>es from all levels of the <a href="water%20column">water column</a>, including <a href="tuna">tuna</a>, <a href="mackerel">mackerel</a>, <a href="sardine">sardine</a>s, <a href="mullet%20%28fish%29">mullets</a>, <a href="grouper">grouper</a>s, <a href="Lutjanidae">snappers</a>, <a href="Decapterus">mackerel scads</a>, <a href="sea%20chub">sea chub</a>s, <a href="Ariidae">sea catfish</a>, <a href="eel">eel</a>s, <a href="lanternfish">lanternfish</a>es, <a href="filefish">filefish</a>es, <a href="triggerfish">triggerfish</a>es, and <a href="porcupinefish">porcupinefish</a>es. It may also take <a href="squid">squid</a>, <a href="paper%20nautilus">paper nautilus</a>, and <a href="swimming%20crab">swimming crab</a>s, and fossil evidence indicates it <a href="scavenger">scavenged</a> on whale carcasses. Good feeding opportunities can draw silky sharks in large numbers; one such feeding aggregation in the Pacific has been documented "herding" a school of small fishes into a compact mass (a <a href="bait%20ball">bait ball</a>) and trapping it against the surface, whereupon the sharks consumed the entire school. When attacking tightly packed fish, silky sharks charge through the ball and slash open-mouthed, catching the <a href="prey%20fish">prey fish</a> at the corners of their jaws. Although multiple individuals may feed at once, each launches its attack independently.

Studies conducted off the Florida coast and the Bahamas have shown that silky sharks are highly sensitive to sound, in particular low-frequency (10–20 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a>), irregular pulses. Experiments in which these sounds were played underwater attracted sharks from hundreds of meters away. Silky sharks likely orient to these sounds because they are similar to the noise generated by feeding animals such as birds or dolphins, thus indicating promising sources of food. These studies have also demonstrated that a silky shark attracted by one sound will quickly withdraw if that sound abruptly changes in amplitude or character; this change need not be a sound produced by a predator to evoke the reaction. Over repeated exposures, silky sharks <a href="habituation">habituate</a> to the sound change and stop withdrawing, though it takes them much longer to do so compared to the bolder oceanic whitetip shark.

The bite force of a 2-m-long silky shark has been measured at . A well-established association exists between this species and tuna: off <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, almost every tuna school has silky sharks trailing behind, and in the eastern Pacific, these sharks inflict such damage to tuna fishing gear and catches that fishery workers have given them the moniker "net-eating sharks". Silky sharks and bottlenose dolphins compete when both species target the same school of fish; the amount eaten by the dolphins decreases relative to the number of sharks present. If a large number of sharks is present, they tend to remain inside the prey school, while the dolphins consign themselves to the periphery, possibly to avoid incidental injury from the sharks' slashing attacks. Conversely, if a large enough group of dolphins gathers, they become able to chase the sharks away from the prey school. Regardless of which one dominates, the two predators do not engage in any overtly aggressive behavior against each other.

Like other members of its family, the silky shark is <a href="viviparous">viviparous</a>: once the developing <a href="embryo">embryo</a> exhausts its supply of <a href="yolk">yolk</a>, the depleted <a href="yolk%20sac">yolk sac</a> is converted into a <a href="placenta">placenta</a>l connection through which the mother delivers nourishment. Relative to other viviparous sharks, the placenta of the silky shark is less similar to the analogous <a href="placental%20mammal">mammalian</a> structure in that no interdigitation exists between the tissues of the fetus and mother. Furthermore, the fetal <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s are much smaller than maternal blood cells, which is opposite the pattern seen in mammals. Adult females have a single functional <a href="ovary">ovary</a> (on the right side) and two functional <a href="uterus">uteri</a>, which are divided lengthwise into separate compartments for each embryo.

Silky sharks in most parts of the world are thought to reproduce year-round, whereas <a href="mating">mating</a> and birthing in the Gulf of Mexico take place in late spring or early summer (May to August). However, in some cases, the presence of reproductive seasonality may have been obscured by biases in data collection. Females give birth after a <a href="gestation%20period">gestation period</a> of 12 months, either every year or every other year. The litter size ranges from one to 16 and increases with female size, with six to 12 being typical. The pups are born in reef nursery areas on the outer continental shelf, where ample food supplies and protection from large pelagic sharks occur. The risk of predation has <a href="natural%20selection">selected</a> for fast growth in young sharks, which add to their length within their first year of life. After a few months (or by the first winter in the Gulf of Mexico), the now-subadult sharks migrate out from the nursery into the open ocean.

The life history characteristics of the silky shark differ across its range (see table). Northwestern Atlantic sharks tend to be larger than those in the western-central Pacific at all ages, while eastern Pacific sharks tend to be smaller than sharks in other regions. Eastern Atlantic and Indian Ocean sharks seem to match or exceed the size of northwestern Atlantic sharks, but the figures are based on relatively few individuals and more data are needed.

The overall growth rate of the silky shark is moderate compared to other shark species and similar for both sexes, though it varies significantly between individuals. One central Pacific study has found females growing much slower than males, but the results may have been skewed by missing data from large females. The highest reported growth rates are from sharks in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and the lowest from sharks off northeastern Taiwan. Males and females reach <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> at ages of 6–10 years and 7–12+ years, respectively. Sharks from more temperate waters may grow slower and mature later than those in warmer regions. The <a href="maximum%20lifespan">maximum lifespan</a> is at least 22 years.

Given its formidable size and dentition, the silky shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans. However, it only rarely comes into contact with people due to its oceanic habits. Its natural curiosity and boldness may lead it to repeatedly and closely approach divers, and it can become dangerously excited in the presence of food. The silky shark tends to be more aggressive if encountered on a reef than in open water. Cases of individual sharks persistently harassing divers and even forcing them out of the water have been reported. As of May 2009, the <a href="International%20Shark%20Attack%20File">International Shark Attack File</a> lists six attacks attributable to the silky shark, three of them unprovoked and none fatal.

Large numbers of silky sharks are caught by <a href="commercial%20fishing">commercial</a> and <a href="artisan%20fishing">artisanal</a> multispecies shark fisheries operating off Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica, the United States, Ecuador, Spain, Portugal, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Yemen, and Côte d'Ivoire. Even greater numbers are <a href="bycatch">caught incidentally</a> by tuna <a href="longline%20fishing">longline</a> and <a href="purse%20seine">purse seine</a> fisheries throughout its range, particularly those using <a href="fish%20aggregating%20device">fish aggregating device</a>s. It is the most common shark caught as bycatch in the eastern Pacific and Gulf of Mexico tuna fisheries, and the second-most common shark caught as bycatch (next to the <a href="blue%20shark">blue shark</a>) overall. The fins are valued as an ingredient in <a href="shark%20fin%20soup">shark fin soup</a>, with captured sharks often <a href="shark%20finning">finned</a> at sea and the rest of the body discarded. Fins from an estimated one-half to one and a half million silky sharks are traded globally per year; it is the second- or third-most common species auctioned on the <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> fin market, which represents over half the global trade. The <a href="shark%20meat">meat</a> (sold fresh or dried and salted), skin, and <a href="shark%20liver%20oil">liver oil</a> may also be used, as well as the jaws: this species is the predominant source of dried shark jaw curios sold to tourists in the tropics. Some <a href="recreational%20fishing">sport fishers</a> catch silky sharks.

As one of the most abundant and widely distributed sharks on Earth, the silky shark was once thought to be mostly immune to depletion despite heavy fishing mortality. In 1989 alone, some 900,000 individuals were taken as bycatch in the southern and central Pacific tuna longline fishery, seemingly without effect on the total population. Fishery data on this shark are often confounded by under-reporting, lack of species-level separation, and problematic identification. Nevertheless, mounting evidence indicates the silky shark has, in fact, declined substantially worldwide, a consequence of its modest reproductive rate which is unable to sustain such high levels of exploitation. The total annual catch reported to the <a href="Food%20and%20Agriculture%20Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> fell steadily from 11,680 tons in 2000 to 4,358 tons in 2004. Regional assessments have found similar trends, estimating declines of some 90% in the central Pacific from the 1950s to the 1990s, 60% off Costa Rica from 1991 to 2000, 91% in the Gulf of Mexico from the 1950s to the 1990s, and 85% (for all large <a href="requiem%20shark">requiem shark</a>s) in the northwestern Atlantic from 1986 to 2005. The silky shark fishery off Sri Lanka reported a drop from a peak catch of 25,400 tons in 1994 to only 1,960 tons in 2006, indicative of a local <a href="fish%20stock">stock</a> collapse. However, Japanese fisheries in the Pacific and Indian Oceans have recorded no change in catch rate between the 1970s and the 1990s, and the validity of the methodologies used to assess declines in the Gulf of Mexico and the northwestern Atlantic have come under much debate.

In light of recent findings, in 2007, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a> reassessed the silky shark to Vulnerable worldwide. The silky shark is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Convention%20on%20the%20Law%20of%20the%20Sea">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea</a>, though this has yet to result in any management schemes. The species should benefit from bans on shark finning, which are being increasingly implemented by nations and supranational entities, including the United States, Australia, and the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a>. Organizations such as the <a href="International%20Commission%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Atlantic%20Tunas">International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas</a> and the <a href="Inter-American%20Tropical%20Tuna%20Commission">Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission</a> have also taken steps to improve fishery monitoring, with the ultimate goal of reducing shark bycatch. However, given the highly migratory nature of the silky shark and its association with tuna, no simple way is known to reduce bycatch without also affecting the economics of the fishery.

Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence

The Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) was a statement adopted by the <a href="Cabinet%20%28government%29">Cabinet</a> of <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a> on 11 November 1965, announcing that Rhodesia, a British territory in southern Africa that had <a href="responsible%20government">governed itself</a> since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent <a href="sovereign%20state">sovereign state</a>. The culmination of a protracted dispute between the British and Rhodesian governments regarding the terms under which the latter could become fully independent, it was the first unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a> nearly two centuries before. The UK, the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia's UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN's history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an <a href="List%20of%20historical%20unrecognized%20states">unrecognised state</a> with the assistance of South Africa and Portugal.

The Rhodesian government, which mostly comprised members of the country's <a href="white%20people%20in%20Zimbabwe">white</a> minority of about 5%, was indignant when, amid <a href="decolonization%20of%20Africa">decolonisation</a> and the <a href="Wind%20of%20Change%20%28speech%29">Wind of Change</a>, less developed African colonies to the north without comparable experience of self-rule quickly advanced to independence during the early 1960s while Rhodesia was refused sovereignty under the newly ascendant principle of "<a href="no%20independence%20before%20majority%20rule">no independence before majority rule</a>" ("NIBMAR"). Most white Rhodesians felt that they were due independence following four decades' self-government, and that the British government was betraying them by withholding it. This combined with the colonial government's acute reluctance to hand over power to black Rhodesians—the manifestation of racial tensions, <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> anti-communism and the fear that a dystopian <a href="Congo%20Crisis">Congo</a>-style situation might result—to create the impression that if the UK did not grant independence, Rhodesia might be justified in taking it unilaterally.

A stalemate developed between the British and Rhodesian prime ministers, <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> and <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a> respectively, between 1964 and 1965. Dispute largely surrounded the British condition that the terms for independence had to be acceptable "to the people of the country as a whole"; Smith contended that this was met, while the UK and black Rhodesian leaders held that it was not. After Wilson proposed in late October 1965 that the UK might safeguard future black representation in the Rhodesian parliament by withdrawing some of the colonial government's devolved powers, then presented terms for an investigatory Royal Commission that the Rhodesians found unacceptable, Smith and his Cabinet declared independence. Calling this treasonous, the British <a href="Governor%20of%20Southern%20Rhodesia">colonial governor</a>, <a href="Humphrey%20Gibbs">Sir Humphrey Gibbs</a>, formally dismissed Smith and his government, but they ignored him and appointed an "<a href="Administrator%20of%20the%20Government%23Rhodesia">Officer Administering the Government</a>" to take his place.

While no country recognised the UDI, the Rhodesian High Court deemed the post-UDI government legal and "de jure" in 1968. The Smith administration initially professed continued loyalty to <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, but abandoned this in 1970 when it declared a republic in an unsuccessful attempt to win foreign recognition. The <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Rhodesian Bush War</a>, a guerrilla conflict between the government and two rival communist-backed black Rhodesian groups, began in earnest two years later, and after several attempts to end the war Smith concluded the <a href="Internal%20Settlement">Internal Settlement</a> with non-militant nationalists in 1978. Under these terms the country was reconstituted under black rule as <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a> in June 1979, but this new order was rejected by the guerrillas and the international community. The Bush War continued until Zimbabwe Rhodesia revoked its UDI as part of the <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Agreement">Lancaster House Agreement</a> in December 1979. Following a brief period of direct British rule, the country was granted internationally recognised independence under the name <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> in 1980.

The southern African territory of <a href="Rhodesia">Rhodesia</a>, officially <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a>, was a unique case in the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> and <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a>—though a colony in name, it was internally <a href="self-governing%20colony">self-governing</a> and constitutionally not unlike a <a href="dominion">dominion</a>. This situation dated back to 1923, when it was granted <a href="responsible%20government">responsible government</a> within the Empire as a self-governing colony, following three decades of <a href="company%20rule%20in%20Rhodesia">administration and development</a> by the <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Company">British South Africa Company</a>. Britain had intended Southern Rhodesia's integration into the <a href="Union%20of%20South%20Africa">Union of South Africa</a> as a new province, but this having been rejected by registered voters in the 1922 <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20government%20referendum%2C%201922">government referendum</a>, the territory was moulded into a prospective dominion instead. It was empowered to run its own affairs in almost all respects, including defence.

<a href="Government%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Whitehall</a>'s powers over Southern Rhodesia under the 1923 constitution were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill within a year, or alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers were intended to protect the indigenous <a href="black%20people">black Africans</a> from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as <a href="Claire%20Palley">Claire Palley</a> comments in her constitutional history of the country, it would have been extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting to do so would have probably caused a crisis. In the event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in <a href="Harare">Salisbury</a>, and dispute was rare.

The 1923 constitution was drawn up in non-racial terms, and the electoral system it devised was similarly open, at least in theory. Voting qualifications regarding personal income, education and property, similar to those of the <a href="Cape%20Qualified%20Franchise">Cape Qualified Franchise</a>, were applied equally to all, but since most blacks did not meet the set standards, both the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly from the <a href="White%20people%20in%20Zimbabwe">white</a> minority of about 5%. The result was that black interests were sparsely represented if at all, something that most of the colony's whites showed little interest in changing; they claimed that most blacks were uninterested in Western-style political process and that they would not govern properly if they took over. Bills such as the Land Apportionment Act of 1930, which earmarked about half of the country for white ownership and residence while dividing the rest into black purchase, tribal trust and national areas, were variously biased towards the white minority. White settlers and their offspring provided most of the colony's administrative, industrial, scientific and farming skills, and built a relatively balanced, partially industrialised <a href="market%20economy">market economy</a>, boasting strong agricultural and manufacturing sectors, iron and steel industries and modern mining enterprises. Everyday life was marked by <a href="discrimination">discrimination</a> ranging from job reservation for whites to <a href="Racial%20segregation">petty segregation</a> of trains, post office queues and the like. Whites owned most of the best farmland, and had far superior education, wages and homes, but the schooling, healthcare, infrastructure and salaries available to black Rhodesians were nevertheless very good by African standards.

In the wider Imperial context, Southern Rhodesia occupied a category unto itself because of the "special quasi-independent status" it held. The <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Dominion%20Affairs">Dominions Office</a>, formed in 1925 to handle British relations with the dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, <a href="Dominion%20of%20Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a>, South Africa and the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a>, also dealt with Southern Rhodesia, and <a href="Imperial%20Conference">Imperial Conference</a>s included the Southern Rhodesian <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Rhodesia">Prime Minister</a> alongside those of the dominions from <a href="British%20Empire%20Economic%20Conference">1932</a>. This unique arrangement continued following the advent of <a href="Commonwealth%20Prime%20Ministers%27%20Conference">Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference</a>s in 1944. Southern Rhodesians of all races <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20in%20World%20War%20II">fought</a> for Britain in the Second World War, and the colonial government gradually received more autonomy regarding external affairs. During the immediate post-war years, Southern Rhodesian politicians generally thought that they were as good as independent as they were, and that full autonomy in the form of dominionship would make little difference to them. Post-war immigration to Southern Rhodesia, mainly from Britain, Ireland and South Africa, caused the white community to swell from 68,954 in 1941 to 221,504 in 1961. The black population grew from 1,400,000 to 3,550,000 over the same period.

Believing full dominion status to be effectively symbolic and "there for the asking", Prime Minister <a href="Godfrey%20Huggins%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Malvern">Godfrey Huggins</a> (in office from 1933 to 1953) twice ignored British overtures hinting at dominionship, and instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with <a href="Northern%20Rhodesia">Northern Rhodesia</a> and <a href="Nyasaland">Nyasaland</a>, two colonies directly administered from London. He hoped that this might set in motion the creation of one united dominion in south-central Africa, emulating the <a href="Federation%20of%20Australia">Federation of Australia</a> half a century before. The <a href="Federation%20of%20Rhodesia%20and%20Nyasaland">Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland</a>, defined in its constitution as indissoluble, began in 1953, mandated by the results of a mostly white <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20federation%20referendum%2C%201953">referendum</a>, with Southern Rhodesia, the most developed of the three territories, at its head, Huggins as Federal Prime Minister and Salisbury as Federal capital.

Coming at the start of the <a href="Decolonization%20of%20Africa">decolonisation</a> period, the Federation of self-governing Southern Rhodesia with two directly ruled British protectorates was later described by the British historian <a href="Robert%20Blake%2C%20Baron%20Blake">Robert Blake</a> as "an aberration of history—a curious deviation from the inevitable course of events". The project faced black opposition from the start, and ultimately failed because of the shifting international attitudes and rising black Rhodesian ambitions of the late 1950s and early 1960s, often collectively called the <a href="Wind%20of%20Change%20%28speech%29">Wind of Change</a>. Britain, <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">France</a> and <a href="Belgian%20colonial%20empire">Belgium</a> vastly accelerated their withdrawal from Africa during this period, believing colonial rule to be no longer sustainable geopolitically or ethically. The idea of "<a href="no%20independence%20before%20majority%20rule">no independence before majority rule</a>", commonly abbreviated to "NIBMAR", gained considerable ground in British political circles. When Huggins (who had been recently ennobled as Lord Malvern) asked Britain to make the Federation a dominion in 1956, he was rebuffed. The opposition <a href="Dominion%20Party">Dominion Party</a> responded by repeatedly calling for a Federal <a href="unilateral%20declaration%20of%20independence">unilateral declaration of independence</a> (UDI) over the next few years. Following Lord Malvern's retirement in late 1956, his successor <a href="Roy%20Welensky">Sir Roy Welensky</a> pondered such a move on at least three occasions.

Attempting to advance the case for Southern Rhodesian independence, particularly in the event of Federal dissolution, the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister <a href="Edgar%20Whitehead">Sir Edgar Whitehead</a> brokered the 1961 constitution with Britain, which he thought would remove all British powers of reservation over Southern Rhodesian bills and acts, and put the country on the brink of full sovereignty. Despite its containing no independence guarantees, Whitehead, Welensky and other proponents of this constitution presented it to the Southern Rhodesian electorate as the "independence constitution" under which Southern Rhodesia would become a dominion on a par with Australia, Canada and New Zealand if the Federation dissolved. White dissenters included <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a>, <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> for <a href="Gwanda">Gwanda</a> and <a href="Chief%20Whip">Chief Whip</a> for the governing <a href="United%20Federal%20Party">United Federal Party</a> (UFP) in the Federal Assembly, who took exception to the constitution's omission of an explicit promise of Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution, and ultimately resigned his post in protest. A <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20constitution%20referendum%2C%201961">referendum</a> of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961. The final version of the constitution included a few extra provisions inserted by the British, one of which—Section 111—reserved full powers to the Crown to amend, add to or revoke certain sections of the Southern Rhodesian constitution by <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a> at the request of the British government. This effectively negated the relinquishment of British powers described elsewhere in the document, but the Southern Rhodesians did not initially notice it.

The black Rhodesian movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites during the late 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the <a href="Bulawayo">Bulawayo</a> trade unionist <a href="Joshua%20Nkomo">Joshua Nkomo</a>, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and by the start of 1962 was called the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20People%27s%20Union">Zimbabwe African People's Union</a> (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP's efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201962">election</a>, the UFP was defeated by the <a href="Rhodesian%20Front">Rhodesian Front</a> (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by <a href="Winston%20Field">Winston Field</a> and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.

Meanwhile, secessionist black Rhodesian parties won electoral victories in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>'s <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> administration in Britain moved towards breaking up the Federation, resolving that it had become untenable. In February 1962, the British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Commonwealth%20Relations">Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations</a>, <a href="Duncan%20Sandys">Duncan Sandys</a>, secretly informed the Nyasaland nationalist leader <a href="Hastings%20Banda">Hastings Banda</a> that secession would be allowed. A few days later, he horrified Welensky by telling him that "we British have lost the will to govern". "But we haven't", retorted Julian Greenfield, Welensky's Law Minister. Macmillan's <a href="Deputy%20Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Deputy Prime Minister</a> and <a href="First%20Secretary%20of%20State">First Secretary of State</a>, <a href="Rab%20Butler">R A Butler</a>, who headed British oversight of the Federation, officially announced Nyasaland's right to secede in December 1962. Four months later, he informed the three territories that he was going to convene a conference to decide the Federation's future.

As Southern Rhodesia had been the UK's legislative partner in forming the Federation in 1953, it would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia's co-operation. Field could therefore potentially hamstring the British by refusing to attend the conference until they pledged to grant his country full independence. According to Field, Smith and other RF politicians, Butler made several such guarantees orally to ensure their co-operation at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. The Southern Rhodesians claimed that Butler justified his refusal to give a written promise by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth's "spirit of trust"—an argument that Field eventually accepted. "Let's remember the trust you emphasised", Smith warned, according to Field's account wagging his finger at Butler; "if you break that you will live to regret it." Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, which was held at <a href="Victoria%20Falls%2C%20Zimbabwe">Victoria Falls</a> over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of the year. In the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> afterwards, Butler flatly denied suggestions that he had "oiled the wheels" of Federal dissolution with secret promises to the Southern Rhodesians.

Field's government was startled by Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised that it was going to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, <a href="Alec%20Douglas-Home">Sir Alec Douglas-Home</a>. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.

The British government's refusal to grant independence to Southern Rhodesia under the 1961 constitution was largely the result of the geopolitical and moral shifts associated with the Wind of Change, coupled with the UK's wish to avoid opprobrium and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. The issue gained international attention in Africa and worldwide as a flashpoint for questions of decolonisation and racism. By the early 1960s, general consensus in the post-colonial UN—particularly the <a href="United%20Nations%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a>, where the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">communist bloc</a> and the <a href="Asian%E2%80%93African%20Conference">Afro-Asian lobby</a> were collectively very strong—roundly denounced all forms of colonialism, and supported communist-backed black Rhodesian insurgencies across southern Africa, regarding them as racial liberation movements. Amid the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, Britain opposed the spread of <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> and Chinese influence into Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly expressed reservations or backed down on NIBMAR in the Southern Rhodesia question. Once the topic of Southern Rhodesia came to the fore in the UN and other bodies, particularly the <a href="Organisation%20of%20African%20Unity">Organisation of African Unity</a> (OAU), even maintaining the "status quo" became regarded as unacceptable internationally, causing the UK government a great deal of embarrassment.

In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain knew that simply granting independence to Southern Rhodesia was out of the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style <a href="Apartheid%20in%20South%20Africa">apartheid</a>. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.

At party level, the Labour Party, in opposition until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and supportive of the black Rhodesian movement on ideological and moral grounds. The <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a>, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more sympathetic to the Southern Rhodesian government's position, and included members who openly supported it.

The Southern Rhodesian government found it bizarre that Britain was making independent states out of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, less developed territories with little experience of self-rule, while withholding sovereign statehood from Southern Rhodesia, the Federation's senior partner, which had already been self-governing for four decades and which was one of the most prosperous and developed countries in Africa. The principle of majority rule, the basis for this apparent inconsistency, was considered irrelevant by the Southern Rhodesians. They had presumed that in the event of Federal dissolution they would be first in line for independence without major adjustments to the 1961 constitution, an impression confirmed to them by prior intergovernmental correspondence, particularly the oral promises they claimed to have received from Butler. When it did not prove forthcoming they felt cheated. Salisbury contended that its predominantly white legislature was more deserving of independence than the untried black Rhodesian leaders as it had proven its competence over decades of self-rule.

The RF claimed that the bloody civil wars, military coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black Rhodesian leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the <a href="Congo%20Crisis">Congo</a>, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black Rhodesian rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black Rhodesian grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony's proud war record on Britain's behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-<a href="Western%20Bloc">Western</a> front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.

These factors combined with what RF politicians and supporters saw as British decadence, chicanery and betrayal to create the case they put forward that UDI, while dubious legally and likely to provoke international uproar, might nevertheless be in their eyes justifiable and necessary for the good of the country and region if an accommodation could not be found with Whitehall.

Field's failure to secure independence concurrently with the end of the Federation caused his Cabinet's support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF <a href="caucus">caucus</a> in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him on the grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony's independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.

The RF united behind Field after Sandys wrote him a terse letter warning him of the likely Commonwealth reaction to a declaration of independence, but the Prime Minister then lost his party's confidence by failing to pursue a possible route to at least "de facto" independence devised by <a href="Desmond%20Lardner-Burke">Desmond Lardner-Burke</a>, a lawyer and RF MP for <a href="Gweru">Gwelo</a>. During March 1964, the Legislative Assembly in Salisbury considered and passed Lardner-Burke's motion that the Governor, <a href="Humphrey%20Gibbs">Sir Humphrey Gibbs</a>, should submit a petition to the Queen requesting alteration of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution so that the <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> described therein would be exercised at the request of the Southern Rhodesian government rather than that of its British counterpart. This would both remove the possibility of British legislative interference and pave the way for an attempted assumption of independence by Order in Council.

The RF's intention was partly to test whether or not the British would attempt to block this bill after Gibbs had granted Royal Assent to it, but this issue never came to a head because Sandys persuaded Field not to forward it to Gibbs for ratification on the grounds that it had not been unanimously passed. <a href="Robert%20Gascoyne-Cecil%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Salisbury">Lord Salisbury</a>, one of Southern Rhodesia's main supporters in Britain, despaired at Field's lack of action, telling Welensky that as he saw it "the simple time to have declared independence, whether right or wrong, would have been when the Federation came to an end". The RF hierarchy interpreted this latest backtrack by Field as evidence that he would not seriously challenge the British on the independence issue, and forced his resignation on 13 April 1964. Smith accepted the Cabinet's nomination to take his place.

Smith, a farmer from the <a href="Midlands%20Province">Midlands</a> town of <a href="Shurugwi">Selukwe</a> who had been seriously wounded while <a href="Military%20service%20of%20Ian%20Smith">serving</a> in the British <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> during the Second World War, was Southern Rhodesia's first native-born Prime Minister. Regarded in British political circles as a "raw colonial"—when he took over, Smith's personal experience of the UK comprised four brief visits—he promised a harder line than Field in independence talks. The RF's replacement of Field drew criticism from the British Labour Party, whose leader <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a> called it "brutal", while Nkomo described the new Smith Cabinet as "a suicide squad ... not interested in the welfare of all the people but only in their own". Smith said he was pursuing a middle course between black Rhodesian rule and apartheid so that there would still be "a place for the white man" in Southern Rhodesia; this would benefit the blacks too, he claimed. He held that the government should be based "on merit, not on colour or nationalism", and insisted that there would be "no African nationalist government here in my lifetime".

Salisbury's blunt refusal to be part of the Wind of Change caused the Southern Rhodesian military's traditional British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo, and prompted Whitehall and Washington to stop sending Southern Rhodesia financial aid around the same time. In June 1964, Douglas-Home informed Smith that Southern Rhodesia would not be represented at the year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, despite Salisbury's record of attendance going back to 1932, because of a change in policy to only include representatives from fully independent states. This decision, taken by Britain to preempt the possibility of open confrontation with Asian and black African leaders at the conference, deeply insulted Smith. Lord Malvern equated Britain's removal of Southern Rhodesia's conference seat with "kicking us out of the Commonwealth", while Welensky expressed horror at what he described as "this cavalier treatment of a country which has, since its creation, staunchly supported, in every possible way, Britain and the Commonwealth".
At <a href="10%20Downing%20Street">10 Downing Street</a> in early September 1964, impasse developed between Douglas-Home and Smith over the best way to measure black public opinion in Southern Rhodesia. A key plank of Britain's Southern Rhodesia policy was that the terms for independence had to be "acceptable to the people of the country as a whole"—agreeing to this, Smith suggested that white and urban black opinion could be gauged through a general referendum of registered voters, and that rural black views could be obtained at a national "<a href="indaba">indaba</a>" (tribal conference) of chiefs and headmen. Douglas-Home told Smith that although this proposal satisfied him personally, he could not accept it as he did not believe the Commonwealth, the United Nations or the Labour Party would also do so. He stressed that such a move towards accommodation with Smith might hurt the Conservatives' chances in the British general election the next month, and suggested that it might be in Smith's best interests to wait until after the election to continue negotiations. Smith accepted this argument. Douglas-Home assured Smith that a Conservative government would settle with him and grant independence within a year.

Attempting to form a viable white opposition to the Rhodesian Front, the UFP resurrected itself around Welensky, renamed itself the Rhodesia Party, and entered the Arundel and Avondale by-elections that had been called for 1 October 1964. Perturbed by the prospect of having to face the political heavyweight Welensky in parliament at the head of the opposition, the RF poured huge resources into winning both of these former UFP safe seats, and fielded <a href="Clifford%20Dupont">Clifford Dupont</a>, Smith's deputy, against Welensky in Arundel. The RF won both seats comfortably, and the Rhodesia Party soon faded away. Spurred on by this success, Smith organised the "indaba" for 22 October, and called a general <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20independence%20referendum%2C%201964">independence referendum</a> for 5 November 1964. Meanwhile, Wilson wrote a number of letters to black Southern Rhodesians, assuring them that "the Labour Party is totally opposed to granting independence to Southern Rhodesia so long as the government of that country remains under the control of the white minority".

Labour defeated the Conservatives by four seats in the British <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">general election</a> on 15 October 1964, and formed a government the next day. Both Labour and the Conservatives told Smith that a positive result at the "indaba" would not be recognised by Britain as representative of the people, and the Conservatives turned down Salisbury's invitation to send observers. Smith pressed on, telling parliament that he would ask the tribal chiefs and headmen "to consult their people in the traditional manner", then hold the "indaba" as planned. On 22 October, 196 chiefs and 426 headmen from across the country gathered at <a href="Domboshawa">Domboshawa</a>, just north-east of Salisbury, and began their deliberations. Smith hoped that Britain, having taken part in such "indabas" in the past, might send a delegation at the last minute, but none arrived, much to his annoyance, particularly as the British government's Commonwealth Secretary <a href="Arthur%20Bottomley">Arthur Bottomley</a> was only across the <a href="Zambezi">Zambezi</a> in <a href="Lusaka">Lusaka</a> at the time.

While the chiefs conferred, Northern Rhodesia became independent Zambia on 24 October 1964, emulating Nyasaland, which had achieved statehood as Malawi three months earlier. Reasoning that it was no longer necessary to refer to itself as "Southern" in the absence of a northern counterpart, Southern Rhodesia began calling itself simply Rhodesia. The same day, the commander of the <a href="Rhodesian%20Army">Rhodesian Army</a>, Major-General John "Jock" Anderson, resigned, announcing publicly that he was doing so because of his opposition to UDI, which he said he could not go along with because of his oath of allegiance to the Queen. Interpreting this as a sign that Smith intended to declare independence if a majority backed it in the referendum, Wilson wrote a stiff letter to Smith on 25 October, warning him of the consequences of UDI, and demanding "a categorical assurance forthwith that no attempt at a unilateral declaration of independence on your part will be made". Smith expressed confusion as to what he had done to provoke this, and ignored it.

When the "indaba" ended on 26 October, the chiefs and headmen returned a unanimous decision to support the government's stand for independence under the 1961 constitution, attesting in their report that "people who live far away do not understand the problems of our country". This verdict was rejected by the nationalist movement on the grounds that the chiefs received governmental salaries; the chiefs countered that the black MPs in parliamentary opposition also received such salaries, but still opposed the government. Malvern, who was becoming perturbed by the RF's actions, dismissed the "indaba" as a "swindle", asserting that the chiefs no longer had any real power; the British simply ignored the whole exercise. On 27 October, Wilson released a firm statement regarding Britain's intended response to UDI, warning that Rhodesia's economic and political ties with Britain, the Commonwealth and most of the world would be immediately severed amid a campaign of sanctions if Smith's government went ahead with UDI. This was intended to discourage white Rhodesians from voting for independence in the referendum, for which the RF campaign slogan was "Yes means Unity, not UDI". Wilson was pleased when Douglas-Home, his leading opponent in the House of Commons, praised the statement as "rough but right". On 5 November 1964, Rhodesia's mostly white electorate voted "yes" to independence under the 1961 constitution by a margin of 89%, prompting Smith to declare that the British condition of acceptability to the people as a whole had been met.

Smith wrote to Wilson the day after the referendum, asking him to send Bottomley to Salisbury for talks. Wilson replied that Smith should instead come to London. The British and Rhodesians exchanged often confrontational letters for the next few months. Alluding to the British financial aid pledged to Salisbury as part of the Federal dissolution arrangements, Wilson's High Commissioner in Salisbury, <a href="John%20Baines%20Johnston">J B Johnston</a>, wrote to the Rhodesian Cabinet Secretary <a href="Gerald%20B.%20Clarke">Gerald B Clarke</a> on 23 December that "talk of a unilateral declaration of independence is bound to throw a shadow of uncertainty on the future financial relations between the two governments". Smith was furious, seeing this as blackmail, and on 13 January 1965 wrote to Wilson: "I am so incensed at the line of your High Commissioner's letter that I am replying directly to you ... It would appear that any undertakings given by the British government are worthless ... such immoral behaviour on the part of the British government makes it impossible for me to continue negotiations with you with any confidence that our standards of fair play, honesty and decency will prevail."
The two premiers were brought together in person in late January 1965, when Smith travelled to London for <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Sir Winston Churchill</a>'s funeral. Following an episode concerning Smith's non-invitation to a luncheon at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> after the funeral—noticing the Rhodesian's absence, the Queen sent a royal <a href="equerry">equerry</a> to Smith's hotel to retrieve him, reportedly causing Wilson much irritation—the two Prime Ministers inconclusively debated at 10 Downing Street. They differed on most matters, but agreed on a visit to Rhodesia the next month by Bottomley and the Lord Chancellor, <a href="Gerald%20Gardiner%2C%20Baron%20Gardiner">Lord Gardiner</a>, to gauge public opinion and meet political and commercial figures. Bottomley and Gardiner visited Rhodesia from 22 February to 3 March, collected a wide cross-section of opinions, including some from black Rhodesians, and on returning to Britain reported to the House of Commons that they were "not without hope of finding a way towards a solution that will win the support of all communities and lead to independence and prosperity for all Rhodesians". Bottomley also condemned black-on-black political violence, and dismissed the idea of introducing majority rule through military force.

The RF called a new general election for <a href="Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201965">May 1965</a> and, campaigning on an <a href="election%20promise">election promise</a> of independence, won all 50 "A"-roll seats (the voters for which were mostly white). <a href="Josiah%20Gondo">Josiah Gondo</a>, leader of the United People's Party, became Rhodesia's first black <a href="Leader%20of%20the%20Opposition">Leader of the Opposition</a>. Opening parliament on 9 June, Gibbs told the Legislative Assembly that the RF's strengthened majority amounted to "a mandate to lead the country to its full independence", and announced that the new government had informed him of its intent to open its own <a href="Rhodesian%20mission%20in%20Lisbon">diplomatic mission in Lisbon</a>, separate from the British embassy there. The British and Rhodesians argued about this unilateral act by Salisbury, described by the historian J R T Wood as the "veritable straw in the wind", alongside the independence issue until Portugal accepted the mission in late September, much to Britain's fury and Rhodesia's delight. Hoping to bring Smith to heel by stonewalling him, Wilson's ministers deliberately delayed and frustrated the Rhodesian government in negotiations. Rhodesia was again excluded from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in 1965. The UK's refusal of aid, the Lisbon mission, the informal arms embargo and other issues combined with this to cause the Rhodesian government's sense of alienation from Britain and the Commonwealth to deepen. In his memoirs, Smith accused the British of "resorting to politics of convenience and appeasement". Wilson, meanwhile, became exasperated by what he saw as Rhodesian inflexibility, describing the gap between the two governments as "between different worlds and different centuries".

Amid renewed rumours of an impending Rhodesian UDI, Smith travelled to meet Wilson in London at the start of October 1965, telling the press that he intended to resolve the independence issue once and for all. Both the British and the Rhodesians were surprised by the large numbers of Britons who came out to support Smith during his visit. Smith accepted an invitation from the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> to appear on its "<a href="24%20Hours%20%28TV%20series%29">Twenty-Four Hours</a>" evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked this at the last minute. Following largely abortive talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.

During these discussions, Smith referred to the last resort of a UDI on many occasions, though he said he hoped to find another way out of the quandary. He offered to increase black legislative representation by expanding the electorate along the lines of "one taxpayer, one vote"—which would enfranchise about half a million, but still leave most of the nation voteless—in return for a grant of independence. Wilson said this was insufficient, and countered that future black representation might be better safeguarded by Britain's withdrawal from the colonial government of the power it had held since 1923 to determine the size and makeup of its parliament. The Rhodesians were horrified by this prospect, particularly as Wilson's suggestion of it seemed to them to have removed the failsafe alternative of keeping the "status quo". Before the British Prime Minister left Rhodesia on 30 October 1965, he proposed a Royal Commission to gauge public opinion in the colony regarding independence under the 1961 constitution, possibly chaired by the Rhodesian Chief Justice <a href="Hugh%20Beadle">Sir Hugh Beadle</a>, which would report its findings to both the British and Rhodesian Cabinets. Wilson confirmed in the House of Commons two days later that he intended to introduce direct British control over the Rhodesian parliamentary structure to ensure that progress was made towards majority rule.

Stalemate drew closer as the Rhodesian Cabinet resolved that since Wilson had ruled out maintenance of the "status quo", its only remaining options were to trust in the Royal Commission or declare independence. When the terms for the commission's visit were presented to Smith, he found that contrary to what had been discussed during the British Prime Minister's visit, the Royal Commission would operate on the basis that the 1961 constitution was unacceptable to the British government, and that Britain would not commit itself to accepting the final report. Smith said these conditions amounted to a "vote of no confidence in [the commission] before they commenced", and therefore rejected them. "The impression you left with us of a determined effort to resolve our constitutional problem has been utterly dissipated", he wrote to Wilson on 5 November. "It would seem that you have now finally closed the door which you publicly claimed to have opened."

Amid frantic efforts by Beadle and others on both sides to revive the Royal Commission, the Rhodesian government had Gibbs announce a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> the same day on the grounds that black Rhodesian insurgents were reportedly entering the country. Smith denied that this foreshadowed a declaration of independence, but the publishing of his letter to Wilson in the press provoked a worldwide storm of speculation that UDI was imminent. Smith wrote again to Wilson on 8 November, asking him to appoint the Royal Commission under the terms they had agreed in Salisbury and to commit the British government to accepting its ruling, but Wilson did not immediately reply. On 9 November, the Rhodesian Cabinet sent a letter to <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, assuring her that Rhodesia would remain loyal to her personally "whatever happens".

The Rhodesian Minister for Justice and Law and Order, Desmond Lardner-Burke, presented the rest of the Cabinet with a draft for the declaration of independence on 5 November 1965. When <a href="Jack%20Howman">Jack Howman</a>, Minister of Tourism and Information, said that he was also preparing a draft, the Cabinet decided to wait to see his version too. The ministers agreed that if an independence proclamation were issued, they would all sign it. On 9 November, the Cabinet jointly devised an outline for the proclamation document and the accompanying statement to be made by Smith. The final version of the declaration of independence was prepared by a sub-committee of civil servants headed by Gerald Clarke, the Cabinet Secretary, with the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a> of 1776, the only other such proclamation ever issued by British colonials, used as a model. Strongly alluding to <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>'s text throughout, the Rhodesians used one phrase <a href="wikt%3Averbatim">verbatim</a>—"a respect for the opinions of mankind"—but no reference was made to the assertion that "<a href="all%20men%20are%20created%20equal">all men are created equal</a>", nor to the "<a href="consent%20of%20the%20governed">consent of the governed</a>", two omissions later stressed by a number of commentators.

Attached to the declaration of independence was a copy of the 1961 constitution amended for the circumstances, which became the 1965 constitution. In the eyes of the Smith administration, this document removed Whitehall's remaining authority over Rhodesia. However, the Smith government still professed loyalty to Elizabeth II, and accordingly the document reconstituted Rhodesia as a dominion with Elizabeth as "Queen of Rhodesia". The new constitution created the concept of allegiance to the "Constitution of Rhodesia," and introduced the post of <a href="Administrator%20of%20the%20Government">Officer Administering the Government</a>, a viceregal figure empowered to sign passed legislation into law on behalf of the monarch if she did not appoint a <a href="Governor-General">Governor-General</a>.

The Rhodesian Cabinet waited in vain for Wilson's reply for the rest of 9 November and the next day. After briefly meeting Smith late on 10 November, Johnston warned Wilson that evening that the Rhodesians seemed poised to declare independence in the morning. The British Prime Minister tried repeatedly to call Smith, but did not get through until Smith was already chairing a Cabinet meeting on the independence issue around 08:00 <a href="Central%20Africa%20Time">Central Africa Time</a> (06:00 in London) on 11 November. Wilson attempted to talk Smith out of unilateral action by telling him the "status quo" could continue, and the two argued inconclusively about the proposed Royal Commission. Returning to his Cabinet meeting, Smith reported the conversation to his ministers, and, after debating for a while, the Cabinet came to the conclusion that Wilson was simply attempting to buy more time and that there was no sign of actual progress. Smith asked if Rhodesia should declare its independence, and had each Cabinet minister <a href="Consensus%20decision-making">answer in turn</a>. According to Smith's account, "each one, quietly but firmly, without hesitation, said: 'Yes'."

At 11:00 local time on 11 November 1965, <a href="Armistice%20Day">Armistice Day</a>, during the traditional <a href="Two%20minute%20silence">two minutes' silence</a> to remember the fallen of the two World Wars, Smith declared Rhodesia independent and signed the proclamation document, with Dupont and the other 10 <a href="Signatories%20of%20Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">ministers</a> of the Cabinet following. The timing was intended to emphasise the sacrifices Rhodesia had made for Britain in wartime. As <a href="Ken%20Flower">Ken Flower</a> later said, "the rebellion was made to appear as though it was not a rebellion". Smith and his ministers still pledged allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, whose official portrait hung prominently behind them as they signed; the declaration even ended "God Save The Queen". Four junior members of the Cabinet—Lance Smith, Ian Dillon, Andrew Dunlop and <a href="P.%20K.%20van%20der%20Byl">P K van der Byl</a>—did not sign, but were included in the official photograph.

Prompted by the government, the <a href="Zimbabwe%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation</a> told the public to stand by for an important announcement from the Prime Minister at 13:15 local time. Smith went first to Government House to inform Gibbs that his Cabinet had declared independence, then to Pockets Hill Studios in east Salisbury to announce UDI to the nation. He read the proclamation aloud, then stated that independence had been declared because it had become "abundantly clear that it is the policy of the British government to play us along with no real intention of arriving at a solution which we could possibly accept ... I promised the people of this country that I would continue to negotiate to the bitter end and that I would leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to secure an honourable and mutually accepted settlement; it now falls to me to tell you that negotiations have come to an end".

Smith said that he believed that he would be remiss in his duty if he allowed Rhodesia to continue to "drift in its present paralysing state of uncertainty", and that following Britain's abandonment of the Federation his government was determined that "the same will never be allowed to happen here". He claimed that UDI did not mark "a diminution in the opportunities which our African people have to advance and prosper in Rhodesia", described "racial harmony in Africa" as part of his agenda and condemned black Rhodesian activities as attempts to "blackmail the British government into ... handing the country over to irresponsible rule". He then attempted to assuage fears that economic sanctions might destroy the economy, and asked Rhodesians to stand firm: "The mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders ... In the lives of most nations there comes a moment when a stand has to be made for principles, whatever the consequences. This moment has come to Rhodesia ... the first Western nation in the last two decades to say 'so far and no further'." He concluded with an assertion that the declaration of independence was "a blow for the preservation of justice, civilisation and Christianity".

By the time Smith and Dupont arrived at Government House to see Gibbs, Whitehall had instructed the Governor to formally dismiss Smith and his ministers for treason. Gibbs complied without hesitation. Smith and his ministers ignored this, holding that under the new 1965 constitution Gibbs "no longer ha[d] any executive powers in Rhodesia", and his <a href="reserve%20power">reserve power</a> to sack them no longer existed. The Rhodesian government hoped that Gibbs might obligingly resign in light of his impotent situation, but he did not; following orders from London, he remained at his post at Government House. Gibbs told the Rhodesian military's senior officers, some of whom were troubled by the perceived choice between Queen and country, to remain at their posts to maintain law and order. Wilson briefly flirted with the idea of sending <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten</a> to Rhodesia to support Gibbs as a direct representative of the Queen, but this was dropped after Gibbs asked for somebody "higher up" in the royal family instead. "Not likely", Wilson retorted.

The Rhodesian government accompanied UDI with emergency measures that it said were intended to prevent alarm, unrest and the flight of people and capital. Press censorship and petrol rationing were imposed, import licences were cancelled and emigration allowances were cut to £100. News of UDI was generally received calmly by the local citizenry, apart from some isolated incidents of passing cars being stoned in the black townships outside Bulawayo. A few expected dissenters were arrested, most prominently <a href="Leo%20Baron">Leo Baron</a>, Nkomo's lawyer, whose links with black Rhodesians and communists were seen by authorities as "subversive". Baron, the younger brother of the scientist <a href="Jacob%20Bronowski">Jacob Bronowski</a>, was arrested nine minutes after UDI was made.

Welensky, who had opposed UDI, stated that he felt it was nevertheless "the duty of every responsible Rhodesian to support the revolutionary government" as he believed the only alternative was a descent into anarchy. João de Freitas Cruz, the Portuguese consul-general in Salisbury, reacted to the news with wild excitement; visiting the Smith residence later in the day, he declared "Only Rhodesians could do this!" A statement from ZAPU's <a href="Jason%20Moyo">Jason Moyo</a>, who was in London at the time, denounced UDI as an act of "treason and rebellion" and asserted that "the lives particularly of four million unarmed Africans are in jeopardy". Davis M'Gabe of the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Union">Zimbabwe African National Union</a> (ZANU) said that "For all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life, UDI has set a collision course which cannot be altered. [It has] marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom ... from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle." Most major Christian denominational leaders in the country publicly rejected UDI and the assertion that it defended Christianity, with the exception of the local <a href="Dutch%20Reformed%20Church%20in%20South%20Africa">Dutch Reformed Church</a>, which stated that it was apolitical and thereafter refrained from comment.

A week after UDI, Smith's government announced that Dupont, the Deputy Prime Minister, had resigned from the Cabinet to accept the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution. Smith asked the Queen by letter to appoint a Governor-General to supersede Gibbs, recommending Dupont, but was ignored. Dupont nevertheless effectively replaced the Governor. The Smith administration assigned him the Governor's official residence at Government House, but no attempt was made to forcibly remove Gibbs and his entourage; the post-UDI government stated that the Officer Administering the Government would live at Governor's Lodge instead "until Government House, at present temporarily occupied by Sir Humphrey Gibbs in a private capacity, becomes available".

The <a href="Speaker%20%28politics%29">Speaker</a> of the Rhodesian parliament, A R W Stumbles, reconvened the Legislative Assembly on 25 November, resolving that if he did not there would be chaos. He feared that Gibbs might dramatically walk into the chamber in an attempt to stop the proceedings, but Gibbs did no such thing. The parliamentary opposition opened the meeting by asking whether the assembly was legal. <a href="Ahrn%20Palley">Ahrn Palley</a>, the lone white opposition MP, announced that as he saw it, "certain Honourable Members in collusion have torn up the constitution under which this House meets. The proceedings have no legal validity whatsoever". Stumbles overruled this objection and two more interruptions from Palley, and suggested that any members with reservations might leave. Palley continued his loud protests until he was forcibly ejected by the <a href="Serjeant-at-Arms">Sergeant-at-Arms</a>, shouting "This is an illegal assembly! God save the Queen!" Gondo and eight other opposition MPs followed Palley out; all ten of them rejoined the Legislative Assembly in February 1966.

Gibbs received threatening letters from the Rhodesian public, and on 26 November 1965 Smith's government cut off the telephones at Government House, and removed the ceremonial guard, the official cars "and even the typewriters", Wood records. Gibbs nevertheless refused to step down or to leave Government House, issuing a statement that he would remain there "as the lawful Governor of Rhodesia until such time as constitutional government is restored, which I hope will be soon." He stayed at his post, ignored by the post-UDI government, until the declaration of a republic in 1970.

Wilson was astonished by Smith's actions, and found the timing of the declaration to coincide with the Armistice Day silence deeply insulting. Describing Salisbury as "hell-bent on illegal self-destroying", the British Prime Minister, supported in the Commons by the Liberals and most Conservatives, called on Rhodesians to ignore the post-UDI government. Within hours of UDI, the UN General Assembly passed a condemnatory resolution, by 107-to-two—South Africa and Portugal voted against, and France abstained—decrying Rhodesia's actions and calling on Britain to end "the rebellion by the unlawful authorities in Salisbury". The <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">UN Security Council</a> the next day adopted <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20216">Resolution 216</a>, which denounced the declaration of independence as illegal and racist, and called on all states to refuse recognition and assistance to the Rhodesian government. <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20217">Security Council Resolution 217</a>, following on 20 November, condemned UDI as an illegitimate "usurpation of power by a racist settler minority", and called on nations neither to recognise what it deemed "this illegal authority" nor to entertain diplomatic or economic relations with it. Both of these measures were adopted by ten votes to none with France abstaining.

Rhodesian black nationalists and their overseas supporters, prominently the OAU, clamoured for Britain to remove Smith's government with a military invasion, but Britain dismissed this option because of various logistical issues, the risk of provoking a pre-emptive Rhodesian strike on Zambia, and the psychological problems that were likely to accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops in what Smith said would be a "fratricidal war". Wilson instead resolved to end the Rhodesian rebellion through economic sanctions; these principally comprised the expulsion of Rhodesia from the <a href="Sterling%20area">Sterling area</a>, a ban on the import of Rhodesian sugar, tobacco, chrome and other goods, and an oil boycott of Rhodesia. When the Rhodesians continued to receive oil, Wilson attempted to directly cut off their main supply lines, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at <a href="Beira%2C%20Mozambique">Beira</a> and <a href="Maputo">Lourenço Marques</a>, by posting a <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> squadron to the <a href="Mozambique%20Channel">Mozambique Channel</a> in March 1966. This blockade, the <a href="Beira%20Patrol">Beira Patrol</a>, was endorsed the following month by <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20221">UN Security Council Resolution 221</a>. The United Nations proceeded to institute the first mandatory trade sanctions in its history with <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20232">Security Council Resolutions 232</a> (December 1966) and <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council%20Resolution%20253">253</a> (April 1968), which required member states to cease all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.

Wilson predicted in January 1966 that the various boycotts would force Smith to give in "within a matter of weeks rather than months", but the British and UN sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with the breakaway colony, providing it with oil and other key resources. Clandestine "sanction-busting" trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level, and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic collapse predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient. The Rhodesian government set up a string of front <a href="holding%20company">holding companies</a> in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein to help keep trade open, with some success; goods that had previously been imported from Britain were replaced by Japanese, French and West German equivalents. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with vitriol, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products. The United States created a formal exception in its embargo with the <a href="Byrd%20Amendment%20%281971%29">Byrd Amendment</a> of 1971, under which the US replaced its import of chrome from the Soviet Union with Rhodesian chrome ore. This breach of the UN sanctions, passed by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">US Congress</a> on the back of anti-communist Cold War considerations, was warmly welcomed by several white <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southerners</a> in Congress; it aided the Rhodesian economy until 1977, when the newly elected President <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">Jimmy Carter</a> successfully pushed Congress to repeal it.

Official diplomatic recognition by other countries was key for Rhodesia as it was the only way it could regain the international legitimacy it had lost through UDI. Recognition by the UK itself through a bilateral settlement would be the "first prize", in Smith's words, as it would end sanctions and constitutional ambiguity and make foreign acceptance, at least in the West, far more likely. Considering their country a potentially important player in the Cold War as a "bastion against communism" in southern Africa, the RF posited that some Western countries might recognise UDI even without a prior Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement. Specifically, it expected diplomatic recognition from South Africa and Portugal, and thought that France might recognise Rhodesia to annoy Britain and create a precedent for an <a href="Quebec%20sovereignty%20movement">independent Quebec</a>. But although South Africa and Portugal gave economic, military and limited political support to the post-UDI government (as did France and other nations, to a lesser extent), neither they nor any other country ever recognised Rhodesia as a "de jure" independent state. Rhodesia's unsuccessful attempts to win Western support and recognition included offers to the US government in 1966 and 1967, ignored by <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B Johnson</a>'s administration, to provide Rhodesian troops to fight alongside the Americans and other anti-communist forces <a href="Vietnam%20War">in Vietnam</a>.

Britain withdrew most of its <a href="High%20Commission">High Commission</a> staff from Salisbury in the days following UDI, leaving a small skeleton staff to man a "residual mission" intended to help Gibbs keep the British government informed of local happenings. Several countries followed Britain's lead and closed their <a href="consul%20%28representative%29">consulates</a> in Salisbury, with one prominent exception to this being the United States, which retained its consulate-general in post-UDI Rhodesia, relabelling it a "US Contacts Office" to circumvent the problem of diplomatic recognition. South Africa and Portugal maintained "Accredited Diplomatic Representative" offices in Salisbury, which were embassies in all but name, while Rhodesia kept its pre-UDI overseas missions in Pretoria, Lisbon and Lourenço Marques. Unofficial representative offices of the Rhodesian government also existed in the US, Japan and West Germany, while a citizen of Belgium was employed to represent Rhodesian interests there. The Rhodesian High Commission in London, located at <a href="Embassy%20of%20Zimbabwe%2C%20London">Rhodesia House</a> on the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a>, remained under the control of the post-UDI government and effectively became its representative office in the UK. Like the <a href="High%20Commission%20of%20South%20Africa%2C%20London">South African Embassy</a> on <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a>, Rhodesia House became a regular target for political demonstrations. These continued even after Britain forced the office to close in 1969.

Because UDI claimed to make Rhodesia independent under the Queen as an effective dominion, many countries justified their retention of missions in Rhodesia concurrently with their non-recognition of the state by pointing out that the envoys' accreditation was to the Queen and not to Smith's government "per se". But Rhodesia moved away from its original line of independence as a <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a> and towards republicanism during the late 1960s, hoping to end ambiguity regarding its claimed constitutional status and elicit official foreign recognition. In March 1970, after the electorate had voted "yes" in a <a href="Rhodesian%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201969">referendum</a> the previous year both to a new constitution and to the abandoning of symbolic ties to the Queen, Smith's government declared Rhodesia a republic. Far from prompting recognition, this led all countries apart from Portugal and South Africa to withdraw their consulates and missions, as the justification of royal accreditation could no longer be used. After Portugal's <a href="Carnation%20Revolution">Carnation Revolution</a> in 1974, the Rhodesian mission in Lisbon was closed in May 1975, with its counterpart in Lourenço Marques following a month later on Mozambican independence. Portugal also withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia, leaving South Africa as the only country with links to Salisbury. Rhodesia's diplomatic activities were thereafter greatly diminished.

The Rhodesian High Court's nine Appellate and General Division judges initially neither rejected UDI nor openly supported it. The Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle, of the Appellate Division, announced simply that the judges would go on carrying out their duties "according to the law". This originally noncommittal stance evolved over time, largely pivoting around legal cases argued at the High Court in Salisbury between 1966 and 1968. The first of these, "<a href="Madzimbamuto%20v.%20Lardner-Burke">Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke N. O. and Others</a>", concerned Daniel Madzimbamuto, a black Rhodesian who was detained without trial by the Rhodesian government on 6 November 1965, the day after the declaration of a state of emergency and five days before UDI, on the grounds that he might pose a danger to the public. Desmond Lardner-Burke, the Rhodesian Minister of Justice and Law and Order, prolonged the state of emergency in February 1966, prompting Madzimbamuto's wife to appeal for his release, arguing that since the United Kingdom had declared UDI illegal and outlawed the Rhodesian government with the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965, the state of emergency (and, by extension, Madzimbamuto's imprisonment) had no legal basis.

The General Division of the Rhodesian High Court ruled on 9 September 1966 that legal sovereignty lay with the British government, but that to "avoid chaos and a vacuum in the law" the Rhodesian government should be considered to be in control of law and order to the same extent as before UDI. In February 1968, ruling on Madzimbamuto's appeal, Beadle concluded that the Smith administration would be recognised by the local judiciary as the "de facto" government by virtue of its "effective control over the state's territory", but that "de jure" recognition would be withheld as this was not "firmly established". Madzimbamuto applied for the right to appeal to the British <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Privy Council</a>; the Rhodesian Appellate Division promptly ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council <a href="Madzimbamuto%20v.%20Lardner-Burke">considered his case</a> anyway.

In late February 1968, considering the fate of James Dhlamini, Victor Mlambo and Duly Shadreck, three black Rhodesians convicted of murder and terrorist offences before UDI, Beadle ruled that Salisbury retained its pre-UDI powers regarding executions and could carry out death sentences. Whitehall announced on 1 March that at the request of the UK government, the Queen had exercised the <a href="royal%20prerogative%20of%20mercy">royal prerogative of mercy</a> and commuted the three death sentences to life imprisonment. Dhlamini and the others applied for a permanent <a href="stay%20of%20execution">stay of execution</a> on this basis. At the hearing for Dhlamini and Mlambo on 4 March 1968, Beadle argued that he saw the statement from London as a decision by the UK government and not the Queen herself, and that in any case the 1961 constitution had transferred the prerogative of mercy from Britain to the Rhodesian Executive Council. "The present government is the fully "de facto" government and as such is the only power that can exercise the prerogative", he concluded. "It would be strange indeed if the United Kingdom government, exercising no internal power in Rhodesia, were given the right to exercise the prerogative of clemency." The Judge President Sir Vincent Quenet and Justice <a href="Hector%20Macdonald%20%28judge%29">Hector Macdonald</a> agreed, and the application was dismissed. Justice <a href="John%20Fieldsend">John Fieldsend</a> of the High Court's General Division resigned in protest, writing to Gibbs that he no longer believed the High Court to be defending the rights of Rhodesian citizens. Dhlamini, Mlambo and Shadreck were hanged on 6 March.

On 23 July 1968, the Privy Council in London ruled in Madzimbamuto's favour, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether the 1961 or 1965 constitution was considered effective. It declared the latter, "revolutionary" constitution illegal, and ruled that the former was overridden by the <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia%20Act%201965">Southern Rhodesia Act 1965</a>, which had effectively outlawed the Rhodesian legislative, administrative and legal authorities in British law. <a href="James%20Reid%2C%20Baron%20Reid">Lord Reid</a>, delivering the majority opinion (<a href="Edward%20Pearce%2C%20Baron%20Pearce">Lord Pearce</a> dissented), argued that the "usurper" government, though the effective master of Rhodesia, could not be considered lawful as the UK government was still attempting to regain control and it was impossible to say whether or not it would succeed. He ruled that only Whitehall could determine what constituted the maintenance of "law and order" in Rhodesia, and that the Rhodesian emergency measures were unlawful as they had been formalised by the Officer Administering the Government, a post-UDI figure who was, in British eyes, unconstitutional. Reid concluded that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice J R Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies' ruling on 12 August and four days later was sworn in as Chief Justice of Botswana.

The Rhodesian High Court granted full "de jure" recognition to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black Rhodesians who had been a month earlier convicted of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council "so far as possible", the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that the court therefore faced a choice between the 1965 constitution and a legal vacuum, the latter of which he felt he could not endorse. Referring to the Privy Council's decision that the UK might yet remove the post-UDI government, he said that "on the facts as they exist today, the only prediction which this court can make is that sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government ... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so".

Macdonald, a member of Beadle's ruling panel, argued that since UDI, the British government had acted unconstitutionally and illegally regarding Rhodesia by involving the United Nations in what should have been legally considered a domestic problem, and had concurrently abdicated its right to the allegiance of the Rhodesian people by waging economic war against the country and encouraging other nations to do the same. To support this argument, Macdonald referred to the assertion by the 17th-century Dutch jurist <a href="Hugo%20Grotius">Hugo Grotius</a> that "the purpose of governing and the purpose of destroying cannot subsist together". Since Britain was in a state of economic war against Rhodesia, the court concluded, it could not at the same time be regarded as governing it. UDI, the associated 1965 constitution and the government were thereafter considered "de jure" by the Rhodesian legal system.

The British Commonwealth Secretary, <a href="George%20Thomson%2C%20Baron%20Thomson%20of%20Monifieth">George Thomson</a>, promptly accused the Rhodesian judges of breaching "the fundamental laws of the land", while Gibbs announced that since his position as Governor existed under the 1961 constitution, which allowed appeals to the Privy Council, he could only reject the Rhodesian court ruling. The Rhodesian judges continued regardless. Their recognition of the post-UDI order carried over to the 1969 republican constitution, adopted in 1970.

Vestiges of British ties were removed piecemeal by the government over the decade following UDI, and replaced with symbols and terminology intended to be more uniquely Rhodesian. A silver "Liberty Bell", based on the bell of the <a href="Liberty%20Bell">same name</a> in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, was cast during 1966 and rung by the Prime Minister each year on <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20Rhodesia">Independence Day</a> (the anniversary of UDI), the number of chimes signifying the number of years since the declaration of independence. The <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a> and <a href="Flag%20of%20Southern%20Rhodesia">Rhodesia's Commonwealth-style</a> <a href="flag%20of%20Rhodesia">national flag</a>—a <a href="Defacement%20%28flag%29">defaced</a> <a href="Blue%20Ensign">Sky Blue Ensign</a> with the Union Jack in the canton—continued to fly over government buildings, military bases and other official locations until 11 November 1968, the third anniversary of UDI, when they were superseded by a new national flag: a green-white-green vertical <a href="Triband%20%28flag%29">triband</a>, <a href="Charge%20%28heraldry%29">charged</a> centrally with the <a href="coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Rhodesia">Rhodesian coat of arms</a>. The Union Jack continued to be ceremonially raised at Cecil Square in Salisbury on 12 September each year as part of the <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20Rhodesia">Pioneers' Day</a> holiday, which marked the anniversary of the establishment of Salisbury (and, by extension, Rhodesia) in 1890.

Since Elizabeth II was still the Rhodesian head of state in the eyes of Smith's administration until 1970, "<a href="God%20Save%20the%20Queen">God Save the Queen</a>" remained the Rhodesian national anthem, and continued to accompany official occasions such as the opening of the Rhodesian parliament. This was intended to demonstrate Rhodesia's continued loyalty to the Queen, but the use of the unmistakably British song at Rhodesian state occasions soon seemed "fairly ironic", as "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" put it. Salisbury started looking for a replacement anthem around the same time as its introduction of the new flag, and in 1974, after four years without an anthem ("God Save the Queen" was formally dropped in 1970), republican Rhodesia adopted "<a href="Rise%2C%20O%20Voices%20of%20Rhodesia">Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia</a>", an anthem coupling original lyrics with the tune of <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s "<a href="Ode%20to%20Joy">Ode to Joy</a>". The country's head of state under the republican constitution was the <a href="President%20of%20Rhodesia">President of Rhodesia</a>, the first of whom was Dupont.

State press censorship, which had been introduced on UDI, was lifted in early April 1968. <a href="Decimalisation">Decimalisation</a> occurred on 17 February 1970, two weeks before Rhodesia's reconstitution as a republic, with the new <a href="Rhodesian%20dollar">Rhodesian dollar</a> replacing the <a href="Rhodesian%20pound">pound</a> at a rate of two dollars to each pound. Following the republic's formal declaration the next month, the Rhodesian military removed nomenclatural and symbolic references to the Crown—the <a href="Rhodesian%20Air%20Force">Royal Rhodesian Air Force</a> and <a href="Rhodesia%20Regiment">Royal Rhodesia Regiment</a> dropped their "Royal" prefixes, new branch and regimental flags were designed, and the <a href="St%20Edward%27s%20Crown">St Edward's Crown</a> surmounting many regimental emblems was expunged in favour of the "lion and tusk", a motif from the coat of arms of the British South Africa Company that had been used in Rhodesian military symbolism since the 1890s. The air force's new <a href="roundel">roundel</a> was a green ring with the lion and tusk on a white centre. Later that year, a system of new <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20Rhodesia">Rhodesian honours and decorations</a> was created to replace the old British honours. Rhodesia's police force, the <a href="British%20South%20Africa%20Police">British South Africa Police</a>, was not renamed.

Wilson told the British House of Commons in January 1966 that he would not enter any kind of dialogue with the post-UDI Rhodesian "illegal regime" until it gave up its claim of independence, but by mid-1966 British and Rhodesian civil servants were holding "talks about talks" in London and Salisbury. By November that year, Wilson had agreed to negotiate personally with Smith. The two Prime Ministers unsuccessfully attempted to settle aboard <a href="HMS%20Tiger%20%28C20%29">HMS "Tiger"</a> in December 1966 and <a href="HMS%20Fearless%20%28L10%29">HMS "Fearless"</a> in October 1968. After the Conservatives returned to power in Britain <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201970">in 1970</a>, provisional agreement was reached in November 1971 between the Rhodesian government and a British team headed by Douglas-Home (who was <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a> under Prime Minister <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a>), and in early 1972 a Royal Commission chaired by Lord Pearce travelled to Rhodesia to investigate how acceptable the proposals were to majority opinion. After extensive consultation, the commission reported that while whites, <a href="coloured">coloured</a>s and Asians were largely in favour of the presented terms, most blacks rejected them. The deal was therefore shelved by the British government.

The <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Rhodesian Bush War</a>, a guerrilla conflict pitting the <a href="Rhodesian%20Security%20Forces">Rhodesian Security Forces</a> against the <a href="Zimbabwe%20African%20National%20Liberation%20Army">Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army</a> (ZANLA) and the <a href="Zimbabwe%20People%27s%20Revolutionary%20Army">Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army</a> (ZIPRA), the respective armed wings of ZANU and ZAPU, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. The 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal, which over the next year replaced Portuguese support for Smith with an independent, <a href="Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism">Marxist–Leninist</a> Mozambique on Rhodesia's eastern frontier, greatly swung the war's momentum in favour of the nationalists (particularly ZANU, which was allied with Mozambique's governing <a href="FRELIMO">FRELIMO</a> party), and caused the sanctions on Rhodesia to finally begin having a noticeable effect. Diplomatic isolation, the sanctions, guerrilla activities and pressure from South Africa to find a settlement led the Rhodesian government to hold talks with the various black Rhodesian factions. Abortive conferences were held at <a href="Victoria%20Falls%20Conference%20%281975%29">Victoria Falls</a> (in 1975) and <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281976%29">Geneva</a> (1976). Despite ideological and tribal rifts, ZANU and ZAPU nominally united as the "Patriotic Front" (PF) in late 1976 in a successful attempt to augment overseas support for the black Rhodesian cause.

By the mid-1970s, it was apparent that white minority rule could not continue forever. Even Vorster realized that white rule in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1 was not a realistic option. Smith, who was decisively re-elected three times during the 1970s, eventually came to this conclusion as well. He announced his acceptance in principle of <a href="one%20man%2C%20one%20vote">one man, one vote</a> during <a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a>'s Anglo-American initiative in September 1976, and in March 1978 concluded the <a href="Internal%20Settlement">Internal Settlement</a> with non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop <a href="Abel%20Muzorewa">Abel Muzorewa</a>, the Reverend <a href="Ndabaningi%20Sithole">Ndabaningi Sithole</a> and Chief <a href="Jeremiah%20Chirau">Jeremiah Chirau</a>. This settlement, boycotted by the PF and rejected internationally, led to <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia%20general%20election%2C%201979">multiracial elections</a> and Rhodesia's reconstitution under majority rule as <a href="Zimbabwe%20Rhodesia">Zimbabwe Rhodesia</a> in June 1979. Muzorewa, the electoral victor, took office as the country's first black Prime Minister at the head of a coalition Cabinet comprising 12 blacks and five whites, including Smith as <a href="minister%20without%20portfolio">minister without portfolio</a>. Dismissing Muzorewa as a "neocolonial puppet", ZANLA and ZIPRA continued their armed struggle until December 1979, when Whitehall, Salisbury and the Patriotic Front <a href="Lancaster%20House%20Agreement">settled at Lancaster House</a>. Muzorewa's government revoked UDI, thereby ending the country's claim to be independent after 14 years, and dissolved itself. The UK suspended the constitution and vested full executive and legislative powers in a new Governor, <a href="Christopher%20Soames%2C%20Baron%20Soames">Lord Soames</a>, who oversaw a ceasefire and <a href="Southern%20Rhodesian%20general%20election%2C%201980">fresh elections</a> during February and March 1980. These were won by ZANU, whose leader <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a> became Prime Minister when the UK granted independence to Zimbabwe as a republic within the Commonwealth in April 1980.

Eurasian crag martin

The Eurasian crag martin or just crag martin ("Ptyonoprogne rupestris") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> in the <a href="swallow">swallow</a> family. It is about long with ash-brown upperparts and paler underparts, and a short, square tail that has distinctive white patches on most of its feathers. It breeds in the mountains of southern Europe, northwestern Africa and southern Asia. It can be confused with the three other species in its genus, but is larger than both, with brighter tail spots and different plumage tone. Many European birds are resident, but some northern populations and most Asian breeders are <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering in northern Africa, the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> or <a href="India">India</a>.

The Eurasian crag martin builds a nest adherent to the rock under a cliff overhang or increasingly onto a man-made structure. It makes a neat half-cup mud nest with an inner soft lining of feathers and dry grass. Nests are often solitary, although a few pairs may breed relatively close together at good locations. Two to five brown-blotched white eggs are incubated mainly by the female, and both parents feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, but is <a href="gregarious">gregarious</a> outside the breeding season. It feeds on a wide variety of insects that are caught in its beak as the martin flies near to cliff faces or over streams and alpine meadows. Adults and young may be hunted and eaten by <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> or <a href="corvidae">corvid</a>s, and this species is a host of blood-sucking mites. With its very large and expanding range and large population there are no significant conservation concerns.

This bird is closely related to the other three crag martins which share its genus, and has sometimes been considered to be the same species as one or both, although it appears that there are areas where two species' ranges overlap without <a href="hybrid%20%28biology%29">hybridisation</a> occurring. All three "Ptyonoprogne" crag martins are quite similar in behaviour to other <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> swallows that build mud nests, and are sometimes subsumed into the larger genus "<a href="Hirundo">Hirundo</a>", but this approach leads to inconsistencies in classifying other genera, particularly the <a href="Delichon">house martins</a>.

The Eurasian crag martin was formally described as "Hirundo rupestris" by Italian naturalist <a href="Giovanni%20Antonio%20Scopoli">Giovanni Antonio Scopoli</a> in 1769 and was moved to the new genus "<a href="Ptyonoprogne">Ptyonoprogne</a>" by German ornithologist <a href="Heinrich%20Gustav%20Reichenbach">Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach</a> in 1850. Its nearest relatives are the three other members of the genus, the <a href="pale%20crag%20martin">pale crag martin</a>, "P. obsoleta", the <a href="rock%20martin">rock martin</a>, "P. fuligula", and the <a href="dusky%20crag%20martin">dusky crag martin</a>, "P. concolor". The genus name is derived from the Greek "ptuon" (πτύον), "a fan", referring to the shape of the opened tail, and <a href="Procne">Procne</a> (Πρόκνη), a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow. The specific "rupestris" means "of rocks", from the Latin "rupes" "rock". There are no generally recognised subspecies. Two races, Central Asian "P. r. centralasica" and "P. r. theresae" in the <a href="Atlas%20Mountains">Atlas Mountains</a> of Morocco, have been proposed, but the slight differences in size and colour show no consistent geographical pattern. Fossils of this species have been found in <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a> deposits in Bulgaria, and in central France in layers dated at 242,000 to 301,000 years ago.

The four "Ptyonoprogne" species are members of the swallow family of birds, and are placed in the subfamily Hirundininae, which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive <a href="river%20martin">river martin</a>s. <a href="DNA">DNA</a> studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. The groups are the "core martins" including burrowing species like the <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a>, the "nest-adopters", which are birds like the <a href="tree%20swallow">tree swallow</a> that utilise natural cavities, and the "mud nest builders". The "Ptyonoprogne" species construct an open mud nest and therefore belong to the last group; "<a href="Hirundo">Hirundo</a>" species also build open nests, "<a href="Delichon">Delichon</a>" house martins have a closed nest, and the "<a href="Cecropis">Cecropis</a>" and "<a href="Petrochelidon">Petrochelidon</a>" swallows have <a href="retort">retort-like</a> closed nests with an entrance tunnel.

"Ptyonoprogne" is closely related to the larger swallow genus "Hirundo" into which it is often subsumed, but a DNA analysis showed that an enlarged genus "Hirundo" should logically contain all the mud-builder genera, including the "<a href="Delichon">Delichon</a>" house martins, a practice which few authorities follow. Although the nests of the "Ptyonoprogne" crag martins resembles those of typical "Hirundo" species like the <a href="barn%20swallow">barn swallow</a>, the research showed that if "Delichon", "<a href="Cecropis">Cecropis</a>" and "<a href="Petrochelidon">Petrochelidon</a>" are split from "Hirundo", "Ptyonoprogne" should also be treated as a separate genus.

The Eurasian crag martin is long with a wingspan, and weighs an average . It has ash-brown upperparts and paler underparts, and has a broader body, wings and tail than any other European swallow. The tail is short and square, with white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers. The underwing and undertail <a href="Covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a> are blackish, the eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are alike, but juveniles have buff-brown tips to the plumage of the head, upperparts and wing coverts. This species can be distinguished from the <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a> by its larger size, the white patches on the tail, and its lack of a brown breast band. Where the range overlaps with that of another "Ptyonoprogne" species, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives.

The crag martin's flight appears relatively slow for a swallow. Rapid wing beats are interspersed with flat-winged glides, and its long flexible <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primaries">primaries</a> give it the agility to manoeuvre near cliff faces. The average migration flight speed has been measured at 9.9 m/s (32.5 ft/s), less than the roughly 11 m/s (36 ft/s) typical for hirundines, but the data is limited. The bird often flies high, and shows the white spots as it spreads its tail. The vocalisations include short high "pli", and "piieh" and "tshir" calls resembling those of the <a href="linnet">linnet</a> and the <a href="Common%20house%20martin">house martin</a> respectively.

The Eurasian crag martin breeds in mountains from <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberia</a> and northwesternmost Africa through southern Europe, the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> and the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> to southwestern and northeastern China. Northern populations are <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, with European birds wintering in north Africa, Senegal, Ethiopia and the <a href="Nile">Nile Valley</a>, and Asian breeders going to southern China, the Indian subcontinent and the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a>. Some European birds stay north of the Mediterranean, and, like martins in warmer areas such as India, Turkey and Cyprus, just move to lower ground after breeding. The breeding range is bounded by the July isotherm, and wintering areas need a temperature of about for enough insect food to be available. This is a rare species any distance north of its breeding areas. For example, there are only eight records from the UK, none from Ireland, and the first record for Sweden was reported as recently as 1996. South of its normal wintering range, it has occurred as a vagrant in The Gambia.

Crag martins breed on dry, warm and sheltered cliffs in mountainous areas with crags and gorges. The typical altitude is but breeding occurs up to in Central Asia. The Eurasian crag martin's choice of nest sites is very similar to that of <a href="Savi%27s%20pipistrelle">Savi's pipistrelle</a>, "Hypsugo savii"; the bird and the bat often breed in the same locations and have almost identical ranges in Europe. In South Asia, migrant Eurasian birds sometimes join with flocks of the dusky crag martin and roost communally on ledges of cliffs or buildings.

Crag martin pairs nest alone or in small <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a>, usually containing fewer than ten nests. Nests are on average apart and each pair aggressively defends its breeding territory against other crag martin and most other bird species. Nesting takes place from May to August, and usually two broods are raised. The nest, built by both adults, is an open half cup made of mud and lined with soft material such as feathers or dry grass. It is constructed under an overhang on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or cave, or on a man-made structure. It takes one to three weeks to build and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years. The clutch is two to five eggs with an average of three. The eggs are white with brownish blotches particularly at the wide end, and average with a weight of . The eggs are incubated mainly by the female for 13–17 days to hatching, and the chicks take another 24–27 days to fledge. Both parents feed the chicks bringing food every two to five minutes, and the young are fed for 14–21 days after fledging. With such frequent feeding rates the adults mainly forage in the best hunting zones in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since the further they fly to forage the longer it would take to bring food to the chicks in the nest. In an Italian study, the hatching rate was 80.2 percent, and the average number of fledged young was 3.1.

The crag martin has over the last few decades increasingly used houses and other man-made sites to nest. This greater availability of breeding sites has enabled the species to expand its range, but it is possible that this will lead to competition with other hirundines, such as the barn swallow and <a href="common%20house%20martin">common house martin</a>, which also use artificial nest sites.

An Italian study showed that, as with other aerial feeders, the start of breeding was delayed by cold or wet weather, but this had no influence on the <a href="avian%20clutch%20size">clutch size</a> nor on the number of fledged young. Unexpectedly, it was found that once the eggs had hatched there was a negative relationship between temperature and the number of fledged young. The authors suggested that hot weather dried up the small rivers where the parents found food. Colony size did not influence the laying date, the clutch size or the number of successfully fledged young, but this species does not form large colonies anyway.

The Eurasian crag martin feeds mainly on insects caught in its beak in flight, although it will occasionally take prey items off rocks, the ground, or a water surface. When breeding, birds often fly back and forth near to a rock face hunting for insects, feeding both inside and outside the nesting territory. At other times, they may hunt flying above streams or alpine meadows. The insects taken depend on what is locally available and may include <a href="fly">flies</a>, ants, aerial spiders, and <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s. Aquatic species such as <a href="Plecoptera">stoneflies</a>, <a href="caddisfly">caddisflies</a> and <a href="Gerridae">pond skaters</a> appear to be important in at least Spain and Italy. Unlike other hirundines, these birds feed close to their breeding sites, and may be locally vulnerable to fluctuations in insect availability. This martin is gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form sizeable flocks where food is abundant. Cliff faces generate <a href="standing%20wave">standing wave</a>s in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The crag martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns.

This species is occasionally hunted by the <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, which shares its mountain habitat, and during its migration over the Himalayas, it is reported to be subject to predation by crows. <a href="Common%20kestrel">Common kestrel</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20sparrowhawk">Eurasian sparrowhawk</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20jay">Eurasian jay</a>s and <a href="common%20raven">common raven</a>s are also treated as predators and attacked by repeated dives if they approach nesting cliffs. Despite the general aggressiveness of the martin, it tolerates <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> common house martins, perhaps because the large numbers of that highly colonial species provide an early warning of predators.

The crag martin is a host of blood-sucking mites of the genus "Dermanyssus", including "D. chelidonis", and of the nasal mite "Ptilonyssus ptyonoprognes". Two new species of parasites were first discovered on this martin, the fly "Ornithomya rupes" in Gibraltar and the flea "Ceratophyllus nanshanensis" from China.

The European population of the Eurasian crag martin is estimated to be 360,000–1,110,000 individuals, including 120,000–370,000 breeding pairs. A rough estimate of the worldwide population is 500,000–5,000,000 individuals, with Europe hosting between one-quarter and one-half of the total. The population is estimated to be increasing following a northward expansion, which may be partly due to increased use of man-made structures as nest sites. Expansions of the range have been reported in Austria (where motorway bridges are used as nest sites), Switzerland, the former Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. With its very large range and high numbers, the Eurasian crag martin is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

The Sun Also Rises

The Sun Also Rises, a 1926 novel by American <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, portrays American and British expatriates who travel from Paris to the <a href="San%20Ferm%C3%ADn">Festival of San Fermín</a> in <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a> to watch the <a href="running%20of%20the%20bulls">running of the bulls</a> and the <a href="bullfights">bullfights</a>. An early and enduring <a href="modernist">modernist</a> novel, it received mixed reviews upon publication. However, Hemingway biographer Jeffrey Meyers writes that it is now "recognized as Hemingway's greatest work", and Hemingway scholar Linda Wagner-Martin calls it his most important novel. The novel was published in the United States in October 1926 by <a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Scribner's</a>. A year later, <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> published the novel in London under the title Fiesta. It remains in print.

Hemingway began writing the novel on his birthday—21 July—in 1925, and finished the draft manuscript barely two months later, in September. After setting aside the manuscript for a short period, he worked on revisions during the winter of 1926. 

The basis for the novel was Hemingway's trip to Spain in 1925. The setting was unique and memorable, depicting sordid café life in Paris and the excitement of the Pamplona festival, with a middle section devoted to descriptions of a fishing trip in the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a>. Hemingway's sparse writing style, combined with his restrained use of description to convey characterizations and action, demonstrates his "<a href="Iceberg%20Theory">Iceberg Theory</a>" of writing.

The novel is a "<a href="roman%20%C3%A0%20clef">roman à clef</a>": the characters are based on real people in Hemingway's circle, and the action is based on real events. Hemingway presents his notion that the "<a href="Lost%20Generation">Lost Generation</a>"—considered to have been decadent, dissolute, and irretrievably damaged by <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>—was in fact resilient and strong. Hemingway investigates the themes of love and death, the revivifying power of nature, and the concept of masculinity.

In the 1920s Hemingway lived in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, was <a href="foreign%20correspondent">foreign correspondent</a> for the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>", and traveled to <a href="Smyrna">Smyrna</a> to report about the <a href="Greco-Turkish%20War%20%281919%E2%80%931922%29">Greco–Turkish War</a>. He wanted to use his journalism experience to write fiction, believing that a story could be based on real events when a writer distilled his own experiences in such a way that, according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, "what he made up was truer than what he remembered".
With his wife <a href="Hadley%20Richardson">Hadley Richardson</a>, Hemingway first visited the Festival of <a href="San%20Ferm%C3%ADn">San Fermín</a> in <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a>, Spain, in 1923, where he was following his recent passion for <a href="bullfighting">bullfighting</a>. The couple returned to Pamplona in 1924—enjoying the trip immensely—this time accompanied by <a href="Eric%20Dorman-Smith">Chink Dorman-Smith</a>, <a href="John%20Dos%20Passos">John Dos Passos</a>, and Donald Ogden Stewart and his wife. The two returned a third time in June 1925 and stayed at the hotel of his friend <a href="Juanito%20Quintana">Juanito Quintana</a>. That year, they brought with them a different group of American and British <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a>s: Hemingway's <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> boyhood friend Bill Smith, Stewart, recently divorced <a href="Duff%20Twysden">Duff, Lady Twysden</a>, her lover Pat Guthrie, and <a href="Harold%20Loeb">Harold Loeb</a>. In Pamplona, the group quickly disintegrated. Hemingway, attracted to Duff, was jealous of Loeb, who had recently been on a romantic getaway with her; by the end of the week the two men had a public fistfight. Against this background was the influence of the young <a href="Torero">matador</a> from <a href="Ronda">Ronda</a>, <a href="Cayetano%20Ord%C3%B3%C3%B1ez">Cayetano Ordóñez</a>, whose brilliance in the <a href="bullring">bullring</a> affected the spectators. Ordóñez honored Hemingway's wife by presenting her, from the bullring, with the ear of a bull he killed. Outside of Pamplona, the fishing trip to the <a href="Irati%20River">Irati River</a> (near <a href="Burguete">Burguete</a> in <a href="Navarre">Navarre</a>) was marred by polluted water.

Hemingway had intended to write a nonfiction book about bullfighting, but then decided that the week's experiences had presented him with enough material for a <a href="novel">novel</a>. A few days after the fiesta ended, on his birthday (21 July), he began writing what would eventually become "The Sun Also Rises". By 17 August, with 14 chapters written and a working title of "Fiesta" chosen, Hemingway returned to Paris. He finished the draft on 21 September 1925, writing a foreword the following weekend and changing the title to "The Lost Generation".

A few months later, in December 1925, Hemingway and his wife spent the winter in <a href="Schruns">Schruns</a>, Austria, where he began revising the manuscript extensively. <a href="Pauline%20Pfeiffer">Pauline Pfeiffer</a> joined them in January, and—against Hadley's advice—urged him to sign a contract with <a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Scribner's</a>. Hemingway left Austria for a quick trip to New York to meet with the publishers, and on his return, during a stop in Paris, began an affair with Pauline. He returned to Schruns to finish the revisions in March. In June, he was in Pamplona with both Richardson and Pfeiffer. On their return to Paris, Richardson asked for a separation, and left for the south of France. In August, alone in Paris, Hemingway completed the proofs, dedicating the novel to his wife and son. After the publication of the book in October, Hadley asked for a divorce; Hemingway subsequently gave her the book's <a href="royalties">royalties</a>.

Hemingway apparently maneuvered <a href="Boni%20%26amp%3B%20Liveright">Boni & Liveright</a> into terminating their contract so he could have "The Sun Also Rises" published by Scribner's instead. In December 1925 he quickly wrote "<a href="The%20Torrents%20of%20Spring">The Torrents of Spring</a>"—a satirical <a href="novella">novella</a> attacking <a href="Sherwood%20Anderson">Sherwood Anderson</a>—and sent it to his publishers Boni & Liveright. His three-book contract with them included a termination clause should they reject a single submission. Unamused by the satire against one of their most saleable authors, Boni & Liveright immediately rejected it and terminated the contract. Within weeks Hemingway signed a contract with Scribner's, who agreed to publish "The Torrents of Spring" and all of his subsequent work.

Scribner's published the novel on 22 October 1926. Its <a href="first%20edition">first edition</a> consisted of 5090 copies, selling at $2.00 per copy. Cleonike Damianakes illustrated the <a href="dust%20jacket">dust jacket</a> with a <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> design of a seated, robed woman, her head bent to her shoulder, eyes closed, one hand holding an apple, her shoulders and a thigh exposed. Editor <a href="Maxwell%20Perkins">Maxwell Perkins</a> intended "Cleon's respectably sexy" design to attract "the feminine readers who control the destinies of so many novels". Two months later the book was in a second printing with 7000 copies sold. Subsequent printings were ordered; by 1928, after the publication of Hemingway's short story collection "<a href="Men%20Without%20Women%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">Men Without Women</a>", the novel was in its eighth printing. In 1927 the novel was published in the UK by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>, titled "Fiesta", without the two epigraphs. Two decades later, in 1947, Scribner's released three of Hemingway's works as a boxed set, including "The Sun Also Rises", "<a href="A%20Farewell%20to%20Arms">A Farewell to Arms</a>", and "<a href="For%20Whom%20the%20Bell%20Tolls">For Whom the Bell Tolls</a>".

By 1983, "The Sun Also Rises" had been in print continuously since its publication in 1926, and was likely one of the most translated titles in the world. At that time Scribner's began to print cheaper mass-market paperbacks of the book, in addition to the more expensive trade paperbacks already in print. In the 1990s, British editions were titled "Fiesta: The Sun Also Rises." In 2006 <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a> began to produce <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> versions of Hemingway's novels, including "The Sun Also Rises".

On the surface, the novel is a love story between the <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> Jake Barnes—a man whose war wound has made him unable to have sex—and the promiscuous divorcée usually identified as Lady Brett Ashley. Barnes is an expatriate American journalist living in Paris, while Brett is a twice-divorced Englishwoman with <a href="Bob%20cut">bobbed</a> hair and numerous love affairs, and embodies the new sexual freedom of the 1920s. Brett's affair with Robert Cohn causes Jake to be upset and break off his friendship with Cohn; her seduction of the 19-year-old <a href="Torero">matador</a> Romero causes Jake to lose his good reputation among the Spaniards in <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a>.

Book One is set in the <a href="caf%C3%A9%20society">café society</a> of young American <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a>s in Paris. In the opening scenes, Jake plays tennis with his college friend Robert Cohn, picks up a prostitute (Georgette), and runs into Brett and Count Mippipopolous in a nightclub. Later, Brett tells Jake she loves him, but they both know that they have no chance at a stable relationship.

In Book Two, Jake is joined by Bill Gorton, recently arrived from New York, and Brett's fiancé Mike Campbell, who arrives from Scotland. Jake and Bill travel south and meet Robert Cohn at <a href="Bayonne">Bayonne</a> for a fishing trip in the hills northeast of <a href="Pamplona">Pamplona</a>. Instead of fishing, Cohn stays in Pamplona to wait for the overdue Brett and Mike. Cohn had an affair with Brett a few weeks earlier and still feels possessive of her despite her engagement to Mike. After Jake and Bill enjoy five days of fishing the streams near <a href="Burguete">Burguete</a>, they rejoin the group in Pamplona.

All begin to drink heavily. Cohn is resented by the others, who taunt him with <a href="anti-semitic">anti-semitic</a> remarks. During the <a href="wikt%3Afiesta">fiesta</a> the characters drink, eat, watch the <a href="Running%20of%20the%20Bulls">running of the bulls</a>, attend bullfights, and bicker with each other. Jake introduces Brett to the 19-year-old matador Romero at the Hotel Montoya; she is smitten with him and seduces him. The jealous tension among the men builds—Jake, Campbell, Cohn, and Romero each want Brett. Cohn, who had been a champion boxer in college, has a fistfight with Jake and Mike, and another with Romero, whom he beats up. Despite his injuries, Romero continues to perform brilliantly in the bullring.

Book Three shows the characters in the aftermath of the fiesta. Sober again, they leave Pamplona; Bill returns to Paris, Mike stays in Bayonne, and Jake goes to <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a> on the northern coast of Spain. As Jake is about to return to Paris, he receives a <a href="telegram">telegram</a> from Brett asking for help; she had gone to <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a> with Romero. He finds her there in a cheap hotel, without money, and without Romero. She announces she has decided to go back to Mike. The novel ends with Jake and Brett in a taxi speaking of the things that might have been.

The first book of "The Sun Also Rises" is set in mid-1920s Paris. Americans were drawn to Paris in the <a href="Roaring%20Twenties">Roaring Twenties</a> by the favorable <a href="exchange%20rate">exchange rate</a>, with as many as 200,000 English-speaking expatriates living there. The "<a href="International%20Herald%20Tribune">Paris Tribune</a>" reported in 1925 that Paris had an <a href="American%20Hospital%20of%20Paris">American Hospital</a>, an American Library, and an American Chamber of Commerce. Many American writers were disenchanted with the US, where they found less artistic freedom than in Europe. (For example, Hemingway was in Paris during the period when "<a href="Ulysses%20%28novel%29">Ulysses</a>", written by his friend <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, was banned and burned in New York.)

The themes of "The Sun Also Rises" appear in its two <a href="Epigraph%20%28literature%29">epigraphs</a>. The first is an allusion to the "<a href="Lost%20Generation">Lost Generation</a>", a term coined by <a href="Gertrude%20Stein">Gertrude Stein</a> referring to the post-war generation; the other epigraph is a long quotation from <a href="Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a>: "One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever. The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose." Hemingway told his editor Max Perkins that the book was not so much about a generation being lost, but that "the earth abideth forever." He thought the characters in "The Sun Also Rises" may have been "battered" but were not lost.

Hemingway scholar Wagner-Martin writes that Hemingway wanted the book to be about morality, which he emphasized by changing the working title from "Fiesta" to "The Sun Also Rises." Wagner-Martin argues that the book can be read either as a novel about bored expatriates or as a morality tale about a protagonist who searches for integrity in an immoral world. Months before Hemingway left for Pamplona, the press was depicting the Parisian <a href="Latin%20Quarter%2C%20Paris">Latin Quarter</a>, where he lived, as decadent and depraved. He began writing the story of a matador corrupted by the influence of the Latin Quarter crowd; he expanded it into a novel about Jake Barnes at risk of being corrupted by wealthy and inauthentic expatriates.
The characters form a group, sharing similar norms, and each greatly affected by the war. Hemingway captures the angst of the age and transcends the love story of Brett and Jake, although they are representative of the period: Brett is starved for reassurance and love and Jake is sexually maimed. His wound symbolizes the disability of the age, the disillusion, and the frustrations felt by an entire generation.

Hemingway thought he lost touch with American values while living in Paris, but his biographer Michael Reynolds claims the opposite, seeing evidence of the author's <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">midwestern American</a> values in the novel. Hemingway admired hard work. He portrayed the matadors and the prostitutes, who work for a living, in a positive manner, but Brett, who prostitutes herself, is emblematic of "the rotten crowd" living on inherited money. It is Jake, the working journalist, who pays the bills again and again when those who can pay do not. Hemingway shows, through Jake's actions, his disapproval of the people who did not pay up. Reynolds says that Hemingway shows the tragedy, not so much of the decadence of the Montparnasse crowd, but of the decline in American values of the period. As such, the author created an American hero who is impotent and powerless. Jake becomes the moral center of the story. He never considers himself part of the expatriate crowd because he is a working man; to Jake a working man is genuine and authentic, and those who do not work for a living spend their lives posing.

The twice-divorced Brett Ashley represented the liberated <a href="New%20Woman">New Woman</a> (in the 1920s, divorces were common and easy to be had in Paris). James Nagel writes that, in Brett, Hemingway created one of the more fascinating women in 20th-century American literature. Sexually promiscuous, she is a denizen of Parisian nightlife and cafés. In Pamplona she sparks chaos: in her presence, the men drink too much and fight. She also seduces the young bullfighter Romero and becomes a <a href="Circe">Circe</a> in the festival. Critics describe her variously as complicated, elusive, and enigmatic; Donald Daiker writes that Hemingway "treats her with a delicate balance of sympathy and antipathy." She is vulnerable, forgiving, independent—qualities that Hemingway juxtaposes with the other women in the book, who are either prostitutes or overbearing nags.

Nagel considers the novel a tragedy. Jake and Brett have a relationship that becomes destructive because their love cannot be consummated. Conflict over Brett destroys Jake's friendship with Robert Cohn, and her behavior in Pamplona affects Jake's hard-won reputation among the Spaniards. Meyers sees Brett as a woman who wants sex without love while Jake can only give her love without sex. Although Brett sleeps with many men, it is Jake she loves. Dana Fore writes that Brett is willing to be with Jake in spite of his disability, in a "non-traditional erotic relationship." Other critics such as <a href="Leslie%20Fiedler">Leslie Fiedler</a> and Nina Baym see her as a supreme bitch; Fiedler sees Brett as one of the "outstanding examples of Hemingway's 'bitch women. Jake becomes bitter about their relationship, as when he says, "Send a girl off with a man ... Now go and bring her back. And sign the wire with love."

Critics interpret the Jake–Brett relationship in various ways. Daiker suggests that Brett's behavior in Madrid—after Romero leaves and when Jake arrives at her summons—reflects her immorality. Scott Donaldson thinks Hemingway presents the Jake–Brett relationship in such a manner that Jake knew "that in having Brett for a friend 'he had been getting something for nothing' and that sooner or later he would have to pay the bill." Daiker notes that Brett relies on Jake to pay for her train fare from Madrid to <a href="San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n">San Sebastián</a>, where she rejoins her fiancé Mike. In a piece Hemingway cut, he has Jake thinking, "you learned a lot about a woman by not sleeping with her." By the end of the novel, although Jake loves Brett, he appears to undergo a transformation in Madrid when he begins to distance himself from her. Reynolds believes that Jake represents the "<a href="everyman">everyman</a>," and that in the course of the narrative he loses his honor, faith, and hope. He sees the novel as a <a href="morality%20play">morality play</a> with Jake as the person who loses the most.

In "The Sun Also Rises", Hemingway contrasts Paris with Pamplona, and the frenzy of the fiesta with the tranquillity of the Spanish countryside. Spain was Hemingway's favorite European country; he considered it a healthy place, and the only country "that hasn't been shot to pieces." He was profoundly affected by the spectacle of bullfighting, writing, It isn't just brutal like they always told us. It's a great tragedy—and the most beautiful thing I've ever seen and takes more guts and skill and guts again than anything possibly could. It's just like having a ringside seat at the war with nothing going to happen to you. He demonstrated what he considered the purity in the culture of bullfighting—called "afición"—and presented it as an authentic way of life, contrasted against the inauthenticity of the Parisian <a href="Bohemianism">bohemians</a>. To be accepted as an "aficionado" was rare for a non-Spaniard; Jake goes through a difficult process to gain acceptance by the "fellowship of "afición.""

The Hemingway scholar Allen Josephs thinks the novel is centered on the "<a href="Bullfighting">corrida</a>" (the bullfighting), and how each character reacts to it. Brett seduces the young matador; Cohn fails to understand and expects to be bored; Jake understands fully because only he moves between the world of the inauthentic expatriates and the authentic Spaniards; the hotel keeper Montoya is the keeper of the faith; and Romero is the artist in the ring—he is both innocent and perfect, and the one who bravely faces death. The "corrida" is presented as an idealized drama in which the matador faces death, creating a moment of <a href="existentialism">existentialism</a> or "nada" (nothingness), broken when he vanquishes death by killing the bull.
Hemingway presents matadors as heroic characters dancing in a bullring. He considered the bullring as war with precise rules, in contrast to the messiness of the real war that he, and by extension Jake, experienced. Critic Keneth Kinnamon notes that young Romero is the novel's only honorable character. Hemingway named Romero after <a href="Pedro%20Romero">Pedro Romero</a>, an 18th-century bullfighter who killed thousands of bulls in the most difficult manner: having the bull impale itself on his sword as he stood perfectly still. Reynolds says Romero, who symbolizes the classically pure matador, is the "one idealized figure in the novel." Josephs says that when Hemingway changed Romero's name from Guerrita and imbued him with the characteristics of the historical Romero, he also changed the scene in which Romero kills a bull to one of "recibiendo" (receiving the bull) in homage to the historical namesake.

Before the group arrives in Pamplona, Jake and Bill take a fishing trip to the Irati River. As <a href="Harold%20Bloom">Harold Bloom</a> points out, the scene serves as an interlude between the Paris and Pamplona sections, "an oasis that exists outside linear time." On another level it reflects "the mainstream of American fiction beginning with the Pilgrims seeking refuge from English oppression"—the prominent theme in American literature of escaping into the wilderness, as seen in <a href="James%20Fenimore%20Cooper">Cooper</a>, <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Hawthorne</a>, <a href="Herman%20Melville">Melville</a>, <a href="Mark%20Twain">Twain</a>, and <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Thoreau</a>. Fiedler calls the theme "The Sacred Land"; he thinks the American West is evoked in "The Sun Also Rises" by the <a href="Pyrenees">Pyrenees</a> and given a symbolic nod with the name of the "Hotel Montana." In Hemingway's writing, nature is a place of refuge and rebirth, according to Stoltzfus, where the hunter or fisherman gains a moment of transcendence at the moment the prey is killed. Nature is the place where men act without women: men fish, men hunt, men find redemption. In nature Jake and Bill do not need to discuss the war because their war experience, paradoxically, is ever-present. The nature scenes serve as counterpoint to the fiesta scenes.

All of the characters drink heavily during the fiesta and generally throughout the novel. In his essay "Alcoholism in Hemingway's "The Sun Also Rises"", Matts Djos says the main characters exhibit alcoholic tendencies such as depression, anxiety and sexual inadequacy. He writes that Jake's self-pity is symptomatic of an alcoholic, as is Brett's out-of-control behavior. William Balassi thinks that Jake gets drunk to avoid his feelings for Brett, notably in the Madrid scenes at the end where he has three martinis before lunch and drinks three bottles of wine with lunch. Reynolds, however, believes the drinking is relevant as set against the historical context of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition in the United States</a>. The atmosphere of the fiesta lends itself to drunkenness, but the degree of revelry among the Americans also reflects a reaction against Prohibition. Bill, visiting from the US, drinks in Paris and in Spain. Jake is rarely drunk in Paris where he works but on vacation in Pamplona, he drinks constantly. Reynolds says that Prohibition split attitudes about morality, and in the novel Hemingway made clear his dislike of Prohibition.

Critics have seen Jake as an ambiguous representative of Hemingway manliness. For example, in the bar scene in Paris, Jake is angry at some homosexual men. The critic Ira Elliot suggests that Hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life, and that he aligns Jake with homosexual men because, like them, Jake does not have sex with women. Jake's anger shows his self-hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity. His sense of masculine identity is lost—he is less than a man. Elliot wonders if Jake's wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality, rather than only a loss of masculinity; the emphasis in the novel, however, is on Jake's interest in women. Hemingway's writing has been called <a href="homophobic">homophobic</a> because of the language his characters use. For example, in the fishing scenes, Bill confesses his fondness for Jake but then goes on to say, "I couldn't tell you that in New York. It'd mean I was a faggot."

In contrast to Jake's troubled masculinity, Romero represents an ideal masculine identity grounded in self-assurance, bravery, competence, and uprightness. The Davidsons note that Brett is attracted to Romero for these reasons, and they speculate that Jake might be trying to undermine Romero's masculinity by bringing Brett to him and thus diminishing his ideal stature.

Critics have examined issues of gender misidentification that are prevalent in much of Hemingway's work. He was interested in cross-gender themes, as shown by his depictions of effeminate men and boyish women. In his fiction, a woman's hair is often symbolically important and used to denote gender. Brett, with her short hair, is <a href="androgyny">androgynous</a> and compared to a boy—yet the ambiguity lies in the fact that she is described as a "damned fine-looking woman." While Jake is attracted to this ambiguity, Romero is repulsed by it. In keeping with his strict moral code he wants a feminine partner and rejects Brett because, among other things, she will not grow her hair.

Hemingway has been called anti-Semitic, most notably because of the characterization of Robert Cohn in the book. The other characters often refer to Cohn as a Jew, and once as a 'kike'. Shunned by the other members of the group, Cohn is characterized as "different", unable or unwilling to understand and participate in the fiesta. Cohn is never really part of the group—separated by his difference or his Jewish faith. Critic Susan Beegel goes so far as to claim, "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew." Hemingway critic Josephine Knopf speculates that Hemingway might have wanted to depict Cohn as a "shlemiel" (or fool), but she points out that Cohn lacks the characteristics of a traditional shlemiel.

Cohn is based on Harold Loeb, a fellow writer who rivaled Hemingway for the affections of Duff, Lady Twysden (the real-life inspiration for Brett). Biographer Michael Reynolds writes that in 1925, Loeb should have declined Hemingway's invitation to join them in Pamplona. Before the trip he was Duff's lover and Hemingway's friend; during the fiasco of the fiesta, he lost Duff and Hemingway's friendship. Hemingway used Loeb as the basis of a character remembered chiefly as a "rich Jew."

The novel is well known for its style, which is variously described as modern, <a href="hard-boiled">hard-boiled</a>, or understated. As a novice writer and journalist in Paris, Hemingway turned to <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>—who had a reputation as "an unofficial minister of culture who acted as mid-wife for new literary talent"—to mark and blue-ink his short stories. From Pound, Hemingway learned to write in the <a href="modernism">modernist</a> style: he used understatement, pared away sentimentalism, and presented images and scenes without explanations of meaning, most notably at the book's conclusion, in which multiple future possibilities are left for Brett and Jake. The scholar Anders Hallengren writes that because Hemingway learned from Pound to "distrust adjectives," he created a style "in accordance with the esthetics and ethics of raising the emotional temperature towards the level of universal truth by shutting the door on sentiment, on the subjective."

<a href="F.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BScott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> told Hemingway to "let the book's action play itself out among its characters." Hemingway scholar Linda Wagner-Martin writes that, in taking Fitzgerald's advice, Hemingway produced a novel without a central narrator: "Hemingway's book was a step ahead; it was the modernist novel." When Fitzgerald advised Hemingway to trim at least 2500 words from the opening sequence, which was 30 pages long, Hemingway wired the publishers telling them to cut the opening 30 pages altogether. The result was a novel without a focused starting point, which was seen as a modern perspective and critically well received.
Wagner-Martin speculates that Hemingway may have wanted to have a weak or negative hero as defined by <a href="Edith%20Wharton">Edith Wharton</a>, but he had no experience creating a hero or protagonist. At that point his fiction consisted of extremely short stories, not one of which featured a hero. The hero changed during the writing of "The Sun Also Rises": first the matador was the hero, then Cohn was the hero, then Brett, and finally Hemingway realized "maybe there is not any hero at all. Maybe a story is better without any hero." Balassi believes that in eliminating other characters as the protagonist, Hemingway brought Jake indirectly into the role of the novel's hero.

As a <a href="roman%20%C3%A0%20clef">roman à clef</a>, the novel based its characters on living people, causing scandal in the expatriate community. Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker writes that "word-of-mouth of the book" helped sales. Parisian expatriates gleefully tried to match the fictional characters to real identities. Moreover, he writes that Hemingway used prototypes easily found in the Latin Quarter on which to base his characters. The early draft identified the characters by their living counterparts; Jake's character was called Hem, and Brett's was called Duff.

Although the novel is written in a journalistic style, Frederic Svoboda writes that the striking thing about the work is "how quickly it moves away from a simple recounting of events." Jackson Benson believes that Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices for life in general. For example, Benson says that Hemingway drew out his experiences with "what if" scenarios: "what if I were wounded in such a way that I could not sleep at night? What if I were wounded and made crazy, what would happen if I were sent back to the front?" Hemingway believed that the writer could describe one thing while an entirely different thing occurs below the surface—an approach he called the <a href="iceberg%20theory">iceberg theory</a>, or the theory of omission.
Balassi says Hemingway applied the iceberg theory better in "The Sun Also Rises" than in any of his other works, by editing extraneous material or purposely leaving gaps in the story. He made editorial remarks in the manuscript that show he wanted to break from the stricture of Gertrude Stein's advice to use "clear restrained writing." In the earliest draft, the novel begins in Pamplona, but Hemingway moved the opening setting to Paris because he thought the <a href="Montparnasse">Montparnasse</a> life was necessary as a counterpoint to the later action in Spain. He wrote of Paris extensively, intending "not to be limited by the literary theories of others, [but] to write in his own way, and possibly, to fail." He added metaphors for each character: Mike's money problems, Brett's association with the <a href="Circe">Circe</a> myth, Robert's association with the segregated steer. It wasn't until the revision process that he pared down the story, taking out unnecessary explanations, minimizing descriptive passages, and stripping the dialogue, all of which created a "complex but tightly compressed story."

Hemingway said that he learned what he needed as a foundation for his writing from the style sheet for "<a href="The%20Kansas%20City%20Star">The Kansas City Star</a>," where he worked as cub reporter. The critic John Aldridge says that the minimalist style resulted from Hemingway's belief that to write authentically, each word had to be carefully chosen for its simplicity and authenticity and carry a great deal of weight. Aldridge writes that Hemingway's style "of a minimum of simple words that seemed to be squeezed onto the page against a great compulsion to be silent, creates the impression that those words—if only because there are so few of them—are sacramental." In Paris Hemingway had been experimenting with the <a href="Prosody%20%28linguistics%29">prosody</a> of the <a href="King%20James%20Bible">King James Bible</a>, reading aloud with his friend <a href="John%20Dos%20Passos">John Dos Passos</a>. From the style of the biblical text, he learned to build his prose incrementally; the action in the novel builds sentence by sentence, scene by scene and chapter by chapter.

The simplicity of his style is deceptive. Bloom writes that it is the effective use of <a href="parataxis">parataxis</a> that elevates Hemingway's prose. Drawing on the Bible, <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> and "<a href="Adventures%20of%20Huckleberry%20Finn">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a>", Hemingway wrote in deliberate understatement and he heavily incorporated parataxis, which in some cases almost becomes cinematic. His skeletal sentences were crafted in response to <a href="Henry%20James">Henry James</a>'s observation that World War I had "used up words," explains Hemingway scholar Zoe Trodd, who writes that his style is similar to a "multi-focal" photographic reality. The syntax, which lacks <a href="subordinating%20conjunctions">subordinating conjunctions</a>, creates static sentences. The photographic "snapshot" style creates a <a href="collage">collage</a> of images. Hemingway omits internal punctuation (colons, semicolons, dashes, parentheses) in favor of short declarative sentences, which are meant to build, as events build, to create a sense of the whole. He also uses techniques analogous to cinema, such as cutting quickly from one scene to the next, or splicing one scene into another. Intentional omissions allow the reader to fill the gap as though responding to instructions from the author and create three-dimensional prose. Biographer James Mellow writes that the bullfighting scenes are presented with a crispness and clarity that evoke the sense of a <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a>.

Hemingway also uses color and visual art techniques to convey emotional range in his descriptions of the Irati River. In "Translating Modernism: Fitzgerald and Hemingway," Ronald Berman compares Hemingway's treatment of landscape with that of the <a href="post-Impressionist">post-Impressionist</a> painter <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Paul Cézanne</a>. During a 1949 interview, Hemingway told <a href="Lillian%20Ross%20%28journalist%29">Lillian Ross</a> that he learned from Cézanne how to "make a landscape." In comparing writing to painting he told her, "This is what we try to do in writing, this and this, and woods, and the rocks we have to climb over." The landscape is seen subjectively—the viewpoint of the observer is paramount. To Jake, landscape "meant a search for a solid form ... not existentially present in [his] life in Paris."

Hemingway's first novel was arguably his best and most important and came to be seen as an iconic modernist novel, although Reynolds emphasizes that Hemingway was not philosophically a modernist. In the book, his characters epitomized the post-war expatriate generation for future generations. He had received good reviews for his volume of short stories, "<a href="In%20Our%20Time%20%28short%20story%20collection%29">In Our Time</a>", of which Edmund Wilson wrote, "Hemingway's prose was of the first distinction." Wilson's comments were enough to bring attention to the young writer.
Good reviews came in from many major publications. <a href="Conrad%20Aiken">Conrad Aiken</a> wrote in the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald%20Tribune">New York Herald Tribune</a>", "If there is a better dialogue to be written today I do not know where to find it"; and <a href="Bruce%20Barton">Bruce Barton</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>" that Hemingway "writes as if he had never read anybody's writing, as if he had fashioned the art of writing himself," and that the characters "are amazingly real and alive." Many reviewers, among them <a href="H.L.%20Mencken">H.L. Mencken</a>, praised Hemingway's style, use of understatement, and tight writing.

Other critics, however, disliked the novel. "<a href="The%20Nation">The Nation</a>" critic believed Hemingway's hard-boiled style was better suited to the short stories published in "In Our Time" than his novel. Writing in the "<a href="New%20Masses">New Masses</a>", Hemingway's friend John Dos Passos asked: "What's the matter with American writing these days? ... The few unsad young men of this lost generation will have to look for another way of finding themselves than the one indicated here." Privately he wrote Hemingway an apology for the review. The reviewer for the "<a href="Chicago%20Daily%20Tribune">Chicago Daily Tribune</a>" wrote of the novel, ""The Sun Also Rises" is the kind of book that makes this reviewer at least almost plain angry." Some reviewers disliked the characters, among them the reviewer for "<a href="The%20Dial">The Dial</a>", who thought the characters were shallow and vapid; and "<a href="The%20Nation%20and%20Atheneum">The Nation and Atheneum</a>" deemed the characters boring and the novel unimportant. The reviewer for "<a href="The%20Cincinnati%20Enquirer">The Cincinnati Enquirer</a>" wrote of the book that it "begins nowhere and ends in nothing."

Hemingway's family hated it. His mother, <a href="Grace%20Hall%20Hemingway">Grace Hemingway</a>, distressed that she could not face the criticism at her local book study class—where it was said that her son was "prostituting a great ability ... to the lowest uses"—expressed her displeasure in a letter to him:
The critics seem to be full of praise for your style and ability to draw word pictures but the decent ones always regret that you should use such great gifts in perpetuating the lives and habits of so degraded a strata of humanity ... It is a doubtful honor to produce one of the filthiest books of the year ... What is the matter? Have you ceased to be interested in nobility, honor and fineness in life? ... Surely you have other words in your vocabulary than "damn" and "bitch"—Every page fills me with a sick loathing.

Still, the book sold well, and young women began to emulate Brett while male students at <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> universities wanted to become "Hemingway heroes." Scribner's encouraged the publicity and allowed Hemingway to "become a minor American phenomenon"—a celebrity to the point that his divorce from Richardson and marriage to Pfieffer attracted media attention.

Reynolds believes "The Sun Also Rises" could have been written only circa 1925: it perfectly captured the period between World War I and the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, and immortalized a group of characters. In the years since its publication, the novel has been criticized for its anti-Semitism, as expressed in the characterization of Robert Cohn. Reynolds explains that although the publishers complained to Hemingway about his description of bulls, they allowed his use of Jewish epithets, which showed the degree to which anti-Semitism was accepted in the US after World War I. Cohn represented the Jewish establishment and contemporary readers would have understood this from his description. Hemingway clearly makes Cohn unlikeable not only as a character but as a character who is Jewish. Critics of the 1970s and 1980s considered Hemingway to be misogynistic and homophobic; by the 1990s his work, including "The Sun Also Rises", began to receive critical reconsideration by female scholars.

Hemingway's work continued to be popular in the latter half of the century and after his suicide in 1961. During the 1970s, "The Sun Also Rises" appealed to what Beegel calls the lost generation of the Vietnam era. Aldridge writes that "The Sun Also Rises" has kept its appeal because the novel is about being young. The characters live in the most beautiful city in the world, spend their days traveling, fishing, drinking, making love, and generally reveling in their youth. He believes the expatriate writers of the 1920s appeal for this reason, but that Hemingway was the most successful in capturing the time and the place in "The Sun Also Rises".

Bloom says that some of the characters have not stood the test of time, writing that modern readers are uncomfortable with the anti-semitic treatment of Cohn's character and the romanticization of a bullfighter. Moreover, Brett and Mike belong uniquely to the <a href="Jazz%20Age">Jazz Age</a> and do not translate to the modern era. Bloom believes the novel is in the <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a> of American literature for its formal qualities: its prose and style.

The novel made Hemingway famous, inspired young women across America to wear short hair and sweater sets like the heroine's—and to act like her too—and changed writing style in ways that could be seen in any American magazine published in the next twenty years. In many ways, the novel's stripped-down prose became a model for 20th-century American writing. Nagel writes that ""The Sun Also Rises" was a dramatic literary event and its effects have not diminished over the years."

The success of "The Sun Also Rises" guaranteed interest from <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> and <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>. In 1927 two Broadway producers wanted to adapt the story for the stage but made no immediate offers. Hemingway considered marketing the story directly to Hollywood, telling his editor <a href="Max%20Perkins">Max Perkins</a> that he would not sell it for less than $30,000—money he wanted his estranged wife Hadley Richardson to have. <a href="Conrad%20Aiken">Conrad Aiken</a> thought the book was perfect for a film adaptation solely on the strength of dialogue. Hemingway would not see a stage or film adaption anytime soon: he sold the film rights to <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> in 1932, but only in 1956 was the novel adapted to <a href="The%20Sun%20Also%20Rises%20%281957%20film%29">a film of the same name</a>. <a href="Peter%20Viertel">Peter Viertel</a> wrote the screenplay. <a href="Tyrone%20Power">Tyrone Power</a> as Jake played the lead role opposite <a href="Ava%20Gardner">Ava Gardner</a> as Brett and <a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a> as Mike. The <a href="royalties">royalties</a> went to Richardson. It was again adapted into a film in <a href="The%20Sun%20Also%20Rises%20%281984%20film%29">1984</a>. It was adapted into a <a href="The%20Sun%20Also%20Rises%20%28opera%29">one-act opera in 2000</a>.

Hemingway wrote more books about bullfighting: "<a href="Death%20in%20the%20Afternoon">Death in the Afternoon</a>" was published in 1932 and "<a href="The%20Dangerous%20Summer">The Dangerous Summer</a>" was published posthumously in 1985. His depictions of Pamplona, beginning with "The Sun Also Rises," helped to popularize the annual running of the bulls at the Festival of <a href="St.%20Fermin">St. Fermin</a>.

Grey jay

The grey jay ("Perisoreus canadensis"), also gray jay, Canada jay, camp robber, or whisky jack, is a <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Corvidae">Corvidae</a>. It is found in <a href="taiga">boreal forests</a> of <a href="North%20America">North America</a> north to the <a href="Tree%20line%23Arctic">tree line</a>, and in the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains%20subalpine%20zone">Rocky Mountains subalpine zone</a> south to <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> and <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>. A fairly large <a href="songbird">songbird</a>, the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey <a href="nape">nape</a>. It is one of three members of the genus "<a href="Perisoreus">Perisoreus</a>", a genus more closely related to the <a href="magpie">magpie</a> genus "<a href="Cyanopica">Cyanopica</a>" than to other birds known as <a href="jay">jay</a>s. The grey jay itself has nine recognized <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>.

Grey jays live year-round on permanent <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territories</a> in <a href="coniferous%20forests">coniferous forests</a>, surviving in winter months on food <a href="hoarding%20%28animal%20behavior%29">cached</a> throughout their territory in warmer periods. The birds form <a href="Monogamy%20in%20animals">monogamous</a> mating pairs, with pairs accompanied on their territories by a third juvenile from the previous season. Grey jays adapt to human activity in their territories and are known to approach humans for food, inspiring a list of colloquial names including "lumberjack", "camp robber", and "venison-hawk". The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) considers the grey jay a <a href="least-concern%20species">least-concern species</a>, however, populations in southern ranges may be affected adversely by <a href="global%20warming">global warming</a>.

The species is associated with <a href="Mythologies%20of%20the%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">mythological figures</a> of several <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a> cultures, including <a href="Wisakedjak">Wisakedjak</a>, a benevolent figure whose name was <a href="Anglicisation">anglicized</a> to Whiskyjack. In 2016, an online poll and expert panel conducted by "<a href="Canadian%20Geographic">Canadian Geographic</a>" magazine selected the grey jay as the <a href="national%20bird">national bird</a> of Canada, although the designation is not formally recognized.

In 1760 the French zoologist <a href="Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson">Mathurin Jacques Brisson</a> included a description of the grey jay in his "Ornithologie" based on a specimen collected in Canada. He used the French name "Le geay brun de Canada" and the Latin "Garralus canadensis fuscus". Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial system</a> and are not recognised by the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</a>. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> updated his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" for the <a href="12th%20edition%20of%20Systema%20Naturae">twelfth edition</a>, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the grey jay. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the <a href="binomial%20name">binomial name</a> "Corvus canadensis" and cited Brisson's work.

<a href="William%20John%20Swainson">William John Swainson</a> named it "Dysornithia brachyrhyncha" in 1831. French ornithologist <a href="Charles%20Lucien%20Bonaparte">Charles Lucien Bonaparte</a> assigned the grey jay to the genus "<a href="Perisoreus">Perisoreus</a>" in 1838 in "A geographical and comparative list of the birds of Europe and North America", along with the <a href="Siberian%20jay">Siberian jay</a>, "P. infaustus". The grey jay belongs to the <a href="crow">crow</a> and <a href="jay">jay</a> family <a href="Corvidae">Corvidae</a>. However, it and the other members of its genus are not closely related to other birds known as jays; they are instead close to the genus "<a href="Cyanopica">Cyanopica</a>", which contains the <a href="azure-winged%20magpie">azure-winged magpie</a>. Its relatives are native to Eurasia, and ancestors of the grey jay are thought to have diverged from their Old World relatives and crossed <a href="Beringia">Beringia</a> into North America.

A 2012 genetic study revealed four <a href="clade">clade</a>s across its range: a widespread "boreal" or "<a href="taiga">taiga</a>" clade ranging from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> to <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> and ranging south to the <a href="Black%20Hills">Black Hills</a> of South Dakota, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> and <a href="Utah">Utah</a> in the west and <a href="New%20England">New England</a> in the east, a "transcascade" clade in eastern <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> and <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and ranging into <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> and <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, a "Rocky Mountains (<a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>)" clade from the southern <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, and a "Pacific" clade from coastal <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, Washington, and southwestern Oregon. There was also a population of the boreal clade in the central Rocky Mountains between the Colorado and transcascade clades. Genetic dating suggests the Pacific clade diverged from the common ancestor of the other clades around three million years ago in the <a href="Piacenzian">Late Pliocene</a>.

The boreal clade is genetically diverse, suggesting that grey jays retreated to multiple areas of milder climate during previous <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>s and recolonized the region in warmer times.

Nine subspecies are recognized:

Two additional subspecies were formerly recognized:

The grey jay is a relatively large <a href="songbird">songbird</a>, though smaller than other jays. A typical adult grey jay is between long. Its <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a> is around . It weighs about . Adults have medium grey back feathers with a lighter grey underside. Its head is mostly white with a dark grey or black nape and hood, with a short black beak and dark eyes. The long tail is medium grey with lighter tips. The legs and feet are black. The <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is thick, providing insulation in the bird's cold native habitat. Like most corvids, grey jays are not <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a>, but males are slightly larger than females. Juveniles are initially coloured very dark grey all over, gaining adult plumage after a first <a href="moult">moult</a> in July or August. The average lifespan of territory-owning grey jays is eight years; the oldest known grey jay banded and recaptured in the wild was at least 17 years old.

A variety of <a href="bird%20vocalization">vocalizations</a> are used and, like other corvids, grey jays may <a href="mimicry">mimic</a> other bird species, especially predators. Calls include a whistled "quee-oo", and various clicks and chuckles. When predators are spotted, the bird announces a series of harsh clicks to signal a threat on the ground, or a series of repeated whistles to indicate a <a href="predation">predator</a> in the air.

The grey jay's range spans across northern North America, from northern Alaska east to Newfoundland and Labrador, and south to northern California, Idaho, Utah, east-central Arizona, north-central New Mexico, central Colorado, and southwestern South Dakota. It is also found in the northern reaches of the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, and New England. The grey jay may wander north of the <a href="breeding%20range">breeding range</a>. In winter it travels irregularly to northwestern Nebraska, central Minnesota, southeastern Wisconsin, central Michigan, southern Pennsylvania, central New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Fossil evidence indicates the grey jay was found as far south as Tennessee during the <a href="Last%20glacial%20period">last ice age</a>.

The vast majority of grey jays live where there is a strong presence of <a href="black%20spruce">black spruce</a> ("Picea mariana"), <a href="Picea%20glauca">white spruce</a> ("P. glauca"), <a href="Engelmann%20spruce">Engelmann spruce</a> ("P. engelmanni"), <a href="jack%20pine">jack pine</a> ("Pinus banksiana"), or <a href="lodgepole%20pine">lodgepole pine</a> ("P. contorta"). Grey jays do not inhabit the snowy, coniferous, and therefore seemingly appropriate <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> of California where no spruce occur. Nor do grey jays live in lower elevations of coastal Alaska or British Columbia dominated by <a href="Sitka%20spruce">Sitka spruce</a> ("Picea sitchensis"). The key <a href="habitat">habitat</a> requirements may be sufficiently cold temperatures to ensure successful storage of perishable food and <a href="tree%20bark">tree bark</a> with sufficiently pliable scales arranged in a shingle-like configuration that allows grey jays to wedge food items easily up into dry, concealed storage locations. Storage may also be assisted by the <a href="antibacterial">antibacterial</a> properties of the bark and foliage of boreal tree species. An exception to this general picture may be the well-marked subspecies "P. c. obscurus". It lives right down to the coast from Washington to northern California in the absence of cold temperatures or the putatively necessary tree species.

The grey jay typically <a href="brooding">breed</a>s at two years of age. <a href="Monogamy%20in%20animals">Monogamous</a>, pairs remain together for life, though a bird will pair up with a new partner if it is widowed. Breeding takes place during March and April, depending on latitude, in permanent, all-purpose <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territories</a>. Second broods are not attempted, perhaps allowing greater time for food storage.
Breeding is <a href="cooperative%20breeding">cooperative</a>. During the <a href="bird%20nest">nest-building phase</a> of the breeding season, grey jay breeding pairs are accompanied by a third, juvenile bird. A 1991 field study in Quebec and Ontario found that approximately 65% of grey jay trios included a dominant juvenile from the pair's previous breeding season, and approximately 30% of trios included non-dominant juveniles who had left their parents' territory. Occasionally, two nonbreeding juveniles accompany a pair of adults. The role of juveniles is in <a href="allofeeding">allofeeding</a> (food sharing) by retrieving caches and bringing food to younger siblings; however, this is only allowed by the parents during the post-<a href="fledgling%20%28birds%29">fledgling</a> period. Until then, parents will drive the other birds away from the nest. This may reduce the frequency of predator-attracting visits to the nest when young are most vulnerable. The benefits of juveniles participating in subsequent brood care may include "lightening the load" for the breeding pair, which may possibly increase longevity, reducing the probability of starvation of nestlings, and detecting and <a href="mobbing%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mobbing</a> predators near the nest. Dominant juveniles may eventually inherit the natal territory and breed, while unrelated juveniles may eventually fill a vacancy nearby or form a new breeding pair on previously unoccupied ground.

Breeding grey jays build nests and lay eggs in March or even February, when snow is deep in the <a href="boreal%20forest">boreal forest</a>. Male grey jays choose a nest site in a mature conifer tree; the nests are found most commonly in black spruce, with white spruce and <a href="balsam%20fir">balsam fir</a> ("Abies balsamea") also used, in Ontario and Quebec. With the male taking a lead role in construction, nests are constructed with brittle dead twigs pulled off of trees, as well as bark strips and <a href="lichen">lichen</a>s. The <a href="cup%20nest">cup</a> is just large enough to contain the female and her eggs, measuring about wide and deep. Insulation is provided by <a href="Cocoon%20%28silk%29%23Cocoon">cocoon</a>s of the <a href="Malacosoma%20disstria">forest tent caterpillar</a> ("Malacosoma disstria") filling the interstitial spaces of the nest, and feathers used to line the cup. Nests are usually built on the southwestern side of a tree for solar warming and are usually less than one nest diameter from the trunk. Nest height is typically above the ground. The average height of 264 nests surveyed in <a href="Algonquin%20Provincial%20Park">Algonquin Provincial Park</a> was above ground.

A clutch consists of 2 to 5 light green-grey eggs with darker spots. The mean <a href="Avian%20clutch%20size">clutch sizes</a> of grey jays in Algonquin Provincial Park and <a href="La%20Verendrye%20Provincial%20Park">La Verendrye Provincial Park</a> were 3.03 and 3.18 eggs, respectively. <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">Incubation</a> is performed only by the female and lasts an average of 18.5 days. The female is fed on the nest by her partner, rarely moving from the nest during incubation and for several days after hatching.

Grey jay young are <a href="altricial">altricial</a>. For the first three to four days after hatching, the female remains on the nest; when the male arrives with food, both parents help in feeding the nestlings. Nestling growth is most rapid from the fourth through the tenth day following hatching, during which time the female begins to participate in <a href="foraging">foraging</a>. The parents carry food to the nest in their throats. The accompanying nonbreeding third bird does not help with feeding during this period but is driven away by the parents if it approaches the nest. Food is a dark brown, viscous paste containing primarily <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s. Young grey jays leave the nest between 22 and 24 days after hatching, after which the third bird begins to participate in foraging and feeding. <a href="Biological%20dispersal">Natal dispersal distance</a> for the grey jay is a median of 0.0 km for males, for females, and a maximum distance of for males and females.

After 55 to 65 days, juveniles reach full adult measurements and battle among themselves until a <a href="dominance%20hierarchy">dominant</a> juvenile forces its siblings to leave the natal area. The dominant bird remains with its parents until the following season, while its siblings leave the natal territory to join an unrelated pair who failed to breed. In a study by Dan Strickland, two-thirds of dominant juveniles were male.

In studies conducted in Ontario and Quebec, the mortality rate for dominant juveniles was 52%, and mortality was 85% for juveniles who left the parents' territory between fledging in June to approximately mid-October. From fall to the following breeding season in March, further juvenile mortality was 50%. Territory-holding adult grey jays experienced low mortality rates (15.1 and 18.2% for males and females, respectively). The oldest known grey jay recaptured in the wild was at least 17 years old.

Grey jays are <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a>. They hunt such prey as arthropods, small <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s including rodents, and nestling birds, and have even been recorded taking a <a href="magnolia%20warbler">magnolia warbler</a> ("Dendroica magnolia") in flight. They have been reported to opportunistically hunt young amphibians such as the <a href="western%20chorus%20frog">western chorus frog</a> ("Pseudacris triseriata") in <a href="Chambers%20Lake%20%28Colorado%29">Chambers Lake, Colorado</a>, and the <a href="long-toed%20salamander">long-toed salamander</a> ("Ambystoma macrodactylum") in Whitehorse Bluff in <a href="Crater%20Lake%20National%20Park">Crater Lake National Park</a>, Oregon. Grey jays have been seen landing on <a href="moose">moose</a> ("Alces alces") to remove and eat engorged <a href="Dermacentor%20albipictus">winter ticks</a> ("Dermacentor albipictus") during April and May in Algonquin Provincial Park. Researchers also found a grey jay nest containing a brooding female, three hatchlings, and three warm, engorged winter deer ticks. Because the ticks were too large for the hatchlings to eat, it was hypothesized that the ticks may have served as "<a href="hot%20water%20bottle">hot water bottle</a>s", keeping hatchlings warm when parents were away from the nest.

Nestling birds are common prey, being taken more often from nests in trees rather than on the ground. Grey jays find them by moving from perch to perch and scanning surroundings. Avian nest predation by grey jays is not necessarily higher in <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">fragmented</a> versus unfragmented forest. Evidence from studies in the Pacific Northwest suggest a moderate increase in nest predation in <a href="logging">logged</a> plots adjacent to mature conifer forest, which is the grey jay's preferred habitat. Studies of nest predation by grey jays in Quebec have shown that the birds prefer preying on nests in open forest with high prominence of jack pine, and greater rates of predation in <a href="riparian%20zone">riparian</a> forest strips and <a href="variable%20retention">green-tree retention stands</a> versus <a href="clearcutting">clearcuts</a>. This may be due to increased availability of perch sites for avian predators such as the grey jay. Grey jays are suspected but not proven to prey on nests of the threatened <a href="marbled%20murrelet">marbled murrelet</a> ("Brachyramphus marmoratus") in coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest.

<a href="Carrion">Carrion</a>, <a href="fungus">fungi</a>, fruits such as <a href="Prunus%20virginiana">chokecherry</a> ("Prunus virginiana"), and <a href="seed">seed</a>s are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating <a href="Fuligo%20septica">slime mold</a> ("Fuligo septica") near Kennedy Hot Springs in the <a href="Glacier%20Peak%20Wilderness">Glacier Peak Wilderness</a>, Washington. This was the first report of any bird consuming slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food on the basis of profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the <a href="blue%20jay">blue jay</a>, "Cyanocitta cristata"), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.

The grey jay is a "scatterhoarder", <a href="hoarding%20%28animal%20behavior%29">caching</a> thousands of food items during the summer for use the following winter, and enabling the species to remain in boreal and subalpine forests year round. Any food intended for storage is manipulated in the mouth and formed into a <a href="bolus%20%28digestion%29">bolus</a> that is coated with sticky saliva, adhering to anything it touches. The bolus is stored in bark crevices, under tufts of <a href="lichen">lichen</a>, or among conifer <a href="pine%20needle">needles</a>. Cached items can be anything from carrion to bread crumbs. A single grey jay may hide thousands of pieces of food per year, to later recover them by memory, sometimes months after hiding them. Cached food is sometimes used to feed nestlings and fledglings.

When exploiting distant food sources found in clearings, grey jays were observed temporarily concentrating their caches in an arboreal site along the edge of a black spruce forest in interior Alaska. This allowed a high rate of caching in the short term and reduced the jay's risk of predation. A subsequent recaching stage occurred, and food items were transferred to widely scattered sites to reduce theft.

Caching is inhibited by the presence of <a href="Steller%27s%20jay">Steller's jay</a>s "(Cyanocitta stelleri)" and grey jays from adjacent territories, which follow resident grey jays to steal cached food. Grey jays carry large food items to distant cache sites for storage more often than small food items. To prevent theft, they also tend to carry valuable food items further from the source when caching in the company of one or more grey jays. Scatterhoarding discourages pilferage by competitors, while increased cache density leads to increased thievery. In southern portions of the grey jay's range, food is not cached during summer because of the chance of <a href="Decomposition">spoilage</a> and the reduced need for winter stores.

Several bird species prey on grey jays, including <a href="great%20grey%20owl">great grey owl</a>s ("Strix nebulosa"), <a href="northern%20hawk-owl">northern hawk-owl</a>s ("Surnia ulula"), and <a href="Mexican%20spotted%20owl">Mexican spotted owl</a>s ("Strix occidentalis lucida"). Grey jay remains have been recovered from the lairs of <a href="fisher%20%28animal%29">fisher</a> ("Martes pennanti") and <a href="American%20marten">American marten</a> ("Martes americana"). <a href="American%20red%20squirrel">Red squirrels</a> ("Tamiasciurus hudsonicus") eat grey jay eggs. Grey jays alert each other to threats by whistling alarm notes, screaming, chattering, or imitating and/or mobbing predators.

Found throughout Canada, the bird is popularly known by its once-official name, "Canada jay". Another well-known colloquial name is "whisky jack". This is a variation on the name of <a href="Wisakedjak">Wisakedjak</a>, a benevolent <a href="trickster">trickster</a> and cultural hero in <a href="Cree">Cree</a>, <a href="Algonquin%20people">Algonquin</a>, and <a href="Menominee">Menominee</a> <a href="Mythologies%20of%20the%20indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">mythologies</a>. Alternate spellings for this name include "wesakechak", "wiskedjak", "whiskachon", and "wisakadjak". The <a href="Tlingit">Tlingit</a> people of northwestern North America know it as "kooyéix" or "taatl'eeshdéi", "camp robber". According to the <a href="Mi%27kmaq">Mi'kmaq</a> of Nova Scotia, each of the seven stars of the <a href="Big%20Dipper">Big Dipper</a> depicted a different bird; the star <a href="Eta%20Ursae%20Majoris">Eta Ursae Majoris</a> in the night sky was a grey jay, "Mikjaqoqwej".

The grey jay readily capitalizes on novel food sources, including taking advantage of man-made sources of food. To the frustration of <a href="animal%20trapping">trappers</a> using baits to catch fur-bearing animals or early travelers trying to protect their winter food supplies, and to the delight of <a href="camping">campers</a>, bold grey jays are known to approach humans for treats and to steal from unattended food stores. Grey jays do not change their feeding behavior if watched by people; if they are able to link humans with food, they will not forget. A nesting female that had become accustomed to being fed by humans was reportedly able to be enticed to leave the nest during incubation and brooding. This behaviour has inspired a number of nicknames for the grey jay, including "lumberjack", "meat-bird", "venison-hawk", "moose-bird", and "gorby", the last two popular in Maine in the northeastern United States. The origin of "gorby", also spelt "gorbey", is unclear but possibly derived from "gorb", which in <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic">Scottish Gaelic</a> or <a href="Irish%20language">Irish</a> means "glutton" or "greedy (animal)" or in <a href="Scots%20language">Scots</a> or <a href="English%20language%20in%20northern%20England">northern English</a> "fledgling bird".

Superstition in the northeast (Maine and New Brunswick) relates how woodsmen would not harm gorbeys as they believed that whatever they inflicted on the bird would be done to them. A folk tale circulated about a man who plucked a gorbey of its feathers and later woke up the next morning having lost all his hair. Although the story was widespread in the early to mid-20th century, it does not appear to have been extant in 1902.

In January 2015, <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Geographical%20Society">The Royal Canadian Geographical Society</a>'s magazine, "<a href="Canadian%20Geographic">Canadian Geographic</a>", announced a project to select a national bird for Canada, a designation which the country has never formally recognized. Dubbed the National Bird Project, the organization conducted an online poll inviting Canadians to vote for their favourite bird. The poll closed on 31 August 2016, and a panel of experts convened the following month to review the top five selections: the grey jay, <a href="common%20loon">common loon</a> ("Gavia immer"), <a href="snowy%20owl">snowy owl</a> ("Bubo scandiacus"), <a href="Canada%20goose">Canada goose</a> ("Branta canadensis") and <a href="black-capped%20chickadee">black-capped chickadee</a> ("Poecile atricapillus"). The project announced on 16 November 2016 that the grey jay was selected as the winner of the contest. Organizers hoped for the <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">Canadian government</a> to formally recognize the result as part of Canada's <a href="sesquicentennial">sesquicentennial</a> celebrations in 2017, however the <a href="Department%20of%20Canadian%20Heritage">Department of Canadian Heritage</a> responded that no new official symbol proposals were being considered at the time.

Grey jays are classified as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> (LC) according to the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>, having stable populations over a very large area of boreal and subalpine habitats only lightly occupied by humans. Significant human impacts may nevertheless occur through <a href="human%20impact%20on%20the%20environment">anthropogenic</a> <a href="climate%20warming">climate warming</a>. Grey jays at the northern edges of their range may benefit from the extension of spruce stands out onto formerly treeless <a href="tundra">tundra</a>. A study of a declining population at the southern end of the grey jay's range linked the decline in reproductive success to warmer temperatures in preceding autumns. Such warm temperatures may trigger spoilage of the perishable food items stored by grey jays upon which success of late winter nesting partly depends.

Ficus rubiginosa

Ficus rubiginosa, commonly known as the rusty fig or Port Jackson fig ("damun" in the <a href="Dharug%20language">Dharug language</a>), is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="flowering%20plant">flowering plant</a> <a href="native%20plant">native</a> to <a href="Eastern%20states%20of%20Australia">eastern Australia</a> in the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Ficus">Ficus</a>". Beginning as a seedling that grows on other plants (<a href="hemiepiphyte">hemiepiphyte</a>) or rocks (<a href="lithophyte">lithophyte</a>), "F. rubiginosa" matures into a tree high and nearly as wide with a yellow-brown <a href="buttress%20root">buttressed</a> trunk. The <a href="leaf">leaves</a> are oval and glossy green and measure from long and wide.

The <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s are small, round and yellow, and can <a href="ripening">ripen</a> and turn red at any time of year, peaking in spring and summer. Like all figs, the fruit is in the form of a <a href="syconium">syconium</a>, an inverted <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> with the flowers lining an internal cavity. "F. rubiginosa" is exclusively <a href="pollination">pollinated</a> by the <a href="fig%20wasp">fig wasp</a> species "<a href="Pleistodontes%20imperialis">Pleistodontes imperialis</a>", which may comprise four <a href="Species%20complex">cryptospecies</a>. The syconia are also home to another fourteen species of <a href="wasp">wasp</a>, some of which induce <a href="gall">gall</a>s while others parasitise the pollinator wasps, and at least two species of <a href="nematode">nematode</a>. Many species of bird, including <a href="pigeon">pigeon</a>s, <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s and various <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s, eat the fruit. Ranging along the Australian east coast from <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> to <a href="Bega%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bega</a> in southern <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> (including the <a href="Port%20Jackson">Port Jackson</a> area, leading to its alternative name), "F. rubiginosa" grows in <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> margins and rocky <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>s. It is used as a <a href="shade%20tree">shade tree</a> in parks and public spaces, and when potted is well-suited for use as an <a href="Houseplant">indoor plant</a> or in <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a>.

"Ficus rubiginosa" was <a href="Species%20description">described</a> by French botanist <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Louiche%20Desfontaines">René Louiche Desfontaines</a> in 1804, from a <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type specimen</a> whose locality is documented simply as "<a href="New%20Holland%20%28Australia%29">New Holland</a>". In searching for the type specimen, Australian botanist Dale Dixon found one from the herbarium of Desfontaines at Florence Herbarium and one from the herbarium of <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Pierre%20Ventenat">Étienne Pierre Ventenat</a> at Geneva. As Ventenat had used Desfontaines' name, Dixon selected the Florence specimen to be the type in 2001. The specific epithet "rubiginosa" related to the rusty coloration of the undersides of the leaves. Indeed, "rusty fig" is an alternate common name; others include "Illawarra fig" and "Port Jackson fig". It was known as "damun" (pron. "tam-mun") to the <a href="Eora">Eora</a> and <a href="Darug%20people">Darug</a> inhabitants of the <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> basin.

In 1806, German botanist <a href="Carl%20Ludwig%20Willdenow">Carl Ludwig Willdenow</a> gave it the <a href="botanical%20name">botanical name</a> "Ficus australis" in "<a href="Species%20Plantarum">Species Plantarum</a>", but this is a "<a href="nomen%20illegitimum">nomen illegitimum</a>" as the species already had a validly published name. Italian botanist <a href="Guglielmo%20Gasparrini">Guglielmo Gasparrini</a> broke up the <a href="genus">genus</a> "Ficus" in 1844, placing the species in the genus "Urostigma" as "U. rubiginosum". In 1862, Dutch botanist <a href="Friedrich%20Anton%20Wilhelm%20Miquel">Friedrich Anton Wilhelm Miquel</a> described "Urostigma leichhardtii" from material collected from <a href="Cape%20Cleveland%2C%20Queensland">Cape Cleveland, Queensland</a>, noting it had affinities to "F. rubiginosa". In 1867, he placed "Urostigma" as a <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> in the reunited "Ficus", which resulted in the <a href="taxon">taxon</a> becoming "Ficus leichhardtii". Miquel also described "Ficus leichhardtii" <a href="Variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a> "angustata" from <a href="Whitsunday%20Island">Whitsunday Island</a>, later classified as "F. shirleyana" by Czech botanist <a href="Karel%20Domin">Karel Domin</a>. Queensland state botanist <a href="Frederick%20Manson%20Bailey">Frederick Manson Bailey</a> described "Ficus macrophylla" variety "pubescens" in 1911 from Queensland, Domin later renaming it "Ficus baileyana". All these taxa were found to be indistinguishable from (and hence reclassified as) "F. rubiginosa" by Dixon in 2001.

In a study published in 2008, <a href="Nina%20R%C3%B8nsted">Nina Rønsted</a> and colleagues analysed the <a href="Nucleic%20acid%20sequence">DNA sequences</a> from the nuclear ribosomal <a href="Internal%20transcribed%20spacer">internal</a> and <a href="external%20transcribed%20spacer">external transcribed spacer</a>s, and the <a href="glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate%20dehydrogenase">glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase</a> region, in the first molecular analysis of the <a href="Section%20%28botany%29">section</a> "Malvanthera". They found "F. rubiginosa" to be most closely related to the <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> species "<a href="Ficus%20watkinsiana">F. watkinsiana</a>" and two rock-growing (<a href="lithophyte">lithophytic</a>) species of arid <a href="northern%20Australia">northern Australia</a> ("<a href="Ficus%20atricha">F. atricha</a>" and "<a href="Ficus%20brachypoda">F. brachypoda</a>"). They classified these species in a new series "Rubiginosae" in the subsection "Platypodeae". Relationships are unclear and it is uncertain into which direction the group <a href="Evolutionary%20radiation">radiated</a> (into rainforest or into arid Australia).

<a href="Joseph%20Maiden">Joseph Maiden</a> described variety "lucida" in 1902, and Bailey described variety "glabrescens" in 1913. Both had diagnosed their varieties on the basis of their hairlessness. Maiden described a taxon totally devoid of hair, while Bailey described his as nearly glabrous (hairless). As Bailey's description more closely matched Dixon's findings (that these variants were only partly and not completely hairless), Dixon retained Bailey's name and reclassified it as "Ficus rubiginosa" <a href="Form%20%28botany%29">forma</a> "glabrescens" in 2001 as it differed only in the lack of hairs on new growth from the <a href="Subspecies%23Nominotypical%20subspecies%20and%20subspecies%20autonyms">nominate</a> form.

A spreading, densely-shading tree when mature, "F. rubiginosa" may reach or more in height, although it rarely exceeds in the Sydney region. The trunk is <a href="buttress%20root">buttressed</a> and can reach in diameter. The bark is yellow-brown. It can also grow as on other plants as a <a href="hemiepiphyte">hemiepiphyte</a>, or high lithophyte. <a href="Phyllotaxis">Alternately arranged</a> on the stems, the <a href="Glossary%20of%20leaf%20morphology%23ovate">ovate</a> (egg-shaped), <a href="wikt%3Aobovate">obovate</a> (reverse egg-shaped) or oval-shaped leaves are anywhere from long and wide, on -long <a href="Petiole%20%28botany%29">petioles</a> (stalks that join the leaves to stems). They are smooth or bear tiny rusty hairs. There are 16 to 62 pairs of lateral <a href="Leaf%23Veins">veins</a> that run off the midvein at an angle of 41.5–84.0°, while distinct basal veins run off the midvein at an angle of 18.5–78.9°. As with all figs, the fruit (fig) is actually an inverted <a href="inflorescence">inflorescence</a> (compound flower) known as a <a href="syconium">syconium</a>, with tiny flowers arising from the fig's inner surface into a hollow cavity. "F. rubiginosa" is <a href="Plant%20reproductive%20morphology%23Terminology">monoecious</a>—both male and female flowers are found on the same plant, and in fact in the same fruit, although they mature at different times. Often growing in pairs, the figs are yellow initially and measure across. Ripening to red in colour, they are tipped with a small nipple and on a stalk. Fruits ripen throughout the year, although more so in spring and summer. Some trees have ripe and unripe fruit at the same time.

It closely resembles its relative, the Moreton Bay fig ("<a href="Ficus%20macrophylla">F. macrophylla</a>"). Having similar ranges in the wild, they are often confused. The smaller leaves, shorter fruit stalks, and rusty colour of the undersides of the leaves of "F. rubiginosa" are the easiest distinguishing features. It is also confused with the small-leaved fig ("<a href="Ficus%20obliqua">F. obliqua</a>"), the syconia of which are smaller, measuring 4–12 mm long and 4–11 mm in diameter, compared with 7–17 mm long and 8–17 mm diameter for "F. rubiginosa".

"Ficus rubiginosa"s range spans the entire eastern coastline of Australia, from the top of the <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> in north Queensland to the vicinity of <a href="Bega%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Bega</a> on the south coast of New South Wales. The range extends westwards to <a href="Porcupine%20Gorge%20National%20Park">Porcupine Gorge National Park</a> in Queensland and the far western plains in New South Wales. "F. rubiginosa" f. "rubiginosa" and "F. rubiginosa" f. "glabrescens" are found over most of the range, though the latter does not occur south past the New South Wales-Queensland border region. Lithophytic, hemiepiphytic and tree forms can be found together in local populations of plants.

"F. rubiginosa" is found in rainforest, rainforest margins, gullies, riverbank habitat, vine thickets, and rocky hillsides. It is found on <a href="limestone">limestone</a> <a href="outcrop">outcrop</a>s in <a href="Kanangra-Boyd%20National%20Park">Kanangra-Boyd National Park</a>. Fig seedlings often grow from cracks in stone where seeds have been lodged, in locations such as cliffs and rock faces in natural environments, or in brickwork on buildings and elsewhere in the urban environment. The soils it grows on are often well-drained and low in nutrients. They are derived from <a href="sandstone">sandstone</a>, <a href="quartzite">quartzite</a> and <a href="basalt">basalt</a>. In the Sydney region, "F. rubiginosa" grows from sea level to 1000 m (3500 ft) altitude, in areas with an average yearly rainfall of . "F. rubiginosa" is largely <a href="Sympatry">sympatric</a> with "F. obliqua", though its range extends further west into dryer regions than the latter species.

Outside its native range, "F. rubiginosa" has <a href="Introduced%20species">naturalised</a> to some degree in urban <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> and <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> in Australia, as well as <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a> and <a href="California">California</a>, and <a href="Southern%20Europe">Mediterranean Europe</a>. "F. rubiginosa" has been planted widely in <a href="Malta">Malta</a> since the early 1990s but has not been observed to fruit.

The fruit is consumed by many bird species including the <a href="rose-crowned%20fruit-dove">rose-crowned fruit-dove</a> ("Ptilinopus regina"), <a href="wompoo%20fruit-dove">wompoo fruit-dove</a> ("P. magnificus"), <a href="wonga%20pigeon">wonga pigeon</a> ("Leucosarcia melanoleuca"), <a href="topknot%20pigeon">topknot pigeon</a> ("Lopholaimus antarcticus"), <a href="Pacific%20koel">Pacific koel</a> ("Eudynamys orientalis"), <a href="Australasian%20swamphen">Australasian swamphen</a> ("Porphyrio melanotus"), <a href="Australian%20king%20parrot">Australian king parrot</a> ("Alisterus scapularis"), <a href="Australasian%20figbird">Australasian figbird</a> ("Sphecotheres vieilloti"), <a href="green%20catbird">green catbird</a> ("Ailuroedus crassirostris"), <a href="regent%20bowerbird">regent bowerbird</a> ("Sericulus chrysocephalus"), <a href="satin%20bowerbird">satin bowerbird</a> ("Ptilonorhynchus violaceus") and <a href="pied%20currawong">pied currawong</a> ("Strepera graculina"), as well as the mammalian <a href="grey-headed%20flying%20fox">grey-headed flying fox</a> ("Pteropus poliocephalus"), and <a href="spectacled%20flying%20fox">spectacled flying fox</a> ("Pteropus conspicillatus"). It is one of several plant species used as food by the endangered <a href="Coxen%27s%20fig%20parrot">Coxen's fig parrot</a>. Many fruits drop onto the ground around the tree, though others are dispersed by animals that eat them.

The <a href="thrips">thrips</a> species "<a href="Gynaikothrips%20australis">Gynaikothrips australis</a>" feeds on the underside of new leaves of "F. rubiginosa", as well as "F. obliqua" and "F. macrophylla". As <a href="plant%20cell">plant cell</a>s die, nearby cells are induced into forming <a href="meristem">meristem</a> tissue and a <a href="gall">gall</a> results, and the leaves become distorted and curl over. The thrips begin feeding when the tree has flushes of new growth, and live for around six weeks. At other times, thrips reside on old leaves without feeding. The species <a href="pupa">pupa</a>tes sheltered in the bark. The thrips remain in the galls at night, wander about in the daytime and return in the evening, possibly to different galls about the tree. <a href="Jumping%20plant%20louse">Psyllids</a> have almost defoliated trees in the <a href="Royal%20Botanic%20Gardens%2C%20Sydney">Royal Botanic Gardens</a> in Sydney in spring.

"F. rubiginosa" is exclusively <a href="pollination">pollinated</a> in a <a href="symbiosis">symbiotic</a> relationship with "<a href="Pleistodontes%20imperialis">Pleistodontes imperialis</a>", a species of <a href="fig%20wasp">fig wasp</a>. Biologist Eleanor Haine and colleagues analysed the DNA of the wasp across the fig's range and determined four cryptic lineages forming what they term the "P. imperialis" <a href="species%20complex">species complex</a>. They <a href="genetic%20divergence">diverge</a> to a greater degree than some distinct wasp species, yet form a <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> group; this indicates that the wasp lineages have split without a change of host.

Fertilised female wasps enter the receptive 'fig' (the syconium) through a tiny hole at the crown (the <a href="ostiole">ostiole</a>). They crawl around the inflorescenced interior of the fig, pollinating some of the female flowers, before laying eggs inside some of the flowers and dying. After several weeks' development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before the females. They chew holes in the galls containing females and fertilise them through the hole they have just chewed. Males return later to mated females, and enlarge the mating holes to enable the females to emerge. Some males then chew their way through the syconium wall, which allows the females to disperse after collecting pollen from the now fully developed male flowers. Females then have a short time (< 48 hours) to find a tree with receptive syconia to successfully reproduce and disperse pollen.

A field study in Brisbane found that "F. rubiginosa" trees often bore both male and female phase syconia at the same time, which could be beneficial for reproduction in isolated populations. The same study found that male phase syconia development persisted through the winter, showing that its wasp pollinator tolerated cooler weather than those of more tropical fig species. "F. rubiginosa" itself can endure cooler climates than other members of the genus.

"P. imperialis" crossed the waters between Australia and New Zealand some time between 1960 and 1972, and seedlings of the previously infertile trees of "F. rubiginosa" began appearing in brick and stone walls, and on other trees, particularly in parks and gardens around <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>. They have been recorded as far south as <a href="Napier%2C%20New%20Zealand">Napier</a>. "P. imperialis" has been transported to Hawaii, California and <a href="Israel">Israel</a>, where it has been observed to pollinate its host.

They can live to 100 years or more and have been known to resprout after <a href="Bushfires%20in%20Australia">bushfire</a>, bearing fruit within three years.

As with many other "Ficus" species, the community of wasps inside the figs of "F. rubiginosa" is made up mostly of pollinator wasps. These develop deep inside the syconium, presumably protected there from parasites. Also present are much smaller numbers of other wasp species, which do not pollinate the fig. At least fourteen species have been recorded, of which four—two each belonging to the genera "<a href="Sycoscapter">Sycoscapter</a>" and "<a href="Philotrypesis">Philotrypesis</a>"—are common while others are rare. Investigation of "F. rubiginosa" syconia found that the fig seeds and parasitic wasps develop closer to the wall of the syconium. The wasps of the genera "Sycoscapter" and "Philotrypesis" are parasitic and are around the same size as the pollinator species. Their larvae are thought to feed on the larvae of the pollinator wasp. Male "Sycoscapter" and "Philotrypesis" wasps fight other males of the same species when they encounter each other in a "F. rubiginosa" fig. Several genera of uncommon larger wasp species enter the immature figs before other wasps and induce galls, which may impact on numbers of pollinator wasps in the fig later. An example of this is "<a href="Pseudidarnes%20minerva">Pseudidarnes minerva</a>", a metallic green wasp species.

<a href="Nematode">Nematode</a>s of the genus "<a href="Schistonchus">Schistonchus</a>" are found in the syconia (and the pollinator wasps) of many species of fig, with "F. rubiginosa" hosting two species. They appear to be less species-specific than wasps. "S. altermacrophylla" is generally associated with "F. rubiginosa" though it has been recorded on several other fig species.

"Ficus rubiginosa" was first cultivated in the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> in 1789, where it is grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large <a href="ornamental%20plant">ornamental tree</a> in eastern Australia, in the <a href="North%20Island">North Island</a> of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a> in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, "F. rubiginosa" is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of <a href="Soil%20pH">acid or alkaline</a> soils, it is hardy to <a href="Hardiness%20zone%23USDA%20hardiness%20zones">US Hardiness Zones</a> 10B and 11, reaching 10 m (35 ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12 m (30–40 ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.

In a brief description, <a href="William%20Guilfoyle">William Guilfoyle</a> recorded a variegated fig from New South Wales "12–15 ft high" in 1911 as "F. rubiginosa" variety "variegata". A variegated form is in cultivation on Australia's east coast, and in the United States. It is a <a href="Chimera%20%28genetics%29">chimera</a> lacking in chlorophyll in the second layer of the leaf meristem. The leaves have an irregular central green patch along the midvein with irregular yellow and green elsewhere. Leaves that grow in winter generally have larger green patches than those that do in summer. The chimera is unstable, and branches of all-green growth appear sporadically.

Despite the relatively large size of the leaves, it is popular for <a href="bonsai">bonsai</a> work as it is highly forgiving to work with and hard to kill; the leaves reduce readily by leaf-pruning in early summer. Described as the best tree for a beginner to work with, it is one of the most frequently used native species in Australia. Its bark remains smooth, and does not attain a rugged, aged appearance. Known as "Little Ruby", a narrow-leaved form with its origins somewhere north of Sydney is also seen in cultivation.

"F. rubiginosa" is also suited for use as a <a href="houseplant">houseplant</a> in low, medium or brightly-lit spaces, although a variegated form requires brighter light. It has gained the <a href="Royal%20Horticultural%20Society">Royal Horticultural Society</a>'s <a href="Award%20of%20Garden%20Merit">Award of Garden Merit</a>. It is easily <a href="plant%20propagation">propagated</a> by <a href="Cutting%20%28plant%29">cuttings</a> or <a href="Vegetative%20reproduction">aerial layering</a>.

The light-coloured <a href="wood">wood</a> is soft and brittle. Lightweight, it has some value in the making of such items as toys and small boxes.

Francis Willughby

Francis Willughby (sometimes spelt Willoughby) <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">FRS</a> (22 November 1635 – 3 July 1672) was an English <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> and <a href="ichthyology">ichthyologist</a>, and an early student of <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a> and <a href="game%20studies">games</a>. He was born and raised at <a href="Middleton%20Hall%2C%20Warwickshire">Middleton Hall, Warwickshire</a>, the only son of an affluent country family. He was a student at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>, where he was tutored by the mathematician and naturalist <a href="John%20Ray">John Ray</a>, who became a lifetime friend and colleague, and lived with Willughby after 1662 when he lost his livelihood through his refusal to sign the <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201662">Act of Uniformity</a>. Willughby was elected as a <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Fellow of the Royal Society</a> in 1661, then aged 27.

Willughby, Ray, and others such as <a href="John%20Wilkins">John Wilkins</a> were advocates of a new way of studying science, relying on observation and classification, rather than the received authority of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and the Bible. To this end, Willughby, Ray and their friends undertook a number of journeys to gather information and specimens, initially in England and Wales, but culminating in an extensive tour of continental Europe, visiting museums, libraries and private collections as well as studying local animals and plants. After their continental tour, he and Ray lived and worked mainly at Middleton Hall. Willughby married Emma Barnard in 1668 and the couple had three children.

Willughby had suffered bouts of illness over the years, and eventually died of <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a> in July 1672, aged 36. His premature death meant that it fell to Ray to complete the works on animals they had jointly planned. In due course, Ray published books on birds, fish and <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, the "Ornithologiae Libri Tres", "Historia Piscium" and "Historia Insectorum". The "Ornithology" was also published in an expanded form in English. The books included innovative and effective ways of classifying animals, and all three were influential in the history of <a href="List%20of%20life%20sciences">life science</a>, including their effect on subsequent <a href="natural%20history">natural history</a> writers and their importance in the development of <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus's</a> <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a>.

Francis Willughby was born at <a href="Middleton%20Hall%2C%20Warwickshire">Middleton Hall</a>, <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a> on 22 November 1635, the only son of Sir Francis Willoughby and his wife Cassandra (<a href="Given%20name%23Name%20at%20birth">née</a> Ridgway). The family were affluent gentry, whose main seat was <a href="Wollaton%20Hall">Wollaton Hall</a>, now in <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>. The younger Francis studied at <a href="Bishop%20Vesey%27s%20Grammar%20School">Bishop Vesey's Grammar School</a>, <a href="Sutton%20Coldfield">Sutton Coldfield</a> and <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>. He appears to have read widely, his library at his death containing an estimated 2,000 books, including literary, historical and <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> works as well as <a href="natural%20science">natural science</a> volumes.

Willughby commenced his studies at Trinity aged 17 as a <a href="Commoner%20%28academia%29">Fellow-commoner</a>. His tutor was <a href="James%20Duport">James Duport</a>, who shared the Willughbys' royalist sympathies in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>. <a href="John%20Ray">John Ray</a>, then a mathematics fellow at Trinity, arranged for his student <a href="Isaac%20Barrow">Isaac Barrow</a> to teach Willughby that subject. The two became friends, and in 1665 Barrow dedicated his "<a href="Euclid%27s%20Elements">Euclid's Elements</a>" to Willughby and two other wealthy fellow pupils.

Although affluent students often left university without a degree, Willughby completed his BA in January 1656 and his MA in July 1660. He also joined <a href="Gray%27s%20Inn">Gray's Inn</a> in 1657, not an unusual step for a man of property who might have to deal with legal disputes. Willughby and Ray had collaborated at Trinity on several "chymistry" projects, including making "<a href="Lead%28II%29%20acetate">sugar of lead</a>" and extracting <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, and in 1661 Willughby, then aged 27, was elected a founder <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Fellow of the Royal Society</a> on the nominations of Ray and <a href="John%20Wilkins">John Wilkins</a>, who became Master of Trinity College in 1660, and eventually <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chester">Bishop of Chester</a>. In 1667 Ray was also elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society, but was excused the subscription because of his relative poverty.

In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, <a href="Francis%20Bacon">Francis Bacon</a> had advocated the advancement of knowledge through observation and experiment, rather than relying on the authority of <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a> and the church. The <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a> and its members such as Ray, Wilkins and Willughby sought to put the <a href="Empirical%20research">empirical method</a> into practice, including travelling to collect specimens and information. Willughby helped Ray in collecting plants for his botanical work "Catalogus Plantarum circa Cantabrigiam Nascentium" (the "Cambridge Catalogue"), which was published anonymously in February 1660.

Later that year, Ray and Willughby journeyed through northern England to the <a href="Lake%20District">Lake District</a>, the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> and the <a href="Calf%20of%20Man">Calf of Man</a>, seeing a <a href="Manx%20shearwater">Manx shearwater</a> chick at the last site. Willughby then briefly visited the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> to consult some rare natural history books.

In May 1662, Willughby, Ray and <a href="Philip%20Skippon%20%281641%E2%80%931691%29">Philip Skippon</a>, Ray's student, set out on a second journey through <a href="Nantwich">Nantwich</a> and <a href="Chester">Chester</a> and west to <a href="Anglesey">Anglesey</a>. They returned inland to <a href="Llanberis">Llanberis</a> and were shown a local lake fish called a "torgoch", which Willughby recognised as essentially the same as the <a href="Salvelinus%20willughbii">Windermere charr</a> he had described previously in the Lake District. The party then headed south through west <a href="Wales">Wales</a> to <a href="Pembroke%2C%20Pembrokeshire">Pembroke</a>, visiting <a href="Bardsey%20Island">Bardsey Island</a> on the way. They then proceeded back along the Welsh south coast to <a href="Tenby">Tenby</a>, where they saw many fish species, and <a href="Aberavon">Aberavon</a>, where they were shown a rare <a href="black-winged%20stilt">black-winged stilt</a>.

Willughby interviewed <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> speakers to attempt a systematic study of the language that, although never published, influenced subsequent scholars. It was during this trip that Ray and Willughby decided to attempt to classify all living things, with Ray mainly working on plants and Willughby on animals. The tables of species they produced were used by Wilkins as part of a unifying scheme later published in 1668 as "<a href="An%20Essay%20towards%20a%20Real%20Character%2C%20and%20a%20Philosophical%20Language">An Essay towards a Real Character, and a Philosophical Language</a>". Wilkins' intention was to create a universal terminology to describe the natural world, and the study of languages and writing systems was meant to create a logical linguistic framework for his classification.

Willughby and his companions parted company when he fell ill at <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> while they continued through the <a href="West%20Country">West Country</a> to <a href="Land%27s%20End">Land's End</a>. When Willughby had recovered, he spent part of the summer <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. Ray and Willughby later visited the West Country together in 1667, returning via <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>, <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> and London.

In August 1662 Ray resigned his Fellowship at Cambridge, being unwilling to subscribe to the requirements of the <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201662">Act of Uniformity</a> imposed on <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> clerics. Unemployed and without a source of income, his position might have been difficult, but Willughby offered him accommodation and work at Middleton, writing "I am likely to spend much of my life afterwards in wandring or else in Private Studiing at Oxford. having but little heart to thinke of settling, or ingaging in a family. I shall bee Verie glad of your constant company and assistance in my studies".

In April 1663, Willughby, Ray, Skippon and <a href="Nathaniel%20Bacon%20%28Virginia%20colonist%20and%20rebel%29">Nathaniel Bacon</a> (another friend from Trinity) departed for continental Europe on a pre-planned itinerary armed with the requisite passports and <a href="Letter%20of%20introduction">letters of introduction</a> to notable personages, with Willughby's wealth making the trip financially viable. They intended to visit museums, libraries and private collections, and also study local animals and plants. Given the limitations of time on their demanding schedule, fish and bird markets were a useful source of information and specimens. Although all kept journals, most of Willughby's are lost, and the journey is mainly documented in Ray's "Observations topographical, moral & physiological made in a journey through part of the Low-Countries, Germany, Italy and France", which included Willughby's notes from Spain.

The travellers visited <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, the <a href="Old%20University%20of%20Leuven">University of Leuven</a>, <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, <a href="Delft">Delft</a>, <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> and <a href="Leiden%20University">Leiden's university</a> and public library. On 5 June they visited a colony of <a href="great%20cormorant">cormorants</a>, <a href="grey%20heron">grey heron</a>s and <a href="Eurasian%20spoonbill">spoonbills</a> at <a href="Zevenhuizen%2C%20Kaag%20en%20Braassem">Zevenhuizen</a>, and Willughby dissected a spoonbill chick obtained there. The party continued north through <a href="Haarlem">Haarlem</a>, <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> and <a href="Utrecht">Utrecht</a> before heading to <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>, where Willughby made a diversion to buy a handwritten book from its author, <a href="Leonhard%20Baldner">Leonard Baldner</a>. This book was illustrated with paintings of birds, fish and other animals. 

Baldner was a prosperous former fisherman, town councillor and self-taught naturalist who, like the Englishmen, only wrote about what he saw. <a href="Frederick%20Slare">Frederick Slare</a> FRS made a translation of the German text into English, later added to Willughby's copy after his death. Ray claimed in his preface to the "Ornithology": "For my part, I must needs acknowledge that I have received much light and information from the Work of this poor man, and have been thereby inabled to clear many difficulties, and rectifie some mistakes in Gesner.", although in practice few of Baldner's insights were incorporated into the text.
The party continued through <a href="Li%C3%A8ge">Liège</a>, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a> and <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>, and arrived in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> on 15 September where they stayed for several days before leaving on 24 September for Venice. The journey through the <a href="Alps">Alps</a> was arduous, with poor mountain tracks, bad weather and little food except bread, and it was 6 October before they reached their destination, where Skippon listed 60 species of fish and 28 kinds of birds he had noted in the Venetian markets.

The group remained in Venice from 6 October 1663 to 1 February 1664, apart from a trip to <a href="Padua">Padua</a>, where they investigated medical procedures including the <a href="dissection">dissection</a> of human corpses. They then travelled through northern Italy, stopping in <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a>, <a href="Verona">Verona</a>, <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a>, <a href="Milan">Milan</a> and <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, before setting sail for <a href="Naples">Naples</a> from <a href="Livorno">Livorno</a> on 15 April 1664. It was here that the party divided, Willughby and Bacon heading to Rome, where they spent May, June and July, while Ray and Skippon went on to <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and <a href="Malta">Malta</a>.

Throughout the continental journey, Willughby and Skippon in particular had continued their research into languages. In Vienna, apart from visiting the local collections, they had taken the opportunity to study <a href="Turkish%20language">Turkish</a> and several <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic languages</a>, and surviving manuscripts show comparison tables for seventeen languages including <a href="Basque%20language">Basque</a>, <a href="Armenian%20language">Armenian</a> and <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a>.

Bacon contracted <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> somewhere in Northern Italy, and Willughby continued with just a servant to <a href="Montpellier">Montpellier</a>, where Ray was already present. Willughby entered Spain on 31 August and progressed through <a href="Valencia">Valencia</a>, <a href="Granada">Granada</a>, <a href="Seville">Seville</a>, <a href="C%C3%B3rdoba%2C%20Spain">Cordoba</a> and <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, reaching <a href="Irun">Irun</a> on 14 November. Willughby found little of scientific interest in Spain, which he considered backward. He also disliked the land and the people: "almost desolate... tyrannical inquisition... multitude of whores... wretched laziness... very like the Welsh and Irish."

In Seville, Willughby had received a letter saying that his father was seriously ill, so he had hastened his return to Middleton where he arrived shortly before Christmas 1664. His father died in December 1665 and Francis then became responsible for the estate. Willughby was soon being urged by his relatives to find a wife, but procrastinated knowing that this would restrict his researches.

In 1661 he had sent the Royal Society the first paper to describe the <a href="Insect%23Reproduction%20and%20development">life cycle of insects</a>, and he and Ray also verified the <a href="parasitoid">parasitoid</a>ism of caterpillars by <a href="Ichneumonidae">ichneumon wasps</a>. Willughby also bred and studied <a href="Megachile">leaf-cutter bees</a>, his chosen research species later being named after him as Willughby's leaf-cutter bee, "<a href="Megachile%20willughbiella">Megachile willughbiella</a>". Willughby was the first person to unambiguously distinguish the <a href="European%20honey%20buzzard">honey buzzard</a> from the <a href="common%20buzzard">common buzzard</a>, and in 2018 it was suggested that the former species should be renamed "Willughby's Buzzard" to commemorate this.

In 1668 Willughby married Emma Barnard, daughter of Sir Henry Barnard of <a href="Bridgnorth">Bridgnorth</a> and London. They had three children. Their first child, Francis, died at the age of nineteen, while their daughter <a href="Cassandra%20Willoughby%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Chandos">Cassandra Willoughby</a> married the <a href="James%20Brydges%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Chandos">Duke of Chandos</a>, who was a patron of the English <a href="natural%20history">naturalist</a> <a href="Mark%20Catesby">Mark Catesby</a>. The second son, <a href="Thomas%20Willoughby%2C%201st%20Baron%20Middleton">Thomas</a>, was created Baron Middleton in 1711 by <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>.

Willughby and Ray continued their researches, now mainly on birds, with the help of Francis Jessop, another Trinity alumnus, who sent them specimens from the <a href="Peak%20District">Peak District</a>, including <a href="twite">twite</a> and <a href="red%20grouse">red grouse</a>. They also were the first to investigate the active flow of <a href="sap">sap</a> in <a href="Betula%20pubescens">birches</a>.

Willughby had suffered several periods of illness, including violent fevers, between 1668 and 1671, described by Ray as "tertian ague" (<a href="malaria">malaria</a>), and the additional physical and financial demands occasioned by having to defend a bitterly disputed inheritance put him under more strain. On 3 June 1672 he became seriously ill again, and signed his will on 24 June, disbarring any Catholic descendants from inheriting. He died on 3 July. The immediate cause of death was <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a>, probably related to <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. He was buried at <a href="St.%20John%20the%20Baptist%20Church%2C%20Middleton">St. John the Baptist parish church</a>, <a href="Middleton%2C%20Warwickshire">Middleton</a>, with Ray, Skippon and Jessop present with the family at the interment. The church contains a large memorial commemorating Francis, his parents, Francis senior and Cassandra, and his son, also Francis; this was erected by his second son, Thomas.

As well as being a friend, John Ray was one of five <a href="executor">executor</a>s of Willughby's will, in which he was left the sum of £60 a year for life. He saw it as his duty to complete and publish his colleague's work on animals.

Willughby's "Ornithology" was intended to describe all the then-known birds worldwide. Its innovative features were an effective <a href="classification">classification</a> system based on <a href="anatomy">anatomical</a> features, such the bird's beak, feet and overall size, and a <a href="single-access%20key">dichotomous key</a>, which helped readers to identify birds by guiding them to the page describing that group. The authors also placed an asterisk against species of which they had no first-hand knowledge, and were therefore unable to verify. Willughby had been keen to add details of "characteristic marks" to help with identification. The authors also largely avoided the practice of previous writers, such as the German naturalist <a href="Conrad%20Gessner">Conrad Gessner</a>, by not including extraneous material relating to the species, such as proverbs, references in history and literature, or use as an <a href="emblem">emblem</a>. The book was published in <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as "Ornithologiae Libri Tres" ("Three Books of Ornithology") in 1676.

The first of the three sections included an introduction to bird biology, an explanation of the new classification system and the dichotomous key. The second and third sections described land birds and <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s respectively. Emma Willughby paid for the 80 <a href="printmaking%23engraving">metal-engraved</a> plates that completed the work, and this is acknowledged on the title page. The English-language version, "The Ornithology of Francis Willughby of Middleton", published in 1678, included additional material, including a section on <a href="fowling">fowling</a> to broaden its appeal, but had no mention of Willughby's widow. Its commercial success is unknown, but its influence was profound.

The next book, on fish, was many years in the making; Willughby's widow had remarried, and her new husband, <a href="Josiah%20Child">Josiah Child</a>, had barred Ray from accessing his friend's papers. Furthermore, there were far more known species of fish than there were birds to describe, and Ray was working on his own "History of Plants". The "Historia Piscium" was finally published in Latin in 1686 with a dedication to <a href="Samuel%20Pepys">Samuel Pepys</a>, President of the Royal Society, who had made a generous financial contribution to the project. The book had four sections: an introduction to fish biology; <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns; <a href="Chondrichthyes">cartilaginous fish</a> (sharks and <a href="Batoidea">rays</a>); and <a href="Osteichthyes">bony fish</a>, the last group being further classified by the number and nature of their fins. 187 plates completed the work, their cost making the book a financial disaster for the Royal Society, which had largely funded its publication.

In the seventeenth century, the term "insect" had a much wider meaning than it does today, so the third major book, "Historia Insectorum", included many other <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, such as worms, spiders and <a href="millipede">millipede</a>s. It excluded <a href="Mollusca">molluscs</a>, perhaps because <a href="Martin%20Lister">Martin Lister</a>, another Fellow of the Royal Society, was writing his own "Historia Animalium" that covered that group. Ray's problems with completing this publication were much the same as with the fish book, although in 1704 he was able to see manuscripts prepared independently by Sir Thomas Willoughby and the scholar Thomas Man, Sir Thomas having moved into Wollaton Hall in 1687 and regained access to Middleton and his father's papers and possessions.

Ray died in January 1705, and little happened with the "Historia Insectorum" until <a href="William%20Derham">William Derham</a> and the Royal Society finally published it in 1710 in Latin, incomplete, unillustrated and under Ray's name only. Ray, however, makes it clear that Willughby did the bulk of the insect research, including, for example, 20 pages of beetle descriptions. The book had four sections, starting with an innovative <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">classification system</a> based on <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a>. The second section contained the main species descriptions, followed by Ray's observations of <a href="lepidoptera">butterflies and moths</a> and their caterpillars, and an appendix by Martin Lister on British beetles. Plates prepared by Sir Thomas Willoughby were not used, and they have now been lost, as have the manuscripts Sir Thomas showed to Ray.

Willughby's "<a href="Francis%20Willughby%27s%20Book%20of%20Games">Book of Games</a>" was unfinished at his death, but was published with accompanying interpretative material in 2003. He gave details of dozens of games and sports, including cards, <a href="cockfight">cockfighting</a>, football and word games; some are now unfamiliar, such as "Lend me your Skimmer". For each entry he included the rules, equipment and manner of play. He also studied the first games that babies and children play, and wrote a more mathematical section "On the rebounding of tennis balls". As with his biological works, the "Book of Games" is organised on the empirical principles of observation, description and <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">classification</a>.

A lost work appears to have been one that, according to his daughter Cassandra, "shews the chances of most games", which may have been titled "The Book of Dice" (""Historii Chartitudii""). Willughby was a competent mathematician, and there is evidence that the lost text considered <a href="probability">probability</a> with regard to card and dice games.

The numerous plates illustrating the species in the bird and fish books came from a number of sources. Willughby's own extensive collection included paintings he had bought on his European travels, and he also borrowed pictures owned by friends like Skippon and Sir <a href="Thomas%20Browne">Thomas Browne</a>. Many illustrations were taken from previous publications by other writers, and some were based on <a href="Francis%20Barlow%20%28artist%29">Francis Barlow's</a> oil-paintings of birds in <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II's</a> <a href="aviary">aviary</a> in <a href="St%20James%27s%20Park">St James's Park</a>.

The illustrations taken from earlier books were from many sources, particularly the earlier natural histories or ornithologies by <a href="Ulisse%20Aldrovandi">Ulisse Aldrovandi</a>, <a href="Giovanni%20Pietro%20Olina">Pietro Olina</a>, <a href="Georg%20Marcgrave">Georg Marcgrave</a> and <a href="Willem%20Piso">Willem Piso</a>. Where feasible, Willughby and Ray compared the available illustrations with life or specimens, or, if that were not possible, against each other, to select the most accurate version for publication. In addition to these authors, sources used for the text included works by <a href="Carolus%20Clusius">Carolus Clusius</a>, <a href="Adriaen%20Collaert">Adriaen Collaert</a>, <a href="Gervase%20Markham">Gervase Markham</a>, <a href="Juan%20Eusebio%20Nieremberg">Juan Eusebio Nieremberg</a> and <a href="Ole%20Worm">Ole Worm</a>. Olina's "Ucelliera", at least, seems to have been revisited between the Latin and English editions of the "Ornithology", since the later version contains a description of <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a> behaviour by the <a href="common%20nightingale">nightingale</a> absent from the earlier work.

Much of Willughby's written work has been lost, along with his scientific equipment and most of his collections of items of natural history interest; what remains is largely owned by the family and housed in the University of Nottingham Middleton archive. The "Ornithology" influenced <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Antoine%20Ferchault%20de%20R%C3%A9aumur">Réamur</a> in organising his great bird collection, and <a href="Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson">Brisson</a> in the compilation of his own work on the topic. <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> commented on the influence of the "Historia Piscium", and <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> from 1735 onwards relied heavily on Willughby and Ray's books in his "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", the basis of <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a>.

The lack of physical evidence, together with Willughby's early death and the publication of his books by Ray, means that the relative contributions of the two men has subsequently been disputed. Willughby's work was initially well-regarded, but Ray's reputation grew as time passed, and, in 1788, the English botanist <a href="James%20Edward%20Smith">James Edward Smith</a> wrote that Willughby's contribution had been overstated by his friend, who gave himself too little credit. The opposite view was given by <a href="William%20John%20Swainson">William Swainson</a>, who felt that Ray's fame rested entirely on that of his patron, and he lacked the genius to have achieved anything on his own.
The pendulum swung again when <a href="Charles%20E.%20Raven">Charles E. Raven</a> wrote his 1942 biography of Ray, seeing him as the senior partner and saying that Willughby had "less knowledge, patience and judgment" than Ray, whom he considered a scientist of genius, and whose contributions he tended to compare favourably with the achievements of most other writers. Raven was unaware of the Willughby family archive at the University of Nottingham when he wrote his book, and access to that and other new material have led to modern appraisals giving a more balanced picture, with the two men seen to have made significant individual contributions, each demonstrating his own strengths.

Willughby and Ray discovered several previously undescribed species of birds, fish and invertebrates. The names of the Windermere charr ("Salvelinus willughbii"), Willughby's leaf-cutter bee ("Megachile willughbiella") and the tropical plant <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Willughbeia">Willughbeia</a>" all commemorate the younger man. However, Willughby and Ray's main influence was through their three books, especially the "Ornithology", with their emphasis on systematic description and classification. Even Willughby's own collection of 170 plates and nature paintings seems to be intended not just to provide individual illustrations, but to be an integral part of a collection intended to reinforce the order of nature.

Pancreatic cancer

Pancreatic cancer arises when <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a> in the <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a>, a glandular organ behind the <a href="stomach">stomach</a>, begin to multiply out of control and form a <a href="Neoplasm">mass</a>. These <a href="cancer">cancer</a>ous cells have the <a href="malignant">ability to invade</a> other parts of the body. There are a number of types of pancreatic cancer. The most common, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, accounts for about 85% of cases, and the term "pancreatic cancer" is sometimes used to refer only to that type. These <a href="adenocarcinoma">adenocarcinoma</a>s start within the part of the pancreas which makes <a href="digestive%20enzyme">digestive enzyme</a>s. Several other types of cancer, which collectively represent the majority of the non-adenocarcinomas, can also arise from these cells. One to two percent of cases of pancreatic cancer are <a href="neuroendocrine%20tumor">neuroendocrine tumor</a>s, which arise from the hormone-producing <a href="neuroendocrine%20cell">cell</a>s of the pancreas. These are generally less aggressive than pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Signs and symptoms of the most common form of pancreatic cancer may include <a href="jaundice">yellow skin</a>, <a href="abdominal%20pain">abdominal</a> or <a href="back%20pain">back pain</a>, <a href="cachexia">unexplained weight loss</a>, light-colored <a href="feces">stools</a>, dark urine and <a href="Anorexia%20%28symptom%29">loss of appetite</a>. There are usually no symptoms in the disease's early stages, and symptoms that are <a href="Pathognomonic">specific</a> enough to suggest pancreatic cancer typically do not develop until the disease has reached an advanced stage. By the time of diagnosis, pancreatic cancer has often <a href="metastasis">spread</a> to other parts of the body.
Pancreatic cancer rarely occurs before the age of 40, and more than half of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occur in those over 70. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include <a href="tobacco%20smoking">tobacco smoking</a>, <a href="obesity">obesity</a>, <a href="diabetes%20mellitus">diabetes</a>, and certain rare genetic conditions. About 25% of cases are linked to smoking, and 5–10% are linked to <a href="heredity">inherited genes</a>. Pancreatic cancer is usually diagnosed by a combination of <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a> techniques such as <a href="ultrasound">ultrasound</a> or <a href="X-ray%20computed%20tomography">computed tomography</a>, blood tests, and examination of tissue samples (<a href="biopsy">biopsy</a>). The disease is <a href="cancer%20staging">divided into stages</a>, from early (stage I) to late (stage IV). <a href="Cancer%20screening">Screening</a> the general population has not been found to be effective.
The risk of developing pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a healthy weight and limit their consumption of <a href="Red%20meat%23Cancer">red</a> or <a href="processed%20meat">processed meat</a>. A smoker's chance of developing the disease decreases if they stop smoking and almost returns to that of the rest of the population after 20 years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiotherapy</a>, <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>, <a href="palliative%20care">palliative care</a>, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve <a href="quality%20of%20life">quality of life</a> without the potential for cure. <a href="Pain%20management">Pain management</a> and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.
In 2015, pancreatic cancers of all types resulted in 411,600 deaths globally. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth most common cause of death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the fourth most common in the United States. The disease occurs most often in the developed world, where about 70% of the new cases in 2012 originated. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis: after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 5% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the <a href="five-year%20survival%20rate">five-year survival rate</a> rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival varies considerably depending on the type of tumor.

The many types of pancreatic cancer can be divided into two general groups. The vast majority of cases (about 95%) occur in the part of the pancreas which produces <a href="digestive%20enzymes">digestive enzymes</a>, known as the <a href="Exocrine%20component%20of%20pancreas">exocrine component</a>. There are several sub-types of exocrine pancreatic cancers, but their diagnosis and treatment have much in common. The small minority of cancers that arise in the <a href="hormone">hormone</a>-producing (<a href="endocrine">endocrine</a>) tissue of the pancreas have different clinical characteristics and are called <a href="pancreatic%20neuroendocrine%20tumor">pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor</a>s, sometimes abbreviated as "PanNETs". Both groups occur mainly (but not exclusively) in people over 40, and are slightly more common in men, but some rare sub-types mainly occur in women or children.

The exocrine group is dominated by pancreatic <a href="adenocarcinoma">adenocarcinoma</a> (variations of this name may add "invasive" and "ductal"), which is by far the most common type, representing about 85% of all pancreatic cancers. Nearly all these start in the ducts of the pancreas, as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This is despite the fact that the tissue from which it arises – the pancreatic ductal <a href="epithelium">epithelium</a> – represents less than 10% of the pancreas by cell volume, because it constitutes only the ducts (an extensive but capillary-like duct-system fanning out) within the pancreas. This cancer originates in the ducts that carry secretions (such as <a href="enzymes">enzymes</a> and <a href="bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a>) away from the pancreas. About 60–70% of adenocarcinomas occur in the <a href="Pancreas%23Structure">head of the pancreas</a>.

The next most common type, <a href="acinar%20cell%20carcinoma%20of%20the%20pancreas">acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas</a>, arises in the <a href="Acinus">clusters of cells</a> that produce these enzymes, and represents 5% of exocrine pancreas cancers. Like the 'functioning' endocrine cancers described below, acinar cell carcinomas may cause over-production of certain molecules, in this case digestive enzymes, which may cause symptoms such as skin rashes and joint pain.

<a href="Cystadenocarcinoma">Cystadenocarcinoma</a>s account for 1% of pancreatic cancers, and they have a better prognosis than the other exocrine types.

<a href="Pancreatoblastoma">Pancreatoblastoma</a> is a rare form, mostly occurring in childhood, and with a relatively good prognosis. Other exocrine cancers include <a href="adenosquamous%20carcinoma">adenosquamous carcinoma</a>s, <a href="signet%20ring%20cell%20carcinoma">signet ring cell carcinoma</a>s, <a href="hepatoid%20carcinoma">hepatoid carcinoma</a>s, colloid carcinomas, <a href="Anaplasia">undifferentiated</a> carcinomas, and undifferentiated carcinomas with <a href="osteoclast">osteoclast</a>-like <a href="giant%20cell">giant cell</a>s. <a href="Solid%20pseudopapillary%20tumor">Solid pseudopapillary tumor</a> is a rare low-<a href="Grading%20%28tumors%29">grade</a> neoplasm that mainly affects younger women, and generally has a very good prognosis.

<a href="Pancreatic%20mucinous%20cystic%20neoplasm">Pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm</a>s are a broad group of pancreas tumors that have varying malignant potential. They are being detected at a greatly increased rate as CT scans become more powerful and common, and discussion continues as how best to assess and treat them, given that many are benign.

The small minority of tumors that arise elsewhere in the pancreas are mainly <a href="pancreatic%20neuroendocrine%20tumor">pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor</a>s (PanNETs). <a href="Neuroendocrine%20tumor">Neuroendocrine tumor</a>s (NETs) are a diverse group of <a href="Benign%20tumor%23Benign%20vs%20malignant">benign or malignant</a> tumors that arise from the body's <a href="neuroendocrine%20cell">neuroendocrine cell</a>s, which are responsible for integrating the <a href="Nervous%20system">nervous</a> and endocrine systems. NETs can start in most organs of the body, including the pancreas, where the various malignant types are all considered to be <a href="Rare%20disease">rare</a>. PanNETs are grouped into 'functioning' and 'non-functioning' types, depending on the degree to which they produce hormones. The functioning types secrete hormones such as <a href="insulin">insulin</a>, <a href="gastrin">gastrin</a>, and <a href="glucagon">glucagon</a> into the bloodstream, often in large quantities, giving rise to serious symptoms such as <a href="low%20blood%20sugar">low blood sugar</a>, but also favoring relatively early detection. The most common functioning PanNETs are <a href="insulinoma">insulinoma</a>s and <a href="gastrinoma">gastrinoma</a>s, named after the hormones they secrete. The non-functioning types do not secrete hormones in a sufficient quantity to give rise to overt clinical symptoms. For this reason, non-functioning PanNETs are often diagnosed only after the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

As with other neuroendocrine tumors, the history of the terminology and classification of PanNETs is complex. PanNETs are sometimes called "islet cell cancers", even though it is now known that they do not actually arise from <a href="islet%20cell">islet cell</a>s as previously thought.

Since pancreatic cancer usually does not cause recognizable symptoms in its early stages, the disease is typically not diagnosed until it has spread beyond the pancreas itself. This is one of the main reasons for the generally poor survival rates. Exceptions to this are the functioning PanNETs, where over-production of various active hormones can give rise to symptoms (which depend on the type of hormone).

Bearing in mind that the disease is rarely diagnosed before the age of 40, common symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occurring before diagnosis include:


Other common manifestations of the disease include: weakness and tiring easily; <a href="Xerostomia">dry mouth</a>; sleep problems; and a <a href="Palpation">palpable</a> abdominal <a href="Abdominal%20mass">mass</a>.

The spread of pancreatic cancer to other organs (<a href="cancer%20metastasis">metastasis</a>) may also cause symptoms. Typically, pancreatic adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>s, and later to the <a href="liver">liver</a> or to the <a href="peritoneal%20cavity">peritoneal cavity</a>, <a href="large%20intestine">large intestine</a> or lungs. It is uncommon for it to spread to the bones or brain.

Cancers in the pancreas may also be <a href="secondary%20cancer">secondary cancer</a>s that have spread from other parts of the body. This is uncommon, found in only about 2% of cases of pancreatic cancer. <a href="Kidney%20cancer">Kidney cancer</a> is by far the most common cancer to spread to the pancreas, followed by <a href="colorectal%20cancer">colorectal cancer</a>, and then cancers of the <a href="melanoma">skin</a>, <a href="breast%20cancer">breast</a>, and <a href="lung%20cancer">lung</a>. Surgery may be performed on the pancreas in such cases, whether in hope of a cure or to alleviate symptoms.

<a href="Risk%20factor">Risk factor</a>s for <a href="pancreatic%20adenocarcinoma">pancreatic adenocarcinoma</a> include:


Drinking alcohol excessively is a major cause of <a href="chronic%20pancreatitis">chronic pancreatitis</a>, which in turn predisposes to pancreatic cancer. However, considerable research has failed to firmly establish alcohol consumption as a direct risk factor for pancreatic cancer. Overall, the association is consistently weak and the majority of studies have found no association, with smoking a strong <a href="confounding">confounding</a> factor. The evidence is stronger for a link with heavy drinking, of at least six drinks per day.

Exocrine cancers are thought to arise from several types of <a href="precancer">precancer</a>ous <a href="lesion">lesion</a>s within the pancreas. But these lesions do not always progress to cancer, and the increased numbers detected as a by-product of the increasing use of CT scans for other reasons are not all treated. Apart from <a href="pancreatic%20serous%20cystadenoma">pancreatic serous cystadenoma</a>s (SCNs), which are almost always benign, four types of precancerous lesion are recognized.

The first is pancreatic <a href="intraepithelial%20neoplasia">intraepithelial neoplasia</a>. These lesions are microscopic abnormalities in the pancreas and are often found in <a href="autopsy">autopsies</a> of people with no diagnosed cancer. These lesions may progress from <a href="cancer%20grading">low to high grade</a> and then to a tumor. More than 90% of cases at all grades carry a faulty "<a href="KRAS">KRAS</a>" gene, while in grades 2 and 3 damage to three further genes – "<a href="p16">CDKN2A</a>" ("p16"), "<a href="p53">p53</a>" and "<a href="SMAD4">SMAD4</a>" – are increasingly often found.

A second type are the <a href="intraductal%20papillary%20mucinous%20neoplasm">intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm</a>s (IPMNs). These are macroscopic lesions, which are found in about 2% of all adults. This rate rises to ~10% by age 70. These lesions have about a 25% risk of developing into invasive cancer. They may have "KRAS" gene mutations (~40–65% of cases) and in the GNAS <a href="Gs%20alpha%20subunit">Gs alpha subunit</a> and RNF43, affecting the <a href="Wnt%20signaling%20pathway">Wnt signaling pathway</a>. Even if removed surgically, there remains a considerably increased risk of pancreatic cancer developing subsequently.

The third type, <a href="pancreatic%20mucinous%20cystic%20neoplasm">pancreatic mucinous cystic neoplasm</a>s (MCNs) mainly occur in women, and may remain benign or progress to cancer. If these lesions become large, cause symptoms, or have suspicious features, they can usually be successfully removed by surgery.

A fourth type of cancer that arises in the pancreas is the intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm. This type was recognised by the WHO in 2010 and constitutes about 1–3% of all pancreatic neoplasms. Mean age at diagnosis is 61 years (range 35–78 years). About 50% of these lesions become invasive. Diagnosis depends on histology as these lesions are very difficult to differentiate from other lesions on either clinical or radiological grounds.

The genetic events found in ductal adenocarcinoma have been well characterized, and complete <a href="exome%20sequencing">exome sequencing</a> has been done for the common types of tumor. Four genes have each been found to be mutated in the majority of adenocarcinomas: "KRAS" (in 95% of cases), "<a href="CDKN2A">CDKN2A</a>" (also in 95%), "<a href="TP53">TP53</a>" (75%), and "SMAD4" (55%). The last of these are especially associated with a poor prognosis. "<a href="SWI/SNF">SWI/SNF</a>" mutations/deletions occur in about 10–15% of the adenocarcinomas. The genetic alterations in several other types of pancreatic cancer and precancerous lesions have also been researched. Transcriptomics analyses and mRNA sequencing for the common forms of pancreatic cancer have found that 75% of human genes are expressed in the tumors, with some 200 genes more specifically expressed in pancreatic cancer as compared to other tumor types.

The genes often found mutated in <a href="Pancreatic%20neuroendocrine%20tumor">PanNETs</a> are different from those in exocrine pancreatic cancer. For example, "KRAS" mutation is normally absent. Instead, hereditary "<a href="MEN1">MEN1</a>" gene mutations give rise to <a href="MEN1%20syndrome">MEN1 syndrome</a>, in which primary tumors occur in two or more endocrine glands. About 40–70% of people born with a "MEN1" mutation eventually develop a PanNet. Other genes that are frequently mutated include "<a href="DAXX">DAXX</a>", "<a href="mTOR">mTOR</a>" and "<a href="ATRX">ATRX</a>".

The symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma do not usually appear in the disease's early stages, and are individually not distinctive to the disease. The symptoms at diagnosis vary according to the location of the cancer in the pancreas, which anatomists divide (from left to right on most diagrams) into the thick head, the neck, and the tapering body, ending in the tail.

Regardless of a tumor's location, the most common symptom is unexplained weight loss, which may be considerable. A large minority (between 35% and 47%) of people diagnosed with the disease will have had nausea, vomiting or a feeling of weakness. Tumors in the head of the pancreas typically also cause jaundice, pain, <a href="Anorexia%20%28symptom%29">loss of appetite</a>, dark urine, and light-colored stools. Tumors in the body and tail typically also cause pain.

People sometimes have recent onset of atypical <a href="type%202%20diabetes">type 2 diabetes</a> that is difficult to control, a history of recent but unexplained blood vessel inflammation caused by blood clots (<a href="thrombophlebitis">thrombophlebitis</a>) known as <a href="Trousseau%20sign%20of%20malignancy">Trousseau sign</a>, or a previous attack of <a href="pancreatitis">pancreatitis</a>. A doctor may suspect pancreatic cancer when the onset of diabetes in someone over 50 years old is accompanied by typical symptoms such as unexplained weight loss, persistent abdominal or back pain, indigestion, vomiting, or fatty feces. Jaundice accompanied by a painlessly swollen <a href="gallbladder">gallbladder</a> (known as <a href="Courvoisier%27s%20law">Courvoisier's sign</a>) may also raise suspicion, and can help <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differentiate</a> pancreatic cancer from <a href="gallstone">gallstone</a>s.

<a href="Medical%20imaging">Medical imaging</a> techniques, such as <a href="computed%20tomography">computed tomography</a> (CT scan) and <a href="endoscopic%20ultrasound">endoscopic ultrasound</a> (EUS) are used both to confirm the diagnosis and to help decide whether the tumor can be surgically removed (its "<a href="Resection%20%28surgery%29">resectability</a>"). On <a href="CT%20scan%23Contrast">contrast CT scan</a>, pancreatic cancer typically shows a gradually increasing radiocontrast uptake, rather than a fast washout as seen in a normal pancreas or a delayed washout as seen in chronic pancreatitis. <a href="Magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">Magnetic resonance imaging</a> and <a href="positron%20emission%20tomography">positron emission tomography</a> may also be used, and <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20cholangiopancreatography">magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography</a> may be useful in some cases. <a href="Abdominal%20ultrasound">Abdominal ultrasound</a> is less sensitive and will miss small tumors, but can identify cancers that have spread to the liver and build-up of fluid in the peritoneal cavity (<a href="ascites">ascites</a>). It may be used for a quick and cheap first examination before other techniques.

A biopsy by <a href="fine%20needle%20aspiration">fine needle aspiration</a>, often guided by endoscopic ultrasound, may be used where there is uncertainty over the diagnosis, but a <a href="Histology">histologic</a> diagnosis is not usually required for removal of the tumor by surgery to go ahead.

<a href="Liver%20function%20test">Liver function test</a>s can show a combination of results indicative of bile duct obstruction (raised <a href="conjugated%20bilirubin">conjugated bilirubin</a>, <a href="Gamma%20glutamyl%20transpeptidase">γ-glutamyl transpeptidase</a> and <a href="alkaline%20phosphatase">alkaline phosphatase</a> levels). <a href="CA19-9">CA19-9</a> (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a <a href="tumor%20marker">tumor marker</a> that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks <a href="sensitivity%20and%20specificity">sensitivity and specificity</a>, not least because 5% of people lack the <a href="Lewis%20antigen%20system">Lewis (a) antigen</a> and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.

The most common form of pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma) is typically characterized by moderately to <a href="Anaplasia">poorly differentiated</a> glandular structures on microscopic examination. There is typically considerable <a href="desmoplasia">desmoplasia</a> or formation of a dense fibrous <a href="Stroma%20%28animal%20tissue%29">stroma</a> or structural tissue consisting of a range of <a href="cell%20type">cell type</a>s (including <a href="myofibroblast">myofibroblast</a>s, <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s, <a href="lymphocyte">lymphocyte</a>s and <a href="mast%20cell">mast cell</a>s) and deposited material (such as <a href="type%20I%20collagen">type I collagen</a> and <a href="hyaluronic%20acid">hyaluronic acid</a>). This creates a <a href="tumor%20microenvironment">tumor microenvironment</a> that is short of <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s (hypovascular) and so of <a href="oxygen">oxygen</a> (<a href="tumor%20hypoxia">tumor hypoxia</a>). It is thought that this prevents many chemotherapy drugs from reaching the tumor, as one factor making the cancer especially hard to treat.

Pancreatic cancer is usually <a href="cancer%20staging">stage</a>d following a <a href="CT%20scan">CT scan</a>. The most widely used cancer staging system for pancreatic cancer is the one formulated by the <a href="American%20Joint%20Committee%20on%20Cancer">American Joint Committee on Cancer</a> (AJCC) together with the <a href="Union%20for%20International%20Cancer%20Control">Union for International Cancer Control</a> (UICC). The AJCC-UICC staging system designates four main overall stages, ranging from early to advanced disease, based on <a href="TNM%20staging%20system">TNM classification</a> of Tumor size, spread to lymph Nodes, and Metastasis.

To help decide treatment, the tumors are also divided into three broader categories based on whether surgical removal seems possible: in this way, tumors are judged to be "resectable", "borderline resectable", or "unresectable". When the disease is still in an early stage (AJCC-UICC stages I and II), without spread to large blood vessels or distant organs such as the liver or lungs, surgical resection of the tumor can normally be performed, if the patient is willing to undergo this major operation and is thought to be sufficiently fit. The AJCC-UICC staging system allows distinction between stage III tumors that are judged to be "borderline resectable" (where surgery is technically feasible because the <a href="celiac%20axis">celiac axis</a> and <a href="superior%20mesenteric%20artery">superior mesenteric artery</a> are still free) and those that are "unresectable" (due to more locally advanced disease); in terms of the more detailed TNM classification, these two groups correspond to T3 and T4 respectively.

Locally advanced adenocarcinomas have spread into neighboring organs, which may be any of the following (in roughly decreasing order of frequency): the <a href="duodenum">duodenum</a>, <a href="stomach">stomach</a>, <a href="transverse%20colon">transverse colon</a>, <a href="spleen">spleen</a>, <a href="adrenal%20gland">adrenal gland</a>, or <a href="kidney">kidney</a>. Very often they also spread to the important blood or <a href="lymphatic%20vessel">lymphatic vessel</a>s and nerves that run close to the pancreas, making surgery far more difficult. Typical sites for metastatic spread (stage IV disease) are the liver, peritoneal cavity and <a href="lung">lung</a>s, all of which occur in 50% or more of fully advanced cases.

The 2010 WHO classification of tumors of the digestive system grades all the pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNETs) into three categories, based on their degree of cellular differentiation (from "NET G1" through to the poorly differentiated "NET G3"). The U.S. <a href="National%20Comprehensive%20Cancer%20Network">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a> recommends use of the same AJCC-UICC staging system as pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Using this scheme, the stage-by-stage outcomes for PanNETs are dissimilar to those of the exocrine cancers. A different TNM system for PanNETs has been proposed by the European Neuroendocrine Tumor Society.

Apart from not smoking, the <a href="American%20Cancer%20Society">American Cancer Society</a> recommends keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and <a href="whole%20grain">whole grain</a>s, while decreasing consumption of red and <a href="processed%20meat">processed meat</a>, although there is no consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of <a href="citrus%20fruit">citrus fruit</a>s and <a href="curcumin">curcumin</a> reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, <a href="folate">folate</a>, <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, and non-fried fish.

In the general population, screening of large groups is not currently considered effective, although newer techniques, and the screening of tightly targeted groups, are being evaluated. Nevertheless, regular screening with endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging is recommended for those at high risk from inherited genetics.

A key assessment that is made after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see <a href="%23Staging">Staging</a>), as this is the only cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. The exact location of the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.

Chemotherapy and, to a lesser extent, radiotherapy are likely to be offered to most people, whether or not surgery is possible. Specialists advise that the management of pancreatic cancer should be in the hands of a <a href="Multidisciplinary%20approach">multidisciplinary team</a> including specialists in several aspects of <a href="oncology">oncology</a>, and is, therefore, best conducted in larger centers.

Surgery with the intention of a cure is only possible in around one-fifth (20%) of new cases. Although CT scans help, in practice it can be difficult to determine whether the tumor can be fully removed (its "resectability"), and it may only become apparent during surgery that it is not possible to successfully remove the tumor without damaging other vital tissues. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on various factors, including the precise extent of local anatomical adjacency to, or involvement of, the <a href="vein">venous</a> or <a href="artery">arterial</a> blood vessels, as well as surgical expertise and a careful consideration of projected post-operative recovery. The age of the person is not in itself a reason not to operate, but their general <a href="performance%20status">performance status</a> needs to be adequate for a major operation.

One particular feature that is evaluated is the encouraging presence, or discouraging absence, of a clear layer or plane of fat creating a barrier between the tumor and the vessels. Traditionally, an assessment is made of the tumor's proximity to major venous or arterial vessels, in terms of "abutment" (defined as the tumor touching no more than half a blood vessel's circumference without any fat to separate it), "encasement" (when the tumor encloses most of the vessel's circumference), or full vessel involvement. A resection that includes encased sections of blood vessels may be possible in some cases, particularly if preliminary <a href="neoadjuvant%20therapy">neoadjuvant therapy</a> is feasible, using chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

Even when the operation appears to have been successful, cancerous cells are often found around the edges ("<a href="Resection%20margin">margins</a>") of the removed tissue, when a pathologist examines them microscopically (this will always be done), indicating the cancer has not been entirely removed. Furthermore, <a href="cancer%20stem%20cells">cancer stem cells</a> are usually not evident microscopically, and if they are present they may continue to develop and spread. An exploratory <a href="laparoscopy">laparoscopy</a> (a small, camera-guided surgical procedure) may therefore be performed to gain a clearer idea of the outcome of a full operation.

For cancers involving the head of the pancreas, the <a href="Pancreaticoduodenectomy">Whipple procedure</a> is the most commonly attempted curative surgical treatment. This is a major operation which involves removing the pancreatic head and the curve of the duodenum together ("pancreato-duodenectomy"), making a <a href="Bypass%20surgery">bypass</a> for food from the stomach to the <a href="jejunum">jejunum</a> ("gastro-jejunostomy") and attaching a loop of jejunum to the <a href="cystic%20duct">cystic duct</a> to drain bile ("cholecysto-jejunostomy"). It can be performed only if the person is likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed only in a minority of cases. Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a <a href="distal%20pancreatectomy">distal pancreatectomy</a>, which often also entails <a href="Splenectomy">removal of the spleen</a>. Nowadays, this can often be done using <a href="Laparoscopic%20surgery">minimally invasive surgery</a>.

Although curative surgery no longer entails the very high death rates that occurred until the 1980s, a high proportion of people (about 30–45%) still have to be treated for a post-operative sickness that is not caused by the cancer itself. The most common <a href="Complication%20%28medicine%29">complication</a> of surgery is difficulty in emptying the stomach. Certain more limited surgical procedures may also be used to ease symptoms (see <a href="%23Palliative%20care">Palliative care</a>): for instance, if the cancer is invading or compressing the duodenum or <a href="Large%20intestine">colon</a>. In such cases, bypass surgery might overcome the obstruction and improve quality of life but is not intended as a cure.

After surgery, <a href="Adjuvant%20therapy">adjuvant</a> chemotherapy with <a href="gemcitabine">gemcitabine</a> or <a href="5-FU">5-FU</a> can be offered if the person is <a href="performance%20status">sufficiently fit</a>, after a recovery period of one to two months. In people not suitable for curative surgery, chemotherapy may be used to extend life or improve <a href="quality%20of%20life">its quality</a>. Before surgery, <a href="neoadjuvant">neoadjuvant</a> chemotherapy or <a href="chemoradiotherapy">chemoradiotherapy</a> may be used in cases that are considered to be "borderline resectable" (see <a href="%23Staging">Staging</a>) in order to reduce the cancer to a level where surgery could be beneficial. In other cases neoadjuvant therapy remains controversial, because it delays surgery.

Gemcitabine was approved by the United States <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration%20%28United%20States%29">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) in 1997, after a <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a> reported improvements in quality of life and a 5-week improvement in <a href="Survival%20rate%23median%20survival">median survival duration</a> in people with advanced pancreatic cancer. This was the first chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA primarily for a nonsurvival clinical trial endpoint. Chemotherapy using gemcitabine alone was the standard for about a decade, as a number of trials testing it in combination with other drugs failed to demonstrate significantly better outcomes. However, the combination of gemcitabine with <a href="erlotinib">erlotinib</a> was found to increase survival modestly, and erlotinib was licensed by the FDA for use in pancreatic cancer in 2005.

The <a href="FOLFIRINOX">FOLFIRINOX</a> <a href="chemotherapy%20regimen">chemotherapy regimen</a> using four drugs was found more effective than gemcitabine, but with substantial side effects, and is thus only suitable for people with good performance status. This is also true of <a href="protein-bound%20paclitaxel">protein-bound paclitaxel</a> (nab-paclitaxel), which was licensed by the FDA in 2013 for use with gemcitabine in pancreas cancer. By the end of 2013, both FOLFIRINOX and nab-paclitaxel with gemcitabine were regarded as good choices for those able to tolerate the side-effects, and gemcitabine remained an effective option for those who were not. A head-to-head trial between the two new options is awaited, and trials investigating other variations continue. However, the changes of the last few years have only increased survival times by a few months. Clinical trials are often conducted for novel adjuvant therapies.

The role of <a href="radiation%20therapy">radiotherapy</a> as an auxiliary (adjuvant) treatment after potentially curative surgery has been controversial since the 1980s. The <a href="European%20Society%20for%20Medical%20Oncology">European Society for Medical Oncology</a> recommends that adjuvant radiotherapy should only be used for people enrolled in clinical trials. However, there is a continuing tendency for clinicians in the US to be more ready to use adjuvant radiotherapy than those in Europe. Many clinical trials have tested a variety of treatment combinations since the 1980s, but have failed to settle the matter conclusively.

Radiotherapy may form part of treatment to attempt to shrink a tumor to a resectable state, but its use on unresectable tumors remains controversial as there are conflicting results from clinical trials. The preliminary results of one trial, presented in 2013, "markedly reduced enthusiasm" for its use on locally advanced tumors.

Treatment of PanNETs, including the less common <a href="malignant">malignant</a> types, may include a number of approaches. Some small tumors of less than 1 cm. that are identified incidentally, for example on a CT scan performed for other purposes, may be followed by <a href="watchful%20waiting">watchful waiting</a>. This depends on the assessed risk of surgery which is influenced by the site of the tumor and the <a href="comorbidity">presence of other medical problems</a>. Tumors within the pancreas only (localized tumors), or with limited metastases, for example to the liver, may be removed by surgery. The type of surgery depends on the tumor location, and the degree of spread to lymph nodes.

For localized tumors, the surgical procedure may be much less extensive than the types of surgery used to treat pancreatic adenocarcinoma described above, but otherwise surgical procedures are similar to those for exocrine tumors. The range of possible outcomes varies greatly; some types have a very high survival rate after surgery while others have a poor outlook. As all this group are rare, guidelines emphasize that treatment should be undertaken in a specialized center. Use of liver transplantation may be considered in certain cases of liver metastasis.

For functioning tumors, the <a href="Hormonal%20therapy%20%28oncology%29%23Somatostatin%20analogs">somatostatin analog</a> class of medications, such as <a href="octreotide">octreotide</a>, can reduce the excessive production of hormones. <a href="Lanreotide">Lanreotide</a> can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and is causing symptoms, <a href="targeted%20therapy">targeted therapy</a> with <a href="everolimus">everolimus</a> or <a href="sunitinib">sunitinib</a> can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard <a href="cytotoxic">cytotoxic</a> chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.

Radiation therapy is occasionally used if there is pain due to anatomic extension, such as <a href="metastasis">metastasis</a> to bone. Some PanNETs absorb specific <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s or hormones, and these PanNETs may respond to <a href="nuclear%20medicine">nuclear medicine</a> therapy with <a href="radiolabeled">radiolabeled</a> peptides or hormones such as <a href="iobenguane">iobenguane</a> (iodine-131-MIBG). <a href="Radiofrequency%20ablation">Radiofrequency ablation</a> (RFA), <a href="cryoablation">cryoablation</a>, and <a href="hepatic%20artery%20embolization">hepatic artery embolization</a> may also be used.

<a href="Palliative%20care">Palliative care</a> is medical care which focuses on treatment of symptoms from serious illness, such as cancer, and improving quality of life. Because pancreatic adenocarcinoma is usually diagnosed after it has progressed to an advanced stage, palliative care as a treatment of symptoms is often the only treatment possible.

Palliative care focuses not on treating the underlying cancer, but on treating symptoms such as <a href="cancer%20pain">pain</a> or nausea, and can assist in decision-making, including when or if <a href="hospice%20care">hospice care</a> will be beneficial. Pain can be managed with medications such as <a href="opioid">opioid</a>s or through procedural intervention, by a <a href="nerve%20block">nerve block</a> on the <a href="celiac%20plexus">celiac plexus</a> (CPB). This alters or, depending on the technique used, destroys the nerves that transmit pain from the abdomen. CPB is a safe and effective way to reduce the pain, which generally reduces the need to use opioid painkillers, which have significant negative side effects.

Other symptoms or complications that can be treated with palliative surgery are obstruction by the tumor of the intestines or <a href="Bile%20drainage">bile ducts</a>. For the latter, which occurs in well over half of cases, a small metal tube called a <a href="stent">stent</a> may be inserted by <a href="endoscope">endoscope</a> to keep the ducts draining. Palliative care can also help treat depression that often comes with the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.

Both surgery and advanced inoperable tumors often lead to <a href="digestive%20system">digestive system</a> disorders from a lack of the exocrine products of the pancreas (exocrine insufficiency). These can be treated by taking <a href="pancreatin">pancreatin</a> which contains manufactured pancreatic enzymes, and is best taken with food. Difficulty in emptying the stomach (delayed gastric emptying) is common and can be a serious problem, involving hospitalization. Treatment may involve a variety of approaches, including draining the stomach by <a href="nasogastric%20aspiration">nasogastric aspiration</a> and drugs called <a href="proton-pump%20inhibitor">proton-pump inhibitor</a>s or <a href="H2%20antagonist">H2 antagonist</a>s, which both reduce production of <a href="gastric%20acid">gastric acid</a>. Medications like <a href="metoclopramide">metoclopramide</a> can also be used to clear stomach contents.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma and the other less common exocrine cancers have a very poor <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a>, as they are normally diagnosed at a late stage when the cancer is already locally advanced or has spread to other parts of the body. Outcomes are much better for PanNETs: many are benign and completely without clinical symptoms, and even those cases not treatable with surgery have an average <a href="five-year%20survival%20rate">five-year survival rate</a> of 16%, although the outlook varies considerably according to the type.

For locally advanced and <a href="metastatic">metastatic</a> pancreatic adenocarcinomas, which together represent over 80% of cases, numerous recent trials comparing chemotherapy regimes have shown increased survival times, but not to more than one year. Overall five-year survival for pancreatic cancer in the US has improved from 2% in cases diagnosed in 1975–77, and 4% in 1987–89 diagnoses, to 6% in 2003–09. In the less than 20% of cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a diagnosis of a localized and small cancerous growth (less than 2 cm in Stage T1), about 20% of Americans survive to five years.

About 1500 genes are linked to outcomes in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression is related to poor outcome, for example <a href="C-Met">C-Met</a> and <a href="MUC1">MUC-1</a>, and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the <a href="transcription%20factor">transcription factor</a> <a href="PELP-1">PELP1</a>.

As of 2012, pancreatic cancer resulted in 330,000 deaths globally, up from 310,000 in 2010 and 200,000 in 1990. In 2014, an estimated 46,000 people in the US are expected to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and 40,000 to die of it. Although it accounts for only 2.5% of new cases, pancreatic cancer is responsible for 6% of cancer deaths each year. It is the seventh highest cause of death from cancer worldwide.

Globally pancreatic cancer is the 11th most common cancer in women and the 12th most common in men. The majority of recorded cases occur in <a href="developed%20countries">developed countries</a>. People from the United States have an average <a href="lifetime%20risk">lifetime risk</a> of about 1 in 67 (or 1.5%) of developing the disease, slightly higher than the figure for the UK. The disease is more common in men than women, though the difference in rates has narrowed over recent decades, probably reflecting earlier increases in female smoking. In the United States the risk for <a href="African%20American">African American</a>s is over 50% greater than for <a href="White%20American">whites</a>, but the rates in Africa and <a href="East%20Asia">East Asia</a> are much lower than those in North America or Europe. The United States, Central and eastern Europe, and <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> and <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> all have high rates.

Pancreatic cancer is the 10th most common cancer in the UK (around 8,800 people were diagnosed with the disease in 2011), and it is the 5th most common cause of cancer death (around 8,700 people died in 2012).

The annual <a href="Incidence%20%28epidemiology%29">incidence</a> of clinically recognized PanNETs is low (about 5 per one million person-years) and is dominated by the non-functioning types. Somewhere between 45% and 90% of PanNETs are thought to be of the non-functioning types. Studies of <a href="autopsies">autopsies</a> have <a href="Incidental%20findings">uncovered</a> small PanNETs rather frequently, suggesting that the <a href="prevalence">prevalence</a> of tumors that remain inert and <a href="asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> may be relatively high. Overall PanNETs are thought to account for about 1 to 2% of all pancreatic tumors. The definition and classification of PanNETs has changed over time, affecting what is known about their <a href="epidemiology">epidemiology</a> and clinical relevance.

The earliest recognition of pancreatic cancer has been attributed to the 18th-century Italian scientist <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Morgagni">Giovanni Battista Morgagni</a>, the historical father of modern-day <a href="anatomic%20pathology">anatomic pathology</a>, who claimed to have traced several cases of cancer in the pancreas. Many 18th and 19th-century physicians were skeptical about the existence of the disease, given the similar appearance of pancreatitis. Some <a href="case%20report">case report</a>s were published in the 1820s and 1830s, and a genuine <a href="histopathologic">histopathologic</a> diagnosis was eventually recorded by the American clinician <a href="Jacob%20Mendes%20Da%20Costa">Jacob Mendes Da Costa</a>, who also doubted the reliability of Morgagni's interpretations. By the start of the 20th century, cancer of the head of the pancreas had become a well-established diagnosis.

Regarding the recognition of PanNETs, the possibility of cancer of the islet cells was initially suggested in 1888. The first case of <a href="hyperinsulinism">hyperinsulinism</a> due to a tumor of this type was reported in 1927. Recognition of a non-insulin-secreting type of PanNET is generally ascribed to the American surgeons, R. M. Zollinger and E. H. Ellison, who gave their names to <a href="Zollinger%E2%80%93Ellison%20syndrome">Zollinger–Ellison syndrome</a>, after postulating the existence of a gastrin-secreting pancreatic tumor in a report of two cases of unusually severe <a href="peptic%20ulcer">peptic ulcer</a>s published in 1955. In 2010, the WHO recommended that PanNETs be referred to as "neuroendocrine" rather than "endocrine" tumors.

The first reported partial pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed by the Italian surgeon <a href="Alessandro%20Codivilla">Alessandro Codivilla</a> in 1898, but the patient only survived 18 days before succumbing to complications. Early operations were compromised partly because of mistaken beliefs that people would die if their duodenum were removed, and also, at first, if the flow of pancreatic juices stopped. Later it was thought, also mistakenly, that the pancreatic duct could simply be tied up without serious adverse effects; in fact, it will very often leak later on. In 1907–08, after some more unsuccessful operations by other surgeons, experimental procedures were tried on corpses by French surgeons.

In 1912 the German surgeon <a href="Walther%20Kausch">Walther Kausch</a> was the first to remove large parts of the duodenum and pancreas together ("en bloc"). This was in Breslau, now <a href="Wroc%C5%82aw">Wrocław</a> in Poland. In 1918 it was demonstrated in operations on dogs that total removal of the duodenum is compatible with life, but this was not reported in human surgery until 1935, when the American surgeon <a href="Allen%20Oldfather%20Whipple">Allen Oldfather Whipple</a> published the results of a series of three operations at <a href="Columbia%20Presbyterian%20Hospital">Columbia Presbyterian Hospital</a> in New York. Only one of the patients had the duodenum totally removed, but he survived for two years before dying of metastasis to the liver. The first operation was unplanned, as cancer was only discovered in the operating theater. Whipple's success showed the way for the future, but the operation remained a difficult and dangerous one until recent decades. He published several refinements to his procedure, including the first total removal of the duodenum in 1940, but he only performed a total of 37 operations.

The discovery in the late 1930s that <a href="vitamin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BK">vitamin K</a> prevented <a href="Vitamin%20K%20deficiency">bleeding with jaundice</a>, and the development of <a href="blood%20transfusion">blood transfusion</a> as an everyday process, both improved post-operative survival, but about 25% of people never left hospital alive as late as the 1970s. In the 1970s a group of American surgeons wrote urging that the procedure was too dangerous and should be abandoned. Since then outcomes in larger centers have improved considerably, and mortality from the operation is often less than 4%. In 2006 a report was published of a series of 1,000 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies performed by a single surgeon from <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> between 1969 and 2003. The rate of these operations had increased steadily over this period, with only three of them before 1980, and the median operating time reduced from 8.8 hours in the 1970s to 5.5 hours in the 2000s, and mortality within 30 days or in hospital was only 1%. Another series of 2,050 operations at the <a href="Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital">Massachusetts General Hospital</a> between 1941 and 2011 showed a similar picture of improvement.

Small precancerous neoplasms for many pancreatic cancers are being detected at greatly increased rates by modern medical imaging. One type, the intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) was first described by Japanese researchers in 1982. It was noted in 2010 that: "For the next decade, little attention was paid to this report; however, over the subsequent 15 years, there has been a virtual explosion in the recognition of this tumor."

Worldwide efforts on many levels are underway to understand pancreatic cancer, but progress has been slow, particularly into understanding the disease's causes. There are several fundamental unanswered questions. The nature of the changes that lead to the disease are being intensely investigated, such as the roles played by genes such as "KRAS" and "p53". A key question is the timing of events as the disease develops and progresses – particularly the role of diabetes, and how and when the disease spreads.

Research on early detection is ongoing. For instance, the European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis and Familial Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) trial is aiming to determine whether regular screening is appropriate for people with a family history of the disease, or who have hereditary pancreatitis. The knowledge that new onset of diabetes can be an early sign of the disease could facilitate timely diagnosis and <a href="Secondary%20prevention">prevention</a> if a workable screening strategy can be developed.

Another area of interest is in assessing whether keyhole surgery (<a href="laparoscopy">laparoscopy</a>) would be better than Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. <a href="Irreversible%20electroporation">Irreversible electroporation</a> is a relatively novel <a href="Ablation%23Medicine">ablation</a> technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or <a href="radiochemotherapy">radiochemotherapy</a> before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.

Efforts are underway to develop new drugs. Some of these involve <a href="targeted%20therapies">targeted therapies</a> against the cancer cells' <a href="Molecular%20pathway">molecular mechanisms</a>. Others aim to target the highly resistant cancer stem cells. Still others aim to affect the non-neoplastic <a href="Stromal%20cell">stroma</a> and microenvironment of the tumor, which is known to influence <a href="Cell%20growth%23Cell%20growth%20disorders">cell proliferation</a> and metastasis. A further approach involves the use of <a href="immunotherapy">immunotherapy</a>, such as <a href="oncolytic%20virus">oncolytic virus</a>es.

He made his film debut two years later in the comedy "<a href="Wet%20Hot%20American%20Summer">Wet Hot American Summer</a>". He first gained recognition as <a href="Will%20Tippin">Will Tippin</a> in the spy-action television show "<a href="Alias%20%28TV%20series%29">Alias</a>" (2001–2006), and achieved minor success with a supporting part in the comedy film "<a href="Wedding%20Crashers">Wedding Crashers</a>" (2005). His breakthrough role came in 2009 with "<a href="The%20Hangover">The Hangover</a>", a critically and commercially successful comedy, which spawned two sequels in <a href="The%20Hangover%20Part%20II">2011</a> and <a href="The%20Hangover%20Part%20III">2013</a>. Cooper's portrayal of a struggling writer in the thriller "<a href="Limitless%20%28film%29">Limitless</a>" (2011) and a rookie police officer in the crime drama "<a href="The%20Place%20Beyond%20the%20Pines">The Place Beyond the Pines</a>" (2012) drew praise from critics.

For his work in these films, he was nominated for four Academy Awards, becoming the tenth actor to receive an Oscar nomination in three consecutive years. In 2014, he portrayed <a href="Joseph%20Merrick">Joseph Merrick</a> in a <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> revival of "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28play%29">The Elephant Man</a>", garnering a nomination for the <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Play">Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play</a>. That year, he also began voicing <a href="Rocket%20Raccoon">Rocket Raccoon</a> in the <a href="Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>. In 2018, Cooper produced, wrote and directed his first film with the musical romance "<a href="A%20Star%20Is%20Born%20%282018%20film%29">A Star Is Born</a>", in which he also starred, for which he gained three more Oscar nominations.

Cooper was married to actress <a href="Jennifer%20Esposito">Jennifer Esposito</a> from 2006 to 2007. He has been in a relationship with Russian model <a href="Irina%20Shayk">Irina Shayk</a> since 2015, with whom he has a daughter. He supports several organizations that help people fight <a href="cancer">cancer</a>.

Cooper was born on January 5, 1975, in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and grew up in the nearby communities of <a href="Jenkintown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Jenkintown</a> and <a href="Rydal%2C%20Pennsylvania">Rydal</a>. His mother, Gloria (née Campano), worked for the local <a href="NBC">NBC</a> affiliate. His father, Charles Cooper, worked as a <a href="stockbroker">stockbroker</a> for <a href="Merrill%20Lynch">Merrill Lynch</a>. Cooper's father was of Irish descent, while his mother is of Italian ancestry (from <a href="Abruzzo">Abruzzo</a> and <a href="Naples">Naples</a>). He has an older sister, Holly, and was raised as a Roman Catholic. He had <a href="cholesteatoma">cholesteatoma</a> in his ear soon after his birth, and punctured his eardrum when he started diving at an early age.
Describing himself as a child, Cooper has said: "I never lived the life of 'Oh, you're so good-looking'. People thought I was a girl when I was little, because I looked like a girl—maybe because my mother would keep my hair really long". He excelled at basketball, and enjoyed cooking: "I used to have buddies come over after kindergarten and I'd cook them food. I prided myself in taking whatever was in the fridge and turning it into lasagna." He initially wanted to attend a military academy and move to Japan to become a <a href="ninja">ninja</a>. At an early age, his father introduced him to films like "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28film%29">The Elephant Man</a>", which inspired him to be an actor. Cooper says that his parents were initially apprehensive of his career choice, but they eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of <a href="Joseph%20Merrick">Joseph Merrick</a> in an excerpt from the play "<a href="The%20Elephant%20Man%20%28play%29">The Elephant Man</a>".

While attending <a href="Germantown%20Academy">Germantown Academy</a>, he worked at the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Daily%20News">Philadelphia Daily News</a>". He says that in school he was neither "the smartest person" nor "the coolest kid" and "really didn't have anything going on!" After graduating from the academy in 1993, Cooper studied at <a href="Villanova%20University">Villanova University</a> for a year before transferring to <a href="Georgetown%20University">Georgetown University</a>. Cooper graduated with honors from the latter with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts%23United%20States">Bachelor of Arts</a> in English in 1997. He was a member of the <a href="Georgetown%20Hoyas">Georgetown Hoyas</a> rowing team and acted with <a href="Nomadic%20Theatre">Nomadic Theatre</a>. Cooper became fluent in French at Georgetown and spent six months as an exchange student in <a href="Aix-en-Provence">Aix-en-Provence</a>, France. In his television debut, "<a href="Sex%20and%20the%20City">Sex and the City</a>" in 1999, he made a brief appearance opposite <a href="Sarah%20Jessica%20Parker">Sarah Jessica Parker</a>. Cooper later served as a presenter in the travel-adventure series "<a href="Globe%20Trekker">Globe Trekker</a>" (2000), which took him to such places as <a href="Peru">Peru</a> and <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>.

Cooper had been interested in a career in <a href="diplomacy">diplomacy</a> when he auditioned for the <a href="master%20class">master class</a> graduate degree at the <a href="Actors%20Studio">Actors Studio</a> and was selected by <a href="James%20Lipton">James Lipton</a>. In 2000, he received a <a href="Master%20of%20Fine%20Arts">Master of Fine Arts</a> degree in acting from the <a href="Actors%20Studio%20Drama%20School">Actors Studio Drama School</a> at <a href="The%20New%20School">The New School</a> in New York City. There, he trained with the coach <a href="Elizabeth%20Kemp">Elizabeth Kemp</a> of whom he says: "I was never able to relax in my life before her." She advised him on many of his films. While studying in New York City, Cooper worked as a <a href="Doorman%20%28profession%29">doorman</a> at the <a href="Morgans%20Hotel">Morgans Hotel</a>, and briefly interacted with <a href="Robert%20de%20Niro">Robert de Niro</a> and <a href="Sean%20Penn">Sean Penn</a> in question-and-answer master class sessions, which were later featured episodes of "<a href="Inside%20the%20Actors%20Studio">Inside the Actors Studio</a>".

Cooper's cinematic debut came in the ensemble comedy "<a href="Wet%20Hot%20American%20Summer">Wet Hot American Summer</a>" (2001), a film that takes place at a fictional summer camp in 1981. He played Ben, a counselor and the love interest of <a href="Michael%20Ian%20Black">Michael Ian Black</a>'s character. Although the film was critically and commercially unsuccessful, it has developed a <a href="cult%20film">cult status</a> over the years. Cooper reprised the role in the film's prequel "" (2015), an eight-episode <a href="Netflix">Netflix</a> series.

In the television series "<a href="Alias%20%28TV%20series%29">Alias</a>" (2001–06), Cooper achieved some success with the role of <a href="Will%20Tippin">Will Tippin</a>, a local reporter for a newspaper and the best friend of <a href="Jennifer%20Garner">Jennifer Garner</a>'s character, <a href="Sydney%20Bristow">Sydney Bristow</a>. Garner was one of the first people he met in Los Angeles and was, in Cooper's words, "very maternal ... She wanted to take care of me, make sure I was okay all the time." He acted in the 2002 psychological thriller "<a href="Changing%20Lanes">Changing Lanes</a>". The scenes in which he appeared were edited out of the final cut of the film, but are featured on the film's DVD and Blu-ray releases. Also in 2002, he played a man involved in a love triangle in the romantic drama "<a href="Bending%20All%20the%20Rules">Bending All the Rules</a>". He guest-starred in the short-lived TV series "<a href="Miss%20Match">Miss Match</a>" and played the role of cowboy and race horse trainer Morgan Murphy in the television film "The Last Cowboy", which aired on the <a href="Hallmark%20Channel">Hallmark Channel</a> in January 2003. He later appeared in the television film "<a href="I%20Want%20to%20Marry%20Ryan%20Banks">I Want to Marry Ryan Banks</a>" (2004) with <a href="Jason%20Priestley">Jason Priestley</a> and as a regular guest star in the <a href="WB%20Television%20Network">WB</a> series "<a href="Jack%20%26amp%3B%20Bobby">Jack & Bobby</a>" (2004–05).
Cooper's career prospects improved with a more prominent role in the <a href="David%20Dobkin%20%28director%29">David Dobkin</a>-directed comedy "<a href="Wedding%20Crashers">Wedding Crashers</a>" (2005) alongside <a href="Owen%20Wilson">Owen Wilson</a>, <a href="Vince%20Vaughn">Vince Vaughn</a> and <a href="Rachel%20McAdams">Rachel McAdams</a>. In the film, he played Sack Lodge, the arrogant and aggressive boyfriend of Claire (McAdams) who is obsessed with winning—a role he describes as "kind of a sociopath". Cooper believed that the antagonistic character changed people's perception of him, as he had previously played the "nice guy". With a production budget of $40 million, the film grossed over $285 million worldwide. In September 2005, <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox</a> debuted the sitcom "<a href="Kitchen%20Confidential%20%28TV%20series%29">Kitchen Confidential</a>", based on a memoir by chef <a href="Anthony%20Bourdain">Anthony Bourdain</a>, with Cooper in the leading role. Despite positive reviews for the series, the show was canceled after only four episodes due to low ratings.

In March 2006, Cooper starred as Pip/Theo in "<a href="Three%20Days%20of%20Rain">Three Days of Rain</a>" on <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> with <a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a> and <a href="Paul%20Rudd">Paul Rudd</a>. This was followed by minor roles in the romantic comedy "<a href="Failure%20to%20Launch">Failure to Launch</a>" (2006) and the satirical comedy "<a href="The%20Comebacks">The Comebacks</a>" (2007). Cooper next appeared in the fifth season of "<a href="Nip/Tuck">Nip/Tuck</a>" (2007) as Aidan Stone, a television star on the fictional show "Hearts 'N Scalpels". In 2008, he played the lead in "<a href="Older%20than%20America">Older than America</a>", and appeared onstage in a production of <a href="Theresa%20Rebeck">Theresa Rebeck</a>'s play "The Understudy" at the <a href="Williamstown%20Theatre%20Festival">Williamstown Theatre Festival</a> alongside <a href="Kristen%20Johnston">Kristen Johnston</a>. Between his small roles of best friend to the main character in the 2008 comedies "<a href="Yes%20Man%20%28film%29">Yes Man</a>" and "<a href="The%20Rocker%20%28film%29">The Rocker</a>", Cooper landed the lead role in the <a href="Ryuhei%20Kitamura">Ryuhei Kitamura</a>-directed horror film "<a href="The%20Midnight%20Meat%20Train">The Midnight Meat Train</a>" (2008), based on <a href="Clive%20Barker">Clive Barker</a>'s 1984 <a href="Books%20of%20Blood%23The%20Midnight%20Meat%20Train">short story of the same name</a>. Playing the dark character of a freelance photographer who tries to track down a serial killer was a departure from Cooper's previous comedic roles and an experience he found enjoyable. The film received positive reviews from critics, though it earned little at the box office.

In February 2009, Cooper hosted "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Live">Saturday Night Live</a>" with musical guest <a href="TV%20on%20the%20Radio">TV on the Radio</a>, portraying actor <a href="Christian%20Bale">Christian Bale</a> in one sketch. Later that year, he appeared in a supporting role in the film "<a href="He%27s%20Just%20Not%20That%20Into%20You%20%28film%29">He's Just Not That Into You</a>". Cooper's breakthrough role came in <a href="Todd%20Phillips">Todd Phillips</a>' comedy "<a href="The%20Hangover">The Hangover</a>" (2009). He played Phil Wenneck, one of the three friends—alongside <a href="Ed%20Helms">Ed Helms</a> and <a href="Zach%20Galifianakis">Zach Galifianakis</a>—to wake up from a bachelor party in Las Vegas, with <a href="Retrograde%20amnesia">no memory</a> of the previous night and the bachelor missing. "The Hangover" was a commercial success and finished as among the highest-grossing <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system">R-rated</a> films in the United States. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> wrote: "Mr. Cooper ... offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss." For his performance, Cooper received an award at the 13th <a href="Hollywood%20Film%20Festival">Hollywood Film Festival</a> and his first nomination for <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Awards">MTV Movie Awards</a>—<a href="MTV%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Comedic%20Performance">Best Comedic Performance</a>. The newspaper "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" opined that the success of the film turned Cooper into "a bona fide leading man". Nevertheless, Cooper stated in a 2011 interview with "<a href="Shave%20%28magazine%29">Shave</a>": "It's the same. I mean, look, more doors have been opened for sure, but it's not like I sit back with a cigar on Monday morning and go through the scripts that have been offered."

Also in 2009, Cooper featured in the psychological horror "<a href="Case%2039">Case 39</a>", a delayed production that had been filmed in 2006. He paired with <a href="Sandra%20Bullock">Sandra Bullock</a> in the comedy "<a href="All%20About%20Steve">All About Steve</a>", a film that was poorly received by critics, failed to attract a wide audience and earned them a <a href="Golden%20Raspberry%20Award%20for%20Worst%20Screen%20Combo">Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Combo</a>. Following a role in one of eleven segments of the anthology film "<a href="New%20York%2C%20I%20Love%20You">New York, I Love You</a>" (2009), Cooper appeared in the ensemble romantic comedy "<a href="Valentine%27s%20Day%20%282010%20film%29">Valentine's Day</a>" (2010), directed by <a href="Garry%20Marshall">Garry Marshall</a>, co-starring with <a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a>. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $215 million worldwide. He then starred in the comedy "<a href="Brother%27s%20Justice">Brother's Justice</a>" and as the fictional character <a href="Templeton%20%26quot%3BFaceman%26quot%3B%20Peck">Templeton "Faceman" Peck</a> in the feature film version of "<a href="The%20A-Team%20%28film%29">The A-Team</a>" alongside <a href="Liam%20Neeson">Liam Neeson</a>, <a href="Quinton%20Jackson">Quinton Jackson</a>, and <a href="Sharlto%20Copley">Sharlto Copley</a>. To prepare for the role, he abstained from consuming sugar, salt and flour, and underwent grueling workouts. The film released to negative reviews and poor box office returns. Tim Robey of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" wrote, "Cooper confirms his credentials as perhaps the most smugly narcissistic performer", while "Empire" credited both Cooper and Copley for "acing swagger and insanity respectively, who best both capture and yet re-forge their iconic characters." Cooper appeared as <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20Raw%20guest%20hosts">guest host</a> of "<a href="WWE%20Raw">WWE Raw</a>" in June 2010.
In 2011, Cooper starred in the <a href="techno-thriller">techno-thriller</a> "<a href="Limitless%20%28film%29">Limitless</a>", based on the 2001 novel "<a href="The%20Dark%20Fields">The Dark Fields</a>" by <a href="Alan%20Glynn">Alan Glynn</a>. In the <a href="Neil%20Burger">Neil Burger</a>-directed film, he played a struggling writer who is introduced to a <a href="nootropic">nootropic</a> drug that gives him the ability to fully utilize his brain and vastly improve his lifestyle. The box office website <a href="Box%20Office%20Mojo">Box Office Mojo</a> was apprehensive of the film's financial prospects, but it emerged as a commercial success with a worldwide gross of $161 million. A writer for "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" said of Cooper's performance that he "makes further strides toward major stardom, spelling excellent early spring returns and socko vid play." Greater commercial success followed with the comedy sequel "<a href="The%20Hangover%20Part%20II">The Hangover Part II</a>" (2011), which earned over $580 million worldwide. Reviews for the film were generally negative, though the critic for "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" complimented him: "Cooper gives a knowing performance: he's both the peacock and the parody of one. He's blessed with good looks and fantastic timing, the kind that makes every line funnier, even the small asides." At the <a href="38th%20People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">38th People's Choice Awards</a>, he was nominated for Favorite Comedic Movie Actor.

The year 2012 saw Cooper star in four films—"<a href="The%20Words%20%28film%29">The Words</a>", "<a href="Hit%20and%20Run%20%282012%20film%29">Hit and Run</a>", "<a href="The%20Place%20Beyond%20the%20Pines">The Place Beyond the Pines</a>", and "<a href="Silver%20Linings%20Playbook">Silver Linings Playbook</a>". The mystery drama "The Words" failed commercially, as did the action comedy "Hit and Run". In <a href="Derek%20Cianfrance">Derek Cianfrance</a>'s critically acclaimed crime drama "The Place Beyond the Pines", Cooper played a rookie police officer, a role Cianfrance specifically wrote for him. The director drove five hours to <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> to meet with Cooper to convince him to take on the role. Cianfrance described Cooper's character as someone "paraded as a hero ... But inside him corruption is going on, conflict is raging inside, guilt and shame are buried." A writer from "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" credited Cooper for "excelling as an archetype, the principled man who is personally rather dislikeable", adding, "I never imagined this actor capable of such layered character work." Despite positive reviews, the film had moderate box office returns.

Cooper starred with <a href="Robert%20De%20Niro">Robert De Niro</a> and <a href="Jennifer%20Lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> in <a href="David%20O.%20Russell">David O. Russell</a>'s romantic comedy-drama "Silver Linings Playbook", an adaptation of <a href="Matthew%20Quick">Matthew Quick</a>'s serio-comic <a href="The%20Silver%20Linings%20Playbook">novel of the same name</a>. He was cast as a divorced man with <a href="bipolar%20disorder">bipolar disorder</a>, a former teacher who finds companionship in a young, depressed widow (Lawrence). Cooper was initially skeptical about playing the part which he thought was out of his depth, but he later accepted the role inspired by Russell's confidence in him. The director was impressed by his performance in "Wedding Crashers", citing his "good bad-guy energy" and unpredictability as justification for casting; he also thought that Cooper would be able to demonstrate emotion and vulnerability on screen. To prepare, Cooper took dance training with the choreographer <a href="Mandy%20Moore%20%28choreographer%29">Mandy Moore</a>, who describes Cooper as having "some real natural dancing ability." The film was a box-office success, earning $236.4 million on a production budget of $21 million. Writing for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> said that Cooper "seizes the juiciest role of his career and meets every comic and dramatic challenge. There's an ache in his funny, touching and vital performance that resonates." For his performance, he earned an <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance">MTV Movie Award for Best Performance</a>, and nominations for an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Academy Award</a>, <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Musical%20or%20Comedy">Golden Globe Award</a>, and <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Male%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actor</a>.

In 2013, Cooper reprised his role as Phil Wenneck in the third and final installment of <a href="The%20Hangover%20%28film%20series%29">"The Hangover" trilogy</a>, "<a href="The%20Hangover%20Part%20III">The Hangover Part III</a>", which was poorly reviewed by critics. A reviewer for "The Independent" argued that Cooper is "reduced to mugging for the camera, offering reaction shots to nothing." Nevertheless, like its preceding entries, the film was a commercial success, grossing $362 million worldwide, and remains one of Cooper's highest-grossing releases. Later that year, he took on the supporting role of an unhinged <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">FBI</a> agent in David O. Russell's crime comedy-drama "<a href="American%20Hustle">American Hustle</a>". Inspired by the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a>'s <a href="Abscam">Abscam</a> sting operation, the film is set against the backdrop of political corruption in 1970s New Jersey. It also starred Christian Bale, <a href="Amy%20Adams">Amy Adams</a>, <a href="Jeremy%20Renner">Jeremy Renner</a> and Jennifer Lawrence. "American Hustle" was a critical and commercial success with global revenues of $251.1 million. <a href="Kim%20Newman">Kim Newman</a> of "Empire" wrote: "Cooper is stuck with the least rewarding role, but keeps finding brilliant little bits of business to hold the attention", praising his "spot impersonations of his overly cautious (but smart) boss." Cooper was nominated for an <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Academy Award</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">BAFTA Award</a>, <a href="Critics%27%20Choice%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor">Critics' Choice Movie Award</a>, and a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor</a>, but did not win any.
Cooper reunited with Lawrence in the <a href="Susanne%20Bier">Susanne Bier</a>-directed drama "<a href="Serena%20%282014%20film%29">Serena</a>"—an adaptation of <a href="Ron%20Rash">Ron Rash</a>'s period novel. The pair starred as a married couple who become involved in criminal activities after realizing that they cannot bear children. The picture was filmed in 2012, but was released in 2014 to negative reviews and poor box office returns. "<a href="The%20Canberra%20Times">The Canberra Times</a>" Jake Wilson said: "Cooper once again proves his value as a leading man who approaches his roles like a character actor." In 2014, Cooper provided the voice of <a href="Rocket%20Raccoon">Rocket Raccoon</a> in the <a href="Marvel%20Studios">Marvel Studios</a> film "<a href="Guardians%20of%20the%20Galaxy%20%28film%29">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>". He returned to <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> for the 2014 run of "The Elephant Man" as the severely deformed <a href="Joseph%20Merrick">Joseph Merrick</a>. Michael Coveney of <a href="Whatsonstage.com">Whatsonstage.com</a> reviewed his performance: "Cooper avoids every trap of "disability" acting by suffusing this outer appearance with soul and passion. It's a wonderful, and very moving, display." He garnered a nomination for <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20in%20a%20Play">Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play</a>.

Also in 2014, Cooper co-produced and starred as <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20SEAL">United States Navy SEAL</a> sniper <a href="Chris%20Kyle">Chris Kyle</a> in "<a href="American%20Sniper">American Sniper</a>"—a biographical war drama directed by <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a>. The film tells the story of Kyle, who became the deadliest <a href="marksman">marksman</a> in US military history, and is loosely based on the <a href="American%20Sniper%20%28book%29">eponymous memoir</a>. To appear to be as large as Kyle, Cooper underwent extensive training and followed a rigorous diet, gaining of muscle. Cooper's preparation also included lessons with a vocal coach, and studying footage of Kyle. To learn how to use a <a href="rifle">rifle</a>, the actor trained with US Navy SEAL veteran <a href="Kevin%20Lacz">Kevin Lacz</a>, who served with Kyle. The film, and Cooper's performance, received generally positive reviews. The critic for "Variety" wrote, "an excellent performance from a bulked-up Bradley Cooper, this harrowing and intimate character study offers fairly blunt insights into the physical and psychological toll exacted on the front lines." Similar sentiments were expressed by "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" Claudia Puig who asserted: "It's clearly Cooper's show. Substantially bulked up and affecting a believable Texas drawl, Cooper embodies Kyle's confidence, intensity and vulnerability." "American Sniper" earned $547 million worldwide to become Cooper's highest-grossing live-action film and the third highest-grossing R-rated film of all time. Cooper won an <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance">MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance</a>, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor; the film was nominated for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a>. With these nominations, Cooper became the tenth actor in history to receive an Academy Award nomination for acting in three consecutive years.

None of Cooper's films released in 2015—"<a href="Aloha%20%282015%20film%29">Aloha</a>", "<a href="Burnt%20%28film%29">Burnt</a>", or "<a href="Joy%20%28film%29">Joy</a>"—performed particularly well at the box office. He starred in <a href="Cameron%20Crowe">Cameron Crowe</a>'s "Aloha" with <a href="Emma%20Stone">Emma Stone</a> and <a href="Rachel%20McAdams">Rachel McAdams</a>. The project became controversial after the Media Action Network for Asian-Americans accused the filmmakers of <a href="Racebending">whitewashing</a> the cast. Despite the criticism, he was nominated for <a href="Teen%20Choice%20Award%20for%20Choice%20Movie%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Comedy">Choice Movie Actor – Comedy</a> at the <a href="2015%20Teen%20Choice%20Awards">2015 Teen Choice Awards</a>. In <a href="John%20Wells%20%28filmmaker%29">John Wells</a>' drama "Burnt", Cooper played a chef who decides to regain his former glory after <a href="drug%20abuse">drug abuse</a> takes a toll on his career. While the film was criticized for its "overdone clichés", Jon Frosch of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote of Cooper's performance, "the actor gives a fully engaged performance that almost makes us want to forgive the movie's laziness. Almost." His supporting role in the biopic "Joy" reunited him with David O. Russell and Lawrence. In 2016, he had a voice <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> in the thriller "<a href="10%20Cloverfield%20Lane">10 Cloverfield Lane</a>", and played a supporting part in "<a href="War%20Dogs%20%282016%20film%29">War Dogs</a>", co-produced under his and Todd Phillips's production company Joint Effort. In 2017, Cooper again voiced Rocket Raccoon, in "<a href="Guardians%20of%20the%20Galaxy%20Vol.%202">Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</a>". Cooper's films have earned a total of $7.8 billion worldwide.

After reprising the role of Rocket Raccoon in "" (2018), Cooper directed his first film, "<a href="A%20Star%20Is%20Born%20%282018%20film%29">A Star Is Born</a>", a remake of the 1937 <a href="A%20Star%20Is%20Born%20%281937%20film%29">musical film of same name</a>. Starring with <a href="Lady%20Gaga">Lady Gaga</a>, Cooper played an established singer, Jackson Maine, whose romance with a woman named Ally (played by Gaga) becomes strained after her career begins to overshadow his. Having long aspired to direct a film, Cooper was keen on making a love story. People had warned him against directing a third remake, and he feared that the film would end his directing career if it failed. It premiered at the <a href="75th%20Venice%20International%20Film%20Festival">75th Venice International Film Festival</a> in August 2018, and was released worldwide in October to critical acclaim. On Cooper's directing, Owen Gleibermann of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" wrote that "to say that [Cooper] does a good job would be to understate his accomplishment" and that he "gets right onto the high wire". Brian Tallerico, writing for critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a>'s website, found that Cooper "does some of the best work of his career as the kind of man who's always restless" and gives "an excellent performance", praising his singing abilities and his chemistry with Gaga. The film earned over $425 million at the box office against a production budget of $36 million.

Cooper and Gaga also co-wrote and produced most of the songs on the <a href="A%20Star%20Is%20Born%20%282018%20soundtrack%29">soundtrack for "A Star Is Born"</a>, which she insisted they record live. Cooper undertook vocal training for 18 months to prepare. The album contains elements of <a href="blues%20rock">blues rock</a>, <a href="country%20music">country</a> and <a href="bubblegum%20pop">bubblegum pop</a>. "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" says its lyrics are about wanting change, its struggle, love, romance, and bonding, describing the music as "timeless, emotional, gritty and earnest. They sound like songs written by artists who, quite frankly, are supremely messed up but hit to the core of the listener." The album's release coincided with the film's, and it contains 34 tracks, including 19 original songs. It received generally positive reviews from critics; Mark Kennedy of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" called it a "five-star marvel" and Ben Beaumont-Thomas of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" termed it an "instant classics full of Gaga's emotional might". Commercially, the soundtrack reached number-one in the US, Ireland and the UK. The record's lead single, "<a href="Shallow%20%28Lady%20Gaga%20and%20Bradley%20Cooper%20song%29">Shallow</a>", was released that September and has reached number one in the US, Australia, Ireland, Switzerland and the UK.

For the film, Cooper received a <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">National Board of Review Award for Best Director</a> and two Golden Globe nominations, for <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Drama">Best Actor in a Drama</a> and <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Director">Best Director</a>. Gaga and Cooper earned two <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy</a> nominations for "Shallow"—<a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Record%20of%20the%20Year">Record of the Year</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Duo/Group%20Performance">Best Pop Duo/Group Performance</a>, winning the latter. At the <a href="72nd%20British%20Academy%20Film%20Awards">72nd British Academy Film Awards</a>, "A Star Is Born" received seven nominations, five of which were for Cooper: <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">Best Film</a>, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Direction">Best Direction</a>, Best Actor in a Leading Role, <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a> and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Music">Best Film Music</a>, winning only the last of these. As a result, Cooper became the first person with five nominations in a single ceremony in BAFTA's history. Cooper was also nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Actor and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Adapted%20Screenplay">Best Adapted Screenplay</a>. He later remarked that he was "embarrassed" by his failure to gain a directing nomination at the ceremony.

Cooper next reunited with Clint Eastwood in "<a href="The%20Mule%20%282018%20film%29">The Mule</a>" (2018), a crime film based on the life of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> veteran <a href="Leo%20Sharp">Leo Sharp</a>. He is set to return as Rocket in the "", which will be released in 2019, and "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3", the release date of which is unknown after the firing of <a href="James%20Gunn">James Gunn</a>.

Cooper's early years in the entertainment industry were marred with difficulties. When his role in the <a href="Alias%20%28season%202%29">second season</a> of "Alias" was demoted to a minuscule part, he considered quitting show business. His substance addiction and doubts about his career triggered thoughts of suicide. Cooper has <a href="Teetotalism">abstained</a> from alcohol since 2004, remarking that it would have destroyed his life.

In October 2006, Cooper became engaged to actress <a href="Jennifer%20Esposito">Jennifer Esposito</a>. The couple married in December. In May 2007, Esposito filed for a divorce that was finalized in November. "It was just something that happened. The good thing is, we both realized it. Sometimes you just realize it", he has since explained. Before his marriage, he met <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Zellweger">Renée Zellweger</a> while filming "Case 39" in 2006. The media speculated about the nature of their relationship in 2009 when the film was released. Although they refused to speak about the romance, they made several appearances together, and in 2011, the media reported about the end of the relationship. In December 2011, he was involved in a romantic relationship with <a href="Zoe%20Saldana">Zoe Saldana</a> that ended in January 2013. In March 2013, he began dating English model <a href="Suki%20Waterhouse">Suki Waterhouse</a>; the relationship ended in March 2015. Cooper began a relationship with Russian model <a href="Irina%20Shayk">Irina Shayk</a> the following month. In November, he moved into her apartment in New York's West Village. In March 2017, Shayk gave birth to their daughter.

Two years after the death of his father from <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a> in 2011, he relocated to Los Angeles with his mother. He says that during his father's diagnosis: "I was in a very lucky position because I was able to put everything on hold in all aspects of my life and completely focus on taking care of him." He has described the process of his treatment as "just simply overwhelming, incredibly stressful, complex and all consuming."

Having grown up in Philadelphia, Cooper is a fan of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>'s <a href="Philadelphia%20Eagles">Eagles</a> and has made various appearances on behalf of the team besides his "Silver Linings Playbook" role. He voiced a snowball trying to make amends with <a href="Santa%20Claus">Santa Claus</a> in an <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> promo which referenced an infamous incident from the <a href="1968%20Philadelphia%20Eagles%20season">1968 Philadelphia Eagles season</a>, and has joined owner <a href="Jeffrey%20Lurie">Jeffrey Lurie</a> in his box at games, including the Eagles' <a href="Super%20Bowl%20LII">first Super Bowl victory</a> in 2018.

As part of a career analysis, <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a>'s Oliver Lyttelton notes that early in his career, Cooper was <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as "weaselly boyfriends or best friends in mainstream comedies", but he later became one of <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a>'s most accomplished actors after starring in several successful films. Cooper is known for appearing in a range of films; writing for "The Hollywood Reporter", Bill Phelps credits him for "opt[ing] for the challenging and provocative, the small and interesting, risking the laid-back image that propelled him to fame." "<a href="The%20Daily%20Beast">The Daily Beast</a>" Oliver Lyttelton agrees, remarking: "Cooper ... regularly ventures outside his grinning-stud comfort zone by taking on roles that, on the surface, might not necessarily seem like perfect matches." "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine writes of Cooper's craft: "It's hard to make people, especially your friends, forget who you are onscreen. But Bradley's that good." Cooper believes that his personality relates to acting: "I enjoy people, that makes this profession a lot easier, and I can sleep anywhere. That's a skill." He cites actor <a href="Daniel%20Day-Lewis">Daniel Day-Lewis</a> as an influence.
Cooper's <a href="sex%20appeal">sex appeal</a> has been noted by several media outlets including "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine, which named him Sexiest Man Alive in 2011. He was initially uncomfortable with the accolade, but later found it funny. Also in 2011, he was dubbed International Man of the Year by "<a href="GQ">GQ</a>" and appeared in <a href="AskMen">AskMen</a>'s 49 most influential men. He ranked tenth on "Empire" list of the 100 Sexiest Movie Stars in 2013.

"Time" magazine named him one of the <a href="Time%20100">100 most influential people in the world</a> in 2015.

Cooper supports organizations that help fight cancer. In June 2014, he joined the board of directors for the charity <a href="Hole%20in%20the%20Wall%20Gang%20Camp">Hole in the Wall Gang Camp</a>, a non-profit organization that serves people coping with cancer. In April 2016, he participated in the launch of the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy that works for cancer patients. He served as an executive producer for <a href="Stand%20Up%20to%20Cancer">Stand Up to Cancer</a>'s Fifth Biennial Telecast, a primetime fundraising <a href="television%20special">special</a> that aired in September.

In 2009, Cooper took part in an <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20Association">Alzheimer's Association</a> campaign that aimed to increase awareness about <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>. He is also one of the members of the Alzheimer's Association Celebrity Champions, an initiative launched for a similar purpose. In 2015, Cooper spoke at <a href="The%20National%20Geographic%20Society">The National Geographic Society</a> for the group Got Your 6 to help ensure military veterans are better represented in popular culture.

Don Valley Parkway

The Don Valley Parkway (DVP) is a <a href="Controlled-access%20highway">municipal expressway</a> in the Canadian city of <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Ontario, which connects the <a href="Gardiner%20Expressway">Gardiner Expressway</a> in <a href="downtown%20Toronto">downtown Toronto</a> with <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20401">Highway 401</a>. North of Highway 401, it continues as <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20404">Highway 404</a>. The parkway runs through the parklands of the <a href="Don%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Don River Valley</a>, after which it is named. It has a maximum speed limit of for its entire length of . It is six lanes for most of its length but it is eight lanes north of York Mills and four lanes south of Eastern. As a municipal road, it is patrolled by the <a href="Toronto%20Police%20Service">Toronto Police Service</a>.

The parkway was the second expressway to be built by <a href="Metropolitan%20Toronto">Metropolitan Toronto</a> (Metro). Planning began in 1954, the year of Metro's formation. The first section opened during 1961 and the entire route was completed by the end of 1966. South of Bloor Street, the expressway was constructed over existing roadways. North of Bloor Street, it was built on a new <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">alignment</a> through the valley, requiring the removal of several hills, diversion of the Don River and the clearing of woodland. North of Eglinton Avenue, the expressway follows the former Woodbine Avenue right-of-way north to Highway 401.

Traffic conditions on the parkway often exceed its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day. Today, some sections carry an average of 100,000 vehicles a day and have bumper-to-bumper traffic conditions during commuting hours. The parkway was planned to be one of two north-south expressways into downtown Toronto. The other was <a href="Cancelled%20expressways%20in%20Toronto">cancelled</a> due to public opposition, leaving the DVP as the sole north-south expressway into downtown. The parkway is also used by regional transit buses which can access designated lanes to pass slow-moving traffic.

The Don Valley Parkway begins at an interchange with the Gardiner Expressway near the mouth of the Don River in downtown Toronto. From there, it runs northwards on the eastern bank of the valley, between the river and the developed city to the east. Beyond the southern, older section of the city, the valley widens and the expressway continues northwards through the parklands along the river to Don Mills Road. The route leaves the valley, rises to meet Eglinton Avenue, descends into the valley again and goes through the park lands of Milne Hollow to Lawrence Avenue. It ascends to meet York Mills Road and ends at <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20401">Highway 401</a>.

At its southern end near the mouth of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level <a href="Lake%20Shore%20Boulevard">Lake Shore Boulevard</a> and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway. To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.

Less than north of the Gardiner, the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> (CNR)/<a href="GO%20Transit">GO</a> Toronto railway viaduct passes over the parkway. The interchange is constrained by that distance for the Gardiner—Don Valley two-lane ramps bridge the difference in height from ground-level under the viaduct with the height of the Gardiner. Acceleration and deceleration lanes for the Lake Shore—Don Valley ramps connect under the viaduct.

From the viaduct, the parkway proceeds north as a four-lane highway on a straight course along the east bank of the channelized Don River, passing beneath <a href="Eastern%20Avenue%20%28Toronto%29">Eastern Avenue</a> and veering slightly to the east as it passes below <a href="Queen%20Street%20East">Queen Street East</a>.
On- and off-ramps project northward from Eastern Avenue, each adding a lane to both carriageways. The expressway continues northward, with the Don River sandwiched between the highway and <a href="Bayview%20Avenue">Bayview Avenue</a>. The Parkway passes beneath <a href="Dundas%20Street">Dundas</a> and Gerrard Streets and rises onto the 'Don Flats' plateau at <a href="Riverdale%20Park%20%28Toronto%29">Riverdale Park</a>. In this section, the elevation of the highway is close to the level of the river and is liable to flood after heavy rains, as occurred in June 2010, for example.

North from Riverdale Park, the valley widens considerably. The expressway rises from the floor of the valley and passes beneath the towering <a href="Prince%20Edward%20Viaduct">Prince Edward Viaduct</a> bridge, which connects <a href="Bloor%20Street">Bloor Street</a> with Danforth Avenue and carries a <a href="Rapid%20transit">subway</a> line.
The highway runs along the eastern wall of the valley for the next several kilometres, rising and dipping repeatedly.
The expressway curves eastward into a cut in the hillside as it passes the 'Half-mile' railway bridge. Immediately to the north, it meets the Bayview Avenue–Bloor Street interchange. The long off-ramp to these roads was the original southern terminus of the parkway in 1961.
The off-ramp was later proposed as the eastern terminus of the proposed <a href="Crosstown%20Expressway%20%28Toronto%29">Crosstown Expressway</a>. This expressway, opposed by the <a href="Old%20Toronto">City of Toronto</a>, was never built:
it was intended for construction only after the completion of the <a href="Spadina%20Expressway">Spadina Expressway</a>, which itself was cancelled in 1971.

Just north of the Bayview–Bloor interchange, the expressway passes over Pottery Road. To the east is <a href="Todmorden%20Mills">Todmorden Mills</a>, a collection of historic buildings and a former industrial site, the original "Don Mills". The nearby pond was a section of the Don River cut off by the parkway construction. Further north, to the west where the highway crosses Beechwood Avenue, is <a href="Crothers%20Woods">Crothers Woods</a>, a restoration site.

The expressway continues due east along the southern edge of the valley. The opposing lanes split as the expressway passes beneath the <a href="Leaside%20Bridge">Leaside Bridge</a>, the southbound lanes at a lower level. The lanes rejoin as they approach the <a href="Don%20Mills%20Road">Don Mills Road</a> interchange at the "forks of the Don". Just east of the Don Mills Road interchange, several large white sculptures resembling human teeth are installed on both sides of the road. The sculptures, called "The Elevated Wetlands", are examples of <a href="environmental%20art">"eco-art"</a> and have become a landmark. The sculptures resemble concrete but are made of plastic and filled with waste plastic and wetland plants. The sculptures function as a water filter, removing pollutants from the Don River. A solar-powered pump lifts water to the top of the sculpture and it is returned to the Don after filtration. The sculptures were installed in 1998 and the wetland plants added in 1999.

The expressway crosses <a href="Taylor-Massey%20Creek">Taylor-Massey Creek</a> and the East Don River, and climbs out of the valley, swinging northwards toward <a href="Eglinton%20Avenue">Eglinton Avenue</a>. In this section, the DVP passes around the apartment buildings of <a href="Flemingdon%20Park">Flemingdon Park</a>. The lanes split again before the underpass at Spanbridge Road, the road that connects a three-tower complex of apartments to the east of the parkway with Flemingdon Park to the west. The lanes pass beneath the <a href="Gatineau%20Hydro%20Corridor">Gatineau Hydro Corridor</a> and reconnect south of the Eglinton interchange.

As it crosses Eglinton, the expressway passes a <a href="business%20park">business park</a> to the west and the Concorde Place commercial and condominium development to the east. The expressway begins to descend back into the East Don Valley. It passes beneath Wynford Drive and two railways (the CPR Midtown line and the CNR/<a href="Richmond%20Hill%20line">Richmond Hill GO line</a>) before reaching <a href="Lawrence%20Avenue">Lawrence Avenue East</a>, one of the few remaining cloverleaf interchanges in Ontario.
This area, known as Milne Hollow, is partially forested, some of the land being conservation reserve.
Passing beneath Lawrence and back over the East Don River, the expressway begins climbing out of the valley once more. It reaches the top of the valley and curves along a plateau before passing over <a href="York%20Mills%20Road">York Mills Road</a>. Residential sub-divisions are present along both sides of the road, isolated from the expressway by noise barriers, from north of Lawrence to the Highway 401 interchange.
After rising to meet the interchange, it widens to four lanes and splits into two branches: two lanes continuing north as Highway 404, and the three others as Highway 401.

The entire length of the parkway uses the RESCU Traffic Management System, which was installed in 1994.
Like the similar <a href="Freeway%20Traffic%20Management%20System">COMPASS</a> system on provincial freeways, RESCU combines in-pavement sensors with traffic cameras and changeable message signs (6 fixed and 10 portable) to alert drivers of accidents, traffic conditions and upcoming closures. The system is used as a means of managing traffic flow along the parkway. The message signs also frequently display non-urgent messages to motorists, such as notices for future construction, safety messages and smog alerts.

The RESCU Traffic Cameras are located at regular intervals along the parkway. The cameras, which are operated by the City of Toronto, can be viewed on television and online. The cameras are located on poles and are fixed in direction. There are 16 camera locations on the parkway. Most have one camera for northbound and one for southbound traffic. RESCU operators monitor the cameras for emergency purposes; local radio and television media use the service for traffic reports.

The Don Valley Parkway, along with the <a href="Gardiner%20Expressway">Gardiner Expressway</a>, is one of Toronto's busiest municipal routes. It is the sole north–south expressway into Toronto's downtown, a role it was not designed to support. The parkway was planned as one of a series of expressways to provide commuter routes to downtown from the expanding suburbs. Two other un-built expressways were planned: the <a href="Scarborough%20Expressway">Scarborough Expressway</a>, expected to handle traffic between downtown and the eastern suburbs, and the Spadina Expressway, expected to serve traffic from the north-west.
By the early 1980s, traffic volumes on the parkway exceeded capacity, and today, the parkway has significant <a href="traffic%20congestion">traffic congestion</a> on most days. During the morning commute, commuters fill the southbound lanes as far south as Bloor Street. In the afternoon/evening commute, commuters fill the northbound lanes from Bloor Street, and often the full length of the highway in event of a collision or other hazard. The daily congestion has earned the highway the quasi-affectionate nickname of the "Don Valley Parking Lot".

The section immediately south of Highway 401 is often congested at all hours. Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes to the number of lanes merging from Highways 401 and 404 into the parkway and the lane changing that results from merging traffic from Highway 401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit. Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway 401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway 404, but only two of the five lanes lead to it.

The construction of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both near the mouth of the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The construction of the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the <a href="Don%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Don River</a>. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.

The Don River valley, formed during the last ice age, has played an important role in the development of Toronto from its beginning as the <a href="York%2C%20Upper%20Canada">Town of York</a>. Using the power of the river, the first sawmill was erected at today's Todmorden Mills by 1795 and other industry was founded soon after, including a grist mill, paper mill and brewery by 1828. Railways were introduced into the valley after 1850 with the building of tracks into Toronto. By 1900, the Don River south of today's Bloor Street was straightened into a channel for boating purposes, with roadways and industry built on both banks.
North of Bloor Street, the wide valley floor became dominated by industrial concerns of the Taylor family, including the <a href="Don%20Valley%20Brick%20Works">Don Valley Brick Works</a>. The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s. The forests of the Don valley had been where Canadian naturalist <a href="Ernest%20Thompson%20Seton">Ernest Thompson Seton</a> spent much of his youth in the 1870s studying animal life.

The Don Valley Parkway was not the first highway planned through the valley. In the 1930s, a "speedway" through the lower valley was promoted as possible depression relief. Unlike today's parkway, this road would have curved northwest near the Don Valley Brick Works and connected to Mount Pleasant at Davisville. The city did not have the money and appealed to 'civic-minded citizens' to donate the land on which the highway would be built. None came forward. In 1939, city transportation planner Norman Wilson proposed a boulevard that would follow the valley into the northeast. On January 1, 1946, Toronto voters approved the building of a 'Don Valley Traffic Artery' following the same route as the "speedway" by a vote of 31,882 to 12,328. This was the same <a href="Referendum">plebiscite</a> where Toronto voters approved the construction of the <a href="Line%201%20Yonge%E2%80%93University">Yonge segment of Line 1</a>. The City then borrowed $1.5 million to finance the project. In 1949, the Official Plan of the City of Toronto updated the Don Valley Roadway plan to include two branches—one to the north-west which would eventually become the Crosstown Expressway proposal, and one to the north-east leading to O'Connor Drive. The original plan to connect to St. Clair remained. East York Township opposed construction of the north-east roadway. The City started the first section of this route from Eastern Avenue south to Keating Street in 1949, but had to suspend work in 1951 due to a lack of steel.

Recognizing the value of the natural spaces of the valley, conservationists such as <a href="Charles%20Sauriol">Charles Sauriol</a> founded the Don Valley Conservation Association, in 1948 to assist the provincial Don Valley Conservation Authority (DVCA) itself founded in 1946. The Association promoted conservation of the valley with rail tours and public events. In 1951, the Ontario Department of Planning and Development released its "Don Valley Conservation Report", which recommended the preservation of the valley, including an artificial reservoir where Lawrence Avenue crossed the Don River. It also proposed that the valley not be used for any new major transportation routes. The DVCA adopted the report and budgeted to buy lands in the valley, but the City of Toronto withheld funding to the DVCA for land purchases.
In April 1953, the <a href="Metropolitan%20Toronto">Metropolitan Toronto</a> (Metro) federation was approved and <a href="Fred%20Gardiner">Fred Gardiner</a> was named as its first chairman. Its mission from the start was to build the infrastructure needed to support the rapidly growing suburbs, whose governments could not afford the projects and often disagreed on joint projects. One of its first priorities was to build the Lakeshore Expressway, and its second road priority was an expressway through the Don River valley. Gardiner was a major proponent of building a highway through the valley, since his days in the 1940s with the Toronto and York Planning Board. At the time, engineers felt that building a six-lane roadway was unfeasible due to the two large hills and a narrow valley. Gardiner and T&Y Board (and later Metro Planning Board) chairman James Maher personally walked the route through the valley, determining the works that would be needed to put the highway through. "We'll move the railway over a piece. We'll tear down the hill. We'll shift the river over a piece, then we can have the highway through there." Gardiner toured New York City in June 1954 to study the city's expressways and municipal parking lots. Gardiner compared the proposed Don Valley expressway to the scenic <a href="Grand%20Central%20Parkway">Grand Central Parkway</a>, and was quoted as claiming that valleys like the Don are not spoiled by arterial highways, but beautified by them. The first Metro staff survey and feasibility study of the parkway's route was approved in late 1953, before the Metro government itself came into being in 1954.

In October 1954, flooding caused by <a href="Effects%20of%20Hurricane%20Hazel%20in%20Canada%23Don%20River">Hurricane Hazel</a> caused the destruction of bridges and buildings in the valley. As a consequence of the destruction on the Don and other rivers, the provincial government of Ontario banned development on river floodplains. In 1957, the <a href="Toronto%20and%20Region%20Conservation%20Authority">Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority</a> (MTRCA) was formed, merging all conservation authorities responsible for Toronto watersheds (including the DVCA), with greater powers to manage valley lands. The MTRCA began <a href="eminent%20domain">expropriating</a> privately owned land in the valley for flood control, often creating or conserving open space uses. Sauriol, who was by then an employee of the MTRCA, was one of the few to speak out against the parkway project. Sauriol's cottage at the Forks of the Don would be expropriated by Metro Toronto for the parkway, although much of his land is now part of the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which extends from the Forks of the Don, along the East Don to Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue, visible from the parkway. By contrast, Metro chairman Gardiner had an opposite opinion of the Don Valley and was quoted "I'll tell you what the Don Valley was. It was a place to murder little boys, that's what it was."

The design of the project was contracted to the engineering consortium of Fenco-Harris, which completed the plans in the fall of 1955. The project included extending Bayview Avenue south along the Lower Don valley, which replaced the 'north' arm of the previous Don Valley roadway project, and the realignment of Lawrence Avenue over the East Don River. The design for the section north of the Don River mouth incorporated the existing river-side Don Roadway on the east side of the River. The design also incorporated a section of the old Don Mills Road leading up from the River, north of Gerrard, to Broadview Avenue and Danforth Avenue into the highway as a northbound on-ramp from Danforth. The project was designed to carry 60,000 vehicles per day. Fenco-Harris designed the route to be "located on public lands as much as possible, thus minimizing the expropriation of private property. Greenbelt land has been used for right-of-way in preference to acreage which can be commercially developed." The route required the expropriation of less than 25 properties.

The first planned route of the parkway was to follow the lower Don Valley before turning north and continuing along the Don Mills Road <a href="Right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> north to the Toronto Bypass (today's Highway 401). <a href="E.%20P.%20Taylor">Edward P. Taylor</a>, developer of the <a href="Don%20Mills">Don Mills</a> subdivision, situated at Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue, protested the plan heavily and the path was rerouted along the CPR railway from Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue north-east to meet the Woodbine Avenue right-of-way at Lawrence Avenue, and proceeded north to the Toronto Bypass. To facilitate the Flemingdon Park development, located south-east of Don Mills Road and Eglinton, the entire planned route south of Lawrence to the present interchange at Don Mills Road was moved east to its current alignment.

The plan, estimated to cost C$28.674 million,
was approved by Metro Council in early 1956.
Formal approval to build came in 1958
and construction of the parkway began. A stumbling block to construction was resolved by a deal between Metro and the City of Toronto over City-owned parklands needed for the parkway. North of Bloor Street, of City-owned land would be transferred to Metro and any lands not needed for the parkway would be developed as parks by Metro. South of Bloor Street, Metro agreed to replace any recreation facilities lost in Riverdale Park due to the parkway construction. The City had threatened to not allow construction through City-owned land.

The first section of the parkway, from Bloor Street to Eglinton Avenue, was opened on August 31, 1961, by Ontario Premier <a href="Leslie%20Frost">Leslie Frost</a> and Metro chairman Gardiner, who presented Frost with a silver plate.
It opened initially without an interchange at Don Mills Road and had its first traffic jam that day at the Eglinton Avenue exit.
The interchange at Don Mills was approved by Metro council on November 2, 1964.
Building the section within the valley required significant civil engineering, including the rerouting of of the Don River, installation of of reinforced retaining wall
and the removal of two hills. Tumper's Hill, located near the Don Mills Road interchange, stood higher than it does today.
Sugar Loaf Hill, shaped like a cone, which stood alone in the shadow of the Prince Edward Viaduct where Bayview Avenue passes today, was removed completely. The of earth was used as fill for the parkway and a total of of earth was excavated and moved.
Besides modification of the natural landscape, the route required relocation and demolition of utilities and residences. Metro relocated of CNR and CPR railway tracks in the section from Bloor Street to Chester Hill Road to make way for the parkway.
The Todmorden sewage treatment plant, built in 1926, was also demolished.
The route required the removal of five homes on Minton Place located above the valley to facilitate the cut of the valley hillside. Four were demolished and one moved to <a href="Scarborough%2C%20Toronto">Scarborough</a>.

Construction of the section from Eglinton Avenue to Lawrence Avenue began on July 1, 1961, and it was opened to traffic in the evening of October 30, 1963, without any ceremony. The segment connected to Woodbine Avenue north of Lawrence Avenue, cutting off access to Woodbine from Lawrence Avenue. Northbound parkway traffic could continue north on Woodbine Avenue, then a two-lane road, from the parkway up to Highway 401. The section cost $2.723 million to complete.

The third section to open was from Bloor Street to the Gardiner Expressway. This section involved the removal of CPR rail sidings on the eastern bank of the Don from Eastern Avenue north. Royal Drive, which was a two-way road that connected with Bloor Street between Broadview Avenue and the Viaduct was re-purposed into a one-way north-bound on-ramp. A pedestrian overpass bridge was constructed to connect the east and west sections of Riverdale Park. The section opened in conjunction with the section of the expressway from the parkway to York Street on November 6, 1964. It was opened ceremonially by Ontario Premier <a href="John%20Robarts">John Robarts</a>.

The final section, from Lawrence Avenue to Sheppard Avenue was opened chaotically to traffic in the afternoon on November 17, 1966, but forced drivers to exit onto Highway 401; construction inspectors were not aware that the parkway was scheduled to open until they arrived on site that morning.
The section north of Highway 401 remained unopened until March 1, 1967, due to ongoing construction of the Sheppard Avenue bridge.
The final cost of the project was $40 million ($ in dollars).

In 1965, Metro Toronto Chief Coroner <a href="Morton%20Shulman">Morton Shulman</a> released a report criticizing the lack of safety in the design of the parkway.
In the first five months of 1965, there were 136 accidents on the parkway, with four deaths and 86 injuries. Among the "death-dealing" deficiencies that had to be corrected were inadequate guardrails, exposed steep slopes and <a href="street%20light">light standards</a> that were exposed to collision from passing high-speed traffic. Call boxes with emergency telephones were installed on the parkway in 1966.
The boxes, attached to street lighting on the right shoulder, provided a direct line for help from the Ontario Motor League, now part of the <a href="Canadian%20Automobile%20Association">Canadian Automobile Association</a> (CAA). Today, the <a href="Road%20Emergency%20Services%20Communications%20Unit">RESCU</a> Traffic Management System monitors the highway and can call for emergency help.

On April 18, 1969, the slope behind Davies Crescent (just west of Don Mills Road) <a href="landslide">gave way</a> after heavy rain, covering the northbound lanes and part of the southbound lanes with up to of mud. There were only minor injuries. The slope, which had had its trees removed for the building of the expressway, was covered with sod and stakes to hold the soil.

In the late 1980s, a new partial-access interchange was built at Wynford Drive to provide access between the parkway and the Concorde Place development. The new partial-access interchange was paid for by the developers.
The ramp connecting Wynford with the northbound parkway required a tunnel under the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> (CPR) Midtown railway lines. To avoid delaying trains on the vital freight line, a prefabricated concrete arch was jacked into the embankment, at a time, over 12 days. This was the first North American use of such a technique.
From 1986 to 1988, the City studied traffic congestion in the 'Don Valley Corridor', an area from Leslie Street east to <a href="Victoria%20Park%20Avenue">Victoria Park Avenue</a>. To improve traffic in the area, the proposed solutions were extending Leslie Street south of Eglinton Avenue and south-west to Bayview Avenue; widening Don Mills Road; and expanding the parkway.
Two proposals were put forward for approval: the Leslie Street extension and widening of Don Mills Road. Don Mills Road was widened from four to six lanes with the new lanes to be high occupancy/bus lanes.
The Leslie Street extension was approved by East York and North York, but was abandoned by Metro Council in 1993, after the provincial government refused to subsidize its construction.

In 1989, a public meeting was held on the future of the Don River, which was widely known for its pollution, and the Don Valley, considered an "industrial wasteland" and which had seen its last industrial use (the Taylor, later Domtar, Paper Mill) close in 1982. The Toronto City Council formed the "Task Force to Bring Back the Don", an organization of volunteers to work on conservation efforts in the Don Valley. Since that time, the task force has planted some 40,000 trees in the valley, planted thousands of wildflowers and overseen the creation of wetlands along the river. Efforts continue to ameliorate the water quality of the river and improve the environment of the surrounding valley lands. These efforts can be seen in the "Crother's Woods" north of Bloor Street and the Chester Marsh just south of Bloor Street, alongside the parkway.

In 1994, the overpass bridge over Pottery Road, north of the Bayview/Bloor interchange was rebuilt. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of columns and a restructuring of the deck. It was worn down due to the cumulative effect of heavy traffic and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several lanes of the parkway from April until the autumn that year.

In 2001, Toronto City Councillor Paul Sutherland proposed to add two toll lanes in each direction along the parkway, from Highway 401 to Eglinton Avenue. From Eglinton Avenue south, one lane in each direction would be added. The proposal was criticized by transportation experts such as Transport 2000 for encouraging driving to downtown. Sutherland estimated the cost of the proposal at $200 million.

On May 11, 2007, GO Transit announced a plan to put dedicated <a href="bus%20lane">bus lane</a>s on the centre median of the parkway, to allow its buses to bypass traffic congestion and promote buses as an alternative to automobiles. The $12 million plan would be paid for by GO. The plan would require testing of soil conditions and an environmental assessment.
GO Transit was taken over by the provincial <a href="Metrolinx">Metrolinx</a> transit agency, and the plan did not appear in the 2008 "Big Move" Regional Transportation Plan of Metrolinx.
A second proposal, to allow GO Transit buses to use the left shoulder to pass slow traffic was approved in June 2010 by <a href="Toronto%20City%20Council">Toronto City Council</a>.
The centre median shoulders, starting with the section between Lawrence Avenue and a point north of York Mills Road, are opened to GO Transit buses to pass other traffic, at no more than faster, when the other traffic is going at or less.
These lanes opened to buses beginning September 7, 2010.
City Council directed the General Manager of Transportation Services to report on the feasibility of future bus bypass lanes in the segments from Pottery Road to Don Mills Road and between Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue East.

On June 7, 2010, a section of the expressway was dedicated by former Toronto mayor <a href="David%20Miller%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">David Miller</a> as part of the "Route of Heroes". Similar to the "Highway of Heroes" designation of part of Highway 401, the designation serves to honour fallen Canadian soldiers. The designation applies to the portion of the parkway between Highway 401 and Bloor Street by which repatriation processions travel when transporting the remains of Canadian soldiers from <a href="CFB%20Trenton">CFB Trenton</a> to the Office of the Coroner in downtown Toronto (but since September 27, 2013 all future repatriation travels to the new Centre of Forensic Sciences at Keele Street near Wilson Avenue)

The lower section of the roadway from the Gardiner Expressway to south of Gerrard Street East has been flooded by overflowing water from the Don River on more than one occasion. This section of the Parkway was closed in 1986 and twice in 2013 due to flooding.

During the 2010 <a href="Toronto%20municipal%20election%2C%202010">municipal election</a>, mayoral candidate <a href="Sarah%20Thomson%20%28publisher%29">Sarah Thomson</a> proposed a road toll for the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway, drawing comments from critics and supporters across the city.

Two projects are underway that may change the parkway's southern end. <a href="Waterfront%20Toronto">Waterfront Toronto</a> is conducting an environmental assessment to evaluate replacing, modifying or removing the Gardiner Expressway east of Jarvis Street.
The parkway would then end at Lake Shore Boulevard. The City of Toronto eventually decided to keep the Gardiner–Don Valley Parkway connection, with revised ramps. A second proposal, known as the "Don Mouth Naturalization and Port Lands Flood Protection" project, seeks to recreate the natural mouth of the Don River into Toronto Harbour with the surrounding parkland. The project is managed by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and Waterfront Toronto.
The ramps between the parkway and the Gardiner Expressway pass directly over the Don River channel.

A third project, the "Don River Valley Park" to link all of the open space from the Toronto Brick Works south to the harbour, has proposed changes that will impact the highway. The first is the replacement of the current Bayview–Bloor interchange roadways to free up green space. The second is the relocation of rail lines on the west bank of the Don River to the east bank. A third is a new land bridge over the highway joining the two sections of Riverdale Park.

In late 2016, the City of Toronto and mayor <a href="John%20Tory">John Tory</a> considered imposing a toll to use the highway, along with the Gardiner Expressway, to cover the maintenance costs of the highway and support public transit construction.
However, the plan was rejected by the Ontario government.

The music video for the song <a href="Subdivisions%20%28song%29">Subdivisions</a> by Canadian rock group <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a> features scenes of the DVP

The song "DVP" by <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> group <a href="Pup%20%28band%29">PUP</a> is named after the Don Valley Parkway, and its lyrics include references to the parkway.

Set in 1914, the film tells the story of a young man who gains possession of a sacred book, which he believes will guide him and a crew of mercenaries to the lost city of <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>.

Development of the film began after production had finished on "<a href="The%20Hunchback%20of%20Notre%20Dame%20%281996%20film%29">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a>" (1996). Instead of another <a href="Musical%20film">musical</a>, the production team decided to do an action-adventure film inspired by the works of <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>. "Atlantis" was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator <a href="Mike%20Mignola">Mike Mignola</a>. At the time of its release, the film had made greater use of <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> (CGI) than any of Disney's previous traditionally animated features; it remains one of the few to have been shot in <a href="anamorphic%20format">anamorphic format</a>. <a href="Linguistics">Linguist</a> <a href="Marc%20Okrand">Marc Okrand</a> created a <a href="Atlantean%20language">language</a> specifically for use in "Atlantis", with <a href="James%20Newton%20Howard">James Newton Howard</a> providing the film's score. The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from <a href="hand-drawn%20animation">hand-drawn animation</a> toward films with full CGI.

"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" premiered at the <a href="El%20Capitan%20Theatre">El Capitan Theatre</a> in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20California">Hollywood, California</a> on June 3, 2001, and went into general release on June 15. Released by <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Walt Disney Pictures</a>, "Atlantis" performed modestly at the box office. Budgeted at around , the film grossed over worldwide, of which was earned in North America. Due to the film's lackluster box office performance, Disney quietly canceled both a spin-off television series and an underwater attraction at its <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> theme park. Some critics praised it as a unique departure from typical Disney animated features, while others disliked it due to the unclear target audience and absence of songs. "Atlantis" was nominated for a number of awards, including seven <a href="Annie%20Award">Annie Award</a>s, and won Best Sound Editing at the 2002 <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Sound%20Editors">Golden Reel Awards</a>. The film was released on VHS and DVD on January 29, 2002; the <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> released on June 11, 2013. "Atlantis" is considered to be a <a href="Cult%20film">cult favorite</a>, due in part to Mignola's unique artistic influence. A direct-to-video sequel, "", was released in 2003.

Many centuries ago, a <a href="tsunami">tsunami</a> threatens to drown the island of <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>. In the midst of an evacuation from the capital city, the Queen of Atlantis is caught by a strange, hypnotic blue light and lifted up into the "Heart of Atlantis", a powerful crystal protecting the city. The crystal consumes her and creates a dome barrier that protects the city's innermost district. She leaves behind her young daughter, Princess Kida, as the island sinks beneath the ocean. Her husband, King Kashekim Nedakh, is blinded during the event as he protects Kida from the light

In 1914, Milo Thatch, a cartographer and linguist at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> who is marginalized for his research on Atlantis, believes that he has found The Shepherd's Journal, an ancient manuscript that contains directions to the lost island. Though the museum board declines his proposal to search for the journal, a mysterious woman, Helga Sinclair, introduces Milo to Preston B. Whitmore, an eccentric millionaire. Whitmore has already funded a successful effort to retrieve the journal as repayment of a debt to Milo's grandfather, recruiting Milo to lead an expedition to Atlantis, as soon as he receives it. Whitmore also builds a <a href="mercenary">mercenary</a> task force 200 - strong, equipped with military grade weapons and munitions.

The expedition departs with a team of specialists led by Commander Lyle Rourke, who also led the journal recovery expedition. They set out in the "Ulysses", a massive <a href="submarine">submarine</a>. During the journey, they are attacked by the monstrous <a href="Leviathan">Leviathan</a>, a robotic lobster-like creature that guards Atlantis' entrance. The "Ulysses" is subsequently destroyed, but Milo, Rourke, and part of the crew escape to a cavern, described in the journal as the entrance to Atlantis.

After traveling through a network of caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis, where they are greeted by Kida. However, Kida's father, the King of Atlantis, is not pleased with the team's visit, but agrees with Rourke for a one-night stay. Kida enlists Milo in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By diving deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn around their necks. He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.

Returning to the surface with Kida, Milo discovers Rourke has the missing page. Rourke and the crew betray Milo, intending to bring the crystal to the surface and sell it. Rourke mortally wounds the King while trying to extract information about the crystal's location, but finds it himself hidden beneath the King's throne room. The crystal detects a threat and merges with Kida, whom Rourke and the mercenaries lock in a crate, and then prepare to leave the city. Knowing that when the crystal is gone the Atlanteans will die, Milo berates the crew for betraying their consciences, and ultimately convinces them to leave Rourke and remain in Atlantis. The King explains to Milo that the crystal has developed a consciousness; it thrives on the collective emotions of the Atlanteans and will find a royal host when Atlantis is in danger. He then reveals that the sinking of Atlantis was caused when he attempted to use it as a weapon of war. As he dies, he gives his crystal to Milo, telling him to save Atlantis and Kida. Milo rallies the crew and Atlanteans to stop Rourke.

In the ensuing battle inside the volcano, Helga, Rourke and his mercenaries are all killed. Milo and the others successfully retrieve and fly the crystal back to the city, as the volcano erupts. With lava flowing towards the city, Kida (in her crystal form) rises into the air and creates a <a href="Force%20field%20%28fiction%29">protective shield</a>. The lava freezes and breaks away harmlessly, showing a restored Atlantis, and the crystal returns Kida to Milo. The surviving crew members return to the surface and promise to keep the discovery of Atlantis a secret. Having fallen in love with Kida, Milo becomes the new king of Atlantis, along with Kida as the new queen, and stays behind to help her rebuild the lost empire.


The idea for "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was conceived in October 1996 when <a href="Don%20Hahn">Don Hahn</a>, <a href="Gary%20Trousdale">Gary Trousdale</a>, <a href="Kirk%20Wise">Kirk Wise</a>, and Tab Murphy lunched at a Mexican restaurant in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>. Having recently completed "<a href="The%20Hunchback%20of%20Notre%20Dame%20%281996%20film%29">The Hunchback of Notre Dame</a>" the producer and directors wanted to keep the "Hunchback" crew together for another film with an <a href="Adventureland%20%28Disney%29">Adventureland</a> setting. Drawing inspiration from <a href="Jules%20Verne">Jules Verne</a>'s "<a href="A%20Journey%20to%20the%20Center%20of%20the%20Earth">A Journey to the Center of the Earth</a>" (1864), they set out to make a film which would fully explore <a href="Atlantis">Atlantis</a> (compared to the brief visit depicted in Verne's novel). While primarily utilizing the Internet to research the mythology of Atlantis, the filmmakers became interested in the <a href="Clairvoyance">clairvoyant</a> readings of <a href="Edgar%20Cayce">Edgar Cayce</a> and decided to incorporate some of his ideas—notably that of a mother-crystal which provides power, healing, and longevity to the Atlanteans—into the story. They also visited museums and old army installations to study the technology of the early 20th century (the film's time period), and traveled 800 feet underground in New Mexico's Carlsbad Caverns to view the subterranean trails which would serve as a model for the approach to Atlantis in the film.

The filmmakers wanted to avoid the common depiction of Atlantis as "crumbled Greek columns underwater", said Wise. "From the get-go, we were committed to designing it top to bottom. Let's get the architectural style, clothing, heritage, customs, how they would sleep, and how they would speak. So we brought people on board who would help us develop those ideas." Art director David Goetz stated, "We looked at <a href="Mayan%20architecture">Mayan architecture</a>, styles of ancient, unusual architecture from around the world, and the directors really liked the look of Southeast Asian architecture." The team later took ideas from other architectural forms, including <a href="Cambodian%20architecture">Cambodian</a>, <a href="Indian%20architecture">Indian</a>, and <a href="Architecture%20in%20Tibet">Tibetan</a> works. Hahn added, "If you take and deconstruct architecture from around the world into one architectural vocabulary, that's what our Atlantis looks like." The overall design and <a href="concentric%20circles">circular</a> layout of Atlantis were also based on the writings of <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, and his quote "in a single day and night of misfortune, the island of Atlantis disappeared into the depths of the sea" was influential from the beginning of production. The crew wore <a href="T-shirt">T-shirt</a>s which read "ATLANTIS—Fewer songs, more explosions" due the film's plan as an <a href="Adventure%20film">action-adventure</a> (unlike previous Disney animated features, which were <a href="Musical%20film">musicals</a>).

<a href="Marc%20Okrand">Marc Okrand</a>, who developed the <a href="Klingon%20language">Klingon language</a> for the "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>" films, was hired to devise the Atlantean language for "Atlantis: The Lost Empire". Guided by the directors' initial concept for it to be a "<a href="Proto-language">mother-language</a>", Okrand employed an <a href="Indo-European%20languages">Indo-European</a> word stock with its own <a href="Grammar">grammatical structure</a>. He would change the words if they began to sound too much like an actual, spoken language. John Emerson designed the written component, making hundreds of random sketches of individual letters from among which the directors chose the best to represent the Atlantean alphabet. The written language was <a href="boustrophedon">boustrophedon</a>: designed to be read left-to-right on the first line, then right-to-left on the second, continuing in a zigzag pattern to simulate the flow of water.

<a href="Joss%20Whedon">Joss Whedon</a> was the first writer to be involved with the film but soon left to work on other Disney projects. According to him, he "had not a shred" in the movie. <a href="Tab%20Murphy">Tab Murphy</a> completed the screenplay, stating that the time from initially discussing the story to producing a script that satisfied the film crew was "about three to four months". The initial draft was 155 pages, much longer than a typical Disney film script (which usually runs 90 pages). When the first two acts were timed at 120 minutes, the directors cut characters and sequences and focused more on Milo. Murphy said that he created the centuries-old "Shepherd's Journal" because he needed a map for the characters to follow throughout their journey. A revised version of the script eliminated the trials encountered by the explorers as they navigated the caves to Atlantis. This gave the film a faster pace because Atlantis is discovered earlier in the story.

The character of Milo J. Thatch was originally supposed to be a descendant of Edward Teach, otherwise known as <a href="Blackbeard">Blackbeard</a> the pirate. The directors later related him to an explorer so he would discover his inner talent for exploration. The character of Molière was originally intended to be "professorial" but Chris Ure, a story artist, changed the concept to that of a "horrible little burrowing creature with a wacky coat and strange headgear with extending eyeballs", said Wise. Don Hahn pointed out that the absence of songs presented a challenge for a team accustomed to animating musicals, as solely action scenes would have to carry the film. Kirk Wise said it gave the team an opportunity for more on-screen character development: "We had more screen time available to do a scene like where Milo and the explorers are camping out and learning about one another's histories. An entire sequence is devoted to having dinner and going to bed. That is not typically something we would have the luxury of doing."

Hahn stated that the first animated sequence completed during production was the film's <a href="prologue">prologue</a>. The original version featured a <a href="Viking">Viking</a> war party using "The Shepherd's Journal" to find Atlantis and being swiftly dispatched by the Leviathan. Near the end of production, story supervisor Jon Sanford told the directors that he felt this prologue did not give viewers enough emotional involvement with the Atlanteans. Despite knowing that the Viking prologue was finished and it would cost additional time and money to alter the scene, the directors agreed with Sanford. Trousdale went home and completed the <a href="storyboards">storyboards</a> later that evening. The opening was replaced by a sequence depicting the destruction of Atlantis, which introduced the film from the perspective of the Atlanteans and Princess Kida. The Viking prologue is included as an extra feature on the .

At the peak of its production, 350 animators, artists and technicians were working on "Atlantis" at all three Disney animation studios: <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Animation%20Studios">Walt Disney Feature Animation</a> (<a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank, California</a>), <a href="Animation%20studios%20owned%20by%20The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company%23Walt%20Disney%20Feature%20Animation%20Florida">Disney Feature Animation Florida</a> (<a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando</a>), and <a href="Animation%20studios%20owned%20by%20The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company%23Disney%20Animation%20France">Disney Animation France</a> (Paris). The film was one of the few Disney animated features produced and shot in <a href="70%20mm%20film">70mm</a> <a href="anamorphic%20format">anamorphic format</a>. The directors felt that a widescreen image was crucial, as a nostalgic reference to old action-adventure films presented in the <a href="CinemaScope">CinemaScope</a> format (2.35:1), noting "<a href="Raiders%20of%20the%20Lost%20Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>" as an inspiration. Because switching to the format would require animation desks and equipment designed for widescreen to be purchased, Disney executives were at first reluctant about the idea. The production team found a simple solution by drawing within a smaller frame on the same paper and equipment used for standard <a href="aspect%20ratio%20%28image%29">aspect ratio</a> (1.66:1) Disney-animated films. Layout supervisor Ed Ghertner wrote a guide to the widescreen format for use by the layout artists and mentioned that one advantage of widescreen was that he could keep characters in scenes longer because of additional space to walk within the frame. Wise drew further inspiration for the format from filmmakers <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a> and <a href="Akira%20Kurosawa">Akira Kurosawa</a>.

The film's visual style was strongly based upon that of <a href="Mike%20Mignola">Mike Mignola</a>, the comic book artist behind "<a href="Hellboy">Hellboy</a>". Mignola was one of four production designers (along with Matt Codd, Jim Martin, and <a href="Ricardo%20Delgado%20%28comics%29">Ricardo Delgado</a>) hired by the Disney studio for the film. Accordingly, he provided style guides, preliminary character and background designs, and story ideas. "Mignola's graphic, angular style was a key influence on the 'look' of the characters," stated Wise. Mignola was surprised when first contacted by the studio to work on "Atlantis". His artistic influence on the film would later contribute to a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>.
The final pull-out scene of the movie, immediately before the end-title card, was described by the directors as the most difficult scene in the history of Disney animation. They said that the pullout attempt on their prior film, "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", "struggled" and "lacked depth"; however, after making advances in the process of <a href="Multiplane%20camera">multiplaning</a>, they tried the technique again in "Atlantis". The scene begins with one 16-inch (40.5 cm) piece of paper showing a close-up of Milo and Kida. As the camera pulls away from them to reveal the newly restored Atlantis, it reaches the equivalent of an 18,000-inch (45,720 cm) piece of paper composed of many individual pieces of paper (24 inches [61 cm] or smaller). Each piece was carefully drawn and combined with animated vehicles simultaneously flying across the scene to make the viewer see a complete, integrated image.
At the time of its release, "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was notable for using more <a href="computer-generated%20imagery">computer-generated imagery</a> (CGI) than any other Disney traditionally animated feature. To increase productivity, the directors had the digital artists work with the <a href="traditional%20animation">traditional animators</a> throughout the production. Several important scenes required heavy use of digital animation: the Leviathan, the "Ulysses" submarine and sub-pods, the Heart of Atlantis, and the Stone Giants. During production, after Matt Codd and Jim Martin designed the "Ulysses" on paper, Greg Aronowitz was hired to build a scale model of the submarine, to be used as a reference for drawing the 3D "Ulysses". The final film included 362 digital-effects shots, and computer programs were used to seamlessly join the 2D and 3D artwork. One scene that took advantage of this was the "sub-drop" scene, where the 3D "Ulysses" was dropped from its docking bay into the water. As the camera floated toward it, a 2D Milo was drawn to appear inside, tracking the camera. The crew noted that it was challenging to keep the audience from noticing the difference between the 2D and 3D drawings when they were merged. The digital production also gave the directors a unique "<a href="virtual%20camera">virtual camera</a>" for complicated shots within the film. With the ability to operate in the z-plane, this camera moved through a digital <a href="Wire-frame%20model">wire-frame set</a>; the background and details were later hand-drawn over the wire frames. This was used in the opening flight scene through Atlantis and the submarine chase through the undersea cavern with the Leviathan in pursuit.

Since the film would not feature any songs, the directors hired <a href="James%20Newton%20Howard">James Newton Howard</a> to compose the <a href="Film%20score">score</a>. Approaching it as a live-action film, Howard decided to have different musical themes for the cultures of the surface world and Atlantis. In the case of Atlantis, Howard chose an <a href="Gamelan">Indonesian orchestral sound</a> incorporating chimes, bells, and gongs. The directors told Howard that the film would have a number of key scenes without dialogue; the score would need to convey emotionally what the viewer was seeing on screen.

<a href="Gary%20Rydstrom">Gary Rydstrom</a> and his team at <a href="Skywalker%20Sound">Skywalker Sound</a> were hired for the film's <a href="Sound%20recording%20and%20reproduction">sound production</a>. Like Howard, Rydstrom employed different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, he felt that the Atlanteans should have a "more organic" sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a <a href="Semi-trailer%20truck">semi-truck</a> drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a> chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by rubbing his finger along the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a <a href="Oral%20irrigator">water pick</a>.

"Atlantis" was among Disney's first major attempts to utilize <a href="internet%20marketing">internet marketing</a>. The film was promoted through <a href="Kellogg%20Company">Kellogg's</a>, which created a website with mini-games and a movie-based video game give-away for UPC labels from specially marked packages of "Atlantis" breakfast cereal. The film was one of Disney's first marketing attempts through <a href="mobile%20network%20operator">mobile network operator</a>s, and allowed users to download games based on the film. <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> (which had an exclusive licensing agreement on all Disney releases) promoted the film with <a href="Happy%20Meal">Happy Meal</a> toys, food packaging and in-store decor. The McDonald's advertising campaign involved television, radio, and print advertisements beginning on the film's release date. <a href="Frito-Lay">Frito-Lay</a> offered free admission tickets for the film on specially marked snack packages.

Before the film's release, reporters speculated that it would have a difficult run due to competition from <a href="DreamWorks%20Animation">DreamWorks</a>' "<a href="Shrek">Shrek</a>" (a wholly CGI feature) and "" (an action-adventure film from <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>). Regarding the market's shift from traditional animation and competition with CGI films, Kirk Wise said, "Any traditional animator, including myself, can't help but feel a twinge. I think it always comes down to story and character, and one form won't replace the other. Just like photography didn't replace painting. But maybe I'm blind to it." Jeff Jensen of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" noted that CGI films (such as "Shrek") were more likely to attract the teenage demographic typically not interested in animation, and called "Atlantis" a "marketing and creative gamble".

"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" had its world premiere at Disney's <a href="El%20Capitan%20Theatre">El Capitan Theatre</a> in Hollywood, California on June 3, 2001 and a limited release in New York City and Los Angeles on June 8; a wider release followed on June 15. At the premiere, "Destination: Atlantis" was on display, featuring behind-the-scenes props from the film and information on the legend of Atlantis with video games, displays, laser tag, and other attractions. The <a href="Aquarium%20of%20the%20Pacific">Aquarium of the Pacific</a> also loaned a variety of fish for display within the attraction. With a budget of $100 million, the film opened at #2 on its debut weekend, behind "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" earning $20.3 million in 3,011 theaters. The film's international release began September 20 in Australia and other markets followed suit. During its 25-week theatrical run, "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" grossed over $186 million worldwide ($84 million from the United States and Canada). Responding to its disappointing box-office performance, <a href="Thomas%20Schumacher">Thomas Schumacher</a>, then-president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, said, "It seemed like a good idea at the time to not do a sweet fairy tale, but we missed."

"Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was released on VHS and DVD January 29, 2002. During the first month of its home release, the film led in VHS sales and was third in VHS and DVD sales combined. Sales and rentals of the VHS and DVD combined would eventually accumulate $157 million in revenue by mid-2003. Both a single-disc DVD edition and a two-disc collector's edition (with bonus features) were released. The single-disc DVD gave the viewer the option of viewing the film either in its original theatrical 2.35:1 aspect ratio or a modified 1.33:1 ratio (utilizing <a href="pan%20and%20scan">pan and scan</a>). Bonus features available on the DVD version included audio and visual commentary from the film team, a virtual tour of the CGI models, an Atlantean-language tutorial, an encyclopedia on the myth of Atlantis, and the deleted Viking prologue scene. The two-disc collector's edition DVD contained all the single-disc features and a disc with supplemental material detailing all aspects of the film's production. The collector's-edition film could only be viewed in its original theatrical ratio, and also featured an optional <a href="DTS%20%28sound%20system%29">DTS 5.1</a> track. Both DVD versions, however, contained a <a href="Dolby%20Digital">Dolby Digital 5.1</a> track and were <a href="THX">THX</a> certified. Disney digitally remastered and released "Atlantis" on <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> on June 11, 2013, bundled with its sequel "".

The review aggregator website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> reports that 49% of 141 professional critics have given "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" a positive review; the average rating is 5.5/10. The site's consensus is: ""Atlantis" provides a fast-paced spectacle, but stints on such things as character development and a coherent plot". <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> assigned the film a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on 29 reviews from mainstream critics; this was considered "mixed or average reviews". <a href="CinemaScore">CinemaScore</a> polls conducted during the opening weekend revealed the average grade cinema-goers gave "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was an "A" on an A+-to-F scale.

While critics had mixed reactions to the film in general, some praised it for its visuals, action-adventure elements, and its attempt to appeal to an older audience. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> gave "Atlantis" three-and-half stars out of four. He praised the animation's "clean bright visual look" and the "classic energy of the comic book style", crediting this to the work of Mike Mignola. Ebert gave particular praise to the story and the final battle scene and wrote, "The story of "Atlantis" is rousing in an old pulp science fiction sort of way, but the climactic scene transcends the rest, and stands by itself as one of the great animated action sequences." In "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Elvis%20Mitchell">Elvis Mitchell</a> gave high praise to the film, calling it "a monumental treat", and stated, ""Atlantis" is also one of the most eye-catching Disney cartoons since Uncle Walt institutionalized the four-fingered glove." Internet film critic <a href="James%20Berardinelli">James Berardinelli</a> wrote a positive review of the film, giving it three out of four stars. He wrote, "On the whole, "Atlantis" offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment, once again proving that while Disney may be clueless when it comes to producing good live-action movies, they are exactly the opposite when it comes to their animated division." <a href="Wesley%20Morris">Wesley Morris</a> of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" wrote positively of the film's approach for an older audience: "But just beneath the surface, "Atlantis" brims with adult possibility."

Other critics felt that the film was mediocre in regards to its story and characters, and that it failed to deliver as a non-musical to Disney's traditional audience. <a href="Owen%20Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> of "Entertainment Weekly" gave the film a C+ rating, writing that the film had "gee-whiz formulaic character" and was "the essence of craft without dream". <a href="Kenneth%20Turan">Kenneth Turan</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" said the storyline and characterizations were "old-fashioned" and the film had the retrograde look of a Saturday-morning cartoon, but these deficiencies were offset by its "brisk action" and frantic pace. <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a> of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" wrote, "Disney pushes into all-talking, no-singing, no-dancing and, in the end, no-fun animated territory." Stephanie Zacharek of "<a href="Salon.com">Salon</a>" wrote of Disney's attempt to make the film for an adult audience, "The big problem with Disney's latest animated feature, "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", is that it doesn't seem geared to kids at all: It's so adult that it's massively boring." Rita Kempley of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" panned the film, calling it a "new-fashioned but old-fangled hash" and wrote, "Ironically Disney had hoped to update its image with this mildly diverting adventure, yet the picture hasn't really broken away from the tried-and-true format spoofed in the far superior "Shrek"."

Several critics and scholars have noted that "Atlantis" plays strongly on themes of <a href="anti-capitalism">anti-capitalism</a> and <a href="anti-imperialism">anti-imperialism</a>. M. Keith Booker, academic and author of studies about the implicit messages conveyed by media, views the character of Rourke as being motivated by "capitalist greed" when he pursues "his own financial gain" in spite of the knowledge that "his theft [of the crystal] will lead to the destruction of [Atlantis]". Religion journalist Mark Pinsky, in his exploration of moral and spiritual themes in popular Disney films, says that "it is impossible to read the movie ... any other way" than as "a devastating, unrelenting attack on capitalism and <a href="American%20imperialism">American imperialism</a>". Max Messier of <a href="AMC%20Networks">FilmCritic.com</a> observes, "Disney even manages to lambast the capitalist lifestyle of the adventurers intent on uncovering the lost city. Damn the imperialists!" According to Booker, the film also "delivers a rather <a href="segregationist">segregationist</a> moral" by concluding with the discovery of the Atlanteans kept secret from other surface-dwellers in order to maintain a separation between the two highly divergent cultures. Others saw "Atlantis" as an interesting look at <a href="utopia">utopia</a>n philosophy of the sort found in classic works of science fiction by <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> and Jules Verne.

When the film was released, some viewers noticed that "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" bore a number of similarities to the 1990–1991 Japanese anime television program "" and the 1986 film "<a href="Castle%20in%20the%20Sky">Castle in the Sky</a>" from <a href="Studio%20Ghibli">Studio Ghibli</a>, particularly in its character design, setting, and story. Although Disney never responded formally to claims of <a href="plagiarism">plagiarism</a>, co-director Kirk Wise posted on a Disney animation <a href="Usenet%20newsgroup">newsgroup</a> in May 2001, "Never heard of "Nadia" till it was mentioned in this [newsgroup]. Long after we'd finished production, I might add." Both "Atlantis" and "Nadia" were inspired, in part, by the 1870 Jules Verne novel "<a href="Twenty%20Thousand%20Leagues%20Under%20the%20Sea">Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea</a>", of which Lee Zion (reporting for <a href="Anime%20News%20Network">Anime News Network</a>) wrote, "There are too many similarities "not" connected with "20,000 Leagues" for the whole thing to be coincidence." Critics also saw parallels with the 1994 film "<a href="Stargate%20%28film%29">Stargate</a>". Milo's characteristics were said to resemble those of <a href="Daniel%20Jackson%20%28Stargate%29">Daniel Jackson</a>, the protagonist of "Stargate" and its spinoff television series "<a href="Stargate%20SG-1">Stargate SG-1</a>"—which coincidentally launched its own spinoff, titled "<a href="Stargate%20Atlantis">Stargate Atlantis</a>".

"Atlantis: the Lost Empire" was meant to provide a springboard for an animated television series entitled "Team Atlantis", which would have presented the further adventures of its characters. However, because of the film's under-performance at the box office, the series was not produced. On May 20, 2003, Disney released a <a href="direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a> sequel called "", consisting of three episodes planned for the aborted series. In addition, <a href="Disneyland">Disneyland</a> planned to revive its <a href="Submarine%20Voyage">Submarine Voyage</a> ride with an "Atlantis" theme with elements from the movie and the ride was promoted with a meet-and-greet by the movie's characters. These plans were canceled and the attraction was re-opened in 2007 as the <a href="Finding%20Nemo%20Submarine%20Voyage">Finding Nemo Submarine Voyage</a>, its theme based on the 2003 <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Disney</a>·<a href="Pixar">Pixar</a> animated film "<a href="Finding%20Nemo">Finding Nemo</a>".

The soundtrack to "Atlantis: The Lost Empire" was released on May 22, 2001. It consists primarily of James Newton Howard's score and includes "<a href="Where%20the%20Dream%20Takes%20You">Where the Dream Takes You</a>", written by Howard and <a href="Diane%20Warren">Diane Warren</a> and performed by <a href="M%C3%BDa">Mýa</a>. It was also available in a limited edition of 20,000 numbered copies with a unique <a href="Lenticular%20printing">3D album cover</a> insert depicting the Leviathan from the film. A rare promotional edition (featuring 73 minutes of material, compared to the 53 minutes on standard commercial editions) was intended only for <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> voters but was <a href="Bootleg%20recording">bootlegged</a> and distributed with fan-created artwork. Concerning the promotional edition, <a href="Filmtracks.com">Filmtracks</a> said, "Outside of about five minutes of superior additional material (including the massive opening, "Atlantis Destroyed"), the complete presentation is mostly redundant. Still, "Atlantis" is an accomplished work for its genre."

There are several video games based on the film. "" (commonly known as "Atlantis: Search for the Journal") was developed by <a href="Zombie%20Studios">Zombie Studios</a> and published by <a href="Buena%20Vista%20Games">Buena Vista Games</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="Disney%20Interactive">Disney Interactive</a>.

Newton's parakeet

Newton's parakeet ("Psittacula exsul"), also known as the Rodrigues parakeet or Rodrigues ring-necked parakeet, is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="parrot">parrot</a> that was <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to the <a href="Mascarene">Mascarene</a> island of <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a> in the western <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>. Several of its features <a href="genetic%20divergence">diverged</a> from related species, indicating long-term isolation on Rodrigues and subsequent adaptation. The <a href="rose-ringed%20parakeet">rose-ringed parakeet</a> of the same <a href="genus">genus</a> is a close relative and probable ancestor. Newton's parakeet may itself have been ancestral to the endemic parakeets of nearby <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a> and <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>.

Around long, Newton's parakeet was roughly the size of a rose-ringed parakeet. Its <a href="plumage">plumage</a> was mostly greyish or <a href="slate%20blue">slate blue</a> in colour, which is unusual in "<a href="Psittacula">Psittacula</a>", a genus containing mostly green species. The male had <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">stronger colours</a> than the female and possessed a reddish instead of black <a href="beak">beak</a>, but details of a mature male's appearance are uncertain; only one male specimen is known, and it is believed to be immature. Mature males might have possessed red patches on the wing like the related <a href="Alexandrine%20parakeet">Alexandrine parakeet</a>. Both sexes had a black collar running from the chin to the <a href="nape">nape</a>, but this was clearer in the male. The legs were grey and the <a href="Bird%20vision%23Anatomy%20of%20the%20eye">iris</a> yellow. 17th-century accounts indicate that some members of the species were green, which would suggest that there were both blue and green <a href="polymorphism%20%28biology%29">colour morphs</a>, but there is no definitive explanation for these reports. Little is known about its behaviour in life, but it may have fed on the nuts of the <a href="Cassine%20orientalis">bois d'olive</a> tree, along with leaves. It was very tame and was able to <a href="talking%20bird">mimic speech</a>.

Newton's parakeet was first written about by the French <a href="Huguenot">Huguenot</a> <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Leguat">François Leguat</a> in 1708 and was only mentioned a few times by other writers afterwards. The specific name ""exsul"" is a reference to Leguat, who was exiled from France. Only two life drawings exist, both of a single specimen held in captivity in the 1770s. The species was scientifically described in 1872, with a female specimen as the <a href="holotype">holotype</a>. A male, the last specimen recorded, was collected in 1875, and these two specimens are the only ones that exist today. The bird became scarce due to deforestation and perhaps hunting, but it is thought that it was finally wiped out by a series of <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>s and storms that hit Rodrigues in the late 19th century. There was unfounded speculation about the possible survival of the species as late as 1967.

Newton's parakeet was first recorded by <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Leguat">François Leguat</a> in his 1708 memoir "A New Voyage to the East Indies". Leguat was the leader of a group of nine <a href="French%20Huguenot">French Huguenot</a> refugees who colonised <a href="Rodrigues">Rodrigues</a> between 1691 and 1693 after they were <a href="marooning">marooned</a> there. Subsequent accounts were by Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island in 1726, in his "Relation de l'Île Rodrigue", and then by the French mathematician <a href="Alexandre%20Pingr%C3%A9">Alexandre Pingré</a>, who travelled to Rodrigues to view the <a href="1761%20transit%20of%20Venus">1761 transit of Venus</a>.

In 1871, George Jenner, the <a href="magistrate">magistrate</a> of Rodrigues, collected a female specimen; it was preserved in alcohol and given to <a href="Edward%20Newton">Edward Newton</a>, a <a href="British%20Mauritius">colonial administrator</a> in <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, who sent it to his brother, the British ornithologist <a href="Alfred%20Newton">Alfred Newton</a>. A. Newton scientifically described the species in 1872 and gave it the <a href="scientific%20name">scientific name</a> "Palaeornis exsul". ""Exsul"" ("exiled") refers to Leguat, in that he was exiled from France when he gave the first description of the bird. Newton had tried to find a more descriptive name, perhaps based on colouration, but found it difficult. He refrained from publishing a figure of the female in his original description, though the journal "<a href="Ibis%20%28journal%29">Ibis</a>" had offered him the space. He instead wanted to wait until a male specimen could be procured since he imagined it would be more attractive. The female, which is the <a href="holotype%20specimen">holotype specimen</a> of the species, is housed in the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Museum">Cambridge University Museum</a> as specimen UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/1.

A. Newton requested further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 he finally published a plate of the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet's 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton's collector, Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton's parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It may have been the same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the <a href="paratype">paratype</a> of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.

In 1876, the Newton brothers noted that they had expected the male would be adorned with a red patch on the wing, but that the absence of this indicated it was immature. They still found it more beautiful than the female. These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species. The <a href="mandible">mandible</a> and <a href="sternum">sternum</a> were extracted from the female specimen, and <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains have since been found in the Plaine Corail caverns on Rodrigues. The genus "Palaeornis" was later declared a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of "<a href="Psittacula">Psittacula</a>", and all species within the former were transferred to the latter. The genus name "Psittacula" is derived from the Latin words "Psittacus", which means parrot, and "-ula", which is a <a href="diminutive%20suffix">diminutive suffix</a>.

Based on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphological</a> features, the <a href="Alexandrine%20parakeet">Alexandrine parakeet</a> ("Psittacula eupatria") has been proposed as the <a href="founder%20population">founder population</a> for all "Psittacula" species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species' southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Subfossil remains of Newton's parakeet show that it differed from other Mascarene "Psittacula" species in some <a href="osteology">osteological</a> features, but also had similarities, such as a reduced sternum, which suggests a close relationship. Skeletal features indicate an especially close relationship with the Alexandrine parakeet and the <a href="rose-ringed%20parakeet">rose-ringed parakeet</a> ("Psittacula krameri"), but the many <a href="synapomorphy">derived features</a> of Newton's parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues.

Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the <a href="dodo">dodo</a>, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and the English palaeontologist <a href="Julian%20Hume">Julian Hume</a> has proposed that this may also be the case for all parrots there. <a href="Past%20sea%20level">Sea levels</a> were lower during the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared common features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced <a href="Pectoralis%20major%20muscle">pectoral</a> bones, and robust leg bones. Hume has suggested that they all have a common origin in the <a href="evolutionary%20radiation">radiation</a> of the <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a> <a href="Psittaculini">Psittaculini</a>, members of which are known as Psittaculines, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that "Psittacula" parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on <a href="hotspot%20island">hotspot island</a>s before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Other members of the genus "Psittacula" from the Mascarenes include the extant <a href="echo%20parakeet">echo parakeet</a> ("Psittacula eques echo") of Mauritius, as well as the extinct <a href="R%C3%A9union%20parakeet">Réunion parakeet</a> ("Psittacula eques eques"), and <a href="Mascarene%20grey%20parakeet">Mascarene grey parakeet</a> ("Psittacula bensoni") of both Mauritius and <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>.

A 2011 <a href="genetic%20study">genetic study</a> of parrot <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a> was unable to include Newton's parakeet, as no viable <a href="DNA">DNA</a> could be extracted. A 2015 genetic study by Jackson et al. included viable DNA from the toe-pad of the female Newton's parakeet specimen. It was found to group within a <a href="clade">clade</a> of rose-ringed parakeet <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> (from Asia and Africa), which it had diverged from 3.82 million years ago. Furthermore, Newton's parakeet appeared to be ancestral to the parakeets of Mauritius and Réunion. The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> accompanying the study is shown below:

Newton's parakeet was about long – roughly the size of the rose-ringed parakeet. The wing of the male specimen was , the tail , the <a href="culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> , and the <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> was . The wing of the female specimen was , the tail , the culmen , and the tarsus was . The male specimen was greyish blue (also described as "<a href="slatey">slatey</a> blue") tinged with green, and darker above. The head was bluer, with a dark line running from the eye to the <a href="cere">cere</a>. It had a broad black collar running from the chin to the <a href="nape">nape</a>, where it became gradually narrower. The underside of the tail was greyish, the upper beak was dark reddish brown, and the mandible was black. The legs were grey and the iris yellow. The female was similar but had a greyer head and a black beak. The black collar was not so prominent as that of the male and did not extend to the back of the neck. The general appearance of Newton's parakeet was similar to the extant "Psittacula" species, including the black collar, but the bluish grey colouration set it apart from other members of its genus, which are mostly green.

The French naturalist <a href="Philibert%20Commerson">Philibert Commerson</a> received a live specimen on Mauritius in the 1770s and described it as "greyish blue". French artist Paul Philippe Sanguin de Jossigny made two illustrations of this specimen, the only known depictions of Newton's parakeet in life, unpublished until 2007. Though both existing specimens are blue, some early accounts from Rodrigues have caused confusion over the colouration of the plumage. One of these is Leguat's following statement:

If the green parrots Leguat referred to were not the <a href="Rodrigues%20parrot">Rodrigues parrot</a> ("Necropsittacus rodericanus"), they might perhaps have been a green <a href="colour%20morph">colour morph</a> of Newton's parakeet, as Julian Hume has suggested. As A. Newton observed in his original description, some feathers of the female specimen display both blue and green tinges, depending on the light. This may explain some of the discrepancies. The green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of "Psittacula" species from other islands, that survived on Rodrigues for a short time.

The two existing specimens were originally preserved in alcohol, but though this can discolour specimens, it is not probable that it could turn green to blue. Hume and Hein van Grouw have also suggested that due to an inheritable <a href="mutation">mutation</a>, some Newton's parakeets may have lacked <a href="psittacin">psittacin</a>, a <a href="pigment">pigment</a> that together with <a href="eumalanin">eumalanin</a> produces green colouration in parrot feathers. Complete lack of psittacine produces blue colouration, whereas reduced psittacine can produce a colour between green and blue called parblue, which corresponds to the colour of the two preserved Newton's parakeet specimens. The reason why only parblue specimens are known today may be due to <a href="collecting%20bias">collecting bias</a>, as unusually coloured specimens are more likely to be collected than those of normal colour.

Tafforet also described what appears to be green Newton's parakeets, but the issue of colouration was further complicated:

In 1987, the British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke proposed that the last two types mentioned were male and female Newton's parakeets, and that the differences between them were due to <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. The last bird mentioned had earlier been identified as introduced <a href="grey-headed%20lovebirds">grey-headed lovebirds</a> ("Agapornis canus") by A. Newton, but Cheke did not find this likely, as their beaks are grey. Alexandre Pingré also mentioned green birds, perhaps with some red colours, but his account is partially unintelligible and therefore ambiguous. A red shoulder patch is also present on the related Alexandrine parakeet. None of the existing Newton's parakeet specimens have red patches. The single known male specimen may have been immature, judged on the colour of its beak, and this may also explain the absence of the red patch. When "Psittacula" are bred by <a href="aviculture">aviculturalists</a>, blue is easily produced from green; the production of blue may suppress red colouration, so blue morphs may have lacked the red patch.

Almost nothing is known about the behaviour of Newton's parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d'olive tree ("<a href="Cassine%20orientalis">Cassine orientalis</a>"). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis <a href="shrub">shrub</a> ("<a href="Fernelia%20buxifolia">Fernelia buxifolia</a>"), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton's parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.

Leguat and his men were hesitant to hunt the parrots of Rodrigues because they were so tame and easy to catch. Leguat's group took a parrot as a pet and were able to <a href="talking%20bird">teach it to speak</a>:

The authors of the 2015 study which resolved the phylogenetic placement of the Mascarene island parakeets suggested that the echo parakeet of Mauritius would be a suitable <a href="ecological%20replacement">ecological replacement</a> for the Réunion parakeet and Newton's parakeet, due to their close evolutionary relationship. The echo parakeet was itself close to extinction in the 1980s, numbering only twenty individuals, but has since recovered, so introducing it to the nearby islands could also help secure the survival of this species.

Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island's ecosystem remains heavily damaged. Forests had covered the entire island before humans arrived, but very little forestation can be seen today. Newton's parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the <a href="Rodrigues%20solitaire">Rodrigues solitaire</a>, the Rodrigues parrot, the <a href="Rodrigues%20rail">Rodrigues rail</a>, the <a href="Rodrigues%20starling">Rodrigues starling</a>, the <a href="Rodrigues%20owl">Rodrigues owl</a>, the <a href="Rodrigues%20night%20heron">Rodrigues night heron</a>, and the <a href="Rodrigues%20pigeon">Rodrigues pigeon</a>. Extinct reptiles include the <a href="domed%20Rodrigues%20giant%20tortoise">domed Rodrigues giant tortoise</a>, the <a href="saddle-backed%20Rodrigues%20giant%20tortoise">saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise</a>, and the <a href="Rodrigues%20day%20gecko">Rodrigues day gecko</a>.

Of the roughly eight parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a> by humans. Leguat stated that Newton's parakeet was abundant during his stay. It was still common when Tafforet visited in 1726, but when Alexandre Pingré mentioned it in 1761, he noted that the bird had become scarce. It was still present on southern islets off Rodrigues (Isle Gombrani), along with the Rodrigues parrot. After this point, much of Rodrigues was severely deforested and used for <a href="livestock">livestock</a>.

According to early accounts praising its flavour, it appears visitors commonly ate Newton's parakeet. Several individuals would likely be needed to provide a single meal, owing to the bird's small size. Pingré stated:

According to government surveyor Thomas Corby, Newton's parakeet may still have been fairly common in 1843. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in southwestern Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the <a href="1874%20Transit%20of%20Venus">1874 Transit of Venus</a>, and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species. A series of <a href="cyclone">cyclone</a>s struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population. Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by this time, there was little cover to protect any remaining birds. The male could, therefore, have been the last of the species alive.

There were unfounded rumours of its continued existence until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1967, the American ornithologist <a href="James%20Greenway">James Greenway</a> stated that an extremely small population might still survive on small offshore islets, since this is often the last refuge of endangered birds. Hume countered that these islets were probably too small to sustain a population.

Sonic X

The series follows a group of <a href="anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> animals who accidentally teleport from their home planet to <a href="Earth">Earth</a> after attempting to save one of their friends from their enemy <a href="Doctor%20Eggman">Doctor Eggman</a>. Separated, <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> is saved by a <a href="human">human</a> boy named Chris Thorndyke, who helps him find his friends while repeatedly scuffling with Doctor Eggman and his robots over control of the powerful <a href="Chaos%20Emeralds">Chaos Emeralds</a>, and becoming <a href="celebrities">celebrities</a>. The final story arc sees the friends return with Chris to their world, where they enter outer space with a newfound plant-like creature named Cosmo and fight an army of aliens called the Metarex.

Generally, writers criticized its American localization and some characters, but praised its story and aesthetics. The series was popular in the United States and France, though less so in its native Japan. The show's merchandise included an <a href="edutainment">edutainment</a> video game for the <a href="Leapster">Leapster</a>, a <a href="trading%20card%20game">trading card game</a>, a <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a> series featuring an original storyline, and various toys and other items. The phrase "gotta go fast", the title of the show's North American theme song, survived as a "Sonic" catchphrase for over a decade after the show's initial release.

<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic</a>, <a href="Tails%20%28character%29">Tails</a> and <a href="Amy%20Rose">Amy Rose</a> are trying to rescue <a href="Cream%20the%20Rabbit">Cream the Rabbit</a> and her pet <a href="Chao%20%28Sonic%29">Chao</a> Cheese from <a href="Doctor%20Eggman">Doctor Eggman</a>, who has already retrieved the seven <a href="Chaos%20Emeralds">Chaos Emeralds</a>. While attempting to destroy his base, one of Eggman's robots inadvertently shoots a machine containing the Emeralds, which activates the "Chaos Control" technique. This teleports Sonic, Eggman (and his robots), Tails, Amy, Cream, and Cheese, as well as <a href="Big%20the%20Cat">Big the Cat</a> (with his frog Froggy), <a href="Rouge%20the%20Bat">Rouge the Bat</a>, <a href="Knuckles%20the%20Echidna">Knuckles the Echidna</a>, and the <a href="Chaotix">Chaotix</a> (a <a href="detective">detective</a> crew comprising <a href="Espio%20the%20Chameleon">Espio the Chameleon</a>, <a href="Vector%20the%20Crocodile">Vector the Crocodile</a>, and <a href="Charmy%20Bee">Charmy Bee</a>) to <a href="Earth">Earth</a>, the <a href="parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">parallel-universe</a> version of their world with <a href="humans">humans</a>. Sonic is chased by police, escapes into a mansion's swimming pool, and is rescued by a twelve-year-old boy named Chris Thorndyke, who lives there with his movie-star mother Lindsey, corporate executive father Nelson, scientist grandfather Chuck, maid and chef Ella, and butler Tanaka. Chris tries to hide the anthropomorphic friends from his family until Cream accidentally reveals them, but they all build up a good rapport with Chris' family and with Chris' friends Danny, Francis, and Helen.

Sonic and his friends still want to return home, so they repeatedly scuffle for the Emeralds with Doctor Eggman, his robot assistants—the hyperactive, attention-seeking Bokkun and the bumbling Bocoe and Decoe—and his larger, armed robots. Eggman plans to take over the world, catching the attention of the unnamed nation's President, so Knuckles, Rouge, and federal agent Topaz work to stop him. The other anthropomorphic residents soon join the crusade and, when Eggman is defeated, they are all hailed as heroes.

Eggman awakens a creature named <a href="Chaos%20%28Sonic%29">Chaos</a> from a huge gem called the Master Emerald. The animals fight a losing battle to retrieve the Emeralds until Chaos absorbs all seven and becomes giant, but an echidna girl named <a href="Tikal%20the%20Echidna">Tikal</a>, who entombed herself and Chaos in the Master Emerald millennia ago, emerges to help placate him. After Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds to become <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29%23Super%20transformation">Super Sonic</a>, he defeats Chaos, who returns to the Master Emerald with Tikal.

Shortly afterwards, Eggman finds his grandfather <a href="Gerald%20Robotnik">Gerald Robotnik</a>'s diary and Gerald's old project <a href="Shadow%20the%20Hedgehog">Shadow</a> in a military base. After being released by Eggman, Shadow breaks into a museum to steal an Emerald, which gets Sonic arrested. Amy rescues him, but Shadow, Eggman, and the duplicitous Rouge escape to the space colony ARK, where Eggman threatens to use a weapon called the Eclipse Cannon to destroy Earth if Earth does not submit to his rule; he blows up half of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> to prove his power. Eggman collects the Emeralds to power the Cannon, but this triggers a program Gerald set up decades ago, which will cause space colony ARK to hurtle into Earth, destroying the planets in less than half an hour. Gerald did this in order to exact revenge on humanity, who he blamed for the death of his Granddaughter Maria after she was killed in a government raid on space colony ARK. Everyone teams up and works together to shut it down except Shadow, who is unsympathetic and believes he has fulfilled his purpose of revenge. Chris confronts Shadow, reminding him of Maria's last wish for Shadow to be a protector of humanity, to guide and aid them. Moved to tears and with a new sense of purpose, Shadow teams up with Sonic and both power up using the Emeralds and teleport the ARK away from Earth, though Shadow is seeming killed in the process. Sonic, his friends, and Eggman reflect on Shadow's sacrifice and return to Earth.

Eggman rebuilds the Moon, seemingly out of remorse, but its position shifts, creating a <a href="solar%20eclipse">solar eclipse</a>, so he manufactures and sells "Sunshine Balls" to replicate sunlight. Sonic sees through his greedy motivations, and Eggman is arrested for fraud. Bokkun activates a robot named <a href="Sonic%20Battle">Emerl</a>, who quickly allies with the anthropomorphic people, and Eggman escapes prison. Emerl wins an Emerald in a martial arts tournament involving numerous hero and villain characters, but he goes berserk and begins to wreck the city, forcing Cream and Cheese to destroy him.

Later, two government physicists show up at Chris' mansion to announce that Sonic's world and Earth were once a single world split in two by a cataclysmic event, but are rejoining, which will stop time irreversibly, and the only way to stop it is to send the anthropomorphic people back home. Tails and Chuck begin to build a gate to teleport Sonic and company back to their own world with Chaos Control, but Chris does not want them to leave. When it is finished and all their friends but Sonic have left, Chris suddenly shuts the machine down and whisks Sonic into the woods to hide out of fear his parents will return to never being home once Sonic is gone. Sonic is understanding, yet teaches Chris that as a fellow person neither can force the other to feel a certain way and that their friendship is free will. Chris tearfully acknowledges that he bound Sonic's freedom today and stopped his friend from going back home and remorsefully asks for forgiveness while Sonic tells him he'll be able to be strong even without him being there. Chris' parents find him and promise to spend more time with him. Chris having learned his lesson and grown as a person goes for one final run with Sonic before they mutually part ways and Sonic returns to his own planet, stopping the merging of the worlds. However, Chris vows that one day, he will see Sonic again.

Six months later, a race of villainous robots known as the Metarex attempt to steal the Emeralds from Sonic, but he scatters them across the galaxy. Meanwhile, on Earth, where <a href="time%20dilation">six years have passed</a> and Chris is now eighteen, Chris builds another device to return to his friends' world; he is twelve again when he arrives. A sick plant-like girl named Cosmo lands on their planet and they nurse her back to health, so she joins them, and they all board Tails' new spaceship, "The Blue Typhoon". On the "Typhoon", they scour the galaxy for the Emeralds and "Planet Eggs" (objects that allow life to flourish on planets, which the Metarex have stolen to depopulate the galaxy) and fight the Metarex at every turn. Along the way, Tails and Cosmo slowly fall in love with each other. Rouge finds Shadow alive in a capsule on Eggman's ship and he is later released (though he has lost his memory.) At first, he and Rouge assist Eggman (even saving Chris on one occasion) but after Shadow witnesses the death of resistance fighter who reminded him of Maria, both he and Rouge go off on their own to fight the Metered independently. Eggman eventually joins the Metarex though this is a ruse to gather more information. After discovering the origins, methods, and goals of the Metarex, Shadow reappears and tries to kill Cosmo, much to Tails' anger. The Metarex's leader, Dark Oak, appears and reveals that the Metarex and Cosmo are of the same species and that they secretly implanted a tracking device in her brain while extinguishing the rest of their kind; she has been an <a href="undercover%20agent">unwitting spy ever since</a>. It was for this reason Shadow wanted Cosmo dead. Chris, Knuckles, and Tails notice that removing the device will likely <a href="deafblindness">destroy her sight and hearing</a> forever. Knuckles pushes for it to be removed anyway (In the Japanese version he stresses to find a way to remove it without damaging her), but Tails can't make any decisions at the present time so the surgery is called off and the battle against the Metarex continues.

The heroes, along with the Chaotix and Shadow, head to the center of the universe, where the Metarex are ominously controlling a planet that is made of water and contains a Planet Egg. After Sonic almost drowns in it, the planet begins turning into a giant seed; the Metarex reveal that, because they have lost the battle, they will destroy the galaxy with this planet. The Metarex then proceed to fuse together, forming a dragon-like plant monster that attaches itself to the giant seed. Sonic and Shadow use the chaos emerald to become Super Sonic and Super Shadow but are still unable to defeat the fused Metarex. Cosmo sees a <a href="vision%20%28spirituality%29">vision</a> from her mother Earthia, telling her that she must sacrifice herself to save the rest. She fuses with the giant seed and instructs Tails to use the Blue Typhoon's cannon to fire Super Sonic and Super Shadow at her and the seed. Tails hesitates, torn between saving the galaxy and killing Cosmo, but eventually finds the inner strength and annihilates the Metarex along with Cosmo, whose seed disperse throughout the galaxy along with the Planet Eggs stolen by the Metarex which return to their original planets. Dark Oak has a moment of repentance before dying while having a vision of being greeted by Earthia as he passes away. Shadow then apparently sacrifices himself to contain the ensuing explosion. After the battle, Sonic reappears and solemnly informs a heartbroken Tails that he could not save Cosmo and hands him one of her seeds. Back on Sonic's planet Eggman builds a device for Chris to return home, later claiming that this was done to reduce the strength of Team Sonic. The series ends with Chris returning home and business as usual for Sonic and his friends as they joyfully gear up to once again put a stop to Eggman's schemes. The final shots show Shadow on an alien planet and Cosmo's seed sprouting in Tails' workshop.

The show was created by <a href="TMS%20Entertainment">TMS Entertainment</a>, the animation subsidiary of SEGA Holdings Co., Ltd. It was the first <a href="anime">anime</a> series based on the "Sonic" universe. It was primarily influenced by other anime rather than work from the West, and was created for a Japanese audience. <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a>, then the head of <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a>, filled in as executive producer, and Satoshi Hirayama designed all of the original characters, basing the designs on <a href="Yuji%20Uekawa">Yuji Uekawa</a>'s original concept.
Most of the series consists of original content featuring new as well as established characters, but the second season is mostly based on the plots of "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>", "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure%202">Sonic Adventure 2</a>", and "<a href="Sonic%20Battle">Sonic Battle</a>". While traditionally animated, it includes non-outlined <a href="CGI%20animation">CGI</a> elements for things such as Sonic's homing attack.

Two trailers for the series were produced. The first was developed before Cheese had been given a name in "<a href="Sonic%20Advance%202">Sonic Advance 2</a>" (2002); it referred to Cheese simply as "Chao". It was made up largely of footage that would later appear in the series' intro, but also of unused scenes featuring unique anthropomorphic people. Sega showed off the second, which was narrated in Japanese, at its booth at the World Hobby Fair video gaming event in February 2003. It consisted mostly of scenes from the first few episodes, followed by introductions to the main characters. However, it also showed a still frame of a silver anthropomorphic hedgehog who never appeared in the series. Years later, in April 2015, Sonic Team producer <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka">Takashi Iizuka</a> clarified the character was simply Super Sonic in its early contour.

Several of the Japanese performers had voiced their characters in the games, but they were also given ample information about their characters' roles in the anime. Chris' voice actress <a href="Sanae%20Kobayashi">Sanae Kobayashi</a> was not sure she would be able to effectively communicate Chris' growth as a person owing to Sonic's presence, but found that a worthwhile goal. <a href="Chikao%20%C5%8Ctsuka">Chikao Ōtsuka</a>, who voiced Eggman, found him a difficult character to play due to the tension in his voice and the desire to have children who watched the show recognize the character as a villain but not hate him.

Iizuka believed that "Sonic X" and its merchandise, along with the game "<a href="Sonic%20Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a>", had helped expose the "Sonic" franchise to a new generation of potential gamers in 2003, and he dubbed it a "Sonic Year" as a result. More boldly, Naka hoped that "Sonic X" alone would cause the popularity of the "Sonic" series to skyrocket, as that of the "<a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28video%20game%20series%29">Pokémon</a>" series did after its <a href="Pok%C3%A9mon%20%28anime%29">anime adaptation</a> was first released.

<a href="4Licensing%20Corporation">4Kids Entertainment</a> handled the show's American localization. The episodes were <a href="Editing%20of%20anime%20in%20American%20distribution">heavily edited for content and length</a>; 4Kids has been described by <a href="Destructoid">Destructoid</a> as being "infamous" among anime fans for this type of overzealous editing. 4Kids removed alcohol consumption, coarse language, instances of breaking the <a href="fourth%20wall">fourth wall</a>, and numerous sexual scenes. Unlike some other series that 4Kids translated around the early- to mid-2000s, such as "", "Sonic X" suffered no full episodes being cut. Producer Michael Haigney personally disliked realistic violence in children's programs, but had not intended to make massive changes himself. Instead, he was bound by <a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">Fox Broadcasting Company</a>'s strict guidelines, which forbid content such as <a href="tobacco%20smoking">smoking</a> and strong violence. In 2006, near the end of the show's American production, Haigney stated in an interview that he had never played a "Sonic" game, read the <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28comics%29">comics</a>, or watched any of the previous "Sonic" animated series.

4Kids found new voice actors rather than using those from the games, with auditions beginning in early 2003. They invited <a href="Mike%20Pollock%20%28voice%20actor%29">Mike Pollock</a> to audition for Eggman, having known him from his work on "" and "Kirby: Right Back at Ya!", and chose him for his yelling and pitch-wavering talents; Pollock also voiced Ella. 4Kids allowed Pollock to make minor alterations to the dialogue when lines "[didn't] work for some reason". He recalled being given only short samples of Eggman's voice from the games—he was not told specifically which game—and brief descriptions of his characters' roles. Beginning with "<a href="Shadow%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28video%20game%29">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>", the cast of "Sonic X" would assume their respective voice roles in all Sonic games released between 2005 and 2010, at which point all the roles were recast with the exception of Mike Pollock as Eggman.

"Sonic X" aired in Japan on <a href="TV%20Tokyo">TV Tokyo</a>'s 8:30 a.m. time slot from April 6, 2003 to March 28, 2004. It consisted of three seasons, each of them 26 half-hour episodes long. The series suffered from poor ratings in Japan, so the third season was never aired on TV or released on DVD there, but was available through rental streaming services. 4Kids licensed the series in North America from the beginning; <a href="Viz%20Media">ShoPro Entertainment</a> was also made a license holder in November 2003. It aired in North America on the <a href="4Kids%20TV">FoxBox</a> block of Fox channels. The series was also localized for other countries in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. In June 2012, the bankrupt 4Kids sold its "Sonic X" license to <a href="Saban%20Brands">Saban Brands</a>'s Kidsco Media Ventures. In 2015, <a href="Discotek%20Media">Discotek Media</a> took over the series' rights and released seasons 1 and 2 on DVD.

The series was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a>, in Japan, only seasons one and two were released, and their 52 episodes spanned 13 discs. 4Kids released the "Project Shadow" DVD in North America, covering the first arc that focused on Shadow (episodes 33–38), on November 15, 2005 to tie in with the release of the game "<a href="Shadow%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28video%20game%29">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>". Discotek Media released the 8-disc DVD set, "Sonic X Collection 1" in North America, which includes the English dubbed seasons 1 and 2 (episodes 1–52) on November 22, 2016. They later released the 4-disc DVD set, "Sonic X Collection 2" in North America, which includes the English dubbed season 3 (episodes 53–78) on December 6, 2016.

The Japanese version of "Sonic X" was scored by Yoshihiro Ike. Its opening theme was "Sonic Drive", performed by <a href="Hironobu%20Kageyama">Hironobu Kageyama</a> and <a href="Hideaki%20Takatori">Hideaki Takatori</a>. The series included three ending themes: by <a href="Run%26amp%3BGun">Run&Gun</a> for episodes 1–13, by Aya Hiroshige for 14–39 and again for 53–78, and "T.O.P" by KP for 40–52. 4Kids musicians John Angier, Craig Marks, Joel Douek, Louis Cortelezzi, Manny Corallo, Matt McGuire and Ralph Schuckett, known for their work on the "<a href="Yu-Gi-Oh%21">Yu-Gi-Oh!</a>" franchise, composed a new background score for the North American release "for both artistic and commercial reasons". The North American opening and closing theme, titled "Gotta Go Fast", was composed by Norman J. Grossfeld and Russell Velazquez. A soundtrack titled "Sonic X ~Original Sound Tracks~" was released in Japan on March 8, 2004, it consisted of 40 tracks of original music from the first two seasons.

"Sonic X" was extensively merchandised in various forms of media and other products. Two <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance%20Video">Videos</a> of episodes from the first season of "Sonic X" were released in May 2004. In October 2004, ShoPro licensed four manufacturers to create "Sonic X" merchandise, they variously produced items such as bedding, beach towels, backpacks, stationery, and pajamas. Six "Sonic X" novels were published between 2005 and 2007: "Aqua Planet", "Dr. Eggman Goes to War", "Battle at Ice Palace", and "Desperately Seeking Sonic" by <a href="Charlotte%20Fullerton">Charlotte Fullerton</a>, "Meteor Shower Messenger" by <a href="Paul%20Ruditis">Paul Ruditis</a>, and "Spaceship Blue Typhoon" by <a href="Diana%20G.%20Gallagher">Diana G. Gallagher</a>.

<a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie Comics</a>, which published "Sonic the Hedgehog" comics until 2017, started a "Sonic X" series in 2005. It was originally set to run for only four issues, but was extended to 40 issues due to high demand. The last issue was released on January 1, 2009, and led into the first arc of the "<a href="Sonic%20Universe">Sonic Universe</a>" series. The comics were written by <a href="Ian%20Flynn">Ian Flynn</a>, who also authored the main comic series. Some issues were published in "<a href="Jetix%23Magazine">Jetix Magazine</a>" in the United Kingdom and <a href="Italy">Italy</a>.

While the comics are set during the "Sonic X" timeline, their plot is original. Eggman imprisons humans inside robots and tries to use them to kill the animals, but the animals destroy the robots. Eggman uses malicious Chao to destroy Station Square, but Tikal and Chaos arrive from the past, return the Chao to normal, and bring them back to the past. Soon, Sonic finds a machine in the desert and thinks nothing of it, but after fighting with Eggman in <a href="Paris">Paris</a> and a bizarre world created by the doctor, Eggman reveals the desert machine was his and it begins to wreck Station Square. Sonic defeats it, but he is accused of working with Eggman, so he and Eggman are both locked up. Nelson <a href="bail">bail</a>s Sonic out of jail, and he saves Cream and Chris from some ghosts.

Eggman enacts more malicious schemes based on holidays like <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a>, <a href="Valentine%27s%20Day">Valentine's Day</a> and <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Day">St. Patrick's Day</a>. Afterwards, he temporarily fires Decoe and Bocoe and creates replacements, Dukow and Bukow, who kidnap Sonic and give him to an organization called S.O.N.I.C.X. Sonic escapes with ease, but S.O.N.I.C.X. repeatedly tries to ruin his reputation. Meanwhile, the animals take on Eggman in his various schemes—including becoming a wrestler and creating a circus—to keep the Emeralds from him. In the final issue, a crossover with the continuity of the <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28comics%29">main comic series</a>, that continuity's <a href="Metal%20Sonic">Metal Sonic</a> appears and allies with Eggman to defeat Sonic, but that continuity's version of Shadow steps in and warps himself and Metal Sonic to another dimension, leading into the events of the first issue of "Sonic Universe".

In 2003, <a href="McDonald%27s">McDonald's</a> packaged five different single-button <a href="dedicated%20console">dedicated console</a> games, mostly based on various sports, with <a href="Happy%20Meal">Happy Meal</a>s to promote "Sonic X": two featuring Sonic and one each for Tails, Knuckles, and Shadow. Another Happy Meal game based on Big the Cat fishing arrived the following year.

<a href="LeapFrog%20Enterprises">LeapFrog Enterprises</a> released a "<a href="Sonic%20X%20%28video%20game%29">Sonic X</a>" <a href="educational%20entertainment">educational</a> math game for its <a href="Leapster">Leapster</a> handheld game console; it was released in 2005 in North America and 2007 in Europe. The game stars Sonic and Chris, who must rescue Tails, Amy, and Knuckles from Eggman. It is a fast-paced <a href="platform%20game">platform</a>/<a href="action%20game">action</a> game in which Sonic runs and jumps through levels and destroys Eggman's robots along the way. Periodically, Sonic must answer math questions to continue. The game features three levels, each with its own math concepts: the city Station Square (sequencing, counting in increments); Angel Island, the home of the Master Emerald (addition); and Eggman's base (subtraction). There are also math-based minigames unrelated to the levels to supplement these skills.

<a href="Score%20Entertainment">Score Entertainment</a> created a "Sonic X" <a href="collectible%20card%20game">collectible card game</a> for two players released in 2005. Players battle for Chaos Emeralds; whoever gets three first wins. Each turn, both players lay out five cards face-down and flip over one at a time; whichever card has a lower number value is eliminated. Eliminating the other player's cards and combining the special abilities of one's own cards allows one to score rings; whichever player has the most rings at the end of the turn wins an Emerald. As the game does not emphasize collecting rare cards, a few booster packs are enough to build a competent deck. KidzWorld gave a positive review, praising its ease of learning, low cost, and inherent strategy, but also noting that it feels more like a generic card game with "Sonic" characters than like a wholly "Sonic"-based product.

Conrad Zimmerman of Destructoid cited its "horrible localization" as a main reason for negativity. Tim Jones of THEM Anime gave the show two stars out of five and criticized the English voice acting: "It's really annoying how all the recent Sonic games use these untalented actors/actresses in their dubs, because they make the original English voices sound like award-winning performers." Other comments on the show's aesthetics were mostly positive. Staff of <a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> admitted, "At least the song fits. Can't imagine Sonic listening to "<a href="Sonic%20Underground">Underground</a>"s wailing <a href="Meat%20Loaf">Meat Loaf</a> <a href="soft%20rock">light rock</a>, but he'd definitely jam to "Sonic X"." Jones praised the <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> music from "Sonic Adventure 1" and "2", as well as the "pretty piano music" and "catchy" Japanese intro and outro themes. He also found the backgrounds "nice to look at" but did not like the use of CGI for Sonic's homing attack.

The human characters and, to a lesser extent, the animal ones were also criticized. Jones decried Chris as "a dull, boring, uninspired character" and also described Tanaka and Ella as "bland" stereotypes of <a href="Stereotypes%20of%20East%20Asians%20in%20the%20United%20States">Japanese</a> and <a href="Stereotypes%20of%20African%20Americans">African-Americans</a>, respectively. Jones also criticized the presence of Amy and Big, but took particular issue to the show's portrayal of Sonic, which he summarized as: I'm gonna run around downtown until something exciting happens and use a stinking <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28series%29%23Rings">Ring</a> to defeat my enemies. GamesRadar bemoaned both the "piss-poor "Adventure" characters" and the original human ones. In contrast, writer Gaz Plant of NintendoLife opined that "one of the key successes" of the series was its incorporation of numerous characters from the games, including lesser-used ones like Big and the Chaotix. Fans were divided on the merit of the Thorndykes.

The show was well received for faithfully following the format of the games. "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>" offered a uniformly positive review before the first episode broadcast in 2003, commending the skillful transition of the games' speed and style to animation, and expected the series to continue to grow more interesting. Plant stated that "where "Sonic X" truly succeeded was in its retelling of iconic stories". Independent of the characters involved, GamesRadar appreciated the idea of following "Sonic's core concept." The original storylines were also well received. Amidst his criticism of most of the show, Jones praised the first episode in general, especially its humor. Plant acclaimed the character development that built on the stories of the original games, especially Sonic's and Amy's relationship and the Chaotix's newfound viability as comedy devices. Concurrently, he found the show "surprisingly touching", particularly in its "emotional" final climax, and favorably compared the space exploration of season three to "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>". "Famitsu"s first preview called the story .

<a href="Common%20Sense%20Media">Common Sense Media</a> gave it three stars out of five and, while not commenting further on its quality, stated that it was appropriate for grade-school children but that some violent scenes were inadvisable for younger viewers. A second "Famitsu" review from later in 2003 called the anime an outstanding success and encouraged readers to tune in.

The show was quite popular in the United States and France, consistently reaching the number-one position in its timeslot in both countries. By 2007, it was TMS' best-selling anime in the non-Japanese market, despite that the third season never aired in Japan, and it inspired TMS to focus on properties that would sell well outside Japan. In April 2009, a six-year-old <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> boy named Christer pressed his parents to send a letter to King <a href="Harald%20V%20of%20Norway">Harald V of Norway</a> to approve his name being changed to "Sonic X". They allowed Christer to write it himself but did not send it until he badgered them further, and the king responded that he could not approve the change because Christer was not eighteen years old. Extending over a decade past the show's initial release, the phrase "gotta go fast" has been used in the titles of video game periodical articles to represent the "Sonic" series and other fast-paced video games.

Mother's Milk

Mother's Milk is the fourth studio album by American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>, released on August 16, 1989 by <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI Records</a>. After the death of founding guitarist <a href="Hillel%20Slovak">Hillel Slovak</a> and the subsequent departure of drummer <a href="Jack%20Irons">Jack Irons</a>, vocalist <a href="Anthony%20Kiedis">Anthony Kiedis</a> and bassist <a href="Flea%20%28musician%29">Flea</a> regrouped with the addition of guitarist <a href="John%20Frusciante">John Frusciante</a> and drummer <a href="Chad%20Smith">Chad Smith</a>. Frusciante's influence altered the band's sound by placing more emphasis on <a href="melody">melody</a> than <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a>, which had dominated the band's previous material. Returning producer <a href="Michael%20Beinhorn">Michael Beinhorn</a> favored <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> guitar riffs, as well as <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a> perceived by Frusciante as excessive, and as a result, Beinhorn and Frusciante constantly fought over the album's guitar sound.

"Mother's Milk" was a greater commercial success than the band's first three albums, peaking at number 52 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">US "Billboard" 200</a>. It received widespread recognition for the single "<a href="Knock%20Me%20Down">Knock Me Down</a>" and the <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a> cover "<a href="Higher%20Ground%20%28Stevie%20Wonder%20song%29%23Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20version">Higher Ground</a>", and became their first <a href="RIAA%20certification">gold record</a> in early 1990. Although it was not met with the same positive critical reception that its predecessor "<a href="The%20Uplift%20Mofo%20Party%20Plan">The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</a>" (1987) had garnered, "Mother's Milk" was the first step for the band in achieving international success and, according to Amy Hanson of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, "turned the tide and transformed the band from underground funk-rocking rappers to mainstream bad boys with seemingly very little effort".

After Red Hot Chili Peppers received a record deal with <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI Records</a> in 1983, the group established themselves as a prominent <a href="funk%20rock">funk rock</a> band with their 1984 debut album "<a href="The%20Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20%28album%29">The Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>". Disappointed with the results of the production, vocalist Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea replaced guitarist Jack Sherman with founding member <a href="Hillel%20Slovak">Hillel Slovak</a>, who had quit his band, What Is This?, several weeks before. The group's <a href="George%20Clinton%20%28musician%29">George Clinton</a>-produced second album, "<a href="Freaky%20Styley">Freaky Styley</a>" (1985), was Slovak's first effort with the band. "<a href="The%20Uplift%20Mofo%20Party%20Plan">The Uplift Mofo Party Plan</a>", which was released in 1987, saw original drummer <a href="Jack%20Irons">Jack Irons</a> return after he too left. The album, a critical success that peaked at number 148 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, is the only Red Hot Chili Peppers album the original members recorded together. Shortly following the ensuing tour, Slovak died of a heroin overdose and left the rest of the group in complete shock; Irons, citing an inability to cope with the death, quit. Kiedis and Flea, similarly devastated, were determined to persevere despite the loss of two key members. In September 1988 they chose <a href="DeWayne%20%26quot%3BBlackbyrd%26quot%3B%20McKnight">DeWayne "Blackbyrd" McKnight</a>, a friend of Clinton's and former member of the funk band <a href="Parliament%20%28band%29">Parliament</a>, to replace Slovak on guitar; <a href="D.%20H.%20Peligro">D. H. Peligro</a> of the <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> outfit <a href="Dead%20Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a> replaced Irons. The new lineup made it through three shows before the band felt McKnight didn't fit and he was fired. McKnight was so angry he threatened to burn Kiedis' house down. McKnight however was with the band long enough to record "Blues for Meister", the first Chili Peppers song featuring Flea on lead vocals and only song to feature Peligro as well. The song would appear a few years later on "<a href="Out%20in%20L.A.">Out in L.A.</a>".

The band wasn't without a guitarist for very long. In October 1988, Kiedis and Flea found a replacement for McKnight in teenage guitarist, <a href="John%20Frusciante">John Frusciante</a>. Flea had originally directed Frusciante to audition for the band <a href="Thelonious%20Monster">Thelonious Monster</a>. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [Frusciante] knows all the shit I don't know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes." Frusciante was also not very familiar with the funk genre: "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [Slovak's] playing and I just took it sideways from there."

With Frusciante in place and Peligro still on drums, the band embarked on a small tour and began writing music for the next album. It wasn't long though before the band felt they needed to part ways with Peligro as well, who had his own personal drug problems. Peligro, who helped co-write "Stone Cold Bush", "Taste the Pain" and "Sexy Mexican Maid" for the "Mother's Milk" album, was fired in late November 1988. Kiedis said it was one of the hardest things he had to do because they considered Peligro a good friend.

The band was now once again without a drummer and were forced to hold open auditions. The last to audition, Chad Smith, was a six-foot three-inch tall drummer who, according to Flea, "lit a fire under our asses". Kiedis later said the audition with Smith left "[the band] in a state of frenzied laughter that we couldn't shake out of for a half an hour". Smith came from such a different background than his other three bandmates. Kiedis, Flea and Frusciante were more into the punk rock scene while Smith was into classic rock and heavy metal. Smith was officially hired in December 1988 and played a handful of shows with the band to finish out the year.

Unlike the stop-start sessions for "The Uplift Mofo Party Plan", where Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs, pre-production for "Mother's Milk" went smoothly. Many of the songs had already been written, and some were even recorded by the time the band started pre-production in January 1989. "Taste the Pain" was recorded before Chad joined, and it featured Philip "Fish" Fisher on drums. The band recorded basic tracks at Hully Gully studios in <a href="Silver%20Lake%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Silver Lake</a>; songs like "Knock Me Down" were formed from <a href="jam%20session">jam session</a>s without any input from returning producer <a href="Michael%20Beinhorn">Michael Beinhorn</a>. According to Flea, the Hully Gully sessions bore fruit: "We played hard and fast more than [at] any other time in our career, I think. A lot of chops were going down [...] we played constantly, got to know each other, and came up with a record." Kiedis and Flea recognized that Frusciante's presence had become a significant influence on the band's new material as the Hully Gully sessions were proving to be extremely productive; Flea recalled that "[Frusciante] was an immense new element to the sound of our band and a big opening up for us."

The band entered the <a href="Ocean%20Way%20Recording">Ocean Way Recording</a> studio in <a href="Hollywood%2C%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Hollywood</a> in February 1989 to record "Mother's Milk". "It was weird when I first joined the band because we recorded the album after I'd been in the band for just a few months and Chad had actually been in for just two weeks", Frusciante recalled. "I was still a little bit confused about my position and we were just like four individuals. Music is all about welding people into a unit and with all the touring we've been doing we're now like an eight armed cosmic octopus!" Beinhorn pushed the Chili Peppers to produce the best possible takes for each of the record's thirteen tracks while the band hoped to obtain a hit record.

Although there had been stress and conflict during the recording of other Chili Peppers albums, the sessions for "Mother's Milk" were uncomfortable thanks to Beinhorn's incessant desire to create a hit. He recalled that he and the band were at odds, saying, "Suffice to say that I had a very intense personal relationship [with the band] and somewhere along the line I fell out with [them]." Beinhorn constantly clashed with Frusciante over guitar effects. According to Kiedis, "[Beinhorn] wanted John to have a big, crunching, almost metal-sounding guitar tone whereas before we always had some interesting acid-rock guitar tones as well as a lot of slinky, sexy, funky guitar tones." Frusciante was frustrated with the producer's attitude, and he ultimately resented his playing on the record, thinking that it was too "macho". Kiedis recalled that, in the end, "I couldn't tolerate his direction any longer. He was trying to squeeze something out of me that I wasn't feeling, and we got in a fight and I knew that I was done with him."

In March 1989, the Chili Peppers embarked on a two-month tour to break-in the new lineup. The "Positive Mental Octopus tour" saw the band play small venues throughout the United States, including several concerts on the East and West Coasts. At this time, Frusciante began asserting more energy and his ego "got a little swollen", according to Flea, "He was running around being rude to girls and getting them pissed off. But that's to be expected, I mean, shit, you're 18 years old and you want to get laid really bad and all of a sudden you're in a band, the girls want to fuck. You're bound to go crazy." Another incident, following a performance at the <a href="George%20Mason%20University">George Mason University</a> in <a href="Fairfax%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax</a>, Virginia, caused legal repercussions; a student accused Kiedis of engaging in sexual misconduct and indecent exposure. Kiedis was subsequently arrested and released on bail pending a trial that was to be set for a later date.

The band's style of music developed with the arrival of Frusciante; producer Michael Beinhorn observed, "It was apparent early on that John was the perfect guitarist for the band—he brought the elements of songwriting and composition to the band which they'd never truly had prior to his involvement. I believe that John is a pivotal figure in the Chili Peppers, being that he is such a distinctive songwriter." Frusciante altered the band's sound by introducing melodies, harmonies and more complex song structures. In contrast to the group's previous albums, which featured groove and rhythm-based songs, "Mother's Milk" contained melodic compositions that reflected the new guitarist's influence. Most of the record, due to Beinhorn's presence, is composed of heavy metal guitar riffs and excessive layering.

"Mother's Milk" features an array of musical styles in its thirteen tracks. Among the songs that surfaced from the Hully Gully sessions in early 1989, "<a href="Knock%20Me%20Down">Knock Me Down</a>" became one of the most radical shifts in style for the band. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have on life, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a <a href="Hedonism">hedonistic</a> lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with "anti-drug" sentiments, claiming, "[the song] is about letting your friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others when you need it, whether it's from drugs, or from a number of other personal problems." According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song "Knock Me Down" was "clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks." Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative</a> territory. "Knock Me Down" was originally recorded to be a duet between Kiedis and Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.

"<a href="Higher%20Ground%20%28Stevie%20Wonder%20song%29%23Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers%20version">Higher Ground</a>" became another song that helped the band achieve international success. <a href="Higher%20Ground%20%28Stevie%20Wonder%20song%29">Originally written and recorded in 1973</a> by R&B singer <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>, the track was, according to Flea, a perfect cover for the band: "[...] the lyrics are great. Especially as far as the situation that the band has been in, as far as state of mind, for the past few months. That song is really about raising and uplifting yourself spiritually." The bassist affirmed that the reason the band covered the song was to pay homage to Wonder and the important role he played in popular music. The cover begins with a funk bass-line, followed by multi-layered heavy metal guitar progressions and effects-treated vocals. "Higher Ground"'s chorus features backing vocals from an array of friends and engineers who worked on the record; the individuals' competence in singing was irrelevant to the band because they sought to achieve a sense of unity. "Mother's Milk" was composed of a variety of songs that expanded the Chili Peppers' repertoire. The instrumental "Pretty Little Ditty" was one of the few songs that featured no guitar layering; Apter notes that the song is "a dreamy, sweetly stoned instrumental featured deft picking and strumming from Frusciante, intertwined with blasts of trumpet from Flea." The eclectic track was originally intended to be over three minutes long, but was cut to just under 2 minutes before the album's release. "<a href="Taste%20the%20Pain">Taste the Pain</a>" reflects a more meditative and melodic theme, similar to "Knock Me Down". Frusciante introduces psychedelic guitar progressions in the verse, while the lyrics touch on themes of love and loss. Other tracks such as "Stone Cold Bush" presented topics of prostitution while "Punk Rock Classic" was, in retrospect, an emulation of typical <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> songs by <a href="Black%20Flag%20%28band%29">Black Flag</a> and <a href="Germs%20%28band%29">The Germs</a>—bands that were influential to the Chili Peppers.

"Mother's Milk" features a black and white photograph of the band sprawled across the arms of a proportionately larger naked woman. A rose conceals one of her nipples while Kiedis' standing body conceals the other. There were originally two women whose photographs were planned to be used, one being Kiedis' girlfriend <a href="Ione%20Skye">Ione Skye</a> and the other being model Dawn Alane; the latter was ultimately chosen. Controversy arose, however, when Dawn claimed the band did not notify her that she was the one chosen to be on the cover of "Mother's Milk". Furthermore, several national chains refused to sell the record because they believed the female subject displayed too much nudity. A more strictly censored version was manufactured for some retailers that featured the band members in far larger proportion than the original. The cover of the record was influenced by a promotional poster Kiedis had from the 1960s of <a href="Sly%20and%20the%20Family%20Stone">Sly and the Family Stone</a>, in which frontman <a href="Sly%20Stone">Sly Stone</a> held a miniaturized band in his palm. When Kiedis was finding shots of the band to use on the cover, Frusciante initially refused every photograph the vocalist showed him but settled on one of him sitting down laughing. "Mother's Milk" was affixed with an "explicit language" warning sticker that, according to Kiedis, "[D]oesn't bother me. Our lyrics are very explicit, whether it's about sex or friendship or love for life in general." The cover booklet of the record features a painting by Hillel Slovak. Following the album's release, a limited number of promotional posters were issued with the model's breasts exposed. Dawn had no knowledge of the pressing and sued the band, winning a $50,000 settlement.

The singles for "Mother's Milk" followed a similar artistic theme. The cover of "Knock Me Down" featured the band shirtless, in front of a photograph of an elephant in an African setting. "Higher Ground" was similar in that all four members—photographs of which were taken from the music video—were printed in front of a large image of Kiedis' face. "Taste the Pain" featured the band together with a red and yellow background with the Chili Peppers' asterisk adjacent to the typeface.
A promotional 12" titled "<a href="For%20the%20Thrashers">For the Thrashers</a>", which contained four songs from the album, was released to radio stations to promote the then forthcoming album in the weeks leading up to its release. Director Drew Carolan shot a promotional video for "<a href="Good%20Time%20Boys">Good Time Boys</a>" which was released on the 1989 Hard 'n Heavy Vol. 2 collection. The video, which has never been released elsewhere by the band or even acknowledged as an official video, featured the band performing the song with cut away scenes of the band being interviewed discussing the album and their sound. Carolan was also hired to film the music videos for album's first two singles, "Higher Ground" and "Knock Me Down" before the release of "Mother's Milk". The initial premise for "Higher Ground" was to have the song's original writer, Stevie Wonder, sit in the <a href="lotus%20position">lotus position</a> as the Chili Peppers dance around him; however, Wonder declined to be in the video. Kiedis gave full creative license to Carolan on the condition that he "make us [the band] look like the Gods of Funk." While the video for "Higher Ground" was intended to be upbeat and exuberant, "Knock Me Down" was filmed to be more poignant; Carolan recalls, "It was a very special track for the band and it needed to be treated with the utmost care and respect. Anthony and Flea just wanted it to be real soulful with a sense of urgency." The videos took a day each to complete and were filmed with relatively small budgets, but the outcome, as Jeff Apter notes, "[B]ecame key elements of [the album's] success." "Knock Me Down" is notable for featuring an appearance by actor <a href="Alex%20Winter">Alex Winter</a>, who would co-direct the video for the band's third single, "Taste the Pain". <a href="MTV">MTV</a> introduced the band's videos into their daily rotation, highlighting the band as up-and-coming and "one to watch".

Although more commercially successful than the band's previous albums, "Mother's Milk" received mixed reviews from critics who were unimpressed with the excessive distortion found throughout the album. However, it was praised as well; Amy Hanson of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called it "a pivotal album for the Red Hot Chili Peppers," and believed that "if anyone doubted the pulsating power that leapt from the blistering opener, 'Good Time Boys', it took only a few bars of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' outrageous, and brilliant, interpretation of the Stevie Wonder classic 'Higher Ground' to prove that this new lineup was onto something special. Wrapping up with the aptly titled and truly punked-out 'Punk Rock Classic' and the band's own punched-up tribute to '<a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a>', "Mother's Milk" was everything the band had hoped for, and a little more besides." Steve Morse of "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" called it a "high-octane fusion of metal, funk and rap—sort of Prince meets Jimi Hendrix in the Twilight Zone," while noting that "Knock Me Down" combined "electrifying musicianship". "<a href="The%20Toronto%20Star">The Toronto Star</a>" commented that the Red Hot Chili Peppers were "the <a href="The%20Mothers%20of%20Invention">Mothers of Invention</a> for the 1990s." In 2005, "Mother's Milk" was ranked number 359 in "Rock Hard" magazine's book of "The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time".

While Carly Darlin of "<a href="The%20Orange%20County%20Register">The Orange County Register</a>" found the album to be "an energetic and fun restatement of the RHCP whiplash funk attitude", she believed that "with the exception of the dreamy instrumental 'Pretty Little Ditty', it doesn't break any new ground." She continued by saying that, if anything ""Mother's Milk" is a slight step away from the party-funk grooves of the last two albums and a return to the band's punk-rock roots. They even reprise the cover of Jimi Hendrix's 'Fire', which they did as a B-side for their 'Fight Like A Brave' 12-inch two years ago." Furthermore, Mark Jenkins of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" said "the polite term for albums like 'Milk' is 'eclectic', but it really sounds as if the band is unraveling [...] Considering the circumstances, it's not especially surprising that the album seems to be looking for someone to give it directions." However, Jenkins did believe Frusciante possessed "solid metal chops and means to show them off." "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>" critic <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> mocked the band's ability to promote empathy and found the guitar layering in "Mother's Milk" to have been done improperly: "punks who loved Hendrix and P-Funk way way back, they're finally cashing in on their good taste, and though unbelievers dis their sincerity, execution's the problem. They didn't have the chops to bring it off then, and by pushing the guitar up front they sound even cruder now. But they're perfectly nice fellas, really—mention 'compassion' in the very first verse."

Released on August 16, 1989, "Mother's Milk" peaked at number 52 on the U.S. <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> The record failed to chart in the United Kingdom and Europe, but climbed to number 33 in Australia. "Knock Me Down" reached number six on the U.S. <a href="Modern%20Rock%20Tracks">Modern Rock Tracks</a> whereas "Higher Ground" charted at number eleven; the latter of the two ultimately proved to be more successful, however, by influencing foreign charts at number fifty-four in the UK and forty-five in Australia and France.<ref name="Billboard singles">

The Wiggles

The Wiggles are an Australian <a href="children%27s%20music">children's music</a> group formed in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, in 1991. Since 2012, the group members are <a href="Anthony%20Field">Anthony Field</a>, <a href="Lachlan%20Gillespie">Lachlan Gillespie</a>, <a href="Simon%20Pryce">Simon Pryce</a>, and <a href="Emma%20Watkins">Emma Watkins</a>. The original members were Field, <a href="Phillip%20Wilcher">Phillip Wilcher</a>, <a href="Murray%20Cook">Murray Cook</a>, <a href="Greg%20Page%20%28musician%29">Greg Page</a>, and <a href="Jeff%20Fatt">Jeff Fatt</a>. Wilcher left the group after their first album. Page retired in 2006 due to ill health and was replaced by understudy <a href="Sam%20Moran">Sam Moran</a>, but returned in 2012, replacing Moran. At the end of 2012, Page, Cook, and Fatt retired, and were replaced by Gillespie, Pryce, and Watkins. Cook and Fatt retained their shareholding in the group and all three continued to have input into its creative and production aspects.

Field and Fatt were members of the Australian pop band <a href="The%20Cockroaches">The Cockroaches</a> in the 1980s, and Cook was a member of several bands before meeting Field and Page at <a href="Macquarie%20University">Macquarie University</a>, where they were studying to become pre-school teachers. In 1991, Field was inspired to create an album of children's music based upon concepts of early childhood education, and enlisted Cook, Page, and Fatt to assist him. They began touring to promote the album, and became so successful, they quit their teaching jobs to perform full-time. The group augmented their act with <a href="The%20Wiggles%20characters">animal characters</a> Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog, as well as the character Captain Feathersword, played by <a href="Paul%20Paddick">Paul Paddick</a> since 1993. They travelled with a small group of dancers, which later grew into a larger troupe. The group's DVDs, CDs, and television programs have been produced independently since their inception. Their high point came in the early 2000s, after they broke into the American market.

The group was formally <a href="Consolidation%20%28business%29">consolidated</a> in 2005. They were listed at the top of "<a href="Business%20Review%20Weekly">Business Review Weekly</a>"s top-earning Australian entertainers four years in a row, and earned <a href="Australian%20dollar">A$</a>45 million in 2009. In 2011, the worldwide recession hit The Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned $28 million, but they still appeared second on BRW's list that year. The Wiggles have enjoyed almost universal approval throughout their history, and their music has been played in pre-schools all over the world. They have earned several Platinum, Double Platinum and Multi-Platinum records, as well as sold 23 million DVDs and 7 million CDs, and have performed, on average, to one million people per year. The group has also earned multiple <a href="APRA%20Awards%20%28Australia%29">Australasian Performing Rights Association (APRA)</a> and <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards">Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Music Awards</a>.

<a href="Anthony%20Field">Anthony Field</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Fatt">Jeff Fatt</a> were members of <a href="The%20Cockroaches">The Cockroaches</a>, a Sydney pop band known for their "good-time R&B material" and several singles recorded by independent labels during the 1980s. In 1988, Field's infant niece, who was the daughter of Cockroaches founder and band member <a href="Paul%20Field%20%28musician%29">Paul Field</a>, died of <a href="Sudden%20infant%20death%20syndrome">SIDS</a>, and the group disbanded. Anthony Field enrolled at <a href="Macquarie%20University">Macquarie University</a> in Sydney to complete his degree in <a href="early%20childhood%20education">early childhood education</a>, and later stated that his niece's death "ultimately led to the formation of [The] Wiggles". <a href="Murray%20Cook">Murray Cook</a>, also "a mature-aged student", was the guitarist in the pub rock band <a href="Bang%20Shang%20a%20Lang">Bang Shang a Lang</a> before enrolling at Macquarie. <a href="Greg%20Page%20%28musician%29">Greg Page</a>, who had been a <a href="roadie">roadie</a> for and sang with The Cockroaches during their final years, had enrolled in Macquarie to study early childhood education on Field's recommendation. Field, Cook, and Page were among approximately 10 men in a program with 200 students.

In 1991, while still a student, Field became motivated to use concepts in the field of early childhood education to record an album of music for children. The album was dedicated to Field's niece. A song he wrote for The Cockroaches, "Get Ready to Wiggle", inspired the band's name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance. Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album. They needed a keyboardist "to bolster the rock'n'roll feel of the project", so Field asked his old bandmate Fatt for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project.

The group received songwriting help from <a href="John%20Field%20%28songwriter%29">John Field</a>, Anthony's brother and former bandmate, and from <a href="Phillip%20Wilcher">Phillip Wilcher</a>, who was working with the early childhood music program at Macquarie. After contributing to their first album, hosting the group's first recording sessions in his Sydney home, and appearing in a couple of the group's first videos, Wilcher left the group and went into classical music. The group reworked a few Cockroaches tunes to better fit the genre of children's music; for example, The Cockroaches song "Hot Tamale", written by John Field, was changed to "Hot Potato". Anthony Field gave copies of their album to his young students to test out the effect of the group's music on children; one mother returned it the next day because her child would not stop listening to it.
To promote their first album, The Wiggles filmed two music videos with the <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (ABC) and created a self-produced, forty-minute-long video version. Finances were limited, so there was no post-production editing of the video project. They used Field's nieces and nephews as additional cast, and hired the band's girlfriends to perform in character costumes. Cook's wife made their first costumes. They used two cameras and visually checked the performance of each song; that way, according to Paul Field, it took them less time to complete a forty-minute video than it took other production companies to complete a three-minute music video.

The Cockroaches' former manager, Jeremy Fabinyi, became the group's first manager. Using their previous connections, he negotiated with the ABC to air their TV show and to help them promote their first recording. The album cost approximately A$4,000 to produce and it sold 100,000 copies in 1991. Field and Cook got teaching jobs, while Page finished his degree, so they could only perform during school holidays; finding time to do so was, as Field reported, "challenging". Fabinyi advised them to tour in unusual settings throughout Sydney and New South Wales. The Wiggles' debut performance was at a friend's daycare facility in <a href="Randwick%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Randwick</a>, for about a dozen children. They played for crowds at shopping centres like <a href="Westfield%20Group">Westfield</a> in Sydney and at small pre-school events and parties, and <a href="busking">busked</a> at <a href="Circular%20Quay">Circular Quay</a>, then moved on to regional tours and shows for playgroup associations, averaging about 300 people in the audience. They were promoted by local <a href="Pre-school%20playgroup">playgroups</a> or <a href="Australian%20Breastfeeding%20Association">nursing mothers' associations</a> with whom they split their proceeds. They performed at pre-schools with other ABC children's performers; when 500 people attended these concerts just to see The Wiggles, they started doing their own shows, and according to Field, "Suddenly people started rolling up to performances in astonishing numbers".

In 1993, Field, Cook, and Page decided to give up teaching for a year to focus on performing full-time, along with Fatt, to see if they could make a living out of it. As Fatt reported, "it was very much a <a href="cottage%20industry">cottage industry</a>". They used many of the <a href="The%20Wiggles%20Pty%20Ltd">business techniques</a> developed by The Cockroaches, choosing to remain as independent and self-contained as possible. John Field, Mike Conway, who later became The Wiggles' general manager, trumpeter Dominic Lindsay, and Cockroaches saxophonist Daniel Fallon performed with them. Anthony Field, with input from the other members, did most of the production of their music, DVDs, and live shows. Their act was later augmented with supporting characters: the "friendly pirate" Captain Feathersword and the animal characters Dorothy the Dinosaur, Henry the Octopus, and Wags the Dog. These characters were initially performed by the band members themselves: Field played Captain Feathersword and Wags; Cook played Dorothy; and Fatt played Henry. In 1993, actor <a href="Paul%20Paddick">Paul Paddick</a>, who became known as "the fifth Wiggle" and was as popular as the bandmembers, permanently joined the group to play Captain Feathersword. At first, the group travelled with a small group of dancers hired from a local dance studio to perform with them.

After the production of their second album, The Wiggles, who were called by their first names when they performed, began to wear costumes on stage as Fabinyi suggested and as The Cockroaches had done, and adopted colour-coded shirts: Greg in yellow, Murray in red, Jeff in purple, and Anthony in blue. The coloured shirts also made it easier for their young audience to identify them. As Field reported, the decision to emphasise colour was "a no-brainer, considering our pre-school-age audience". Cook and Fatt already owned shirts in their colours, but Field and Page "met in a Sydney department store and literally raced to see who got the blue shirt". Another early development used throughout the group's history was their signature finger-wagging move, which was created by Cook after seeing professional bowlers do it on television. They used the move when being photographed with children because it was their policy that touching children, no matter how innocently, was inappropriate. It also protected them from possible litigation; as Paddick has explained, "There is no doubting where their hands are".

Through the rest of the 1990s, The Wiggles maintained a busy recording and touring schedule, becoming as Field reported and despite his strong dislike of touring, "the hardest-working touring act in the country". They released multiple albums and home videos and, depending upon the word of mouth of their audience, performed to increasingly large audiences in Australia and New Zealand despite having to re-introduce themselves to a new audience of children every three years. They produced a new album and video each year and toured to promote them. By late 1993, they "grew bigger than anyone had thought", and hundreds attended their concerts; by 1995 they had set records for music and video sales. In 1997, <a href="Twentieth%20Century%20Fox">Twentieth Century Fox</a> produced a feature-length film, "<a href="The%20Wiggles%20Movie">The Wiggles Movie</a>", which became the fifth-highest grossing Australian film of 1998, earning over a million-and-a-half dollars.

In spite of their early success in Australia, Paul Field reported that the band was unable to produce a television program on the ABC, where they felt they would receive the most exposure to the pre-school market. "Around 1996–1997", they filmed a television pilot for the ABC, but as "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" reported in 2002, "the project never got off the ground due to irreconcilable artistic differences". As a result, The Wiggles financed a TV program of 13 episodes themselves and sold it to the Disney Channel in Australia and to <a href="Seven%20Network">Channel Seven</a>, where it became a hit. By 1998, The Wiggles were ready to move on to international markets, despite its members' health issues, especially Field's. The reaction of producers in the UK was less positive than the group would have liked, although they were eventually able to make inroads there, but their real success came in the US. Disney arranged for them to perform at <a href="Disneyland%20Park%20%28Anaheim%29">Disneyland</a> in California, where they were discovered by <a href="Lyrick%20Studios">Lyrick Studios</a>, the producers of "<a href="Barney%20%26amp%3B%20Friends">Barney & Friends</a>." Both Anthony and Paul Field reported that Lyrick, despite their initial misgivings about whether American audiences would accept the band's Australian accents, came to understand The Wiggles and their goals, and after successful tests with American children, enthusiastically promoted them.

The Wiggles used many of the same promotion techniques in the US that they had used in Australia, and chose to keep their concerts simple and maintain the same values that were successful in Australia. The Wiggles performed during the intermission of "Barney Live" stage shows, which "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" likened to "getting the warm-up slot for <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">the Stones</a>" in the pre-school entertainment world. In 2000, when video sales took off in the US, Lyrick began to distribute Wiggles videos and advertised them by including Wiggles shorts as trailers in their "Barney" videos, which, as Anthony Field stated, "pushed us over the edge". At first, the group's videos were distributed in boutique stores such as <a href="FAO%20Schwarz">FAO Schwarz</a> and <a href="Zany%20Brainy">Zany Brainy</a>, and on-line. According to Paul Field, they entered the mass media market when their videos became top-sellers at <a href="Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a>, and their first two videos, "Yummy Yummy" and "Wiggle Time", landed in the top ten at Amazon.com. Stores such as <a href="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> began to take notice, and began to sell Wiggles videos. The band released nine DVDs in the next three years to keep up with the demand.

As they had done in Australia, The Wiggles chose to tour, but start off small, with simple props and sets instead of hiring a touring company. Some of their first appearances in America were at <a href="Blockbuster%20Video">Blockbuster Video</a> parking lots to small audiences—as Fatt said, "a dozen people". They performed at small venues such as church halls and 500-seat theatres in Brooklyn and New Jersey, and upgraded to larger venues as ticket sales increased. Anthony Field reported that one week they would perform to 8,000 in Sydney and to 20 people the following week at a parking lot in a small town in the US. One time, they performed for a dozen people at the <a href="Mall%20of%20America">Mall of America</a> in Minnesota, but half of the audience were hired by Lyrick. Eventually, they moved to larger arenas such as the <a href="Beacon%20Theatre%20%28New%20York%20City%29">Beacon Theatre</a> and <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a>. They performed at <a href="SeaWorld%20Orlando">SeaWorld</a> in <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando, Florida</a>, for six weeks. Their audiences began to increase, and they toured Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, the US, and the UK.

The Wiggles' popularity in the US increased "in the shell-shocked weeks after the <a href="11%20September%202001%20attacks">terrorist attacks</a> on New York City in 2001", when the group performed there, even when other acts cancelled their tours, a decision that earned them loyalty and respect. According to Cook, the press proclaimed that they were braver than many Australian sports teams that had cancelled their appearances. Paul Field stated, "New York has really embraced them. It was a kind of watershed." Strong sales of The Wiggles videos eventually caught the attention of the <a href="Disney%20Channel">Disney Channel</a> in the US, who was impressed by their "strong pro-social message". In January 2002, Disney began showing Wiggles video clips between their programs. By June of that year, the popularity of the clips prompted the Disney Channel to add both seasons of "The Wiggles" series to their schedule and showed full episodes multiple times per day. Field reported that despite their "modest production values", the shows were popular with pre-schoolers.

Beginning in 2002, The Wiggles filmed four seasons' worth of shows exclusively with the ABC. The network called them "the most successful property that the ABC has represented in the pre-school genre". By the end of 2002, according to Field, "we knew we were involved in something extraordinary in the US". Their concert schedule in North America doubled, seemingly overnight; they began performing up to 520 shows per year all over the world. They also began to produce other stage shows in places The Wiggles themselves were unable to visit, in Australia, the UK, and US, that featured their characters, a host, and a few dancers. "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" called this time period (about the mid-2000s) the group's "high point"; they earned A$45 million a year in revenues, and had several licensing deals and an international distribution agreement with Disney.

Despite their success, founding member Anthony Field almost left the group in 2004, shortly after his marriage and the birth of his first child, due to his serious medical issues, which were worsened by The Wiggles' demanding tour schedule. After meeting <a href="chiropractor">chiropractor</a> <a href="James%20Stoxen">James Stoxen</a> in Chicago, Field improved his health to the point that he was able to continue. He began to hire teams of chiropractors for himself, his fellow bandmembers, and castmembers in every city they performed, which he credited with making it possible for them to fulfill their touring requirements.

In December 2005, lead singer and founding member Page, at age 33, underwent a double hernia operation. He withdrew from The Wiggles' US tour in August 2006, after suffering fainting spells, lethargy, nausea, and loss of balance. He returned to Australia, where doctors diagnosed his condition as <a href="orthostatic%20intolerance">orthostatic intolerance</a>, a chronic but not life-threatening condition. Page's final performance with The Wiggles was in <a href="Kingston%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Kingston, Rhode Island</a>.

On 30 November 2006, the Wiggles announced Page's retirement from the group. "I'll miss being a part of The Wiggles very much, but this is the right decision because it will allow me to focus on managing my health", Page said in a video message, which "The Sydney Morning Herald" called "unsettling", posted on the group's web page. Page was replaced by <a href="Sam%20Moran">Sam Moran</a>, who had served as an understudy for The Wiggles for five years and had already stood in for Page for 150 shows. Initially, The Wiggles struggled over their decision to replace Page, but after their audience's positive response to Moran, they decided to continue as a group because they thought that was what their young audience would want. According to Fatt, who called it "a huge decision" and "a teachable moment" for them, they chose to be honest with their young audience as they made the transition from Page to Moran. As part owner of The Wiggles, Page received a payout of about $20 million.

Although Moran's transition as The Wiggles' lead singer was "smooth" for the young children of their audience, it was more difficult for their parents. Moran said that "most children understood". Field reported that by the group's 20th anniversary in 2011, due to the ever-changing nature of their audience, most of their young fans were unfamiliar with Page. Cook stated that Moran's transition was challenging for the group because since he replaced their lead singer, it changed their sound. Fatt characterised Moran's singing style as more operatic, so they chose different keys to sing and perform. The Wiggles never publicly disclosed how much Moran was paid, but it was reported that he earned $200,000 per year. Moran was featured in his first DVD and CD as a member of the group in early 2008, and a sixth season of The Wiggles' television series featuring Moran was filmed and began airing in Australia.

At the end of 2007, The Wiggles donated their complete back catalogue of 27 master tapes to Australia's <a href="National%20Film%20and%20Sound%20Archive">National Film and Sound Archive</a>. Their business ventures during these years included opening up "Wiggles World" sections in theme parks in North America and the Arab World, internet offerings, the creation of new television shows, and a five-year-long partnership with the digital cable channel <a href="PBS%20Kids%20Sprout">Sprout</a> in 2009. In December 2010, Cinemalive beamed a Wiggles concert live from <a href="Acer%20Arena">Acer Arena</a> into movie theatres all over Australia, for children and their families unable to attend their shows.

In early July 2011, founding member Fatt developed <a href="Heart%20arrhythmia">arrhythmia</a> and underwent "urgent but routine" heart surgery, when he was fitted with a <a href="pacemaker">pacemaker</a> after feeling unwell for several weeks and blacking out. He missed the group's US tour as a result, after not missing a show in 20 years. Also in mid-2011, The Wiggles celebrated their 20th anniversary with circus-themed shows and performances throughout Australia and the <a href="outback">outback</a> in a circus tent, as well as a "physically grueling" birthday-themed tour of 90 shows throughout Australia, which Paul Field called "one of the biggest of their careers". Sydney's <a href="Powerhouse%20Museum">Powerhouse Museum</a> commemorated the group's anniversary with an exhibit that displayed Wiggles memorabilia.

In 2011, the worldwide financial crisis hit the group, and they recorded their first drop in revenues in 10 years, at approximately $2.5 million, a total decrease of 28 percent. Royalties partially offset the difference between their 2010 and 2011 revenues. Their managing director Mike Conway called 2011 their toughest year financially. For the first time, they had <a href="negative%20equity">negative equity</a>, with more liabilities than assets, and the owners had to provide the funds for them to continue operations. Conway stated that their losses were due to less touring time in the US, difficulties in placing their DVDs in <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a>, and their required investment in a new digital platform.

In January 2012, and amidst a great deal of controversy, The Wiggles announced that Page had regained his health and was returning to The Wiggles. He returned as an employee "exactly on the same level as Sam", rather than a co-owner, having relinquished his business interest in the group after he left in 2006. According to "The Sydney Morning Herald", interest in Page's return was sparked when they met during the group's induction in the <a href="ARIA%20Hall%20of%20Fame">ARIA Hall of Fame</a> in November 2011. After it was decided that Moran would no longer continue on as the Yellow Wiggle, the group asked Page to return, only until August 2012, "to help transition from Sam [Moran] to a new Yellow Wiggle." "<a href="BRW%20%28magazine%29">Business Review Weekly</a>" reported that the presentation of Moran's departure had been mishandled and had potentially damaged their brand image. Paul Field agreed, stating that they "could have handled the communication and management of the transition better". Cook later admitted that they were shocked by the backlash in the press and among the parents of their audience.

As part of his severance package, Moran continued to collect song royalties and was granted use of The Wiggles' studios.

In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; <a href="Emma%20Watkins">Emma Watkins</a>, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, <a href="Lachlan%20Gillespie">Lachlan Gillespie</a> replaced Fatt, and <a href="Simon%20Pryce">Simon Pryce</a>, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook. Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band "was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.

The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people. Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce wore "In Training" T-shirts, and debuted the song "Do the Propeller!" during these concerts. The final televised performance of the original band members, along with the new members, was on 22 December 2012, during the annual <a href="Carols%20in%20the%20Domain">Carols in the Domain</a> in Sydney. Their final performance, after over 7000 shows over the years, was on 23 December at the <a href="Sydney%20Entertainment%20Centre">Sydney Entertainment Centre</a>.

Also by 2012, The Wiggles performed to audiences whose parents attended their shows in their early years, and they were hiring performers who were part of their audience as young children. The Wiggles began airing a show on <a href="Sirius%20XM">Sirius XM</a> satellite radio in late 2012, featuring the original members and their replacements, and stories and games for young listeners. In December, the group auctioned their famous "Big Red Car" (called the "iconic Volkswagen Beetle Cabriolet") for charity for almost A$36,000 on the auction site <a href="eBay">eBay</a>. The money was donated to the Melbourne-based charity SIDS and Kids.

The new iteration of The Wiggles, with Field and its new members, began touring in early 2013. Cook became the group's road manager in mid-2013. Pryce reported that since The Wiggles' audience changed every few years, the transition to the new group was easier for their young audience than it was for their parents. One of their challenges, especially for their early tours, was learning The Wiggles' catalogue of 1400 songs. In early 2016, Pryce described The Wiggles' competitive culture of fitness, especially among the male cast, by citing the group's grueling performance schedule, saying, "Sometimes it feels like it's an extreme sport".

After a seven-year absence from Australian television, they filmed a new show, called "Ready, Steady, Wiggle", filmed in their spare time at their studio in Sydney between tours and on the road. Watkins, who had a film-making degree, played an important role in its production. The series was picked up by the on-line streaming service <a href="Hulu">Hulu</a> in 2015. Anthony Field admitted that they found it "hard going" until they returned to television. Merchandise featuring the original group outsold the new group's products, and they failed to sell-out their concerts.

By 2015, Paul Field called the new group "an amazing success". By that time, they had produced 8 CDs and DVDs, and 3 new television series. Field reported that the new group went through the same process as the original group in terms of audience acceptance and "benchmarks of success". They performed to sell-out audiences throughout Australia, had high sales of their DVDs and CDs, and won an ARIA in 2014. According to Kathy McCabe of <a href="News%20Corp%20Australia">News Corp Australia</a>, it took 18 months for the new group to be accepted by their audience. McCabe credited their success to Watkins, who became the group's stand-out member. According to Field, an American journalist called her young fans, who came to concerts dressed in yellow and wearing bows like her, the "mini Emma army". She was so popular, she starred in her own TV show, called "Emma", without the other Wiggles, in 2015. Field called her "an aspirational role model" for their young audience and reported that she had increased their fan base of girls. Field stated that the audience emulated her fashion choices, opening up new merchandising possibilities for the group.

In 2014, The Wiggles doubled their ticket sales from the year before and played in sold-out venues all over Australia and the world for 250,000 fans. <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20Sydney">Hyde Park</a> in Sydney had to be closed on <a href="Australia%20Day">Australia Day</a> because fans filled it to see the group perform. They continued to sell-out concerts throughout 2015. Also in 2015, the group produced their DVD, "Rock and Roll Preschool", featuring musician <a href="David%20Campbell%20%28Australian%20musician%29">David Campbell</a>, and it was announced that The Wiggles would produce their second feature film; comedian <a href="Ben%20Elton">Ben Elton</a> was slated to write the script and co-write the soundtrack. In early 2015, Gillespie and Watkins revealed that they had been dating for two years; they announced their engagement in May 2015. They were married on 9 April 2016 at Hopewood House in Bowral in New South Wales, Australia. In August 2018, Gillespie and Watkins announced their separation.

The Wiggles celebrated their 25th anniversary with a performance by the new members, published as a free <a href="podcast">podcast</a> on <a href="ITunes%20Store">iTunes</a>, in front of the <a href="Apple%20Store">Apple Store</a> in Sydney in January 2016. In February, the original group members were to perform a charity concert for their fans over the age of 18, who were part of their first audiences, at the Dee Why RSL club in Sydney. A new television series, called "Wiggle Wiggle Wiggle", premiered in Canada in September 2017. Based on a segment from the series, a new range of nursery items was launched in January 2019, catering for babies and toddlers under the new "Little Wiggles" branding.

Former members

The Wiggles have written new music each year since their inception; they sequestered themselves for a month each summer and wrote three albums' worth of original children's music based on simple concepts familiar to young children, and using several genres of music and types of instruments. Most of their songs were short and started with the chorus because they felt that young children needed to be presented with a song's topic in their first few lines. They wrote songs individually at first, but eventually wrote as a group, often with John Field, trumpet player Dominic Lindsay, and Paddick. Fatt, the only member of the original group without a degree in early childhood education, tended to focus on composing music. Fatt told reporter Brian McElhiney, who called the group's songwriting process "a collaborate affair", that they wrote repetitive pop songs or jingles, which were appealing to children. Watkins reported that she was invited to write songs for their albums, even though she was primarily a dancer. <a href="John%20Fogerty">John Fogerty</a> of <a href="Creedence%20Clearwater%20Revival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>, who appeared in a Wiggles video in 2002, told "The New York Times" that he was "very impressed" with the group's songwriting, especially with their <a href="Hearing%20the%20shape%20of%20a%20drum">drum sound</a>.

According to Field, the transition from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for The Wiggles. "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from what we did in The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by <a href="nursery%20rhymes">nursery rhymes</a>, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. Page reported, "First and foremost, we're entertainers". The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.

The group wrote and performed children's music that was different from what had been done previously; as Cook stated, "we didn't just go down the route of what people think is kids' music". They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. "Guitar Magazine" speculated that since Cook was one of the first guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. I think it would be really nice if in 15 years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [The] Wiggles". In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like <a href="Regular%20John">Regular John</a> approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band "they got into".

The Wiggles' songwriting and performances were rooted in their professional training as pre-school teachers and in the concepts of early childhood education. Anthony Field reported, as he studied music for young children at university, being "shocked ... at the non-inclusive way music for children was usually performed". According to Field, children had to sit silently as musicians played "traditional songs often featuring negative or outdated lyrics and dealing with subject matter of no interest to small children". The lack of songs with themes and topics that interested children inspired Field to record The Wiggles' first album.

The group's "golden rule", according to Field, was to make the content of their songs and shows "developmentally appropriate and fun". Their music, stage shows, and television and DVD productions were developed, as "The New York Times" reported, "from the premise that a young child has a short attention span, is curious about a limited number of objects and activities, loves having a job to do and is thrilled by mastering basic movements". They also respected their audience's intelligence and insight about entertainment, information, and honesty. As Field said, "Young children identify with relevant concepts, and enjoy being entertained and being part of the entertainment. They are willing to commit to interacting if you are direct, inclusive, and positive". The group understood that challenging young children to engage in difficult tasks is more effective than simply telling them to do it. They believed that young children were egocentric, so they stared continually into the camera in their videos and TV shows, and explained every action because they believed that young children needed to be told what to expect so that they do not feel left out and in order to feel safe.
The Wiggles' stage shows were full of action and audience participation. By the group's "New Wiggles" iteration, "The Sydney Morning Herald" called their shows slick and fast-paced, with inside jokes for the adult members of their audience. The bandmembers tended to wander throughout the audience, "thrilling toddlers and smartphone wielding guardians alike". Pryce, as an experienced stage performer, was conscious that their shows were the first live theater young children experienced; as a result, the group adapted the content of their shows to accommodate their audience's development and understanding. Paddick's role as Captain Feathersword became more important in the mid-1990s, especially in the group's stage shows, when he was able to incorporate his circus and opera training, as well as impersonations that were popular with their audience's parents.

They believed in empowering children by practices such as greeting their audience members with "Hello, everyone", instead of "Hello, boys and girls" because as Paul Field has explained, the second greeting "unnecessarily separates children and has undertones of condescension". Kathleen Warren, the group's former professor at Macquarie University, believed that the group's practice of asking their audience to "Wake Up Jeff" when Fatt pretended to fall asleep was "very much in keeping with the way they work with children". Warren stated that asking children to interrupt Fatt's slumber helped them build confidence and to feel more in control of their lives. Fatt was the only original member of The Wiggles without a background in early childhood education; he explained that was the reason falling asleep was chosen as his gimmick and that "it was a way of getting me involved in the shows without actually having to do anything". Paul Field reported that children in The Wiggles' audience felt "great excitement" and were disappointed if not given the opportunity to help Jeff in this way. Anthony Field, who called it "a simple audience participation and interaction gag we've done since the start of the group", claimed that it endeared Fatt to their audiences. The group's members took turns falling asleep in the early days of the group, but it became Fatt's gimmick because "it was a perfect fit". When Fatt retired, Gillespie took over the task of falling asleep.

Simple movements were developed by their choreographers, including Leeanne Ashley, to accompany each song because, as "The New York Times" reported, they believed "in the power of basic movements to enchant young children". According to reporter Anders Wright, they intentionally made mistakes in their dance moves in order to identify more with their young audience. The group incorporated more dancing into their performances after the birth of Field's oldest daughter in 2004. "So [The] Wiggles have kind of become a bit more, dare I say, girly. Dorothy (the Dinosaur) does ballet now and we dance as well a lot more than we did", Field reported. In later years, corresponding with Field's developing interests in <a href="acrobatics">acrobatics</a> and gymnastics, they added these elements to their stage shows, including, as Field reported, hiring several world-class athletes such as former <a href="trampoline">trampoline</a> champion <a href="Karl%20Shore">Karl Shore</a>. Watkins, whom Paul Field called "a dancer of many disciplines", was initially hired as a member of their troupe and referred to herself as "mainly a dancer".

Between 1999 and 2003, to test the group's appeal across cultures, Warren used one of The Wiggles' CDs as an educational tool in a village near <a href="Madang">Madang</a>, on the north coast of <a href="Papua%20New%20Guinea">Papua New Guinea</a>. She found that the Madangese children were able to relate to the group's songs, and that they were able to sing along and participate in their simple choreography. Although The Wiggles' recorded and performed songs, dances, and musical styles from different cultures and languages, The Wiggles did not find that adapting their music to non-Australian cultures was necessary to reach children in other countries. As Cook stated, "... Toddlers don't have the same hang ups as adults". The Wiggles recognised that as long as they spoke at the same level as their audience, their Australian accents would not matter, and that young children were able to adapt to a variety of contexts and to different pronunciations of common words, no matter where they resided.

Despite Anthony Field's expressed dislike of the term, preferring to refer to it as "preserving the good name of The Wiggles", the group has stressed the importance of their brand and were protective of it. They remained as independent as possible, and retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business. As Field stated, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was "not your regular 'corporate culture'. They made decisions by consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education. They made careful decisions regarding their endorsements of toys and other products, and avoided over-extending their brand by only licensing products that correlated with their image. They had high expectations regarding the behaviour and attitude of everyone associated with the group.

The Wiggles became formally <a href="Consolidation%20%28business%29">consolidated</a> in 2005. The group's board of directors consisted of the original three members, <a href="Paul%20Field%20%28musician%29">Paul Field</a>, who has been general manager of operations since the group was formed and their manager since the mid-1990s, and Mike Conway, who had worked for <a href="Ernst%20%26amp%3B%20Young">Ernst & Young</a> in England and become their general manager in 2001. In 2009, the Australian rock band <a href="AC/DC">AC/DC</a> knocked The Wiggles, who earned A$45 million, from the top of "<a href="Business%20Review%20Weekly">Business Review Weekly</a>'s " (BRW) list of top entertainment earners for the first time in four years. In 2011, the worldwide recession hit The Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned A$28 million, but they still appeared second on the BRW's list that year. By 2012, founding members Anthony Field, Cook, and Fatt retained 30% ownership of their brand, and Paul Field and Conway each owned 5%. It was reported that as part owner of The Wiggles, Page was given a A$20 million payout when he left the group in 2006. Other ventures of The Wiggles Pty Ltd included franchising their concept to South America, Taiwan, and other countries, opening "Wiggles World" sections in theme parks, and online offerings.

The Wiggles enjoyed "almost universal approval" throughout their history. Their songs were sung and played in pre-schools all around the world. Between 2000 and 2010, The Wiggles earned 21 <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">Gold</a> records. According to a 2012 news release published to announce the retirement of Cook, Fatt, and Page, they earned several Platinum, Double Platinum and Multi-Platinum records, as well as sold 23 million DVDs and 7 million CDs. They performed, on average, to one million people per year.

After 2003, front-row tickets to their sold-out concerts in the US were <a href="Ticket%20resale">scalped</a> for US$500. The group responded by reducing the number of seats sold per transaction, in order to keep prices down and avoid further tickets scalping. In 2008, the group found themselves in the midst of what "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" called a "ticketing scandal"; scalpers tried to sell a A$19 ticket on <a href="eBay">eBay</a> for almost A$2,000 and a set of three tickets for A$315 for concerts in Melbourne, and a group of three tickets to a Wiggles <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> charity concert in Sydney had a price tag of A$510. The tickets were taken off eBay and voided.

In what Paul Field called "one of the highlights of their 15 years of being together", The Wiggles were awarded an honorary doctorate degree from <a href="Australian%20Catholic%20University">Australian Catholic University</a> in 2006. Cook gave an address during the private ceremony honouring them. They were awarded another honorary doctoral degree in 2009 from their alma mater, Macquarie University. The group was named UNICEF goodwill ambassadors in 2008; they held a special concert to raise money for the organisation. In 2010, the four original members of The Wiggles were appointed Members of the <a href="Order%20of%20Australia">Order of Australia</a> for their service to the arts in Australia, especially children's entertainment, and for their contributions and support of several charities. They called the honour their "biggest recognition yet". The group has always invited children with special needs and their families to pre-concert "meet and greet" sessions. According to Fatt, many parents of these children have reported that The Wiggles' music has enhanced their lives, and that children with <a href="autism">autism</a> "respond to [The] Wiggles and nothing else". The Wiggles, throughout their history, have visited and performed for patients at the <a href="Sydney%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Sydney Children's Hospital</a> every Christmas morning.

In 2011, <a href="ABC%20Music">ABC Music</a> released an album titled "Rewiggled: A Tribute to The Wiggles" to celebrate the group's 20th anniversary. The album features covers of many favourite Wiggles songs performed by notable Australian music artists.

The <a href="APRA%20Awards%20%28Australia%29">APRA Music Awards</a> are award ceremonies that recognise songwriting skills, sales, and airplay performance by its members annually. The Wiggles have won five APRAs and was nominated for another. In 2007, the group's members, along with John Field, were awarded APRA's International Achievement Award.

The <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards">Australian Recording Industry Association Music Awards</a> is an annual series of awards nights celebrating the Australian music industry, put on by the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a> (ARIA). The Wiggles have been nominated for <a href="ARIA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Children%27s%20Album">Best Children's Album</a> 24 times, and have won the award 14 times. In 2003, the group was awarded ARIA's Award for Outstanding Achievement, and in 2011, they were inducted into ARIA's <a href="ARIA%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a>.

Battle of Neville's Cross

The Battle of Neville's Cross took place during the <a href="Second%20War%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Second War of Scottish Independence</a> on 17 October 1346, half a mile (800 m) to the west of <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a>, England, within sight of <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a>. An invading Scottish army of 12,000 led by <a href="King%20David%20II">King David II</a> was defeated with heavy loss by an English army of approximately 6,000–7,000 men led by <a href="Ralph%20Neville%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Neville%20de%20Raby">Lord Ralph Neville</a>. The battle was named after an Anglo-Saxon stone cross on the hill where the Scots made their stand; after the victory, Neville paid to have a new cross erected to commemorate the day.

The battle was the result of the invasion of France by England during the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a>. King <a href="Philip%20VI%20of%20France">Philip VI of France</a> () called on the Scots to fulfil their obligation under the terms of the <a href="Auld%20Alliance">Auld Alliance</a> and invade England. David II obliged and after ravaging much of northern England was taken by surprise by the English defenders. The ensuing battle ended with the rout of the Scots, the capture of their king and the death or capture of most of their leadership. Strategically this freed significant English resources for the war against France, and the English border counties were able to guard against the remaining Scottish threat from their own resources. The eventual ransoming of the Scottish king resulted in a truce which brought peace to the border for forty years.

By 1346 England had been embroiled in the <a href="Second%20War%20of%20Scottish%20Independence">Second War of Scottish Independence</a> since 1332 and the <a href="Hundred%20Years%27%20War">Hundred Years' War</a> with <a href="France%20in%20the%20Middle%20Ages">France</a> since 1337. In January 1343 the French and English had entered into the <a href="Truce%20of%20Malestroit">Truce of Malestroit</a>, which included Scotland and was intended to last until 29 September 1346. In defiance of the truce, hostilities continued on all fronts, although mostly at a lower level; King <a href="David%20II%20of%20Scotland">David II of Scotland</a> () led a six-day raid into northern England in October 1345. <a href="Edward%20III%20of%20England">Edward III of England</a> () planned an invasion of northern France in 1346 and King <a href="Philip%20VI%20of%20France">Philip VI of France</a> sent an appeal to David II to open a northern front. Philip VI wanted the Scots to divert English troops, supplies and attention away from the army under Edward III which was gathering in southern England. The <a href="Auld%20Alliance">Auld Alliance</a> between France and Scotland had been renewed in 1326 and was intended to deter England from attacking either country by the threat that the other would invade English territory.

In June Philip VI asked David II to attack pre-emptively: "I beg you, I implore you... Do for me what I would willingly do for you in such a crisis and do it as quickly... as you are able." Edward III landed in <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> with an army of 15,000 in July. Philip VI renewed his pleas to David II. As the English had also committed troops to <a href="Gascony">Gascony</a>, <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> and <a href="County%20of%20Flanders">Flanders</a>, Philip VI described northern England to David II as "a defenceless void". David II felt certain that few English troops would be left to defend the rich northern English cities, but when the Scots probed into northern England they were sharply rebuffed by the local defenders. David II agreed a truce, to last until 29 September, in order to fully mobilise the Scottish army, which was assembling at <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>. By the time the truce expired, the French had been decisively beaten at <a href="Battle%20of%20Crecy">Crécy</a> and the English were <a href="Siege%20of%20Calais%20%281346%E2%80%931347%29">besieging Calais</a>. The French were also in difficulty in south-west France, where their front had collapsed, with the major city and provincial capital of Poitiers, from the border of English Gascony, falling on 4 October.

On 7 October the Scots invaded England with approximately 12,000 men. Many had modern weapons and armour supplied by France. A small number of French knights marched alongside the Scots. It was described by both Scottish and English chroniclers of the time, and by modern historians, as the strongest and best equipped Scottish expedition for many years. The border fort of <a href="Liddel%20Strength">Liddell Peel</a> was stormed and captured after a siege of three days and the garrison massacred. <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Cumbria">Carlisle</a> was bypassed in exchange for a large indemnity and the Scottish army moved east, ravaging the countryside as they went. They <a href="Looting">sacked</a> <a href="Hexham%20Abbey">Hexham Abbey</a>, taking three days to do so, then advanced to <a href="Durham%2C%20England">Durham</a>. They arrived outside Durham on 16 October and camped at <a href="Bearpark">Beaurepaire</a> Priory, where the monks offered the Scots £1,000 (£ as of 2019) in protection money to be paid on 18 October.

The invasion had been expected by the English for some time; two years earlier the Chancellor of England had told parliament that the Scots were "saying quite openly that they will break the truce as soon as our adversary [France] desires and will march into England". Once the Scots invaded, an army was quickly mobilised at <a href="Richmond%2C%20North%20Yorkshire">Richmond</a> in north Yorkshire under the supervision of <a href="William%20de%20la%20Zouche">William de la Zouche</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, who was <a href="Lord%20Warden%20of%20the%20Marches">Lord Warden of the Marches</a>. It was not a large army: 3,000–4,000 men from the northern counties of <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a>, <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a> and <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>; it is known that Lancashire contributed 1,200 <a href="longbowmen">longbowmen</a> and a small number of lightly armed border cavalry, known as <a href="Hobelar">hobeler</a>s. Another 3,000 <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>men were en route to reinforce their fellow northerners. This was possible because Edward III, when raising his army to invade France, had exempted the counties north of the River <a href="Humber">Humber</a>. On 14 October, while the Scots were sacking Hexham Abbey, the Archbishop decided not to wait for the Yorkshire troops and marched north west towards <a href="Barnard%20Castle">Barnard Castle</a>, and then rapidly north east to Durham. He was joined en route by the Yorkshire contingent and <a href="Ralph%20Neville%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Neville%20de%20Raby">Lord Ralph Neville</a> took command of the combined force of 6,000–7,000 men.

The Scots at Beaurepaire only discovered the English army on the morning of 17 October, when they were some away. Around 500 men under <a href="William%20Douglas%2C%20Lord%20of%20Liddesdale">William Douglas</a> stumbled upon them in the morning mist during a raid near <a href="Kirk%20Merrington">Merrington</a>, south of Durham. The two rear divisions of the English army drove them off with heavy Scottish casualties, around 300. Douglas raced back to David II's camp, alerting the rest of the army, which stood to arms. The same morning two <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Benedict">Benedictine monks</a> arrived from Durham in an attempt to broker a peace but David II, thinking they were spies, ordered their beheading; the monks escaped in the confusion.
David II led the Scottish army to the high ground at <a href="Neville%27s%20Cross">Neville's Cross</a>, less than half a mile (800 m) to the west of Durham and within sight of <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a>, where he prepared for battle. Both the Scots and the English arranged themselves in three formations, or <a href="Battle%20%28formation%29">battles</a>. On the Scottish side, David II took control of the second battle, and placed <a href="John%20Randolph%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Moray">John Randolph, the Earl of Moray</a>, in charge of the first battle. <a href="Patrick%20V%2C%20Earl%20of%20March">Patrick Dunbar, the Earl of March</a>, took command of the third battle. The contemporary sources are not consistent, but it seems that the Scots formed up in their traditional <a href="schiltrons">schiltrons</a>, each battle forming a rectilinear formation. The front ranks were armed with axes and long spears carried by the rear ranks protruded past them. The knights and other men-at-arms dismounted and stiffened the formations, usually at the very front. A screen of archers skirmished to the front, and each flank of the army was shielded by <a href="hobelars">hobelars</a> and further archers. As the mist lifted, it became clear that the Scots were poorly positioned, on broken ground and with their movement made difficult by ditches and walls. They remembered their defeats at <a href="Battle%20of%20Dupplin%20Moor">Dupplin Moor</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Halidon%20Hill">Halidon Hill</a> and so took a defensive stance, waiting for the English to attack.

The English similarly divided their forces with <a href="Henry%20de%20Percy%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Percy">Lord Henry Percy</a> commanding their first battle; Neville their second; and the Archbishop of York their third. Neville remained in overall command. The English were entirely dismounted, with each battle having men-at-arms in the centre and longbowmen on each flank. The English also took a defensive stance, knowing they had the superior position and that time was on their side; their morale was high. The resulting stalemate lasted until the afternoon, when the English sent longbowmen forward to harass the Scottish lines. On the English left the Scottish light horse and archers withdrew under the arrow fire and the English were able to shoot into the flank of Moray's battle. The <a href="John%20Graham%2C%20Earl%20of%20Menteith">Earl of Menteith</a> attempted to clear away the English archers with a cavalry charge, but this failed and he was taken prisoner. The archers succeeded in provoking the Scots into attacking.

Moray's battle led the assault, but the broken terrain and obstacles slowed their advance and made it difficult for them to maintain formation. The longbowmen were able to fall back behind their men-at-arms. By the time the disorganised battle came to hand-to-hand combat it was easily dealt with it. Seeing their first attack repulsed, and also being harassed by the English archers, the third and largest Scottish battle, on the Scottish left under the Earl of March and <a href="Robert%20II%20of%20Scotland">Robert Stewart</a>, broke and fled. The English stood off from the remaining Scots under David II and poured in arrows. The English men-at-arms then attacked and after fighting described as "ferocious", the Scots attempted unsuccessfully to retreat and were routed. The English men-at-arms outfought superior numbers of the Scottish foot, while the performance of the English archers was mixed. Most of them were participating in their first pitched battle, or even their first combat. Many groups of bowmen conspicuously hung back, while the Lancashire longbowmen received a post-battle bonus of £10 each (£ in 2019 terms).

David II, badly wounded, was captured after he fled the field, while the rest of the Scottish army was pursued by the English long into the night. More than 50 Scottish barons were killed or captured; Scotland lost almost all of its military leadership. The Scottish dead included: the Constable, Lord <a href="David%20de%20la%20Hay">David de la Hay</a>; the <a href="Earl%20Marischal">Marischal</a>, <a href="Robert%20III%20Keith%2C%20Marischal%20of%20Scotland">Robert de Keith</a>; the Chamberlain, John Roxburgh; the Chancellor, Lord <a href="Thomas%20Charteris">Thomas Charteris</a>; two earls, John Randolph, Earl of Moray and <a href="Maurice%20de%20Moravia%2C%20Earl%20of%20Strathearn">Maurice de Moravia, Earl of Strathearn</a>; and <a href="Niall%20Bruce%20of%20Carrick">Niall Bruce of Carrick</a>, an illegitimate son of <a href="Robert%20I%20of%20Scotland">Robert the Bruce</a>. An unknown number of Scots were taken prisoner. It is believed that only Scots thought able to pay a ransom were spared, others being slain out of hand. Scottish nobles who were captured included William Douglas, the "Knight of Liddesdale", their most skilled guerilla fighter, and four earls.

Scottish chroniclers <a href="Andrew%20of%20Wyntoun">Andrew of Wyntoun</a> and <a href="Walter%20Bower">Walter Bower</a> both wrote that 1,000 Scots were killed in the battle, while the <a href="Chronicle%20of%20Lanercost">Chronicle of Lanercost</a> said that "few English were killed". Modern historians Given-Wilson and Bériac have estimated that some 3,000 Scotsmen perished while fewer than 100 were taken prisoner.

Accounts of the time state that after the battle David II was hiding under a bridge over the <a href="River%20Browney">River Browney</a> when his reflection was seen in the water by a group of English soldiers. David II was then taken prisoner by <a href="John%20de%20Coupland">John de Coupland</a>, who was leading the detachment and who had his teeth knocked out by the King. During the battle David II was twice shot in the face with arrows. Surgeons attempted to remove the arrows but the tip of one remained lodged in his face, rendering him prone to headaches for decades. Edward III ordered David II to be handed over to him, rewarding Coupland with a knighthood and an <a href="annuity">annuity</a> of £500 for life (£ per year in 2019 terms).
Despite having fled without fighting, Robert Stewart was appointed lord guardian to act on David II's behalf in his absence.

All of the Scottish captives were ordered to London, to the disgust of their captors who had a legal right to ransom them. A significant number of Scottish prisoners were privately ransomed, their captors subsequently attempting to deny that they had been taken, which outraged Edward III. Edward III refused to ransom any of those who were passed on to him, or release them on <a href="parole">parole</a> as was traditional; he wished to cripple the Scottish capacity to make war for as long as possible, by depriving them of their leaders. In at least some cases he paid considerable sums to their captors to buy out their ransom rights. <a href="John%20Graham%2C%20Earl%20of%20Menteith">John Graham, Earl of Menteith</a>, had previously sworn fealty to Edward III, who considered him guilty of treason. On the King's direct orders he was tried, condemned and then <a href="Hanged%2C%20drawn%20and%20quartered">drawn, hanged, beheaded and quartered</a>.

In early 1346 two English forces made large scale raids deep into Scotland. They met little opposition and devastated much of southern Scotland. Border raids, often accompanied by devastation of the countryside, and sometimes on a large scale, continued to be launched by both the Scots and the English. However, the battle effectively removed the strategic threat to Edward III's rear, and by 1349 the English border counties were able to guard against the remaining Scottish threat from their own resources.

On three separate occasions Edward III offered to release the childless David II for £40,000 (approximately £ in 2019 terms) if he would accept one of Edward III's sons as his heir to the Scottish throne. All three offers were refused. Eleven years after the battle David II was released in exchange for a ransom of 100,000 <a href="Mark%20%28currency%29">marks</a> (approximately £ in 2019 terms.) The ransom was to be paid over a ten-year span, on 24 June (<a href="John%20the%20Baptist">St. John the Baptist's</a> Day) each year, during which an <a href="Treaty%20of%20Berwick%20%281357%29">Anglo-Scottish truce</a> prohibited any Scottish citizen from bearing arms against Edward III or any of his men. This truce proved to be effective for four decades and marked the end of the Second War of Scottish Independence.

The Battle of Neville's Cross is named after an old Anglo-Saxon stone cross near Beaurepaire. After the victory, Lord Ralph Neville paid to have a new cross erected to commemorate the day. The "Black Rood", venerated as a piece of the <a href="True%20Cross">True Cross</a>, and previously belonging to the former Queen of Scotland, <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20of%20Scotland">St Margaret</a>, was taken from David II and donated to the shrine of <a href="Cuthbert">St Cuthbert</a> in Durham Cathedral. The site of the battle has been listed as a registered battlefield by <a href="Historic%20England">Historic England</a>.

The fate of King David II is recalled in <a href="Shakespeare">Shakespeare</a>’s play "<a href="Henry%20V%20%28play%29">Henry V</a>". In Act 1 Scene 3, Henry discusses the Scottish invasion with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The last lines refer to an earlier play that would have been known to Shakespeare's audience, "<a href="Edward%20III%20%28play%29">The Reign of Edward III</a>", at the end of which John de Coupland brings the captured David II to Edward III in Calais; where he meets the Black Prince, who has captured the French King.

Pacific swift

The Pacific swift ("Apus pacificus") is a bird which breeds in eastern Asia. This <a href="swift">swift</a> is strongly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, spending the northern hemisphere's winter in <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a> and <a href="Australia">Australia</a>. The general shape and blackish plumage recall its relative, the <a href="common%20swift">common swift</a>, from which it is distinguished by a white rump band and heavily marked underparts. The sexes are identical in appearance, although young birds can be identified by pale fringes to the wing feathers that are absent in adults. This swift's main call is a screech typical of its <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>. It is one of a group of closely related Asian swifts formerly regarded as one species.

The Pacific swift is found in a wide range of climatic zones and habitats. It breeds in sheltered locations such as caves, natural rock crevices or under the roofs of houses. The nest is a half-cup of dry grass and other fine material that is gathered in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a vertical surface. The two or three white eggs are incubated for about seventeen days to hatching. Subsequently, the chicks have a long but variable period in the nest before they are fully fledged. When the parents cannot find sufficient food in bad weather, the young can survive for days without being fed by <a href="metabolism">metabolising</a> body fat.

Like all members of its family, the Pacific swift feeds exclusively on insects caught in flight. It tends to hunt higher than most of its relatives other than the <a href="white-throated%20needletail">white-throated needletail</a>. The Pacific swift has a large population and extensive breeding area, and faces few threats from predators or human activities. It is classed as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. It has occurred as far afield as the US and New Zealand, and it is a very rare vagrant in Europe.

The <a href="swift">swift</a>s form the bird <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Apodidae, which is divided into several <a href="genus">genera</a>. The Pacific swift is in the Old World genus "<a href="Apus">Apus</a>", which is characterised by dark, glossy <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, a forked tail and sharply pointed wings. Until recently, the Pacific swift was considered to have five <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, but three have now been elevated to full species status as part of a "fork-tailed swift" <a href="superspecies">superspecies</a>. The proposed name of the superspecies was formerly a synonym for the Pacific swift.

A 2011 study proposed the following treatment. The long-tailed birds from the <a href="Tibetan%20Plateau">Tibetan Plateau</a> with a narrow white throat patch are separated as <a href="Salim%20Ali%27s%20swift">Salim Ali's swift</a>, "A. salimali", the small swifts with narrow white rumps from the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> of India, Nepal and Bhutan become <a href="Blyth%27s%20swift">Blyth's swift</a>, "A. leuconyx", and the population that breeds in limestone caves in northern <a href="Southeast%20Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, characterised by a green <a href="iridescence">iridescence</a> and shallow tail fork, is split as <a href="Cook%27s%20swift">Cook's swift</a>, "A. cooki". The remaining subspecies are the <a href="Nominotypical%20subspecies">nominate</a> "A. p. pacificus" and the southern race "A. p. kurodae" (which includes the Tibetan population formerly named as "kanoi"). This arrangement has been accepted by the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a> (IOC), but not the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a>. A 2012 paper showed that "cooki" is closely related to the <a href="dark-rumped%20swift">dark-rumped swift</a>, "A. acuticauda", which should therefore be included in the "pacificus" <a href="clade">clade</a>, but made no further taxonomic recommendations.

This swift was first described by <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in 1801 as "Hirundo pacifica". 
<a href="Giovanni%20Antonio%20Scopoli">Scopoli</a> separated the swifts from the swallows as the genus "Apus" in 1777. "Apus", like Apodidae, is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> απους, "apous", meaning "without feet", a reference to the small, weak legs of these most aerial of birds, and "pacificus" refers to the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific Ocean</a>.

At in length, the Pacific swift is the largest of the "Apus" swifts. It has a 43–54-cm (17–21-in) wingspan. Females are slightly heavier than males, averaging against . It is similar in general shape to the <a href="common%20swift">common swift</a>, although slightly longer-winged and with a more protruding head. The fork of the tail is deeper, and the rump is broader. The upperparts are black, apart from a white rump band and a somewhat greyer head. The underparts are black, although white fringes to the feathers gives the belly a scaly appearance when seen well from below. The tail and the upper wings are black, and the underwings are brown. The eyes are brown and the small bill and very short legs are black. The sexes are identically plumaged, and juveniles differ from the adults only in that the feathers show pale fringes, particularly on the <a href="flight%20feather">wings</a>. The southern subspecies, "A. p. kurodae", has a narrower white rump (15 mm/0.6 in against the nominate form's 20 mm/0.8 in), a grey throat and blacker underparts. Juveniles of migratory "Apus" swifts have a partial <a href="Moulting">moult</a> prior to migration, but retain the larger wing feathers. The moult is completed in the wintering grounds, where adults have a complete moult.

This species is usually straightforward to identify. The <a href="white-rumped%20swift">white-rumped swift</a> is similar to Pacific swift, but its slender body and long, deeply forked tail make it appear quite different from its more powerfully built relative. A possible pitfall is a partially <a href="Leucism">leucistic</a> common swift with a white rump. The Pacific swift can be distinguished with care by its deeper tail fork, longer wings, bigger head, larger white throat patch and patterned underparts. In parts of Southeast Asia, migrating Pacific swifts pass through the resident ranges of former subspecies, and good views are then necessary to be sure of correct identification.

The calls given by flocks near the breeding areas are typical swift screams, including a trilled "tsiririri" or harsher "spee-eer". They resemble the cries of the common swift, but are softer and less wheezy. Pacific swifts are less vocal on the wintering grounds, but produce a variety of twitters and buzzes.

The nominate subspecies, "A. p. pacificus", breeds in eastern Asia from the <a href="Ob%20River">Ob River</a> northeast to <a href="Kamchatka">Kamchatka</a> and east to the <a href="Kuril%20Islands">Kuril Islands</a>, <a href="Sakhalin">Sakhalin</a> and Japan. It is strongly migratory, wintering in southern Indonesia, Melanesia and Australia, including <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. It is a common migrant through coastal Malaysia, <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a> and <a href="Java">Java</a> with "vast numbers" crossing the <a href="Strait%20of%20Malacca">Strait of Malacca</a>. Subspecies "A. p. kurodae" breeds from southeastern <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a> through eastern China to southern Japan, Taiwan and <a href="Orchid%20Island">Orchid Island</a>. It is a relatively short-distance migrant, wintering in the Philippines, Malaysia and northern Indonesia.

As a powerful long-distance migrant, the nominate subspecies of Pacific swift has occurred as a vagrant far from its normal range. Birds have been recorded from Brunei, the Maldives, New Zealand and <a href="Macquarie%20Island">Macquarie Island</a>, and there have been multiple occurrences in the Seychelles. In the US, this species is casual in the <a href="Pribilof%20Islands">Pribilof</a> and <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>; a claimed 2010 sighting from the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a> will be the first for Canada and the mainland of North America if ratified. In South America, there is a 1959 record from Colombia. There are 13 European records as of 2013, from Denmark (two), Spain, Sweden (four) and the UK (seven). It is possible that this overstates the true number of visiting birds. All the listed countries had a sighting on different dates in the summer of 2013 which could be due to a single wandering bird. The four most recent English records in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2013 all included sightings at <a href="Spurn">Spurn</a>, <a href="East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">East Yorkshire</a> and may refer to one returning individual.

A mainly aerial species, this swift is not limited to particular land habitats or climatic zones; it breeds from the Arctic to sub-tropical China, and from sea level to at least in Japan. It is often found around human habitation. It tends to winter in lowlands, and in Australia it is found in arid areas as well as in towns and on the coast. Flocks of thousands may appear when there are hot strong winds. Pacific swifts often travel and feed with <a href="white-throated%20needletail">white-throated needletail</a>s. The Pacific swift probably sleeps in flight when not nesting, behaviour known to occur in the common swift and suspected in other "Apus" species, but there is an Australian record of these swifts roosting in a tree, and they are occasionally seen to land briefly on the ground or on vertical surfaces.

Most "Apus" swift species nest in rocky areas, and the majority will accept human habitations as a substitute for natural sites. The Pacific swift is a <a href="bird%20colony">colonial</a> species which nests in sheltered locations such as caves, crevices in vertical rock faces (including sea-cliffs), or under the eaves of houses. The nest is a half-cup of feathers, dry grass and other light vegetation collected in flight, cemented with saliva and attached to a ledge or vertical surface with the same substance. Two or three eggs is the normal <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a>, the number varying with geographical location. In areas where three eggs are usual, a fourth may occasionally be laid; no larger clutches are known. The eggs are white, as with all swifts, and 24–27.5 x 16–17 mm (0.95–1.08 x 0.63–0.67 in) in size. They are incubated by both parents for about 17 days prior to hatching as unfeathered and blind <a href="altricial">altricial</a> chicks. Both adults brood and feed the chicks, which <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in an average 40.5 days.

Swifts as a family have smaller egg clutches and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s with similarly sized eggs, resembling <a href="Procellariiformes">tubenoses</a> in these developmental factors. Young birds reach a maximum weight heavier than their parents; they can cope with not being fed for long periods of time, and delay their feather growth when undernourished. Swifts and seabirds have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. These adaptations mean that when conditions are good, the survival rate is very high. One large <a href="Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a> colony had hatching success of 73.5%, with 63.6% of the chicks fledging. The average productivity was 1.24 fledged young per pair per year.

All swifts feed on insects caught in flight, and the Pacific swift has been recorded as consuming bees, wasps, termites, moths and <a href="fly">flies</a>. A Chinese study found that it caught a wide variety of insect prey and considered that most of the species eaten were harmful to agriculture or forestry. The Pacific swift tends to hunt higher than <a href="Sympatry">sympatric</a> swifts, sharing its airspace mainly with white-throated needletails. It typically feeds at heights up to , only flying close to the ground in poor weather. It often forages near <a href="low-pressure%20area">low-pressure area</a>s, which serve both to raise insects from the ground and to give the swifts additional <a href="lift%20%28force%29">lift</a>. The swifts circle through the insect swarms in flocks typically of tens or hundreds of birds, although sometimes reaching tens of thousands in Australia. In Siberia, Pacific swifts feed at dusk to much later hours than the common swift, sometimes until midnight, and migrants have been seen flying with bats in the Philippines. The young are brought balls of insects bound with saliva. In bad weather, they are sometimes not fed for days, surviving on stored body fat.

Swifts spend most of their time in flight. Few birds have the necessary speed and agility to catch them, <a href="hobby%20%28bird%29">hobbies</a> being the main exception. The nest sites are also usually sufficiently inaccessible to be beyond the reach of snakes or mammalian predators.

This swift is host to <a href="feather%20mite">feather mite</a>s including "<a href="Eustathia%20cultrifera">Eustathia cultrifera</a>", "<a href="Chauliacia%20canarisi">Chauliacia canarisi</a>" and "<a href="Chauliacia%20securigera">C. securigera</a>". Biting parasites include the <a href="Hippoboscidae">louse fly</a> "<a href="Crataerina%20pacifica">Crataerina pacifica</a>", <a href="bat%20bug">bat bug</a>s and <a href="Prostigmata">sucking mite</a>s. <a href="Mallophaga">Chewing lice</a> include two species first identified on this swift. <a href="Davaineidae">Davaineidae tapeworms</a> have been found as internal parasites.

The Pacific swift has a very large range, exceeding 10,000,000 km (3,800,000 mi). Its population is unknown, although it is common throughout its breeding range with no evidence of any decline. It is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>. There appear to be no significant threats to this bird; predation is low, and this swift is not tied to a particular habitat. Some birds may die through misadventure or become exhausted when lost on migration (the first record for the <a href="Western%20Palaearctic">Western Palaearctic</a> was found resting on a <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> <a href="Oil%20platform">gas platform</a>), but swifts have high survival rates and are generally long-lived. The common swift, a close relative of the Pacific swift, has been recorded as reaching 21 years old.

Reaching long and weighing as much as , the sei whale consumes an average of of food every day; its diet consists primarily of <a href="copepod">copepod</a>s, <a href="krill">krill</a>, and other <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a>. It is among the fastest of all <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns, and can reach speeds of up to (27 <a href="knot%20%28unit%29">knots</a>) over short distances. The whale's name comes from the <a href="Norwegian%20language">Norwegian</a> word for <a href="Pollachius%20virens">pollock</a>, a fish that appears off the coast of Norway at the same time of the year as the sei whale.

Following large-scale <a href="whaling">commercial whaling</a> during the late 19th and 20th centuries, when over 255,000 whales were killed, the sei whale is now internationally protected, although limited hunting occurs under a controversial research program conducted by Japan. , its worldwide population was about 80,000, less than a third of its prewhaling population.

"Sei" is the Norwegian word for <a href="pollock">pollock</a>, also referred to as coalfish, a close relative of codfish. Sei whales appeared off the coast of Norway at the same time as the pollock, both coming to feed on the abundant <a href="plankton">plankton</a>. The specific name is the Latin word "borealis", meaning northern. In the Pacific, the whale has been called the Japan finner; "finner" was a common term used to refer to rorquals. In Japanese, the whale was called "iwashi kujira", or sardine whale, a name originally applied to <a href="Bryde%27s%20whale">Bryde's whale</a>s by early Japanese whalers. Later, as modern whaling shifted to <a href="Sanriku">Sanriku</a> — where both species occur — it was confused for the sei whale. Now the term only applies to the latter species. It has also been referred to as the lesser fin whale because it somewhat resembles the fin whale. The American <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="Roy%20Chapman%20Andrews">Roy Chapman Andrews</a> compared the sei whale to the <a href="cheetah">cheetah</a>, because it can swim at great speeds "for a few hundred yards", but it "soon tires if the chase is long" and "does not have the strength and staying power of its larger relatives".

On 21 February 1819, a 32-ft whale stranded near <a href="Gr%C3%B6mitz">Grömitz</a>, in <a href="Schleswig-Holstein">Schleswig-Holstein</a>. The Swedish-born German naturalist Karl Rudolphi initially identified it as "Balaena rostrata" (="Balaenoptera acutorostrata"). In 1823, the French naturalist <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a> described and figured Rudolphi's specimen under the name "rorqual du Nord". In 1828, Rene Lesson translated this term into "Balaenoptera borealis", basing his designation partly on Cuvier's description of Rudolphi's specimen and partly on a 54-ft female that had stranded on the coast of France the previous year (this was later identified as a juvenile fin whale, "Balaenoptera physalus"). In 1846, the English zoologist <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a>, ignoring Lesson's designation, named Rudolphi's specimen "Balaenoptera laticeps", which others followed. In 1865, the British zoologist <a href="William%20Henry%20Flower">William Henry Flower</a> named a 45-ft specimen that had been obtained from <a href="Pekalongan">Pekalongan</a>, on the north coast of <a href="Java">Java</a>, "Sibbaldius" (="Balaenoptera") "schlegelii" — in 1946 the Russian scientist A.G. Tomilin synonymized "S. schlegelii" and "B. borealis", creating the subspecies "B. b. schlegelii" and "B. b. borealis". In 1884–85, the Norwegian scientist G. A. Guldberg first identified the "sejhval" of <a href="Finnmark">Finnmark</a> with "B. borealis".

Sei whales are <a href="rorqual">rorqual</a>s (family Balaenopteridae), baleen whales that include the <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a>, the <a href="blue%20whale">blue whale</a>, <a href="Bryde%27s%20whale">Bryde's whale</a>, the <a href="fin%20whale">fin whale</a>, and the <a href="minke%20whale">minke whale</a>. Rorquals take their name from the <a href="Norwegian%20language">Norwegian</a> word "røyrkval", meaning "furrow whale", because family members have a series of longitudinal pleats or grooves on the anterior half of their ventral surface. Balaenopterids diverged from the other families of suborder <a href="baleen%20whale">Mysticeti</a>, also called the whalebone whales or great whales, as long ago as the middle <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>. Little is known about when members of the various families in the Mysticeti, including the Balaenopteridae, diverged from each other.

Two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> have been identified—the northern sei whale ("B. b. borealis") and southern sei whale ("B. b. schlegelii"). Their ranges do not overlap.

The sei whale is the fourth-largest balaenopterid, after the blue whale (up to 180 tonnes, 200 tons) and the fin whale (up to 70 tonnes, 77 tons) and the humpback whale (up to 40 tonnes, 44.5 tons). In the North Pacific, adult males average and adult females , weighing 15 and 18.5 tonnes (16.5 and 20.5 tons), while in the North Atlantic adult males average and adult females , weighing 15.5 and 17 tonnes (17 and 18.5 tons) In the Southern Hemisphere, they average 14.5 (47.5 ft) and , respectively, weighing 17 and 18.5 tonnes (18.5 and 20.5 tons). ( In the Northern Hemisphere, males reach up to and females up to , while in the Southern Hemisphere males reach and females — the authenticity of an alleged female caught 50 miles northwest of <a href="St%20Kilda%2C%20Scotland">St. Kilda</a> in July 1911 is doubted. The largest specimens taken off <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> were a female and a male, while the longest off Nova Scotia were two females and a male. The longest measured during JARPN II cruises in the North Pacific were a female and a male. The longest measured by Discovery Committee staff were an adult male of and an adult female of , both caught off South Georgia. Adults usually weigh between 15 and 20 metric tons — a pregnant female caught off Natal in 1966 weighed 37.75 tonnes (41.6 tons), not including 6% for loss of fluids during flensing. Females are considerably larger than males. At birth, a calf typically measures in length.

The whale's body is typically a dark steel grey with irregular light grey to white markings on the <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">ventral</a> surface, or towards the front of the lower body. The whale has a relatively short series of 32–60 <a href="pleat">pleat</a>s or grooves along its ventral surface that extend halfway between the pectoral fins and umbilicus (in other species it usually extends to or past the umbilicus), restricting the expansion of the buccal cavity during feeding compared to other species. The <a href="Rostrum%20%28anatomy%29">rostrum</a> is pointed and the <a href="Fish%20anatomy%23Types%20of%20fin">pectoral fins</a> are relatively short, only 9%–10% of body length, and pointed at the tips. It has a single ridge extending from the tip of the rostrum to the paired <a href="Blowhole%20%28biology%29">blowholes</a> that are a distinctive characteristic of baleen whales.

The whale's skin is often marked by pits or wounds, which after healing become white scars. These are now known to be caused by <a href="Cookiecutter%20shark">"cookie-cutter" sharks</a> ("Isistius brasiliensis"). It has a tall, <a href="sickle">sickle</a>-shaped <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a> that ranges in height from and averages , about two-thirds of the way back from the tip of the rostrum. Dorsal fin shape, <a href="pigment">pigment</a>ation pattern, and scarring have been used to a limited extent in <a href="Wildlife%20photo-identification">photo-identification</a> studies. The tail is thick and the <a href="Whale%23Appendages">fluke</a>, or lobe, is relatively small in relation to the size of the whale's body.

Adults have 300–380 ashy-black baleen plates on each side of the mouth, up to long. Each plate is made of <a href="nail%20%28anatomy%29">fingernail</a>-like <a href="keratin">keratin</a>, which is bordered by a fringe of very fine, short, curly, wool-like white bristles. The sei's very fine baleen bristles, about are the most reliable characteristic that distinguishes it from other rorquals.

The sei whale looks similar to other large baleen whales. The best way to distinguish between it and Bryde's whale, apart from differences in baleen plates, is by the presence of lateral ridges on the dorsal surface of the Bryde's whale's rostrum. Large individuals can be confused with fin whales, unless the fin whale's asymmetrical head coloration is clearly seen. The fin whale's lower jaw's right side is white, and the left side is grey. When viewed from the side, the rostrum appears slightly arched (accentuated at the tip), while fin and Bryde's whales have relatively flat rostrums.

Sei whales usually travel alone or in pods of up to six individuals. Larger groups may assemble at particularly abundant feeding grounds. Very little is known about their <a href="social%20structure">social structure</a>. During the southern Gulf of Maine influx in mid-1986, groups of at least three sei whales were observed "milling" on four occasions – i.e. moving in random directions, rolling, and remaining at the surface for over 10 minutes. One whale would always leave the group during or immediately after such socializing bouts.
The sei whale is among the fastest <a href="cetacea">cetacea</a>ns. It can reach speeds of up to over short distances. However, it is not a remarkable diver, reaching relatively shallow depths for 5 to 15 minutes. Between dives, the whale surfaces for a few minutes, remaining visible in clear, calm waters, with blows occurring at intervals of about 60 seconds (range: 45–90 sec.). Unlike the fin whale, the sei whale tends not to rise high out of the water as it dives, usually just sinking below the surface. The <a href="Blowhole%20%28biology%29">blowholes</a> and dorsal fin are often exposed above the water surface almost simultaneously. The whale almost never lifts its flukes above the surface, and are generally less <a href="Whale%20surfacing%20behaviour">active on water surfaces</a> than closely related Bryde's whales; it rarely <a href="Whale%23Behavior">breaches</a>.

This rorqual is a <a href="filter%20feeder">filter feeder</a>, using its <a href="baleen">baleen</a> plates to obtain its food by opening its mouth, engulfing or skimming large amounts of the water containing the food, then straining the water out through the baleen, trapping any food items inside its mouth.

The sei whale feeds near the surface of the ocean, swimming on its side through swarms of <a href="predation">prey</a> to obtain its average of about of food each day. For an animal of its size, for the most part, its preferred foods lie unusually relatively low in the <a href="food%20chain">food chain</a>, including <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a> and small fish. The whale's diet preferences has been determined from stomach analyses, direct observation of feeding behavior, and analyzing <a href="feces">fecal matter</a> collected near them, which appears as a dilute brown cloud. The feces are collected in nets and DNA is separated, individually identified, and matched with known species. The whale competes for food against <a href="clupeidae">clupeid</a> fish (<a href="herring">herring</a> and its relatives), <a href="basking%20shark">basking shark</a>s, and <a href="right%20whale">right whale</a>s.

In the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">North Atlantic</a>, it feeds primarily on <a href="Calanoida">calanoid copepods</a>, specifically "<a href="Calanus%20finmarchicus">Calanus finmarchicus</a>", with a secondary preference for <a href="krill">euphausiids</a>, in particular "<a href="Meganyctiphanes%20norvegica">Meganyctiphanes norvegica</a>" and "<a href="Thysanoessa%20inermis">Thysanoessa inermis</a>". In the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">North Pacific</a>, it feeds on similar zooplankton, including the copepod species "Neocalanus cristatus", "N. plumchrus", and "Calanus pacificus", and euphausiid species "Euphausia pacifica", "E. similis", "Thysanoessa inermis", "T. longipes", "T. gregaria" and "T. spinifera". In addition, it eats larger organisms, such as the <a href="Japanese%20flying%20squid">Japanese flying squid</a>, "Todarodes pacificus pacificus", and small fish, including <a href="anchovy">anchovies</a> ("Engraulis japonicus" and "E. mordax"), <a href="South%20American%20pilchard">sardines</a> ("Sardinops sagax"), <a href="Pacific%20saury">Pacific saury</a> ("Cololabis saira"), <a href="Scomber">mackerel</a> ("Scomber japonicus" and "S. australasicus"), <a href="Trachurus">jack mackerel</a> ("Trachurus symmetricus") and juvenile <a href="Sebastes">rockfish</a> ("Sebastes jordani"). Some of these fish are commercially important. Off central California, they mainly feed on anchovies between June and August, and on krill ("Euphausia pacifica") during September and October. In the Southern Hemisphere, prey species include the copepods "Neocalanus tonsus", "Calanus simillimus", and "Drepanopus pectinatus", as well as the euphausiids "Euphausia superba" and "Euphausia vallentini" and the pelagic <a href="amphipod">amphipod</a> "<a href="Themisto%20gaudichaudii">Themisto gaudichaudii</a>".

<a href="Mating">Mating</a> occurs in <a href="temperateness">temperate</a>, subtropical seas during the winter. <a href="Gestation">Gestation</a> is estimated to vary around 10 months, 11 months, or one year, depending which model of <a href="fetus">foetal</a> growth is used. The different estimates result from scientists' inability to observe an entire pregnancy; most reproductive data for baleen whales were obtained from animals caught by commercial whalers, which offer only single snapshots of fetal growth. Researchers attempt to extrapolate conception dates by comparing fetus size and characteristics with newborns.

A newborn is <a href="weaning">weaned</a> from its mother at 6–9 months of age, when it is long, so weaning takes place at the summer or autumn feeding grounds. Females reproduce every 2–3 years, usually to a single calf. In the Northern Hemisphere, males are usually and females at sexual maturity, while in the Southern Hemisphere, males average and females . The average age of <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> of both <a href="sex">sex</a>es is 8–10 years. The whales can reach ages up to 65 years.

The sei whale makes long, loud, low-frequency sounds. Relatively little is known about specific calls, but in 2003, observers noted sei whale calls in addition to sounds that could be described as "growls" or "whooshes" off the coast of the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a>. Many calls consisted of multiple parts at different frequencies. This combination distinguishes their calls from those of other whales. Most calls lasted about a half second, and occurred in the 240–625 <a href="hertz">hertz</a> range, well within the range of human hearing. The maximum volume of the vocal sequences is reported as 156 <a href="decibel">decibel</a>s relative to 1 <a href="Pascal%20%28unit%29">micropascal (μPa)</a> at a reference distance of one metre. An observer situated one metre from a vocalizing whale would perceive a volume roughly equivalent to the volume of a jackhammer operating two metres away.

In November 2002, scientists recorded calls in the presence of sei whales off <a href="Maui">Maui</a>. All the calls were downswept tonal calls, all but two ranging from a mean high frequency of 39.1 Hz down to 21 Hz of 1.3 second duration – the two higher frequency downswept calls ranged from an average of 100.3 Hz to 44.6 Hz over 1 second of duration. These calls closely resembled and coincided with a peak in "20- to 35-Hz irregular repetition interval" downswept pulses described from seafloor recordings off <a href="Oahu">Oahu</a>, which had previously been attributed to fin whales. Between 2005 and 2007, low frequency downswept vocalizations were recorded in the Great South Channel, east of <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, which were only significantly associated with the presence of sei whales. These calls averaged 82.3 Hz down to 34 Hz over about 1.4 seconds in duration. This call has also been reported from recordings in the Gulf of Maine, <a href="New%20England">New England</a> shelf waters, the mid-Atlantic Bight, and in <a href="Davis%20Strait">Davis Strait</a>. It likely functions as a contact call.

BBC News quoted Roddy Morrison, a former whaler active in South Georgia, as saying, "When we killed the sei whales, they used to make a noise, like a crying noise. They seemed so friendly, and they'd come round and they'd make a noise, and when you hit them, they cried really. I didn't think it was really nice to do that. Everybody talked about it at the time I suppose, but it was money. At the end of the day that's what counted at the time. That's what we were there for."

Sei whales live in all oceans, although rarely in polar or tropical waters. The difficulty of distinguishing them at sea from their close relatives, Bryde's whales and in some cases from fin whales, creates confusion about their range and population, especially in warmer waters where Bryde's whales are most common.

In the North Atlantic, its range extends from <a href="southern%20Europe">southern Europe</a> or <a href="Northwest%20Africa">northwestern Africa</a> to Norway, and from the <a href="southern%20United%20States">southern United States</a> to <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>. The southernmost confirmed records are strandings along the northern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and in the <a href="Greater%20Antilles">Greater Antilles</a>. Throughout its range, the whale tends not to frequent semienclosed bodies of water, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Saint%20Lawrence">Gulf of Saint Lawrence</a>, <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a>, the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, and the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. It occurs predominantly in deep water, occurring most commonly over the <a href="continental%20shelf">continental slope</a>, in basins situated between banks, or <a href="submarine%20canyon">submarine canyon</a> areas.

In the North Pacific, it ranges from <a href="20th%20parallel%20north">20°N</a> to <a href="23rd%20parallel%20north">23°N</a> <a href="latitude">latitude</a> in the winter, and from <a href="35th%20parallel%20north">35°N</a> to <a href="50th%20parallel%20north">50°N</a> latitude in the summer. Approximately 75% of the North Pacific population lives east of the <a href="International%20Date%20Line">International Date Line</a>, but there is little information regarding the North Pacific distribution. , the U.S. <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> estimated that the eastern North Pacific population stood at 374 whales. Two whales tagged in deep waters off California were later recaptured off <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a> and <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, revealing a possible link between these areas, but the lack of other tag recovery data makes these two cases inconclusive. Occurrences within the <a href="Gulf%20of%20California">Gulf of California</a> have been fewer. In <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a> and <a href="Sea%20of%20Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a>, whales are not common, although whales were more commonly seen than today in southern part of Sea of Japan from Korean Peninsula to the southern <a href="Primorsky%20Krai">Primorsky Krai</a> in the past, and there had been a sighting in <a href="Golden%20Horn%20Bay">Golden Horn Bay</a>, and whales were much more abundant in the triangle area around <a href="Kunashir%20Island">Kunashir Island</a> in whaling days, making the area well known as sei – ground, and there had been a sighting of a cow calf pair off the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a> coast of mid-<a href="Honshu">Honshu</a> during cetacean survey.

Sei whales have been recorded from northern Indian Ocean as well such as around <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> and <a href="India">India</a>n coasts.

In the Southern Hemisphere, summer distribution based upon historic catch data is between <a href="40th%20parallel%20south">40°S</a> and <a href="50th%20parallel%20south">50°S</a> latitude in the South Atlantic and southern Indian Oceans and <a href="45th%20parallel%20south">45°S</a> and <a href="60th%20parallel%20south">60°S</a> in the South Pacific, while winter distribution is poorly known, with former winter whaling grounds being located off northeastern Brazil (<a href="7th%20parallel%20south">7°S</a>) and Peru (<a href="6th%20parallel%20south">6°S</a>). The majority of the "sei" whales caught off Angola and Congo, as well as other nearby areas in equatorial West Africa, are thought to have been predominantly misidentified <a href="Bryde%27s%20whale">Bryde's whale</a>s. For example, Ruud (1952) found that 42 of the "sei whale" catch off <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a> in 1952 were actually Bryde's whales, based on examination of their baleen plates. The only confirmed historical record is the capture of a female, which was brought to the Cap Lopez whaling station in Gabon in September 1950. During cetacean sighting surveys off Angola between 2003 and 2006, only a single confirmed sighting of two individuals was made in August 2004, compared to 19 sightings of Bryde's whales. Sei whales are commonly distributed along west to southern Latin America including along entire Chilean coasts, within <a href="Beagle%20Channel">Beagle Channel</a> to <a href="Isla%20Grande%20de%20Tierra%20del%20Fuego">Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego</a>, and possibly feed in the <a href="Ays%C3%A9n%20Region">Aysen</a> region.

In general, the sei whale migrates annually from cool and subpolar waters in summer to temperate and subtropical waters for winter, where food is more abundant. In the northwest Atlantic, sightings and catch records suggest the whales move north along the shelf edge to arrive in the areas of <a href="Georges%20Bank">Georges Bank</a>, <a href="Gulf%20of%20Maine">Northeast Channel</a>, and <a href="Gulf%20of%20Maine">Browns Bank</a> by mid- to late June. They are present off the south coast of <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> in August and September, and a southbound migration begins moving west and south along the <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>n shelf from mid-September to mid-November. Whales in the <a href="Labrador%20Sea">Labrador Sea</a> as early as the first week of June may move farther northward to waters southwest of <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> later in the summer. In the northeast Atlantic, the sei whale winters as far south as <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a> such as off <a href="Banc%20d%27Arguin%20National%20Park">Bay of Arguin</a>, off <a href="Cintra%20Bay">coastal Western Sahara</a> and follows the continental slope northward in spring. Large females lead the northward migration and reach the <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a> earlier and more reliably than other sexes and classes, arriving in mid-July and remaining through mid-September. In some years, males and younger females remain at lower latitudes during the summer.

Despite knowing some general migration patterns, exact routes are incompletely known and scientists cannot readily predict exactly where groups will appear from one year to the next. F.O. Kapel noted a correlation between appearances west of Greenland and the incursion of relatively warm waters from the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Current">Irminger Current</a> into that area. Some evidence from tagging data indicates individuals return off the coast of <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a> on an annual basis. An individual satellite-tagged off <a href="Faial%20Island">Faial</a>, in the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>, traveled more than to the Labrador Sea via the <a href="Charlie-Gibbs%20Fracture%20Zone">Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone</a> (CGFZ) between April and June 2005. It appeared to "hitch a ride" on prevailing currents, with erratic movements indicative of feeding behavior in five areas, in particular the CGFZ, an area of known high sei whale abundance as well as high copepod concentrations. Seven whales tagged off Faial and <a href="Pico%20Island">Pico</a> from May to June in 2008 and 2009 made their way to the Labrador Sea, while an eighth individual tagged in September 2009 headed southeast – its signal was lost between <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> and the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>.

The development of explosive <a href="harpoon">harpoon</a>s and steam-powered whaling ships in the late nineteenth century brought previously unobtainable large whales within reach of commercial <a href="Whaling">whalers</a>. Initially their speed and elusiveness, and later the comparatively small yield of <a href="Whale%20oil">oil</a> and <a href="whale%20meat">meat</a> partially protected them. Once stocks of more profitable <a href="right%20whale">right whale</a>s, blue whales, fin whales, and humpback whales became depleted, sei whales were hunted in earnest, particularly from 1950 to 1980.

In the North Atlantic between 1885 and 1984, 14,295 sei whales were taken. They were hunted in large numbers off the coasts of Norway and Scotland beginning in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and in 1885 alone, more than 700 were caught off <a href="Finnmark">Finnmark</a>. Their meat was a popular Norwegian food. The meat's value made the hunting of this difficult-to-catch species profitable in the early twentieth century.

In Iceland, a total of 2,574 whales were taken from the <a href="Hvalfj%C3%B6r%C3%B0ur">Hvalfjörður</a> whaling station between 1948 and 1985. Since the late 1960s to early 1970s, the sei whale has been second only to the fin whale as the preferred target of Icelandic whalers, with meat in greater demand than <a href="whale%20oil">whale oil</a>, the prior target.

Small numbers were taken off the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, beginning in the 1920s by Spanish whalers, off the <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>n shelf in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Canadian whalers, and off the coast of West Greenland from the 1920s to the 1950s by Norwegian and Danish whalers.

In the North Pacific, the total reported catch by commercial whalers was 72,215 between 1910 and 1975; the majority were taken after 1947. Shore stations in <a href="Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="Korea">Korea</a> processed 300–600 each year between 1911 and 1955. In 1959, the Japanese catch peaked at 1,340. Heavy exploitation in the North Pacific began in the early 1960s, with catches averaging 3,643 per year from 1963 to 1974 (total 43,719; annual range 1,280–6,053). In 1971, after a decade of high catches, it became scarce in Japanese waters, ending commercial whaling in 1975.

Off the coast of North America, sei whales were hunted off British Columbia from the late 1950s to the mid-1960s, when the number of whales captured dropped to around 14 per year. More than 2,000 were caught in British Columbian waters between 1962 and 1967. Between 1957 and 1971, <a href="California">California</a> shore stations processed 386 whales. Commercial Sei whaling ended in the eastern North Pacific in 1971.

A total of 152,233 were taken in the Southern Hemisphere between 1910 and 1979. Whaling in <a href="Southern%20Ocean">southern oceans</a> originally targeted humpback whales. By 1913, this species became rare, and the catch of fin and blue whales began to increase. As these species likewise became scarce, sei whale catches increased rapidly in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The catch peaked in 1964–65 at over 20,000 sei whales, but by 1976, this number had dropped to below 2,000 and commercial whaling for the species ended in 1977.

Since the moratorium on commercial whaling, some sei whales have been taken by Icelandic and Japanese whalers under the IWC's scientific research programme. Iceland carried out four years of scientific whaling between 1986 and 1989, killing up to 40 sei whales a year.
Japanese scientists catch about 50 sei whales each year for this purpose. The research is conducted by the <a href="Institute%20of%20Cetacean%20Research">Institute of Cetacean Research</a> (ICR) in <a href="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, a privately funded, nonprofit institution. The main focus of the research is to examine what they eat and to assess the competition between whales and fisheries. Dr. Seiji Ohsumi, Director General of the ICR, said,

He later added,

Conservation groups, such as the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wildlife Fund</a>, dispute the value of this research, claiming that sei whales feed primarily on <a href="squid">squid</a> and <a href="plankton">plankton</a> which are not hunted by humans, and only rarely on <a href="fish">fish</a>. They say that the program is

At the 2001 meeting of the IWC Scientific Committee, 32 scientists submitted a document expressing their belief that the Japanese program lacked scientific rigor and would not meet minimum standards of <a href="peer%20review">academic review</a>.

In 2010, a Los Angeles restaurant confirmed to be serving sei <a href="whale%20meat">whale meat</a> was closed by its owners after prosecution by authorities for handling a protected species.
The sei whale did not have meaningful international protection until 1970, when the <a href="International%20Whaling%20Commission">International Whaling Commission</a> first set catch quotas for the <a href="North%20Pacific">North Pacific</a> for individual species. Before quotas, there were no legal limits. Complete protection from commercial whaling in the North Pacific came in 1976.

Quotas on sei whales in the North Atlantic began in 1977. Southern Hemisphere stocks were protected in 1979. Facing mounting evidence that several whale species were threatened with extinction, the IWC established a complete moratorium on commercial whaling beginning in 1986.

In the late 1970s, some "pirate" whaling took place in the eastern North Atlantic. There is no direct evidence of illegal whaling in the North Pacific, although the acknowledged misreporting of whaling data by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> means that catch data are not entirely reliable.

The species remained listed on the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a> <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red List of Threatened Species</a> in 2000, categorized as "endangered". Northern Hemisphere populations are listed as <a href="CITES">CITES</a> Appendix II, indicating they are not immediately threatened with extinction, but may become so if they are not listed. Populations in the Southern Hemisphere are listed as <a href="CITES">CITES</a> Appendix I, indicating they are threatened with extinction if trade is not halted.

The sei whale is listed on both Appendix I and Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (<a href="Bonn%20Convention">CMS</a>). It is listed on Appendix I as this species has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them and also on Appendix II as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

Sei whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (<a href="Pacific%20Islands%20Cetaceans%20Memorandum%20of%20Understanding">Pacific Cetaceans MOU</a>) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (<a href="ACCOBAMS">ACCOBAMS</a>).

The species is listed as endangered by the U.S. government <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> under the U.S. <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>.

The current population is estimated at 80,000, nearly a third of the prewhaling population. A 1991 study in the North Atlantic estimated only 4,000. Sei whales were said to have been scarce in the 1960s and early 1970s off northern Norway. One possible explanation for this disappearance is that the whales were <a href="Overexploitation">overexploited</a>. The drastic reduction in northeastern Atlantic <a href="copepod">copepod</a> stocks during the late 1960s may be another culprit. Surveys in the <a href="Denmark%20Strait">Denmark Strait</a> found 1,290 whales in 1987, and 1,590 whales in 1989. <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>'s population estimates are between 1,393 and 2,248, with a minimum of 870.

A 1977 study estimated Pacific Ocean totals of 9,110, based upon catch and <a href="catch%20per%20unit%20effort">CPUE</a> data. Japanese interests claim this figure is outdated, and in 2002 claimed the western North Pacific population was over 28,000, a figure not accepted by the scientific community. In western Canadian waters, researchers with <a href="Fisheries%20and%20Oceans%20Canada">Fisheries and Oceans Canada</a> observed five Seis together in the summer of 2017, the first such sighting in over 50 years. In California waters, there was only one confirmed and five possible sightings by 1991 to 1993 aerial and ship surveys, and there were no confirmed sightings off Oregon coasts such as <a href="Maumee%20Bay">Maumee Bay</a> and Washington. Prior to commercial whaling, the North Pacific hosted an estimated 42,000. By the end of whaling, the population was down to between 7,260 and 12,620.

In the Southern Hemisphere, population estimates range between 9,800 and 12,000, based upon catch history and CPUE. The IWC estimated 9,718 whales based upon survey data between 1978 and 1988. Prior to commercial whaling, there were an estimated 65,000.

Mass death events for sei whales have been recorded for many years and evidence suggests endemic poisoning (<a href="red%20tide">red tide</a>) causes may have caused mass deaths in prehistoric times. In June 2015, scientists flying over southern Chile counted 337 dead sei whales, in what is regarded as the largest mass beaching ever documented. The cause is not yet known; however, toxic algae blooms caused by unprecedented warming in the Pacific Ocean, known as <a href="The%20Blob%20%28Pacific%20Ocean%29">the Blob</a>, may be implicated.

Flag of Hong Kong

The flag of Hong Kong, officially regional flag of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, features white, stylised, five-petal <a href="Bauhinia%20blakeana">Hong Kong orchid tree ("Bauhinia blakeana")</a> flower in the centre of a red field. Its design was adopted on 4 April 1990 at the Third Session of the Seventh <a href="National%20People%27s%20Congress">National People's Congress</a>. The precise use of the flag is regulated by laws passed by the 58th executive meeting of the <a href="State%20Council%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">State Council</a> held in Beijing. The design of the flag is enshrined in Hong Kong's <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Basic%20Law">Basic Law</a>, the territory's constitutional document, and regulations regarding the use, prohibition of use, <a href="Flag%20desecration">desecration</a>, and manufacture of the flag are stated in the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance. The flag of Hong Kong was first officially hoisted on 1 July 1997, in the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20handover%20ceremony">handover ceremony</a> marking the transfer of sovereignty.

The Chinese name of <a href="Bauhinia%20%C3%97%20blakeana">Bauhinia × blakeana</a> has also been frequently shortened as 紫荊/紫荆 (洋 "yáng" means "foreign" in Chinese, and this would be deemed inappropriate by the PRC government), although 紫荊/紫荆 refers to another genus called "<a href="Cercis">Cercis</a>". A <a href="statue">statue</a> of the plant has been erected in <a href="Golden%20Bauhinia%20Square">Golden Bauhinia Square</a> in Hong Kong. Although the flowers are bright pinkish purple in colour, they are depicted in white on the Flag of Hong Kong.

The design of the flag comes with cultural, political, and regional meanings. The colour itself is significant; red is a festive colour for the <a href="Chinese%20people">Chinese people</a>, used to convey a sense of celebration and nationalism. Moreover, the red colour is identical to that used in the <a href="Flag%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">national PRC flag</a>, chosen to signify the link re-established between post-colonial Hong Kong and China. The position of red and white on the flag symbolises the "<a href="one%20country%20two%20systems">one country two systems</a>" political principle applied to the region. The stylised rendering of the "<a href="Bauhinia%20blakeana">Bauhinia blakeana</a>" flower, a flower discovered in Hong Kong, is meant to serve as a harmonising symbol for this dichotomy. The five stars of the Chinese national flag, representing the Communist Party and Mao Zedong's four classes (proletarian workers, agricultural peasants, petty bourgeoisie and capitalists), are replicated on the petals of the flower.

Before the adoption of the flag, the Chairman of the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Basic%20Law%20Drafting%20Committee">Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee</a> explained the significance of the flag's design to the National People's Congress:
The <a href="Hong%20Kong%20government">Hong Kong government</a> has specified sizes, colours, and manufacturing parameters in which the flag is to be made. The background of the rectangular flag is red, the same shade of red as that used for the national PRC flag. The ratio of its length to breadth is 2:1. In its centre is a five-petal stylised rendering of a white "<a href="Bauhinia%20blakeana">Bauhinia blakeana</a>" flower. If a circle circumscribes the flower, it should have a diameter 0.6 times the entire height of the flag. The petals are uniformly spread around the centre point of the flag, radiating outward and pointing in a clockwise direction. Each of the flower's petals bears a five-pointed <a href="red%20star">red star</a>, a <a href="communist">communist</a> and socialist symbolism, with a red trace, suggestive of a flower <a href="stamen">stamen</a>. The red trace makes each petal look as if it is being divided in half. The heading that is used to allow a flag to be slid or raised onto a pole is white.

This table lists all the official sizes for the flag. Sizes deviating from this list are considered non-standard. If a flag is not of official size, it must be a scaled-down or scaled-up version of one of the official sizes.

The following are the approximate colours of the Hong Kong flag in different colour models. It is listed by <a href="Web%20colors">web colours</a> in <a href="hexadecimal">hexadecimal</a> notation, <a href="CMYK%20color%20model">CMYK</a> equivalents*, dye colours, <a href="HLS%20color%20space">HSL</a> equivalents, and <a href="Pantone">Pantone</a> equivalents.
<nowiki>*</nowiki>CMYK equivalents based on official downloadable files from Hong Kong's Protocol website (see 2nd external link).

The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance stipulates that the Hong Kong flag must be manufactured according to specifications laid out in the ordinance. If flags are not produced in design according to the ordinance, the <a href="Secretary%20for%20Justice">Secretary for Justice</a> may petition the <a href="District%20Court%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">District Court</a> for an injunction to prohibit the person or company from manufacturing the flags. If the District Court agrees that the flags are not in compliance, it may issue an injunction and order that the flags and the materials that were used to make the flags to be seized by the government.

The Hong Kong flag is flown daily from the <a href="Chief%20Executive%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Chief Executive</a>'s official residence, the <a href="Government%20House%2C%20Hong%20Kong">Government House</a>, the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20International%20Airport">Hong Kong International Airport</a>, and at all border crossings and points of entry into Hong Kong. At major government offices and buildings, such as the Office of the Chief Executive, the <a href="Executive%20Council%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Executive Council</a>, the <a href="Court%20of%20Final%20Appeal%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Court of Final Appeal</a>, the <a href="High%20Court%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">High Court</a>, the <a href="Legislative%20Council%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Legislative Council</a>, and the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Economic%20and%20Trade%20Office">Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office</a>s overseas, the flag is displayed during days when these offices are working. Other government offices and buildings, such as hospitals, schools, departmental headquarters, sports grounds, and cultural venues should fly the flag on occasions such as the <a href="National%20Day%20of%20the%20People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">National Day of the PRC</a> (1 October), the <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Special%20Administrative%20Region%20Establishment%20Day">Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Establishment Day</a> (1 July), and New Year's Day. The flag should be raised at 8:00 a.m. and lowered at 6:00 p.m. The raising and lowering of the flag should be done slowly; it must reach the peak of the flag staff when it is raised, and it may not touch the ground when it is lowered. The flag may not be raised in severe weather conditions. A Hong Kong flag that is either damaged, defaced, faded or substandard must not be displayed or used.

Whenever the PRC national flag is flown together with the regional Hong Kong flag, the national flag must be flown at the centre, above the regional flag, or otherwise in a more prominent position than that of the regional flag. The regional flag must be smaller in size than the national flag, and it must be displayed to the left of the national flag. When the flags are displayed inside a building, the left and right sides of a person looking at the flags, and with his or her back toward the wall, are used as reference points for the left and right sides of a flag. When the flags are displayed outside a building, the left and right sides of a person standing in front of the building and looking towards the front entrance are used as reference points for the left and right sides of a flag. The national flag should be raised before the regional flag is raised, and it should be lowered after the regional flag is lowered.

An exception to this rule occurs during medal presentation ceremonies at multi-sport events such as the Olympics and <a href="Asian%20Games">Asian Games</a>. As Hong Kong competes separately from mainland China, should an athlete from Hong Kong win the gold medal, and an athlete from mainland China win the silver and/or bronze medal(s) in the same event, the regional flag of Hong Kong would be raised in the centre above the national flag(s) during the medal presentation ceremony.

The Hong Kong flag must be lowered to <a href="half-mast">half-mast</a> as a token of mourning when any of the following people die:

The flag may also be flown at half-mast when the Central People's Government advises the Chief Executive to do so, or when the Chief Executive considers it appropriate to do so, on occurrences of unfortunate events causing especially serious casualties, or when serious natural calamities have caused heavy casualties. When raising a flag to be flown at half-mast, it should first be raised to the top of the pole and then lowered to a point where the distance between the top of the flag and the top of the pole is one third of the length of the pole. When lowering the flag from half-mast, it should first be raised to the peak of the pole before it is lowered.

The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance states what manner of use of the Hong Kong flag is prohibited and that desecration of the flag is prohibited; it also states that it is a punishable offence for a person to use the flag in a prohibited manner or desecrate the flag. According to the ordinance, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that "publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling" the flag is considered flag desecration. Similarly, the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance extends the same prohibition toward the national PRC flag. The ordinances also allow for the Chief Executive to make stipulations regarding the use of the flag. In stipulations made in 1997, the Chief Executive further specified that the use of the flag in "any trade, calling or profession, or the logo, seal or badge of any non-governmental organisation" is also prohibited unless prior permission was obtained.

The first conviction of flag desecration occurred in 1999. Protesters Ng Kung Siu and Lee Kin Yun wrote the word "Shame" on both the national PRC flag and the Hong Kong flag, and were convicted of violating the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance and the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance. The <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Court of Appeal</a> overturned the verdict, ruling that the ordinances were unnecessary restrictions on the <a href="freedom%20of%20expression">freedom of expression</a> and in violation of both the Basic Law and the <a href="International%20Covenant%20on%20Civil%20and%20Political%20Rights">International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</a>. Upon further appeal, however, the <a href="Court%20of%20Final%20Appeal%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Court of Final Appeal</a> maintained the original guilty verdict, holding that this restriction on the freedom of expression was justifiable in that the protection of the flags played a role in national unity and territorial integrity and constituted a restriction on the mode of expressing one's message but did not interfere with one's freedom to express the same message in other ways.<ref name="FACC000004/1999"></ref>

<a href="Leung%20Kwok-hung">Leung Kwok-hung</a>, a member of the Legislative Council and a political activist in Hong Kong, was penalised in February 2001, before he became a member of the Legislative Council, for defiling the flag. He was convicted of three counts of desecrating the flag—for two incidents on 1 July 2000 during the third anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China and for one incident on 9 July of the same year during a protest against elections to choose the <a href="Election%20Committee">Election Committee</a>, the <a href="electoral%20college">electoral college</a> which chooses the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. Leung was placed on a good-behaviour bond for 12 months in the sum of <a href="HK%24">HK$</a>3,000.

Zhu Rongchang, a mainland Chinese farmer has been jailed for three weeks after setting fire to a Chinese flag in Hong Kong. Zhu was charged for "publicly and wilfully" burning the Chinese flag at Golden Bauhinia Square in central Hong Kong. The 74-year-old man is reportedly the third person charged for desecrating the Chinese national flag, but he is first to be jailed under the law.

In early 2013, protestors went to the streets flying the old colonial flag demanding more democracy and resignation of Chief Executive <a href="Leung%20Chun%20Ying">Leung Chun Ying</a>. The use of the flag has created concerns from Chinese authorities and request from Leung to stop flying the flag. Despite the calls from Leung the old flags are not subject to use restrictions beyond not being allowed to be placed on flagpoles and are freely sold and manufactured in the territory.

Prior to Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty, the flag of Hong Kong was a colonial <a href="Blue%20Ensign">Blue Ensign</a> flag. The flag of <a href="colonial%20Hong%20Kong">colonial Hong Kong</a> underwent several changes in the last one and a half centuries.

In 1843, a <a href="Seal%20%28contract%20law%29">seal</a> representing Hong Kong was instituted. The design was based on a local waterfront scene; three local merchants with their commercial goods can be found on the foreground, a square-rigged ship and a junk occupy the middle ground, while the background consists of conical hills and clouds. In 1868, a Hong Kong flag was produced, a Blue Ensign flag with a badge based on this "local scene", but the design was rejected by <a href="Governor%20of%20Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong Governor</a> <a href="Richard%20Graves%20MacDonnell">Richard Graves MacDonnell</a>.

In 1870, a "white crown over HK" badge for the Blue Ensign flag was proposed by the <a href="Chief%20Secretary%20for%20Administration">Colonial Secretary</a>. The letters "HK" were omitted and the crown became full-colour three years later. It is unclear exactly what the badge looked like during that period of time, but it was unlikely to be the "local scene". It should have been a crown of some sort, which may, or may not, have had the letters "HK" below it. In 1876, the "local scene" badge ( "Picture of "Ar Kwan" Guiding the British soldier") was re-adopted to the Blue Ensign flag with the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a>'s approval.

A <a href="Emblem%20of%20Hong%20Kong">coat of arms for Hong Kong</a> was granted on 21 January 1959 by the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a> in London. The Hong Kong flag was revised in the same year to feature <a href="Flag%20of%20Hong%20Kong%20%281959%E2%80%931997%29">the coat of arms in the Blue Ensign flag</a>. This design was used officially from 1959 until Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty in 1997. Since then, the colonial flag has been appropriated by protestors, such as on the annual <a href="Hong%20Kong%201%20July%20marches">1 July marches</a> for <a href="universal%20suffrage">universal suffrage</a>, as a "symbol of antagonism towards the mainland", along with a blue flag featuring the coat of arms, used by those <a href="Hong%20Kong%20independence%20movement">advocating independence</a>.
Before Hong Kong's transfer of sovereignty, between 20 May 1987 and 31 March 1988, a contest was held amongst Hong Kong residents to help choose a flag for post-colonial Hong Kong, with 7,147 design submissions, in which 4,489 submissions were about flag designs. Architect <a href="Tao%20Ho">Tao Ho</a> was chosen as one of the panel judges to pick Hong Kong's new flag. He recalled that some of the designs had been rather funny and with political twists: "One had a <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a> on one side and a <a href="dollar%20sign">dollar sign</a> on the other." Some designs were rejected because they contained copyrighted materials, for example, the emblem of <a href="Urban%20Council%20%28Hong%20Kong%29">Urban Council</a>, <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Arts%20Festival">Hong Kong Arts Festival</a> and <a href="Hong%20Kong%20Tourism%20Board">Hong Kong Tourism Board</a>. Six designs were chosen as finalists by the judges, but were all later rejected by the PRC. Ho and two others were then asked by the PRC to submit new proposals.

Looking for inspiration, Ho wandered into a garden and picked up a "Bauhinia blakeana" flower. He observed the symmetry of the five petals, and how their winding pattern conveyed to him a dynamic feeling. This led him to incorporate the flower into the flag to represent Hong Kong. The design was adopted on 4 April 1990 at the Third Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, and the flag was first officially hoisted seconds after midnight on 1 July 1997 in the handover ceremony marking the transfer of sovereignty. It was hoisted together with the national PRC flag, while the Chinese national anthem, "<a href="March%20of%20the%20Volunteers">March of the Volunteers</a>" was played. The <a href="Union%20Flag">Union Flag</a> and the colonial Hong Kong flag were lowered seconds before midnight.

A selection of proposals during the 1987–1988 contest is shown below:

William Etty

William Etty (10 March 1787 – 13 November 1849) was an English artist best known for his <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>s containing <a href="nude%20%28art%29">nude</a> figures. He was the first significant British painter of nudes and <a href="still%20life">still life</a>s. Born in <a href="York">York</a>, he left school at the age of 12 to become an <a href="apprenticeship">apprentice</a> printer in <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>. He completed his apprenticeship seven years later and moved to London, where in 1807 he joined the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Schools">Royal Academy Schools</a>. There he studied under <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a> and trained by copying works by other artists. Etty earned respect at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> for his ability to paint realistic flesh tones, but had little commercial or critical success in his first few years in London.

Etty's "<a href="Cleopatra%27s%20Arrival%20in%20Cilicia">Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia</a>", painted in 1821, featured numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim. Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes. All but one of the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure, and he acquired a reputation for indecency. Despite this, he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, and in 1828 was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. Although he was one of the most respected artists in the country he continued to study at <a href="life%20class">life class</a>es throughout his life, a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists. In the 1830s Etty began to branch out into the more lucrative but less respected field of <a href="portraiture">portraiture</a>, and later became the first English painter to paint significant still lifes. He continued to paint both male and female nudes, which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press.

An extremely shy man, Etty rarely socialised and never married. From 1824 until his death he lived with his niece Betsy (Elizabeth Etty). Even in London he retained a keen interest in his native York, and was instrumental in the establishment of the town's first art school and the campaign to preserve <a href="York%20city%20walls">York city walls</a>. While he never formally converted from his <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> faith, he was deeply attached to the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> and was one of the few non-Catholics to attend the 1838 opening of <a href="Augustus%20Pugin">Augustus Pugin</a>'s chapel for <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20College%2C%20Oscott">St Mary's College, Oscott</a>, at that time England's most important Roman Catholic building.

Etty was prolific and commercially successful throughout the 1840s, but the quality of his work deteriorated throughout this period. As his health progressively worsened he retired to York in 1848. He died in 1849, shortly after a major <a href="retrospective%20exhibition">retrospective exhibition</a>. In the immediate aftermath of his death his works became highly collectable and sold for large sums. Changing tastes meant his work later fell out of fashion, and imitators soon abandoned his style. By the end of the 19th century the value of all of his works had fallen below their original prices, and outside his native York he remained little known throughout the 20th century. Etty's inclusion in <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a>'s landmark "Exposed: The Victorian Nude" exhibition in 2001–02, the high-profile restoration of his "<a href="The%20Sirens%20and%20Ulysses">The Sirens and Ulysses</a>" in 2010 and a major retrospective of his work at the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a> in 2011–12 led to renewed interest in his work.

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, British painting was strongly influenced by <a href="Joshua%20Reynolds">Joshua Reynolds</a> (1723–1792), the first president of the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> (RA). Reynolds believed the purpose of art was "to conceive and represent their subjects in a poetical manner, not confined to mere matter of fact", and that artists should emulate <a href="Renaissance">Renaissance</a> painters such as <a href="Rubens">Rubens</a>, <a href="Paolo%20Veronese">Paolo Veronese</a> and <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a> and make their subjects close to perfection. After Reynolds's death his "Discourses on Art", which extolled the notion of an artist's duty to paint idealised subjects, remained Britain's primary theoretical work on art. The Royal Academy dominated British art, with the annual <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Summer%20Exhibition">Royal Academy Summer Exhibition</a> the most important event in the calendar. The Royal Academy also controlled the prestigious Royal Academy art schools, which had an effective monopoly on the training of new artists and which taught with a very narrow focus on approved techniques. While painters such as <a href="J.%20M.%20W.%20Turner">J. M. W. Turner</a> (a strong supporter of the Royal Academy) were beginning to move away from the influence of the <a href="Old%20Masters">Old Masters</a> to create uniquely British styles, they adhered to principles established by Reynolds.

In the opinions then current at the Royal Academy and among critics, the most prestigious form of painting was considered <a href="history%20painting">history painting</a>, in which an artwork illustrated a story. It was thought that such works enabled British artists to show themselves as equal or even superior to those European artists active at the time, as well as to the Old Masters. Other forms of painting such as portraiture and landscapes were considered lesser styles, as they did not give the artist as much opportunity to illustrate a story but instead were simply depictions of reality. Nonetheless, even the most eminent artists would often devote time to portrait painting, as portraits were generally commissioned by the subjects or their families, providing a guaranteed source of income to the artist; two of the first three presidents of the Royal Academy (Joshua Reynolds and <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Sir Thomas Lawrence</a>) had made their names as portrait painters. Owing to a lack of patrons willing to commission history paintings, by the early 19th century history painting in England was in serious decline.

William Etty was born in Feasegate, <a href="York">York</a>, on 10 March 1787, the seventh child of Matthew and Esther Etty, née Calverley. Although Matthew Etty was a successful miller and baker, he bore a large family and was never financially secure. Esther Calverley's brother unexpectedly inherited the title of <a href="Squire">Squire</a> of <a href="Hayton%2C%20East%20Riding%20of%20Yorkshire">Hayton</a> in 1745, nine years before Esther's birth, but disowned her following her marriage to Matthew, whom he considered as beneath her station. The family were strict <a href="Methodism">Methodists</a> and William was raised as such, although he disliked the spartan appearance of the Methodist chapel and liked to attend his <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a> parish church or <a href="York%20Minster">York Minster</a> when able.

He showed artistic promise from an early age, drawing in chalk on the wooden floor of his father's shop. From the age of four he attended local schools in York, before being sent at the age of 10 to Mr. Hall's Academy, a <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> in nearby <a href="Pocklington">Pocklington</a>, which he left two years later. On 8 October 1798, at the age of 11, William was apprenticed as a printer to Robert Peck of <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Hull</a>, publisher of the "Hull Packet". While Etty found the work exhausting and unpleasant, he continued to draw in his spare time, and his job gave him the opportunity to broaden his education by reading books. It seems likely that it was working as a printer that led him to realise for the first time that it was possible for someone to make a living drawing and painting.

On 23 October 1805, Etty's seven-year <a href="indenture">indenture</a> with Peck expired, an event greeted with great happiness as he intensely disliked the job. He remained in Hull for a further three weeks as a <a href="journeyman">journeyman</a> printer. He moved to London "with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours", to stay with his older brother Walter in <a href="Lombard%20Street%2C%20London">Lombard Street</a>. Walter worked for the successful <a href="metal%20lace">gold lace</a> manufacturer Bodley, Etty and Bodley, with whom their father's brother, also named William, was partner. He arrived in London on 23 November 1805, with the intention of gaining admission to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20Schools">Royal Academy Schools</a>.

Applicants to the Royal Academy Schools were expected to pass stringent ability tests, and on his arrival in London Etty set about practicing, drawing "from prints and from nature". Aware that all successful applicants were expected to produce high quality drawings of <a href="classical%20sculpture">classical sculpture</a>s, he spent much time "in a plaster-cast shop, kept by Gianelli, in that lane near to Smithfield, immortalised by Dr. Johnson's visit to see 'The Ghost' there", which he described as "My "first" academy".

Etty obtained a <a href="letter%20of%20introduction">letter of introduction</a> from Member of Parliament <a href="Richard%20Sharp%20%28politician%29">Richard Sharp</a> to painter <a href="John%20Opie">John Opie</a>. He visited Opie with this letter, and showed him a drawing he had done from a cast of "<a href="Cupid%20and%20Psyche%20%28Capitoline%20Museums%29">Cupid and Psyche</a>". Impressed, Opie recommended Etty to <a href="Henry%20Fuseli">Henry Fuseli</a>, who accepted him into the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer. Having satisfactorily completed drawings from casts of "<a href="Laoco%C3%B6n%20and%20His%20Sons">Laocoön</a>" and "the Torso of Michelangelo", Etty was accepted as a full student on 15 January 1807.
Shortly after Etty joined the RA, four major lectures on painting were delivered by John Opie in February and March 1807. In them, Opie said that painting "brings into view the heroes, sages, and beauties of the earliest periods, the inhabitants of the most distant regions, and fixes and perpetuates the forms of the present day; it presents to us the heroic deeds, the remarkable events, and the interesting examples of piety, patriotism and humanity of all ages; and according to the nature of the action depicted, fills us with innocent pleasure, excites our abhorrence of crimes, moves us to piety, or inspires us with elevated sentiments". Opie rejected Reynolds's tradition of idealising the subjects of paintings, observing that he did not believe "that the flesh of heroes is less like flesh than that of other men". Opie advised his students to pay great attention to <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, whose use of colour he considered unsurpassed, advising students that "colouring is the sunshine of the art, that clothes poverty in smiles [...] and doubles the charms of beauty. Opie's opinions made a deep impression on the young Etty, and he would hold these views throughout his career.

By this time, Etty had developed a great admiration for the portrait painter <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a>, and hoped to learn from him. Having arranged an introduction via Henry Fuseli, Etty's uncle William met with Lawrence and paid him 100 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> (about £ in 2019 terms) in return for his accepting the younger William as a private pupil for a year.

Under this arrangement Etty did not receive formal tuition from Lawrence. Instead, Lawrence set aside a room in his attic for Etty to copy from his pictures, and agreed to answer questions when he was in a position to do so. Etty found the experience of copying Lawrence's work extremely frustrating, and in his own words "was ready to run away", but he persisted and eventually taught himself to copy Lawrence's work very closely. Although Etty found his year with Lawrence a frustrating experience, his development of the ability to copy other works served him in good stead in future when he came to copy elements from the Old Masters.

Once he had completed his year with Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the <a href="life%20class">life class</a> and copying other paintings, as well as undertaking commissions and doing occasional work for Lawrence to earn money. He was unsuccessful in all the Academy's competitions, and every painting he submitted for the Summer Exhibition was rejected.

In 1809 Etty's uncle William, with whom he had been staying, died. He was forced into an inconvenient transient lifestyle, moving from lodging to lodging. Etty had been left a significant sum in his uncle's will, and his brother Walter now took over their uncle's position at Bodley, Etty and Bodley, giving Walter the means to support the younger William's work financially. In 1811 Etty's persistence paid off. Two of his paintings were accepted for the "Telemachus Rescues Antiope from the Fury of the Wild Boar" exhibition at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, and "Sappho" at the <a href="British%20Institution">British Institution</a>. The latter sold for the respectable sum of 25 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms). Although from now on Etty had at least one work accepted for the Summer Exhibition each year, he had little commercial success and generated little interest over the next few years. By 1814, Etty was becoming widely respected at the RA for his use of colour and in particular his ability to produce realistic flesh tones.

At the time, there were no public art galleries in England with permanent collections. In 1816, in the face of his continued lack of success, Etty decided to spend a year in Italy to study the artworks held in the great Italian collections. He had made a brief visit to France in early 1815, but other than this had never been abroad. The 28-year-old Etty had fallen in love, and fretted about the difficulties a potential marriage would cause, and whether it would be right to travel to further his career even though it would mean taking his new wife to a foreign country. In the event, the woman rejected him, and he set out for the Continent in early September 1816.

Etty landed in <a href="Dieppe">Dieppe</a>, and made his way to Paris via <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a>. Although he admitted to finding France a beautiful country, he was unhappy throughout his stay there, suffering from severe homesickness; shortly after his arrival in Paris he wrote to his cousin Martha Bodley that "I hope I shall like Italy better than Paris, or I think I shall not feel resolution to stop a year. If I don't, I shall content myself with seeing what I think worth while; and then return." He travelled onwards via <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, but found Switzerland frustrating; although he had brought his own tea-making equipment with him, in the remoter mountain villages he found it difficult to obtain milk for his tea. Travelling through the <a href="Simplon%20Pass">Simplon Pass</a> to <a href="Piedmont">Piedmont</a> revived his spirits somewhat; he found the variety of colour in the landscapes of northern Italy fascinating, and in late September arrived in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>.
Despite the grandeur of Florence, Etty was severely depressed, writing to his brother on 5 October that "I feel so lonely, it is impossible for me to be happy" and complaining of "the vermin in the bed, the dirt and the filth" which he considered "such as no Englishman can have any idea of, who has not witnessed it". His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the <a href="atelier">atelier</a> of <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Regnault">Jean-Baptiste Regnault</a> but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20Beaux-Arts">Académie des Beaux-Arts</a>, and amassed a large quantity of <a href="Old%20master%20print">prints</a> from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.

Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition ("Bacchanalians: a Sketch" and "Cupid and Euphrosyne") attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from <a href="William%20Paulet%20Carey">William Paulet Carey</a> writing in the "<a href="Literary%20Gazette">Literary Gazette</a>" who considered "Bacchanalians" "a fine classical invention" and "Cupid" as showing "splendid promise". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of <a href="Damiano%20Mazza">Damiano Mazza</a>'s "The Rape of Ganymede"—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student. Etty was disqualified from the competition, but the high quality of his work further raised his prestige within the Academy. Although his income was still low and he was surviving on gifts from his brother, at some point by 1818 Etty hired an assistant, George Henry Franklin.

At the 1820 Summer Exhibition, Etty exhibited two paintings: "Drunken Barnaby" and "The Coral Finder: Venus and her Youthful Satellites Arriving at the Isle of Paphos". "Drunken Barnaby" is a scene of a drunken man being carried away from an inn while a barmaid looks on; the barmaid is shown as sturdily built, plump and rosy-cheeked, a style in which Etty continued to paint women throughout his career. "The Coral Finder" is strongly inspired by Titian, and depicts <a href="Venus%20Victrix">Venus Victrix</a> lying nude in a golden boat, surrounded by scantily clad attendants. It was Etty's first use of the combination of nude figures and mythological or literary references for which he was to become famous.

"The Coral Finder" was sold at exhibition to piano manufacturer Thomas Tomkinson for £30 (about £ in 2019 terms). <a href="Francis%20Freeling">Sir Francis Freeling</a> had admired "The Coral Finder" at its exhibition, and on learning that it had already been sold he commissioned Etty to paint a similar picture on a more ambitious scale, for a fee of 200 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms). Etty had for some time been musing on the possibility of a painting of <a href="Cleopatra">Cleopatra</a>, and took the opportunity provided by Freeling to paint a picture of her based loosely on the composition of "The Coral Finder".

"<a href="Cleopatra%27s%20Arrival%20in%20Cilicia">Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia</a>" (also known as "The Triumph of Cleopatra") is based loosely on <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a>'s "Life of Antony" and Shakespeare's "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", in which the Queen of Egypt travels to <a href="Tarsus%2C%20Mersin">Tarsus</a> in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a> aboard a grand ship to cement an alliance with the Roman general <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a>. While superficially similar to "The Coral Finder", "Cleopatra" is more closely related to the style of Regnault, with its intentionally cramped and crowded composition. The individual figures are out of proportion to each other and the ship, while many figures are tightly positioned within a small section of the painting. As well as from Regnault, the work borrows elements from Titian, Rubens and classical sculpture.

When exhibited in 1821, "Cleopatra" was generally extremely well received, and considered among the finest paintings of its kind, and its success inspired Etty to paint more works in a similar vein. The exhibition of "Cleopatra", coupled with the exhibition in January 1822 of "A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes (Youth on the Prow)" which also depicted nude figures on a boat, drew criticism of Etty for his treatment of female nudes. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" in early 1822 chided Etty, remarking that "We take this opportunity of advising Mr. Etty, who got some reputation for painting "Cleopatra's Galley", not to be seduced into a style which can gratify only the most vicious taste. Naked figures, when painted with the purity of Raphael, may be endured: but nakedness without purity is offensive and indecent, and on Mr. Etty's is mere dirty flesh." Unlike nude studies by other artists of the period, Etty made no attempt to idealise the female nudes in "Cleopatra", but instead painted them in realistic poses and realistic flesh tones. Possibly alarmed by the criticism, Freeling persuaded Etty to paint clothes onto some of the figures in "Cleopatra", although in 1829 he allowed Etty to return the figures to the state in which he had originally painted them.
The success of "Cleopatra" notwithstanding, Etty remained a student at the RA and continued with a rigorous programme of study. Now in his mid 30s, he felt that for his work to progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those European masters whose styles he most admired, despite his unpleasant experiences the last time he left England.

Recalling his homesickness and loneliness the last time he had ventured abroad, for his next foreign trip Etty travelled in the company of <a href="Richard%20Evans%20%28portrait%20painter%29">Richard Evans</a>, who had been a fellow student of Thomas Lawrence. Despite warnings that Italy would be uncomfortably hot, the two men set out on 23 June 1822 with the aim of reaching Rome. Crossing to France by means of the recently developed <a href="steamboat">steamboat</a>, they arrived in Paris on 26 June. They stayed in Paris for two weeks, visiting <a href="Versailles">Versailles</a> and the city's public art galleries; they also visited the much-reduced remaining exhibits of the <a href="Louvre">Louvre</a>. The Louvre was hosting an exhibition of modern French painting at the time, at which Etty felt a great dislike for the quality of portraiture in France, but he was nonetheless greatly impressed by the permanent collections, in particular Rubens's <a href="Marie%20de%27%20Medici%20cycle">Marie de' Medici cycle</a>, elements of which he later reused in many of his own works.

Travelling onwards through <a href="Dijon">Dijon</a> and Switzerland, Etty and Evans passed over the Simplon Pass and on to <a href="Milan">Milan</a>, where they viewed Leonardo's "<a href="The%20Last%20Supper%20%28Leonardo%20da%20Vinci%29">The Last Supper</a>" and visited the <a href="Pinacoteca%20di%20Brera">Brera Gallery</a>. After a sixteen-day <a href="cabriolet%20%28carriage%29">cabriolet</a> ride through the gruelling heat of an unusually hot summer, the two men reached <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, where they stayed for two days visiting the city's galleries. On 10 August, the two men reached Rome.

Although Etty was somewhat disappointed by Rome, comparing the architecture of <a href="St.%20Peter%27s%20Basilica">St. Peter's</a> unfavourably with that of <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St. Paul's</a>, he was highly impressed with Michelangelo's "almost Venetian" use of colour in the <a href="Sistine%20Chapel">Sistine Chapel</a>. He also met with <a href="Antonio%20Canova">Antonio Canova</a>, to whom he had been recommended by Lawrence, shortly before Canova's death. Rome was at the time suffering badly from <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, and after two weeks Etty decided to leave for <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. Evans had contracted malaria and decided to stay in Rome, and so Etty travelled to Naples alone and returned to Rome in the company of actor <a href="William%20Macready">William Macready</a>, who happened to be making the same journey, and with whom he remained a good friend for the rest of his life. On his return to Rome, Etty toured the city's museums, making copies of various artworks, particularly those of the Venetian artists such as Titian and Veronese whom he so admired.

Feeling unsettled, Etty left Rome for Venice, intending to remain there for 10 days and then return to England. Evans preferred to remain in Rome, so Etty travelled alone, pausing briefly in Florence and in <a href="Ferrara">Ferrara</a> (where he stopped to kiss the armchair of <a href="Ludovico%20Ariosto">Ludovico Ariosto</a>). The painter <a href="Charles%20Lock%20Eastlake">Charles Lock Eastlake</a>, then resident in Rome, had provided Etty with a letter of introduction to Harry D'Orville, British <a href="Vice%20consul">Vice consul</a> in Venice; D'Orville was so impressed with Etty that he arranged for him to stay in his own house, rather than in lodgings. Etty had long considered Venice his spiritual home and "the hope and idol of my professional life", and had often wondered why, given its artistic importance, so few English travellers visited the city. He was not disappointed. Throughout the remainder of his life, he looked back on his visit to Venice with great fondness, writing shortly before his death that "Venezia, cara Venezia! thy pictured glories haunt my fancy now!"

Although Etty had only intended to stay for 10 days, he was so taken with Venice that he remained for over seven months. He fell into a routine of copying paintings in Venetian collections by day, and attending the life class of the <a href="Accademia%20di%20Belle%20Arti%20di%20Venezia">Venetian Academy of Fine Arts</a> by night, producing around 50 oil paintings in total as well as numerous pencil sketches. He was extremely impressed with the high quality of the Venetian Academy; the instructors in their turn were extremely impressed with the quality of Etty's work, in particular his flesh tones. He acquired the nickname of "Il Diavolo" owing to the high speed at which he was able to paint, and watching him at work became something of a spectacle in its own right; luminaries including <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Gioachino Rossini</a> and <a href="Ladislaus%20Pyrker">Ladislaus Pyrker</a> (then <a href="Patriarch%20of%20Venice">Patriarch of Venice</a>) came to watch him paint. So devoted was Etty to his studies in Venice that he exhibited no original work in 1823, writing to his brother that "If one spent all the time in painting originals, one might as well, nay better, be at home". The members of the Venetian Academy were so impressed by Etty that he was elected an Honorary Academician.
By 7 June 1823, Etty felt that he had reached the limits of what he could accomplish in Venice, and was considering returning home. Soon afterwards he left Venice for Florence, with the intention of creating a full-size replica of Titian's "<a href="Venus%20of%20Urbino">Venus of Urbino</a>", considered one of the finest works of the Venetian school of painting. Although the <a href="Uffizi">Uffizi</a> management were hostile to this proposal, after 10 days of negotiations they allowed Etty to create his copy. His contemporaries considered it among the finest copies ever made of a painting generally considered to be impossible to copy. In late July Etty began the journey home, pausing for a further two months in Venice. On 8 October 1823 Etty left Venice, travelling via <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> and Geneva to Paris.

Etty had intended to travel to England, but instead remained in Paris, to resume copying works in Paris galleries, collecting prints and buying a <a href="lay%20figure">lay figure</a> and around 200 paintbrushes, both of which the French made to a higher standard than English manufacturers. In early January 1824, Etty returned to London.

As soon as he arrived home, Etty began to work on ensuring he had at least one picture ready for the 1824 Summer Exhibition. He decided to return to a theme for which he had created a sketch in 1820, that of the story of <a href="Pandora">Pandora</a> and in particular the passage in <a href="Hesiod">Hesiod</a> in which the seasons crown her with a wreath. He had exhibited a sketch in 1820 on the same theme, and had already decided on the arrangement of the figures. His first attempt in 1824 was abandoned half-finished, and he began again on a smaller canvas with different positioning of the key figures of "Pandora", <a href="Vulcan%20%28mythology%29">Vulcan</a> and <a href="Venus%20%28mythology%29">Venus</a>.

"Pandora Crowned by the Seasons" is an unusual composition, painted to resemble a <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a> in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan to one side and Venus and <a href="Cupid">Cupid</a> to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 <a href="engraving">engraving</a> on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist <a href="John%20Flaxman">John Flaxman</a> and engraved by <a href="William%20Blake">William Blake</a>. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.

Although recognisably descended from earlier works such as "The Coral Finder", "Pandora" was a far more accomplished work than those Etty exhibited prior to his travels. Although some critics were reluctant to accept Etty's combination of realistic figures and an unrealistic setting (Etty's 1958 biographer Dennis Farr characterises the critical reaction to "Pandora" as "grudging admiration not unmixed with philistinism"), his fellow artists were extremely impressed with it, to the extent that <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Thomas Lawrence</a> bought the painting at the 1824 Summer Exhibition.

In the wake of the success of "Pandora", Etty moved to an apartment in Buckingham Street, near <a href="Strand%2C%20London">the Strand</a>, where he was to reside for the remainder of his working life. Shortly afterwards he applied to become an <a href="Associate%20of%20the%20Royal%20Academy">Associate of the Royal Academy</a> for the first time, and on 1 November was duly elected, beating <a href="William%20Allan%20%28painter%29">William Allan</a> by 16 votes to seven. ("The Times", at this time still hostile to Etty for his perceived indecency, sneered that "this cannot be as an honour conferred on Mr. Etty: if it were, he has deserved and should have obtained it long ago". The same reviewer did concede that Etty's copy of <a href="Tintoretto">Tintoretto</a>'s "Esther Before Ahaseurus" was "the most important picture in the room" in their report on an exhibition held at the British Institution of significant copies of paintings.)

In the years following his return from Italy, Etty had a very limited social life. In a typical day he woke at 7 am, painting from around 9 or 10 am until 4 pm, after which he had a meal. Following the meal he took a walk, and attended life classes between 6 and 8 pm. On returning home he drank two cups of tea, and went to bed at midnight.

Etty was considered extremely unattractive, described by his 1855 biographer <a href="Alexander%20Gilchrist">Alexander Gilchrist</a> —a great admirer—as "Slovenly in attire, short and awkward in body—large head, large hands, large feet—a face marked with the small-pox, made still more noticeable by length of jaw, and a quantity of sandy hair, long and wild: all, conspired to make him 'one of the oddest looking creatures' in a Young Lady's eyes—what she would call 'a sight'; one, not redeemed (to her), by the massive brow, its revelation of energy and power, the sign-manual of Genius there legible."

One of his few close companions was his niece Betsy (Elizabeth Etty), fifth daughter of his brother John. Betsy was unmarried and 14 years younger than William, and became his housekeeper in 1824. She remained in his service for the rest of his life, and as he grew older William increasingly came to depend on her, suffering distress whenever they were apart and regularly writing to her in panic whenever he did not hear from her. She became his companion and acted as his assistant, alongside his official assistant George Franklin.
While he appears to have been attracted to young women throughout his life, and there is a strong suggestion in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice, there is no suggestion that he ever had a sexual relationship with Betsy of any kind. He recorded in his diary in 1830 that "it is best I have not married because I have not noisy Children and can have nice Books, and Pictures etc". He suffered from extreme shyness throughout his life, and when compelled to attend dinner parties would often sit silent throughout, although he was popular with fellow artists and students. Etty rarely socialised, preferring to concentrate on his painting; when on one occasion it was suggested that he had little further need of training and need not continue attending classes, he indignantly replied that "it fills up a couple of hours in the evening, I should be at a loss how else to employ".

As she grew older Betsy suffered from numerous illnesses, the exact natures of which are not recorded but which are known to have caused William great concern. William began to fear that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going as far as to have her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him. In 1843 his older brother Charles, a successful planter in <a href="Java">Java</a>, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector <a href="Joseph%20Gillott">Joseph Gillott</a>, one of William's regular customers who owned some of his pictures. Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.
Spurred by the reception of "Pandora", in 1825 Etty exhibited his most ambitious work to date, "". This was a huge canvas, 399 cm (13 ft 1 in) across, showing a woman pleading for the life of a defeated soldier as another soldier prepares to kill him. Highly unusually for a history painting at the time, Etty did not base "The Combat" on an incident from literature, religion or history, but instead painted a scene entirely from his own imagination, based on an idea which had first occurred to him in 1821. (He was later to describe this type of painting as "that class of compositions called by the Romans "Visions", not having their origin in history or poetry".)

"The Combat" was extremely well received, even by critics who had previously been hostile to Etty. In terms of composition and technique it was considered as equalling or even surpassing Titian and Veronese, and one critic considered it "one of the finest and most masterly works that ever graced the walls of the Royal Academy", while those critics who had previously dismissed Etty for his supposed obscenity reconsidered their opinions in light of it. "The Combat" continued to be one of Etty's best-regarded works, and formed the basis of a successful 1848 engraving by <a href="George%20Thomas%20Doo">George Thomas Doo</a>.

Following the success of "The Combat", Etty painted a further four very large paintings. One was on the well-worn theme of the <a href="Judgement%20of%20Paris">Judgement of Paris</a>, exhibited in 1826, and three were on the theme of <a href="Book%20of%20Judith">Judith</a> beheading <a href="Holofernes">Holofernes</a>, the first of which was exhibited in 1827. Unlike other artists who had painted this subject, Etty's "Judith" paintings did not show the actual beheading, as he hoped to avoid "the offensive and revolting butchery, some have delighted and even revelled in". The first "Judith" picture in particular was extremely well received critically.

In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated <a href="John%20Constable">John Constable</a> by 18 votes to five to become a full <a href="Royal%20Academician">Royal Academician</a>, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.

For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; "<a href="The%20World%20Before%20the%20Flood">The World Before the Flood</a>", "Venus, the Evening Star" and "Guardian Cherubs". (The latter was a portrait of the children of <a href="Welbore%20Ellis%20Agar%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Normanton">Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton</a>, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both "The World Before the Flood" and "Venus" attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by <a href="George%20Leveson-Gower%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Sutherland">the Marquess of Stafford</a> of "The World Before the Flood"—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in "<a href="The%20Gentleman%27s%20Magazine">The Gentleman's Magazine</a>" that it "will serve to accompany the "private" Titians of that nobleman". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent.
As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a <a href="reception%20piece">diploma piece</a>, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, "Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs", was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician.

Even after he had achieved status as a full Royal Academician, Etty regularly attended life classes; fellow artist John Constable sarcastically wrote that "Etty [sets] an excellent example to the Modles for regularity". His contemporaries considered this at best peculiar and at worst extremely inappropriate, complaining that for someone in his senior position to attend classes as a student was both unprofessional and unnecessary, and that it damaged the standing of the position of Academician; there were complaints that he had far outlasted the official student term of 10 years. Etty refused to give up attendance, offering to resign rather than give up his studies, and the Academy grudgingly allowed him to continue to attend classes. He divided his time between the RA's own life classes and those at nearby <a href="St.%20Martin%27s%20Lane">St. Martin's Lane</a>.

Etty generally finished life studies during three evenings sittings. On the first evening he would sketch the model in charcoal or chalk, and then ink in the outline. On the second he used oil paints to fill in the figures. On the third he layered glaze and the final coverings of paint. He usually painted on <a href="cardboard">millboard</a>, re-using the reverse for fresh paintings. His female models were typically shop-girls, prostitutes, actresses or <a href="poses%20plastiques">poses plastiques</a> models, while his male models tended to be <a href="Life%20Guards%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Life Guards</a> recruited from the nearby barracks, who he thought to have an appropriate muscular physique, or occasionally men Etty met in public <a href="Baths%20and%20wash%20houses%20in%20Britain">bath houses</a>.

In the wake of Etty's elevation to Academician, he exhibited two paintings at the Summer Exhibition in 1829, "Benaiah, David's Chief Captain" and "Hero, Having Thrown Herself from the Tower at the Sight of Leander Drowned, Dies on his Body". "Benaiah" is on the same large scale as "The Combat" at 398 cm (13 ft 1 in) wide, and is a very similar composition, although in place of the woman begging for mercy is the body of a dead soldier. "Hero" recycles the pose of the dead soldier from "Benaiah" as the dying <a href="Hero%20and%20Leander">Hero</a> as she lies on the body of her dead lover. Unusually for Etty, "Hero" is painted in intentionally neutral tones rather than his usual Venetian colours, and the composition uses foreshortening of the bodies to create a single diagonal across the canvas. For the rest of his life, Etty considered "Hero" to be "the finest of my fine pictures".
On 7 January 1830 Etty's mentor Thomas Lawrence died, followed on 30 July by Etty's mother. Etty was devastated by the loss, and was one of those considered to replace Lawrence as President of the Royal Academy, although in the event he did not stand for election. Possibly distracted by the death of Lawrence, Etty only submitted three paintings to the Summer Exhibition that year. One of these, "Judith Going Forth", was an addition to "Judith", which had been commissioned the previous year by that painting's new owners, the <a href="Royal%20Scottish%20Academy">Royal Scottish Academy</a>.

Of Etty's two original works exhibited at the RA in 1830, "The Storm", inspired by <a href="Psalm%2022">Psalm 22</a>, attracted little interest and was dismissed by "The Gentleman's Magazine"—typically a staunch supporter of Etty's work—as "a sad failure". The other painting exhibited was "<a href="Candaules%2C%20King%20of%20Lydia%2C%20Shews%20his%20Wife%20by%20Stealth%20to%20Gyges%2C%20One%20of%20his%20Ministers%2C%20as%20She%20Goes%20to%20Bed">Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed</a>", which was to prove one of the most controversial works of Etty's career. "Candaules" is based on a story from <a href="Herodotus">Herodotus</a> in which king <a href="Candaules">Candaules</a> arranges for his servant <a href="Gyges%20of%20Lydia">Gyges</a> to spy on his wife Nyssia undressing without her knowledge. Gyges is discovered and at Nyssia's behest kills Candaules, marries Nyssia and rules the kingdom in his stead. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia removes the last of her clothes. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty aimed for the viewer to feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge.
Etty felt that the work illustrated the moral that women are not chattels, and were entitled to punish men who violated their rights. He made little effort to explain this to his audience, and thus "Candaules" appeared morally highly ambiguous, inviting the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges. From the moment it was unveiled "Candaules" was condemned as a cynical mix of a distasteful narrative and pornographic images, and there was near-unanimous consensus that it was inappropriate for public exhibition. The piece remained controversial long after Etty's death; <a href="Alexander%20Gilchrist">Alexander Gilchrist</a>'s overwhelmingly flattering 1855 biography of Etty described it as "almost the only instance among Etty's works, of an undeniably disagreeable, not to say objectionable subject", while as late as 2011 Sarah Burnage of the University of York wrote of "Candaules" that "it is perhaps hard to see the painting as anything but a deliberate attempt by the artist to shock and scandalise". "Candaules" was bought by wealthy collector <a href="Robert%20Vernon%20%28art%20patron%29">Robert Vernon</a>, who was in the process of building a major collection of British art and was to become one of Etty's most important customers.

With the three paintings for the 1830 Summer Exhibition completed, Etty decided to pay another visit to Paris. Etty travelled via <a href="Brighton">Brighton</a>, arriving in Paris in early July 1830. He found the atmosphere of the city had become unpleasantly hedonistic, writing to Betsy that "If I had a daughter, she should "not" be educated here. Pleasure and amusement are the idols."

France was in constitutional crisis in 1830, which reached a peak in late July as the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> began and riots erupted across Paris. Although moved by the death and destruction taking place around him, Etty felt that the purpose of his visit was to study paintings, and continued to attend the Louvre to copy paintings as the violence raged in the surrounding streets. On 31 July he decided to abandon the trip; abandoning his proposed onward journey to Brussels and Antwerp, he collected the five copies he had made in the Louvre and set off for London.
The works Etty painted following his return began to show a departure in style from his previous efforts. While the figures in his previous original paintings had been painted from sketches of models made in the studio or life classes, from now on he began to work from memory, and as a consequence his figures began to appear more idealised; Farr (1958) describes his figures from now on as less to a particular aspect of the model than to a preconceived notion of what the model ought to look like".

In 1832 Etty returned to the theme of "A Sketch from One of Gray's Odes", exhibited in 1822 to such disdain from the press. The result was "<a href="Youth%20on%20the%20Prow%2C%20and%20Pleasure%20at%20the%20Helm">Youth on the Prow, and Pleasure at the Helm</a>", which remains one of his best known works. Illustrating a passage from "<a href="The%20Bard%20%28poem%29">The Bard</a>", a poem by <a href="Thomas%20Gray">Thomas Gray</a>, "Youth and Pleasure" has been described as "a poetic romance". It shows a gilded boat being propelled by the breath of a nude child on the sails; one nude figure representing Pleasure languidly holds the <a href="Tiller">helm</a> of the boat. A nude child blows bubbles, which another nude on the <a href="prow">prow</a> of the ship, representing Youth, reaches to catch. <a href="Naiad">Naiad</a>s, again nude, swim around and clamber onto the boat.

"The Bard" was about the English destruction of Welsh culture and the subsequent decline of the <a href="House%20of%20Plantagenet">House of Plantagenet</a> and its replacement by the Welsh <a href="House%20of%20Tudor">House of Tudor</a>, and there was a general feeling among critics that Etty had misunderstood the point of the metaphors used by Gray. Etty claimed that his unusual interpretation of the text was intended to create "a general allegory of Human Life, its empty vain pleasures—if not founded on the laws of Him who is the Rock of Ages", and that the painting served as a moral warning about the pursuit of empty pleasure. This explanation appears to have left critics unconvinced. Even those critics most favourable towards Etty's technical accomplishments in creating the picture found it hard to ascertain what the painting was supposed to represent; other critics were more openly hostile, with "<a href="The%20Morning%20Chronicle">The Morning Chronicle</a>" condemning it as "indulgence of what we once hoped a classical, but which are now convinced, is a lascivious mind". Purchased for a huge sum by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, "Youth and Pleasure" remained controversial long after Etty's death, with Farr's 1958 biography describing it as "singularly inept".
Also exhibited at the 1832 Summer Exhibition along with "Youth and Pleasure" was "<a href="The%20Destroying%20Angel%20and%20Daemons%20of%20Evil%20Interrupting%20the%20Orgies%20of%20the%20Vicious%20and%20Intemperate">The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate</a>", seen as a riposte by Etty to his critics. Another of what Etty deemed "visions", depicting a wholly imaginary scene rather than one from literature, mythology or history, "The Destroying Angel" shows an imaginary <a href="Classical%20architecture">classical temple</a> under attack from a <a href="destroying%20angel%20%28Bible%29">destroying angel</a> and a group of <a href="Daemon%20%28classical%20mythology%29">daemons</a>. The human figures, intentionally painted in paler tones than usual to suggest death, each show their fear in a different way. Painted soon after his 1830 travels, it is thought that the heaped corpses and terrified crowds were directly inspired by events Etty had witnessed in Paris.

Unlike "Youth and Pleasure", the critical response to "The Destroying Angel" was generally favourable even from those critics usually hostile to Etty. The painting generated favourable comparisons to Michelangelo and Rubens, and Etty's early supporter William Carey (writing under the name of "Ridolfi") considered it to be evidence of Etty's "redeeming grace and spirit". The painting was explicitly seen as a renunciation by Etty of his previous nude studies, with "<a href="Fraser%27s%20Magazine">Fraser's Magazine</a>" described it as "a sermon to [Etty's] admirers ... where he inflicts poetical justice upon his own gay dames and their gallants, their revels being broken in upon, and they themselves being carried off most unceremoniously, like that "little" gentleman Don Juan, by sundry grim-looking brawny devils".
At around this time Etty began to receive many unsolicited letters from wealthy <a href="Old%20Etonian">Old Etonian</a> lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as to appeal to the nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile by painting nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.

In mid-1833 Etty began a portrait of the daughters of <a href="Charles%20Williams-Wynn%20%281775%E2%80%931850%29">Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn</a>, the long-serving <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> Member of Parliament for <a href="Montgomeryshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Montgomeryshire</a>, shown "<a href="Preparing%20for%20a%20Fancy%20Dress%20Ball">Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball</a>" . Etty was then little-known for portraits, but had recently completed "Elizabeth Potts", a portrait of the daughter of a family friend, which although poorly received by some critics was technically highly accomplished. He said at the time that he hoped his portrait of the Williams-Wynn children would be "one of my best".

In February 1834, Etty became seriously ill, and was incapacitated for four months. Unable to paint, he exhibited only two already-completed paintings in the 1834 Summer Exhibition, "Elizabeth Potts" and "The Cardinal". In June of that year he left London to convalesce, renting a cottage in York. Weak and unable to concentrate, Etty painted very little, and spend the next few months visiting friends and touring the sights of Yorkshire. Gradually regaining his health, he returned to London in December 1834, and resumed work on those paintings he had left incomplete on the onset of his illness.
Making up for lost time during illness, he completed several significant works over the next few months, and exhibited eight paintings at the 1835 Summer Exhibition. These included works now considered among his most significant. "The Bridge of Sighs, Venice" was based on sketches made by Etty during his visit to that city in the early 1820s. It shows the aftermath of an execution, as two men haul the body away to be thrown into the sea; it was described as "poetry on canvas" by William Macready, who bought it from Etty. "<a href="Preparing%20for%20a%20Fancy%20Dress%20Ball">Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball</a>" was the portrait of the daughters of Charles Watkin Williams-Wynn which Etty had begun in 1833. Etty had put far more work into this than was usual for a portrait, remarking to the Williams-Wynn family that he intended "to make a fine work of Art as well as a resemblance". Showing Williams-Wynn's daughters <a href="Charlotte%20Williams-Wynn%20%28diarist%29">Charlotte</a> and Mary in elaborate Italian-style costumes, it was critically well received as evidence that Etty was able to paint a major work that did not rely on nudity, as well as demonstrating that Etty could paint on commission for the elite, leading to further commissions. "The Warrior Arming" was a study of <a href="Godfrey%20de%20Bouillon">Godfrey de Bouillon</a>. painted to satisfy the then-current fad for <a href="medievalism">medievalism</a>. Etty had recently developed an interest in collecting pieces of <a href="plate%20armour">armour</a>, and "The Warrior Arming" is a technically adept study of the effects of lights from multiple sources shining on polished armour.

The most contentious of Etty's 1835 RA exhibits was "Venus and Her Satellites", a depiction of the Toilet of Venus. This was condemned in much of the press as pornographic, and was described as having a "total absence of soul", with "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" in particular extremely hostile, calling for the Archbishop of Canterbury to become involved in chastising Etty for his lack of taste. Despite this condemnation, Etty considered "Venus and her Satellites" one of his best works, and sold it to <a href="Edward%20Pryce%20Owen">Rev. Edward Pryce Owen</a> for the substantial sum of 300 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms) in August.

In August 1835 Etty spent a brief holiday in <a href="Shropshire">Shropshire</a>, where he delivered "Venus and Her Satellites" to Owen. While en route back he made a detour to <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> to visit an art exhibition; while there he made the acquaintance of wealthy cotton merchant Daniel Grant.

After <a href="Jonathan%20Martin%20%28arsonist%29">Jonathan Martin</a>'s arson attack on York Minster in 1829 caused major damage, there were proposals by the <a href="dean%20and%20chapter">dean and chapter</a> to take the opportunity of the destruction to restructure the interior of the building. Etty was prominent in the effort to resist the redesign and to restore the building to its original state. A campaign led by Etty and other York luminaries was successful, and the plans were eventually defeated in February 1831.
By the time of the Minster fire, the Corporation of York (the body responsible for local government) was already engaged in a debate about the future of the city's <a href="York%20city%20walls">defensive walls</a>. The walls no longer served any practical purpose and were expensive to maintain, and with the population of the city rising rapidly the city was becoming cramped and dangerous. The city gates ("Bars") had become a public health hazard given the number of locals using them as toilets, and theft of stone for other building works had left parts of the walls dangerously unstable. The Bars restricted <a href="stagecoach">stagecoach</a>es, meaning York was unable to capitalise on its strategic position halfway along the lucrative London–Edinburgh route. Faced with the need to clear the city's slums, in 1800 the Corporation sought permission from Parliament to demolish the Bars and much of the walls. Owing to opposition from York Minster the scheme was abandoned, but by 1826 the <a href="barbican">barbican</a>s of four of the gates had been demolished. In the face of this a public campaign to save the walls was launched in 1824, but attention on both sides of the debate was diverted by the Minster fire. In 1828 Etty had written to his mother expressing horror at the demolition proposals, but distracted by the need to complete "Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs" was unable to take any action himself. By 1831 the Corporation had decided to demolish the barbicans but to retain and restore the walls.
In February 1832 Etty began a campaign of writing to local York newspapers urging the preservation of the walls, and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention. Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation in light of the damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade, many locals—whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry—remained hostile to the preservation campaigns. A proposal in 1838 by the <a href="York%20and%20North%20Midland%20Railway">York and North Midland Railway</a> to cut an archway through the walls to allow access to <a href="York%20old%20railway%20station">a railway station within the walls</a> galvanised Etty, and he delivered two lectures on the preservation of the walls during visits to York in 1838–39, and made four paintings of the Bars. Etty's words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in the walls, much to his dismay, although the station was soon moved to its current location outside the walls to allow through the running of trains to both north and south. While the walls were eventually saved in 1889, many years after Etty's death, Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation. It is open to debate how significant his part was. Some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and the preservation of the walls was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers, while others feel that the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like-minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so.

In 1838, Etty started lobbying for the establishment of an art school in York. He proposed that the <a href="Hospitium">Hospitium</a> of <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Abbey%2C%20York">St Mary's Abbey</a> be used for this purpose, with the lower floor becoming a museum of sculpture and the upper floor becoming a school and exhibition hall. The Hospitium scheme was abandoned, but the York School of Design duly opened on a different site in 1842. Although the school was created by an artist who had built his reputation on nudes, nude art remained controversial. In 1847, following a complaint from a female student about a display of replicas of Ancient Greek sculptures, "the master was requested to have the penis of each of the offending statues cut off [...] a proceeding that called forth the indignation of the male students and the remonstrances of even the lady students".

In 1836 architect <a href="John%20Harper%20%28architect%29">John Harper</a> arranged a small exhibition in York of works by modern artists, which included 11 Etty paintings. This included the first public showing of "Venus and her Doves", which had been commissioned by Daniel Grant. Although the exhibition broke even it met with little public interest, and no further Etty <a href="retrospective%20exhibition">retrospectives</a> were held for some years. Harper did take the opportunity to buy Etty's "A Family of the Forest" (also known as "Flowers of the Forest"), which had failed to sell at the 1836 Summer Exhibition. "A Family of the Forest" illustrates a passage from the Ancient Greek poem "<a href="Theogony">Theogony</a>", dealing with the Golden Age before humanity suffered pain, misery or the need to work. The setting sun in the background and the man looking away from the woman and child, and instead into the distance, signify his knowledge that his days of ease are coming to an end.

By this time, Etty was becoming conflicted religiously. Although he had been raised as a Methodist, following <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Relief%20Act%201829">Catholic emancipation</a> in 1829 Etty became increasingly drawn to <a href="Roman%20Catholicism">Roman Catholicism</a>. Although he considered himself "in [my] heart's core deeply and sincerely of the Ancient Faith", he refused formally to convert to Catholicism owing to concerns that it would upset his family and friends, worries that he would be denied access to Anglican buildings such as York Minster, and a distaste for the concept of <a href="Confession%20%28religion%29">auricular (spoken) confession</a>. He remained closely associated with Catholicism throughout his later life, and was one of the few non-Catholics to attend the 1838 opening of <a href="Augustus%20Pugin">Augustus Pugin</a>'s chapel for <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20College%2C%20Oscott">St Mary's College, Oscott</a>, at the time the most important Roman Catholic building in England.

Also in 1836 Etty began work on "<a href="The%20Sirens%20and%20Ulysses">The Sirens and Ulysses</a>", which he considered among his greatest works, and which is his largest surviving painting. Measuring 442.5 cm by 297 cm (14 ft 6 in by 9 ft 9 in) "Sirens" was based on a passage from <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>" in which sailors resist the irresistible song of the <a href="Siren%20%28mythology%29">Sirens</a>. The theme and scale of the painting were probably suggested to Etty by Thomas Myers, who had been encouraging Etty to paint very large canvases. Myers's suggested theme appealed to Etty, who later wrote that it illustrated "the importance of resisting "Sensual Delights"". Etty made every effort to ensure realism in the picture, going as far as to visit mortuaries to sketch corpses in varying stages of decay to ensure the accuracy of the cadavers on the beach.

When Etty completed "Sirens" in 1837, it was one of the main attractions at the 1837 Summer Exhibition, the first to be held in the Royal Academy's new building in <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> (now part of the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a>). The painting, with its juxtaposition of male and female nudity and decaying corpses, immediately divided opinion. Some critics considered it one of the finest artworks ever made, with "The Gentleman's Magazine" particularly taken with the work, describing "Sirens" as "a historical work of the first class" and "by far the best that Mr. Etty ever painted". Other critics were less kind; "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>" considered it "a disgusting combination of voluptuousness and loathsome putridity—glowing in colour and wonderful in execution, but conceived in the worst possible taste".
Possibly because of its size, "The Sirens and Ulysses" failed to sell at the Summer Exhibition. In October 1837 Etty met again with Daniel Grant who, without having seen the painting, offered £250 (about £ in today's terms) for "Sirens" and for "Samson and Delilah", also exhibited by Etty that year. Etty, poor at business and always reluctant to keep unsold paintings in his studio, sold both paintings to Grant for well below their true worth. Etty had used a strong glue as a <a href="sizing">paint stabiliser</a> which flaked when dry, and as soon as it was complete "Sirens" began to deteriorate. It was shown at the 1857 <a href="Art%20Treasures%20Exhibition%2C%20Manchester%201857">Art Treasures Exhibition</a> but then considered in too poor a condition for further public display, and placed in long-term storage in the archives of the <a href="Royal%20Manchester%20Institution">Royal Manchester Institution</a> and its successor, the <a href="Manchester%20Art%20Gallery">Manchester Art Gallery</a>. In 2006 restoration began on it, and in May 2010 "Sirens" was returned to public display and is now one of the key works in the Manchester Art Gallery.

After "Sirens", Etty's output remained as high as ever, with seven paintings exhibited at the 1838 Summer Exhibition, but the quality of his work is generally considered to have gone into decline. By 1838 critics began to comment that Etty's paintings were no longer inventive but simply reworkings of his earlier paintings, while in June of that year <a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">William Makepeace Thackeray</a> (under the pen name of Michael Angelo Titmarsh) wrote that is, like great men, lazy, or indifferent, perhaps, about public approbation". By 1839, criticisms of Etty were being raised in even those newspapers and journals which had previously championed his work. A new type of criticism of Etty also began to appear in 1839, from a new generation led by "<a href="The%20Art%20Journal">The Art Union</a>", who praised Etty's technical abilities but saw his choice of subjects as out of touch and anachronistic, and "very frequently doing as little good for mankind as the priest who preaches his sermon in Latin".
From around this time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief that the purpose of art is to illustrate moral lessons, he began to abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. He began to paint <a href="still%20life">still life</a>s, beginning with "Pheasant and Peach" (likely to be the painting now called "Dead Pheasant and Fruit"); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, he began to paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.

In May 1840, Etty made the trip to <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> and <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> which he had been forced by revolution to abandon in 1830. He intended to study the works of Rubens, but the briefness of his tour—in the company of Betsy Etty he visited <a href="Ostend">Ostend</a>, <a href="Bruges">Bruges</a>, Antwerp, Brussels, <a href="Aachen">Aachen</a>, <a href="Cologne">Cologne</a>, <a href="Bonn">Bonn</a> and <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a> in the course of ten days—meant he had little time for study. The following year he returned to Antwerp and <a href="Mechelen">Mechelen</a> for a longer visit to visit <a href="St.%20Rumbold%27s%20Cathedral">St. Rumbold's Cathedral</a> and to study the substantial collections of Rubens paintings in the two cities. On this second journey he twice visited a <a href="Trappists">Trappist</a> monastery outside Antwerp, staying overnight on one visit, and bought a Trappist <a href="Religious%20habit">habit</a>; he also bought a <a href="Order%20of%20Friars%20Minor%20Capuchin">Capuchin</a> habit from a monastery in Bruges. These acquisitions prompted paintings on monastic themes over subsequent years.
Despite a perceived decline in his work's quality, the 1840s were the most financially successful of Etty's career. His income increased with further opportunities for patronage from a growing industrial class, and with few costs and all his earlier debts cleared, Etty was in a position to invest money for the first time. By 1841 Etty had around £300 invested, rising to £8500 in 1845 and £17,000 in 1849. He continued to have difficulty forming relationships with any woman other than Betsy Etty, writing in his diary in 1843 that "being in sound Mind and Body I declare it to be my "Firm Intention" NEVER TO MARRY. In which resolution I pray GOD to help me that I may devote myself purely to my Art, my Country, and my GOD!"

In May 1843, Etty was one of eight artists chosen by <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> to paint <a href="fresco">fresco</a>es on the theme of Milton's "<a href="Comus%20%28John%20Milton%29">Comus</a>" for a new pavilion being built in the grounds of <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on the theme of "Circe and the Sirens Three". The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the <a href="lunette">lunette</a> shape of the panel left Etty with a large empty space above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement on the theme of "Hesperus" he was rejected, and <a href="William%20Dyce">William Dyce</a> was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.
The perceived lack of respect shown to one of England's leading artists led to some outcry, and attacks in the press upon the then very unpopular Albert; William Makepeace Thackeray wrote in 1845: "Think of the greatest patronage in the world giving forty pounds for pictures worth four hundred—condescending to buy works from humble men who could not refuse, and paying for them below their value! Think of august powers and principalities ordering the works of such a great artist as Etty to be hacked out of the palace-wall! That was a slap in the face to every artist in England."

In August 1843, during a break from his work on the fresco, Etty made what was to prove his final overseas journey. Since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of <a href="Joan%20of%20Arc">Joan of Arc</a>, and he wanted to visit places associated with her. Setting out on 16 August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen, Paris and <a href="Orl%C3%A9ans">Orléans</a> associated with her life. Unlike Etty's disastrous prior visits to France, this journey passed without incident, and he found that he actually was coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living.

In the same year, Etty painted the first version of "", an illustration from the poem "<a href="The%20Seasons%20%28Thomson%29">Summer</a>" by <a href="James%20Thomson%20%28poet%2C%20born%201700%29">James Thomson</a> and arguably Etty's last history painting painted while he still had all his powers. "Musidora" shows a scene in which the titular character, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into "the lucid coolness of the flood" to "bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream", unknowing that she is being watched by her suitor Damon. Etty's composition is shown from the viewpoint of Damon; by so doing Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as "a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome". "Musidora" met with almost universal acclaim, compared favourably to Titian and Rembrandt, and described by "<a href="The%20Critic%20%28magazine%29">The Critic</a>" as "a preeminent work" and "the triumph of the British school".

By the time "Musidora" was exhibited, Etty's health was in serious decline. Suffering severe asthma, it was not unusual for passers-by to accuse him of drunkenness as he made his way wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his "Joan of Arc" triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28 ft (8.5 m) in total width and 9 ft 9 in (3 m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.

Etty sold the triptych for the huge sum of 2500 guineas (about £ in 2019 terms) to dealer Richard Colls and the engraver C. W. Wass. Colls and Wass had ambitious plans to recoup their money by selling engravings of the pictures and by taking the paintings on a tour of Britain and Europe. The paintings proved less popular than expected. Very few engravings were sold and the tours did not take place; Wass declared bankruptcy in 1852. The paintings were separated, and sold on to a series of buyers, with the third panel fetching just 7 guineas in 1893 as Etty's popularity continued to wane. By the 1950s all three panels of "Joan of Arc" were believed lost or destroyed, although some preliminary studies survive.

Following the completion of "Joan of Arc", Etty's health continued to deteriorate. He continued to paint and exhibit, but his retirement plans grew firmer. In April 1846 he bought a house in Coney Street, central York, as a retirement home, and in December 1847 he formally resigned from the Council of the Royal Academy. Following structural alterations to give him a better view of the river, Etty moved into the house in June 1848, completing the move in September, although he retained his London apartments. His move from London caused some consternation among that city's models, who were losing one of their most regular customers, as well as concerns from Etty who was worried that working with nude models might cause a scandal in York.

He continued to exhibit, sending seven paintings to that year's Summer Exhibition, but they drew little interest, although the lack of nudes was applauded by some reviewers. By this time, Robert Vernon's bequest of his collection to the nation had led to eleven Etty paintings going on public display in the cellars of the National Gallery. In late 1848 he wrote a brief autobiography, published the following year in "The Art Journal", in which he staunchly defended himself against the accusations of pornography which had been levelled at him throughout his life:

In 1849, the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> decided to organise a retrospective exhibition of Etty's work, the first since the minor York exhibition of 1836. Etty agreed only on condition that all nine of his large works were included. The three "Joan of Arc" paintings were in London and easily accessible, and the Royal Scottish Academy was happy to lend "The Combat", "Benaiah" and the "Judith" triptych, but the Royal Manchester Institution was deeply reluctant to lend "The Sirens and Ulysses" in light of concerns that transporting it would damage the fragile paintwork further. They were eventually persuaded to lend the piece after Etty and some of his friends visited Manchester to personally request they release it. The exhibition went ahead from 9 June to 25 August 1849, bringing together 133 Etty paintings for the first time; Etty hoped that it would raise public awareness of his abilities, writing to his friend Rev. Isaac Spencer "Please God, I will give them a taste of my quality". The exhibition was well received and well attended; even Etty's old adversaries at the "Morning Chronicle" recommending that readers "lose no time in visiting this collection". It was a financial disaster for the Royal Society of Arts, faced with the cost of transporting large numbers of delicate artworks from around the country.

During the exhibition Etty suffered a serious bout of <a href="rheumatic%20fever">rheumatic fever</a>. Exhausted by illness and the stress of the exhibition, when the exhibition was complete he returned to York in very poor health. On 3 November 1849 he suffered a serious asthma attack, thought to have been made worse by his neglecting to wear his flannel undershirt the night before. His condition deteriorated rapidly, and by 10 November he was bedridden. On Tuesday 13 November, watching the sun set over the <a href="River%20Ouse%2C%20Yorkshire">River Ouse</a>, he was heard to say "Wonderful! Wonderful! This death!" Later that night, Betsy Etty wrote to Joseph Gillott that "Uncle paid the last debt to nature at past Eight tonight. I do not know what to do. I am almost broken hearted. I have lost my best friend. I not what to do. I can say no more."

Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of <a href="George%20Hudson">George Hudson</a>, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of <a href="St%20Olave%27s%20Church%2C%20York">St Olave's Church</a>, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with <a href="Charles%20Robert%20Leslie">Charles Robert Leslie</a> observing in 1850 "It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds".

Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in <a href="Haymarket%2C%20London">Haymarket</a>, and some time after his death moved to 40 <a href="Edwardes%20Square">Edwardes Square</a>, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87.
While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the <a href="Pre-Raphaelite%20Brotherhood">Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood</a>. <a href="William%20Holman%20Hunt">William Holman Hunt</a> and <a href="John%20Everett%20Millais">John Everett Millais</a>, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style. Holman Hunt recollected that "in my youth [Etty] had lost the robustness he once had [...] the paintings of his advanced age cloyed the taste by their sweetness". Millais had consciously modelled his style on Etty, and his works prior to the formation of the Pre-Raphaelites are very similar in composition, but after 1848 the only similarity in style is the use of colour. As Pre-Raphaelitism waned Millais's style became more varied, and some of his later work such as "The Knight Errant" owes a strong debt to Etty's influence.
During his life Etty had acquired followers such as Irish painters <a href="William%20Mulready">William Mulready</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Maclise">Daniel Maclise</a>, but both rejected Etty's preoccupation with nudes. Mulready painted nudes but became best known for domestic <a href="genre%20art">genre paintings</a>, while Maclise chose to specialise in more traditional history paintings and exhibited only one nude work in his career. One of the few painters who consciously attempted to continue Etty's style after his death was <a href="William%20Edward%20Frost">William Edward Frost</a>, who had been an acquaintance of Etty's since 1825. In the early 1830s Frost painted on commission for Thomas Potts (whose 1833 commission of Etty to paint his daughter Elizabeth's portrait had been Etty's first significant portrait commission), and later was commissioned on Etty's recommendation to paint a portrait of Etty's cousin Thomas Bodley. Frost successfully imitated Etty throughout his career, to the extent that his figure studies and Etty's are often misattributed to each other. Although Frost eventually became a Royal Academician in 1870, by this time Etty's style of painting had badly fallen out of fashion.

<a href="Victorian%20painting">Victorian painting</a> had gone through radical changes, and by the 1870s the realism of Etty and the Pre-Raphaelites had given way to the ideas of the <a href="Aesthetic%20Movement">Aesthetic Movement</a>, abandoning the traditions of storytelling and moralising in favour of painting works designed for aesthetic appeal rather than for their narrative or subject. Although the aesthetic movement ultimately led to a brief revival of history painting, these works were in a very different style to Etty's. The new generation of history painters such as <a href="Edward%20Burne-Jones">Edward Burne-Jones</a>, <a href="Lawrence%20Alma-Tadema">Lawrence Alma-Tadema</a> and <a href="Frederic%20Leighton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Leighton">Frederic Leighton</a> sought to depict passivity, rather than the dynamism seen in previous works depicting the classical world. By the end of the 19th century, the value of all of Etty's works had fallen below their original prices. As the 20th century began, the increasingly influential <a href="modernism">Modernist movement</a>, which came to dominate British art in the 20th century, drew its inspiration from <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Paul Cézanne</a> and had little regard for 19th-century British painting.
In 1911 the city of York belatedly recognised Etty. A statue of Etty by G. W. Milburn was unveiled on 1 February outside the <a href="York%20Art%20Gallery">York Art Gallery</a>, and a retrospective of 164 Etty paintings was held at the gallery despite opposition from some of Etty's descendants who refused to lend works for it. William Wallace Hargrove, proprietor of the "York Herald", gave a speech recalling his memories of knowing Etty. Outside York, Etty generally remained little-known, with the majority of those galleries holding his works, other than the <a href="Lady%20Lever%20Art%20Gallery">Lady Lever Art Gallery</a>, the <a href="Russell-Cotes%20Art%20Gallery%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">Russell-Cotes Museum</a> and <a href="Anglesey%20Abbey">Anglesey Abbey</a>, tending to keep them in storage. Minor Etty exhibitions in London in 1936 and 1938 had little impact, and likewise an exhibition of 30 Etty paintings in 1948 to mark the reopening of the York Art Gallery and another York exhibition of 108 paintings the following year to mark the centenary of his death. In 2001–02 five Etty paintings were included in <a href="Tate%20Britain">Tate Britain</a>'s landmark "Exposed: The Victorian Nude" exhibition, which did much to raise Etty's profile, and established Etty as "the first British artist to paint the nude with both seriousness and consistency". The restoration of "The Sirens and Ulysses", completed in 2010, led to increased interest in Etty, and in 2011–12 a major exhibition of Etty's works was held at the York Art Gallery. The York Art Gallery continues to hold the largest collection of Etty's works.

In Utero (album)

In Utero is the third and final studio album by American <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>, released on September 21, 1993, by <a href="DGC%20Records">DGC Records</a>. Nirvana intended for the record to diverge significantly from the polished, refined production of its previous album, "<a href="Nevermind">Nevermind</a>" (1991). To capture a more abrasive and natural sound, the group hired engineer <a href="Steve%20Albini">Steve Albini</a> to record "In Utero" during a two-week period in February 1993 at <a href="Pachyderm%20Studio">Pachyderm Studio</a> in <a href="Cannon%20Falls%2C%20Minnesota">Cannon Falls, Minnesota</a>. The music was quickly recorded within that time with few studio embellishments. The song lyrics and album packaging largely incorporated medical imagery that conveyed frontman <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>'s outlook on his publicized personal life and his band's newfound fame.

Soon after recording was completed, rumors circulated in the press that DGC might not release the album in its original state, as the record label felt that the result was not commercially viable. Although Nirvana publicly denied the statements, the band opted to remix parts of the album. Albini declined to alter the album further, and ultimately the band hired <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a> producer <a href="Scott%20Litt">Scott Litt</a> to make minor changes to the album's sound and remix the singles "<a href="Heart-Shaped%20Box">Heart-Shaped Box</a>" and "<a href="All%20Apologies">All Apologies</a>".

Upon release, "In Utero" entered the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart at number one and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from "Nevermind". The record has been <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified</a> five times platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a>, and has sold 15 million copies worldwide.

Nirvana broke into the musical mainstream with its major-label album "<a href="Nevermind">Nevermind</a>" in 1991. Despite modest sales estimates—the band's record company, DGC Records, forecast sales of 50,000 copies—"Nevermind" became a huge commercial success, popularizing the <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> grunge movement and <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> in general. Nevertheless, all three members of Nirvana—singer and guitarist <a href="Kurt%20Cobain">Kurt Cobain</a>, bassist <a href="Krist%20Novoselic">Krist Novoselic</a>, and drummer <a href="Dave%20Grohl">Dave Grohl</a>—later expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of the album, citing its production as too polished. Early in 1992, Cobain told "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" that he was sure that the band's next album would showcase "both of the extremes" of its sound, saying "it'll be more raw with some songs and more candy pop on some of the others. It won't be as one-dimensional [as "Nevermind"]". Cobain wanted to start work on the album in the summer of 1992, but the band was unable as Cobain and his bandmates lived in different cities, and as the singer and his wife, <a href="Courtney%20Love">Courtney Love</a>, were expecting the birth of their daughter, <a href="Frances%20Bean%20Cobain">Frances Bean</a>. DGC had hoped to have a new album by the band ready for a late-1992 holiday season release; since work on it proceeded slowly, the label released the compilation album "<a href="Incesticide">Incesticide</a>" in December 1992.

In a "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" interview published in July 1992, Cobain told the English journalist <a href="Everett%20True">Everett True</a> that he was interested in recording with <a href="Jack%20Endino">Jack Endino</a> (who had produced the group's 1989 début album "<a href="Bleach%20%28Nirvana%20album%29">Bleach</a>") and <a href="Steve%20Albini">Steve Albini</a> (former frontman of the <a href="noise%20rock">noise rock</a> band <a href="Big%20Black">Big Black</a> and producer for various independent releases). Cobain said he would then choose the best material from the sessions for inclusion on the group's next album. In October 1992, Nirvana recorded several songs (mainly as instrumentals) during a demo session with Endino in Seattle; they later re-recorded many of these songs for "In Utero". Endino recalled that the band did not ask him to produce its next record, but noted that the band members constantly debated working with Albini. The group recorded another set of demos while on tour in Brazil in January 1993. One of the recordings from this session, the long improvisational track "Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip", was included as a hidden track on non-U.S. CD copies of "In Utero".

Nirvana ultimately chose Albini to record its third album. Albini had a reputation as a principled and opinionated individual in the American <a href="independent%20music">independent music</a> scene. While there was speculation that the band chose Albini to record the album due to his underground credentials, Cobain told "Request" magazine in 1993, "For the most part I wanted to work with him because he happened to produce two of my favorite records, which were "<a href="Surfer%20Rosa">Surfer Rosa</a>" [by <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>] and "<a href="Pod%20%28The%20Breeders%20album%29">Pod</a>" [by <a href="The%20Breeders">The Breeders</a>]." Inspired by those albums, Cobain wanted to utilize Albini's technique of capturing the natural ambiance of a room via the usage and placement of several microphones, something previous Nirvana producers had been averse to trying. Months before the trio had even approached Albini about the recording, rumors circulated that he was slated to record the album. Albini sent a disclaimer to the British music press denying involvement, only to get a call from Nirvana's management a few days later about the project. Although he considered the group to be "<a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a> with a <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">fuzzbox</a>" and "an unremarkable version of the Seattle sound", Albini told Nirvana biographer <a href="Michael%20Azerrad">Michael Azerrad</a> he accepted because he felt sorry for the band members, whom he perceived to be "the same sort of people as all the small-fry bands I deal with", at the mercy of their record company. Before the start of recording sessions, the band sent Albini a tape of the demos it had made in Brazil. In return, Albini sent Cobain a copy of the <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a> album "<a href="Rid%20of%20Me">Rid of Me</a>" to give him an idea of the acoustics at the studio where they would record.

The members of Nirvana and Albini decided on a self-imposed two-week deadline for recording the album. Wary of interference by DGC, Albini suggested the band members pay for the sessions with their own money, which they agreed to. Studio fees totaled <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>24,000, while Albini took a flat fee of $100,000 for his services. Despite the suggestions of Nirvana's management company Gold Mountain, Albini refused to take percentage points on record sales, even though he stood to earn about $500,000 in royalties. While a common practice among producers in the music industry, Albini refused to take royalties because he considered it to be immoral and "an insult to the artist".

In February 1993, Nirvana traveled to <a href="Pachyderm%20Studio">Pachyderm Studio</a> in <a href="Cannon%20Falls%2C%20Minnesota">Cannon Falls, Minnesota</a>, to record the album. Albini did not meet the band members until the first day of recording, though he had spoken to them beforehand about the type of album they wanted to make. Albini observed that "they wanted to make precisely the sort of record that I'm comfortable doing". The group stayed in a house located on the studio grounds during the recording sessions. Novoselic compared the isolated conditions to a <a href="gulag">gulag</a>; he added, "There was snow outside, we couldn't go anywhere. We just worked." For most of the sessions, the only people present were the band members, Albini, and technician <a href="Bob%20Weston">Bob Weston</a>. The band made it clear to DGC and Gold Mountain that it did not want any intrusion during the album production, going as far as not playing any of the work in progress for its record label <a href="A%26amp%3BR">A&R</a> representative. To prevent the group's managers and label from interfering, Albini instituted a strict policy of ignoring everyone except for the band members; the producer explained that everyone associated with the group aside from the musicians themselves were "the biggest pieces of shit I ever met".

The band arrived at Pachyderm Studio without their equipment and spent much of the first three days waiting for it to arrive by mail. However, once recording began on February 13, work moved quickly. On most days the group began work around midday, took breaks for lunch and dinner, and continued work through midnight. Cobain, Novoselic, and Grohl recorded their basic instrumental tracks together as a band. The group utilized this set-up on all songs except for faster compositions like "Very Ape" and "", where the drums were recorded separately in a nearby kitchen due to its natural <a href="reverb">reverb</a>. Albini surrounded Grohl's drum kit with about 30 microphones. Cobain added additional guitar tracks to about half of the songs, then added guitar solos, and finally vocals. The band did not discard takes and kept virtually everything it captured on tape. Albini felt he was more an engineer than a producer; despite his personal opinions, he ultimately let the band judge which were decent takes. He said, "Generally speaking, [Cobain] knows what he thinks is acceptable and what isn't acceptable [...] He can make concrete steps to improve things that he doesn't think are acceptable." Cobain reportedly recorded all his vocal tracks in six hours. The band completed recording in six days; Cobain had originally anticipated disagreements with Albini, who the singer heard "was supposedly this <a href="sexism">sexist</a> jerk", but called the process "the easiest recording we've ever done, hands down". The only disruption occurred a week into the sessions, when Courtney Love arrived because she missed Cobain. The band, Love, and Albini refused to go into specifics, but Weston's girlfriend (who served as the studio's chef) stated that Love created tension by criticizing Cobain's work and being confrontational with everyone present.

The album was <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> over five days. This rate was quick by Nirvana's standards, but not for Albini, who was used to mixing entire albums in a day or two. On occasions when work on a song mix was not producing desired results, the band and Albini took the rest of the day off to watch nature videos, set things on fire, and make prank phone calls for amusement. The sessions were completed on February 26.

Albini sought to produce a record that sounded nothing like "Nevermind". He felt the sound of "Nevermind" was "sort of a standard hack recording that has been turned into a very, very controlled, compressed radio-friendly mix [...] That is not, in my opinion, very flattering to a rock band." Instead, the intention was to capture a more natural and visceral sound. Albini refused to <a href="doubletracking">double-track</a> Cobain's vocals and instead recorded him singing alone in a resonant room. The producer noted the intensity of the singer's vocals on some tracks; he said, "There's a really dry, really loud voice at the end of 'Milk It' ... that was also done at the end of '<a href="Rape%20Me">Rape Me</a>', where [Cobain] wanted the sound of him screaming to just overtake the whole band." Albini achieved the album's sparse drum sound by simply placing several microphones around the room while Dave Grohl performed, picking up the natural <a href="reverberation">reverberation</a> of the room. Albini explained, "If you take a good drummer and put him in front of a drum kit that sounds good acoustically and just record it, you've done your job."

Azerrad asserted in his 1993 biography "" that the music of "In Utero" showcased divergent sensibilities of abrasiveness and accessibility that reflected the upheavals Cobain experienced prior to the album's completion. He wrote, "The <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatlesque</a> 'Dumb' happily coexists beside the all-out frenzied <a href="Punk%20rock">punk</a> graffiti of 'Milk It,' while 'All Apologies' is worlds away from the apoplectic '<a href="Scentless%20Apprentice">Scentless Apprentice</a>.' It's as if [Cobain] has given up trying to meld his punk and pop instincts into one harmonious whole. Forget it. This is war." Cobain believed, however, that "In Utero" was not "any harsher or any more emotional" than any of Nirvana's previous records. Novoselic concurred with Azerrad's comments that the album's music leaned more towards the band's "arty, aggressive side"; the bassist said, "There's always been [Nirvana] songs like '<a href="About%20a%20Girl%20%28Nirvana%20song%29">About a Girl</a>' and there's always been songs like 'Paper Cuts'... "Nevermind" came out kind of 'About a Girl'-y and this [album] came out more 'Paper Cuts'". Cobain cited the track "Milk It" as an example of the more experimental and aggressive direction in which the band's music had been moving in the months prior to the sessions at Pachyderm Studio. Novoselic viewed the album's singles "<a href="Heart-Shaped%20Box">Heart-Shaped Box</a>" and "<a href="All%20Apologies">All Apologies</a>" as "gateways" to the more abrasive sound of the rest of the album, telling journalist <a href="Jim%20DeRogatis">Jim DeRogatis</a> that once listeners played the record, they would discover "this aggressive wild sound, a true alternative record".

Several of the songs on "In Utero" had been written years prior to recording; some of them dated back to 1990. With tracks like "Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle", Cobain favored long song titles in reaction to contemporary alternative rock bands that utilized single-word titles. Cobain continued to work on the lyrics while recording at Pachyderm Studio. Nonetheless, Cobain told <a href="Darcey%20Steinke">Darcey Steinke</a> in "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" in 1993 that, in contrast to "Bleach" and "Nevermind", the lyrics were "more focused, they're almost built on themes." Michael Azerrad asserted that the lyrics were less impressionistic and more straightforward than in previous Nirvana songs. Azerrad also noted that "[v]irtually every song contains some image of sickness and disease". In a number of songs, Cobain made reference to books he had read. "Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle" was inspired by "<a href="Shadowland%20%28Arnold%20novel%29">Shadowland</a>", a 1978 biography of actress <a href="Frances%20Farmer">Frances Farmer</a>, with whom Cobain had been fascinated ever since he read the book in high school. The song "Scentless Apprentice" was written about "<a href="Perfume%20%28novel%29">Perfume: The Story of a Murderer</a>", a historical horror novel about a perfumer's apprentice born with no body odor of his own but with a highly developed sense of smell, and who attempts to create the "ultimate perfume" by killing virgin women and taking their scent.

Cobain stated in a 1993 interview with "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" that "for the most part ["In Utero"]'s very impersonal". The songwriter also told "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. However, Azerrad argued that much of the album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. Grohl said, "A lot of what he has to say is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. And it's not so much teen angst anymore. It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that "Rape Me" seemed to deal with that very issue. While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. "Serve The Servants" contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. The opening lines "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line "That legendary divorce is such a bore" from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.

Cobain originally wanted to name the album "I Hate Myself and I Want to Die", a phrase that had originated in his journals in mid-1992. At the time, the singer used the phrase as a response whenever someone asked him how he was doing. Cobain intended the album title as a joke; he stated he was "tired of taking this band so seriously and everyone else taking it so seriously". Novoselic convinced Cobain to change the title due to fear that it could potentially result in a lawsuit. The band then considered using "Verse Chorus Verse"—a title taken from its song "Verse Chorus Verse", and an earlier working title of "Sappy"—before eventually settling on "In Utero". The final title was taken from a poem written by Courtney Love.

The art director for "In Utero" was Robert Fisher, who had designed all of Nirvana's releases on DGC. Most of the ideas for the artwork for the album and related singles came from Cobain. Fisher recalled that "[Cobain] would just give me some loose odds and ends and say 'Do something with it.'" The cover of the album is an image of a <a href="Transparent%20Anatomical%20Manikin">Transparent Anatomical Manikin</a>, with angel wings superimposed. Cobain created the collage on the back cover, which he described as "Sex and woman and "In Utero" and vaginas and birth and death", that consists of model fetuses, a turtle shell and models of turtles, and body parts lying in a bed of orchids and lilies. The collage had been set up on the floor of Cobain's living room and was photographed by <a href="Charles%20Peterson%20%28photographer%29">Charles Peterson</a> after an unexpected call from Cobain. The album's track listing and re-illustrated symbols from <a href="Barbara%20G.%20Walker">Barbara G. Walker</a>'s "The Woman's Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects" were then positioned around the edge of the collage.

After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company <a href="Geffen%20Records">Geffen Records</a> Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, "The grown-ups don't like it." He said he was told his songwriting was "not up to par", the sound was "unlistenable", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, "I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home." However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing "In Utero" as it was. According to Cobain, "Of course, they want another "Nevermind", but I'd rather die than do that. This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning."

The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound. During this time, Cobain admitted, "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong. The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. The producer declined; as he recalled, "[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' And I don't think he felt he had that yet ... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the <a href="Audio%20mastering">mastering</a> process with <a href="Bob%20Ludwig">Bob Ludwig</a> at his studio in <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a>. Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.

Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album. Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation "from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone". While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to "Newsweek" that said that the article's author "ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous information"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>". Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder <a href="David%20Geffen">David Geffen</a> made the unusual move of personally calling "Newsweek" to complain about the article.

Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer <a href="Scott%20Litt">Scott Litt</a> and remixing some tracks with <a href="Andy%20Wallace%20%28producer%29">Andy Wallace</a> (who had mixed "Nevermind"). Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement. Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs "Heart-Shaped Box" and "All Apologies" with Litt at Seattle's <a href="Bad%20Animals%20Studio">Bad Animals Studio</a> in May 1993. Furthermore, a remix of "Pennyroyal Tea" by Scott Litt (at Bad Animals on November 22, 1993) appears on the censored Wal-Mart and Kmart versions of "In Utero"; this remix is also available on the band's 2002 best-of compilation, "<a href="Nirvana%20%28Nirvana%20album%29">Nirvana</a>", and is the same mix that appeared on the single. One song, "<a href="I%20Hate%20Myself%20and%20Want%20to%20Die">I Hate Myself and Want to Die</a>", was omitted from the final track listing as Cobain felt there were too many "noise" songs on the album. The rest of the album was left unaltered aside from a remastering which sharpened the bass guitar sound and increased the volume of the vocals by approximately three <a href="decibel">decibel</a>s. Albini was critical of the album's final mix; he said, "The end result, the record in the stores doesn't sound all that much like the record that was made. Though it's still them singing and playing their songs, and the musical quality of it still comes across."

To avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to promoting "In Utero"; the company's head of marketing told "Billboard" before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy similar to that of "Nevermind", and explained that the label would "set things up, duck, and get out of the way". The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on <a href="Gramophone%20record">vinyl record</a> as part of this strategy. In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of "In Utero"'s singles commercially in the United States. DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single, "Heart-Shaped Box", to American <a href="Campus%20radio">college</a>, <a href="modern%20rock">modern rock</a>, and <a href="album-oriented%20rock">album-oriented rock</a> radio stations in early September, but the label did not target <a href="Top%2040">Top 40</a> radio. Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that "In Utero" would not be as successful as "Nevermind". Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, "We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much."

"In Utero" was released on September 13, 1993, on vinyl record and <a href="Compact%20cassette">cassette tape</a> in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 on vinyl in the United States, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies. Although the album was issued on compact disc in the U.K. on September 14, a full domestic release did not occur until September 21. "In Utero" débuted at number one on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> album chart, selling 180,000 copies in its first week of release. Meanwhile, retail chain stores <a href="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a> and <a href="Kmart">Kmart</a> refused to sell the album. According to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", Wal-Mart claimed it did not carry the album due to lack of consumer demand, while Kmart representatives explained that the album "didn't fit within our merchandise mix". In truth, both chains feared that customers would be offended by the artwork on the album's back cover. DGC issued a new version of the album with reworked packaging to the stores in March 1994. This version featured edited album artwork, listed the name of "Rape Me" as "Waif Me", and included a Scott Litt remix of "Pennyroyal Tea". A spokesperson for Nirvana explained that the band decided to edit the packaging because as kids Cobain and Novoselic were only able to buy music from the two chain stores; as a result they "really want to make their music available to kids who don't have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores".

"In Utero" received acclaim from critics, although some reviews were mixed. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>"s <a href="Christopher%20John%20Farley">Christopher John Farley</a> stated in his review of the album, "Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn't gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana." "Rolling Stone" reviewer <a href="David%20Fricke">David Fricke</a> said that the album is "a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it's a triumph of the will." "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" reviewer <a href="David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29">David Browne</a> commented "Kurt Cobain hates it all", and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, "The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke." "<a href="NME">NME</a>" magazine's John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, "As a document of a mind in flux – dithering, dissatisfied, unable to come to terms with sanity – Kurt [Cobain] should be proud of [the album]. As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn't quite there." Ben Thompson of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" commented that in spite of the album's more abrasive songs, ""In Utero" is beautiful far more often than it is ugly", and added, "Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with." "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" magazine felt that the album showcases Cobain's songwriting abilities and wrote, "If this is how Cobain is going to develop, the future is lighthouse-bright". Several critics ranked "In Utero" as one of the best releases of the year. It placed first and second in the album categories of the "Rolling Stone" and "Village Voice" <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> year-end critics' polls, respectively. Additionally, "The New York Times" included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Best Alternative Music Album</a> at the <a href="36th%20Grammy%20Awards">1994 Grammy Awards</a>.

That October, Nirvana embarked on its first American tour in two years to promote the album. A second single, a split release that featured "All Apologies" and "Rape Me", was issued in December in the United Kingdom. The band began a six-week European leg of the tour in February 1994, but it was canceled after Cobain suffered a drug overdose in Rome on March 6. Cobain agreed to enter <a href="drug%20rehabilitation">drug rehabilitation</a>, but the singer went missing soon afterward. On April 8, he was found dead in his Seattle home, having committed suicide by a self-inflicted shotgun blast. The intended third single from "In Utero", "<a href="Pennyroyal%20Tea">Pennyroyal Tea</a>", was canceled in the wake of Cobain's death and the subsequent dissolution of Nirvana; limited promotional copies were released in Britain. Three days after Cobain's body was discovered, "In Utero" moved back up the "Billboard" charts, from number 72 to number 27.

In the ensuing years, "In Utero" has continued to perform commercially and gather critical praise. In a 2003 "<a href="Guitar%20World">Guitar World</a>" article that commemorated the tenth anniversary of the album's release, Cobain biographer <a href="Charles%20R.%20Cross">Charles R. Cross</a> argued that "In Utero" was "a far better record [than "Nevermind"] and one that only 10 years later seems to be an influential seed spreader, judging by current bands. If it is possible for an album that sold four million copies to be overlooked, or underappreciated, then "In Utero" is that lost pearl." That same year, <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> placed "In Utero" at number 13 on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s. In 2004 "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" ranked it at number 94 in its "100 Greatest American Albums of All Time" list, while in 2005, "Spin" placed it at number 51 on its "100 Greatest Albums 1985–2005" retrospective. "Rolling Stone" has ranked it at number 435 on its list "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>", and number 7 on its list the "100 Best Albums of the Nineties". In 2005, "In Utero" was ranked number 358 in "Rock Hard" magazine's book of "The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time". "In Utero" has been certified five times platinum by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> for shipments of over five million units, and has sold 4,258,000 copies in the United States, according to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>. To commemorate the album's 20th anniversary, DGC reissued "In Utero" in several different formats in September 2013. The album was also included in the book "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

Common raven

The common raven ("Corvus corax"), also known as the northern raven, is a large all-black <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird. Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all <a href="Corvidae">corvids</a>. There are at least eight <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the <a href="thick-billed%20raven">thick-billed raven</a>, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages in length and in mass. Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild, a lifespan surpassed among passerines by only a few <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>n species such as the <a href="satin%20bowerbird">satin bowerbird</a> and probably the <a href="lyrebird">lyrebird</a>s. Young birds may travel in flocks but later <a href="mate%20for%20life">mate for life</a>, with each <a href="mated%20pair">mated pair</a> defending a <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">territory</a>.

Common ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as <a href="pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a>. Part of their success as a species is due to their <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a> diet; they are extremely versatile and <a href="Opportunism%23Biological%20opportunism">opportunistic</a> in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on <a href="carrion">carrion</a>, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.

Some notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually <a href="intelligence">intelligent</a>. Over the centuries, it has been the subject of mythology, folklore, <a href="Cultural%20depictions%20of%20ravens">art, and literature</a>. In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of <a href="Norse%20mythology">Scandinavia</a>, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Pacific%20Northwest%20Coast">northwest coast of North America</a>, and <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20Siberia">Siberia</a> and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or godlike creature.

The common raven was one of the many species originally described by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his 18th century work, "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>", and it still bears its original name of "Corvus corax". It is the <a href="type%20species">type species</a> of the genus "<a href="Crow%23List%20of%20Species%20in%20the%20genus%20Corvus">Corvus</a>", derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word for "raven". The specific epithet, "corax"/κοραξ, is the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word for "raven" or "crow".

The modern English word "raven" has cognates in all other <a href="Germanic%20languages">Germanic languages</a>, including <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> (and subsequently <a href="Icelandic%20language">modern Icelandic</a>) "hrafn" and <a href="Old%20High%20German">Old High German</a> "(h)raban", all which descend from <a href="Proto-Germanic">Proto-Germanic</a> "*khrabanas". An old <a href="Scots%20language">Scottish</a> word "corby" or "corbie", akin to the French "corbeau", has been used for both this bird and the <a href="carrion%20crow">carrion crow</a>.
Obsolete <a href="collective%20noun">collective noun</a>s for a group of ravens (or at least the common raven) include "unkindness" and "conspiracy". In practice, most English-speakers use the more generic "flock".

The closest relatives of the common raven are the <a href="brown-necked%20raven">brown-necked raven</a> ("C. ruficollis"), the <a href="pied%20crow">pied crow</a> ("C. albus") of Africa, and the <a href="Chihuahuan%20raven">Chihuahuan raven</a> ("C. cryptoleucus") of the North American southwest. While some authorities have recognized as many as 11 <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, others recognize only eight:
The common raven evolved in the <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> and crossed the <a href="Bering%20land%20bridge">Bering land bridge</a> into North America. Recent genetic studies, which examined the <a href="DNA">DNA</a> of common ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall into at least two <a href="clade">clade</a>s: a <a href="California">California</a> clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a <a href="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> clade, found across the rest of the Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.

The findings indicate that based on <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a>, common ravens from the rest of the United States are more closely related to those in Europe and Asia than to those in the California clade, and that common ravens in the California clade are more closely related to the <a href="Chihuahuan%20raven">Chihuahuan raven</a> ("C. cryptoleucus") than to those in the Holarctic clade. Ravens in the Holarctic clade are more closely related to the <a href="pied%20crow">pied crow</a> ("C. albus") than they are to the California clade. Thus, the common raven species as traditionally delimited is considered to be <a href="paraphyletic">paraphyletic</a>.

One explanation for these genetic findings is that common ravens settled in California at least two million years ago and became separated from their relatives in Europe and Asia during an <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>. One million years ago, a group from the California clade evolved into a new species, the Chihuahuan raven. Other members of the Holarctic clade arrived later in a separate migration from Asia, perhaps at the same time as humans.

A 2011 study suggested that there are no restrictions on gene flow between the Californian and Holarctic common raven groups, and that the lineages can remerge, effectively reversing a potential speciation.

A recent study of raven mitochondrial DNA showed that the isolated population from the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> is very close to the population of the Canaries (to the extent that the two are often considered part of a single subspecies).

A mature common raven ranges between 54 and 67 cm (21" and 26") long, with a <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a> of 115 to 150 cm (45–51"). Recorded weights range from 0.69 to 2 kg (1.5 to 4.4 lb), thus making the common raven one of the heaviest <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s. Birds from colder regions such as the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> and Greenland are generally larger with slightly larger bills, while those from warmer regions are smaller with proportionally smaller bills. Representative of the size variation in the species, ravens from <a href="California">California</a> weighed an average of , those from <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> weighed an average of and those from <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> weighed an average of . The <a href="beak">bill</a> is large and slightly curved, with a <a href="Culmen%20%28bird%29">culmen</a> length of , easily one of the largest bills amongst passerines (perhaps only the <a href="thick-billed%20raven">thick-billed raven</a> has a noticeably larger bill). It has a longish, strongly graduated tail, at , and mostly black <a href="iridescent">iridescent</a> plumage, and a dark brown <a href="Iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a>. The throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck feathers are pale brownish-grey. The legs and feet are good-sized, with a <a href="Tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsus</a> length of . Juvenile plumage is similar but duller with a blue-grey iris.

Apart from its greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the <a href="crow">crow</a>s, by having a larger and heavier black beak, shaggy feathers around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the <a href="Chihuahuan%20raven">Chihuahuan raven</a> ("C. cryptoleucus") is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black <a href="carrion%20crow">carrion crow</a> ("C. corone") in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.

In the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, a now extinct colour-morph of this species existed, known as the <a href="pied%20raven">pied raven</a>.

White ravens are occasionally found in the wild. Birds in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> lack the pink eyes of an albino, and are instead <a href="leucistic">leucistic</a>, a condition where an animal lacks any of several different types of pigment, not simply <a href="melanin">melanin</a>.

Common ravens have a wide range of <a href="Bird%20vocalization">vocalization</a>s which are of interest to <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a>s. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant "prruk-prruk-prruk" call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking "toc-toc-toc", a dry, grating "kraa", a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.

Like other corvids, ravens can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech. Non-vocal sounds produced by the common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If a member of a pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.

Common ravens can thrive in varied climates; indeed this species has the largest range of any member of the genus, and one of the largest of any passerine. They range throughout the <a href="Holarctic">Holarctic</a> from Arctic and <a href="temperate">temperate</a> habitats in North America and Eurasia to the deserts of North Africa, and to islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the British Isles, they are more common in Scotland, Wales, northern England and the west of Ireland. In <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>, they have been recorded at altitudes up to 5,000 m (16,400 ft), and as high as 6,350 m (20,600 ft) on <a href="Mount%20Everest">Mount Everest</a>. The population sometimes known as the Punjab raven—described as "Corvus corax laurencei" (also spelt "lawrencii" or "laurencii") by <a href="Allan%20Octavian%20Hume">Allan Octavian Hume</a> but more often considered synonymous with "subcorax"—is restricted to the <a href="Sindh">Sindh</a> district of Pakistan and adjoining regions of northwestern India. They are generally resident within their range for the whole year. In his 1950 work, "Grønlands Fugle" ["Birds of Greenland"], noted ornithologist <a href="Finn%20Salomonsen">Finn Salomonsen</a> indicated that common ravens did not overwinter in the Arctic. However, in Arctic Canada and Alaska, they are found year-round. Young birds may disperse locally.

Most common ravens prefer wooded areas with large expanses of open land nearby, or coastal regions for their nesting sites and feeding grounds. In some areas of dense human population, such as <a href="California">California</a> in the United States, they take advantage of a plentiful food supply and have seen a surge in their numbers. On coasts, individuals of this species are often evenly distributed and prefer to build their nest sites along sea cliffs. Common ravens are often located in coastal regions because these areas provide easy access to water and a variety of food sources. Also, coastal regions have stable weather patterns without extreme cold or hot temperatures.

In general, common ravens live in a wide array of environments but prefer heavily contoured landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as <a href="corticosterone">corticosterone</a> is activated by the <a href="hypothalamic%E2%80%93pituitary%E2%80%93adrenal%20axis">hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis</a>. Corticosterone is activated when the bird is exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.

Common ravens usually travel in mated pairs, although young birds may form <a href="Flock%20%28birds%29">flocks</a>. Relationships between common ravens are often quarrelsome, yet they demonstrate considerable devotion to their families.

Owing to its size, gregariousness and its defensive abilities, the common raven has few natural predators. Predators of its eggs include <a href="owl">owl</a>s, <a href="marten">marten</a>s, and sometimes <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s. Ravens are quite vigorous at defending their young and are usually successful at driving off perceived threats. They attack potential predators by flying at them and lunging with their large bills. Humans are occasionally attacked if they get close to a raven nest, though serious injuries are unlikely. There are a few records of predation by large birds of prey. Their attackers in America have reportedly included <a href="great%20horned%20owl">great horned owl</a>s, <a href="northern%20goshawk">northern goshawk</a>s, <a href="bald%20eagle">bald eagle</a>s, <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s and <a href="red-tailed%20hawk">red-tailed hawk</a>s, it is possible that the two hawks only have attacked young ravens, as had a <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a> who in one instance swooped at a newly fledged raven but was successfully chased off by the parent ravens. In <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>, their reported predators include, in addition to golden eagles, <a href="Eurasian%20eagle-owl">Eurasian eagle-owl</a>s, <a href="white-tailed%20eagle">white-tailed eagle</a>s, <a href="Steller%27s%20sea-eagle">Steller's sea-eagle</a>s, <a href="eastern%20imperial%20eagle">eastern imperial eagle</a>s and <a href="gyrfalcon">gyrfalcon</a>s. Because they are potentially hazardous prey for raptorial birds, raptors must usually take them by surprise and most attacks are on fledgling ravens. More rarely still, large mammalian predators such as <a href="lynx">lynx</a>es, <a href="coyote">coyote</a>s and <a href="cougar">cougar</a>s have also attacked ravens. This principally occurs at a nest site and when other prey for the carnivores are scarce. Ravens are highly wary around novel carrion sites and, in North America, have been recorded waiting for the presence of <a href="American%20crow">American crow</a>s and <a href="blue%20jay">blue jay</a>s before approaching to eat.

Juveniles begin to court at a very early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key behaviors of courting. Once paired, they tend to nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.

Breeding pairs must have a territory of their own before they begin nest-building and reproduction, and thus aggressively defend a territory and its food resources. Nesting territories vary in size according to the density of food resources in the area. The nest is a deep bowl made of large sticks and twigs, bound with an inner layer of roots, mud, and bark and lined with a softer material, such as <a href="deer">deer</a> fur. The nest is usually placed in a large tree or on a cliff ledge, or less frequently in old buildings or utility poles.

Females lay between 3 & 7 pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, sheltering but not actually <a href="brooding">brooding</a> them. Young <a href="fledge">fledge</a> at 35 to 42 days, and are fed by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.

In most of their range, egg laying begins in late February. In colder climates, it is later, e.g. April in <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> and <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>. In Pakistan, egg-laying takes place in December. Eggs and hatchlings are preyed on, rarely, by large <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s and <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s, large <a href="owl">owl</a>s, <a href="marten">marten</a>s and <a href="canid">canid</a>s. The adults, which are very rarely preyed upon, are often successful in defending their young from these predators, due to their numbers, large size and cunning. They have been observed dropping stones on potential predators that venture close to their nests.

Common ravens can be very long-lived, especially in captive or protected conditions; <a href="Ravens%20of%20the%20Tower%20of%20London">individuals at the Tower of London</a> have lived for more than 40 years. Lifespans in the wild are considerably shorter at typically 10 to 15 years. The longest known lifespan of a <a href="bird%20ringing">banded</a> wild common raven was 23 years, 3 months.

Common ravens are <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a> and highly <a href="Opportunism%23Biological%20opportunism">opportunistic</a>: their diet may vary widely with location, season and <a href="serendipity">serendipity</a>. For example, those foraging on <a href="tundra">tundra</a> on the <a href="Arctic%20North%20Slope">Arctic North Slope</a> of <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> obtained about half their energy needs from <a href="predation">predation</a>, mainly of <a href="Microtus">microtine rodents</a>, and half by scavenging, mainly of <a href="caribou">caribou</a> and <a href="Rock%20ptarmigan">ptarmigan</a> carcasses.

In some places they are mainly <a href="scavenger">scavenger</a>s, feeding on <a href="carrion">carrion</a> as well as the associated <a href="maggot">maggot</a>s and <a href="carrion%20beetle">carrion beetle</a>s. With large-bodied carrion, which they are not equipped to tear through as well as birds such as hook-billed <a href="vulture">vulture</a>s, they must wait for the prey to be torn open by another predator or flayed by other means. Plant food includes cereal grains, berries and fruit. They prey on small <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and birds. Ravens may also consume the undigested portions of animal feces, and human food waste. They store surplus food items, especially those containing fat, and will learn to hide such food out of the sight of other common ravens. Ravens also raid the food caches of other species, such as the <a href="Arctic%20fox">Arctic fox</a>. They sometimes associate with another canine, the <a href="grey%20wolf">grey wolf</a>, as a <a href="kleptoparasite">kleptoparasite</a>, following to scavenge wolf-kills in winter. Ravens are regular predators at bird nests, brazenly picking off eggs, nestlings and sometimes adult birds when they spot an opportunity. They are considered perhaps the primary natural threat to the nesting success of the critically endangered <a href="California%20condor">California condor</a>, since they readily take condor eggs and are very common in the areas where the species is being re-introduced. On the other hand, when they defend their own adjacent nests, they may incidentally benefit condors since they chase <a href="golden%20eagle">golden eagle</a>s out of the area that may otherwise prey upon larger nestling and fledging condors. Condors, despite their large size, do not seem to have well developed nest defenses.
Common ravens nesting near sources of human <a href="Food%20waste">garbage</a> included a higher percentage of food waste in their diet, birds nesting near roads consumed more <a href="roadkill">road-killed</a> <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s, and those nesting far from these sources of food ate more <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s and plant material. <a href="Fledging">Fledging</a> success was higher for those using human garbage as a food source. In contrast, a 1984–1986 study of common raven diet in an agricultural region of south-western <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> found that cereal grains were the principal constituent of <a href="pellet%20%28ornithology%29">pellet</a>s, though small mammals, grasshoppers, cattle carrion and birds were also eaten.

One behavior is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens to a food bonanza, usually a carcass, with a series of loud yells. In "Ravens in Winter," <a href="Bernd%20Heinrich">Bernd Heinrich</a> posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate in sharing information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent of the size of the bait.

Furthermore, there has been research suggesting that the common raven is involved in seed dispersal. In the wild, the common raven chooses the best habitat and disperses seeds in locations best suited for its survival.

The brains of common ravens count among the largest of any bird species. Specifically, their <a href="avian%20pallium">hyperpallium</a> is large, for a bird. They display ability in problem-solving, as well as other <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a> processes such as <a href="imitation">imitation</a> and <a href="Insight%20phenomenology">insight</a>.

Linguist <a href="Derek%20Bickerton">Derek Bickerton</a>, building on the work of biologist <a href="Bernd%20Heinrich">Bernd Heinrich</a>, has argued that ravens are one of only four known animals (the others being <a href="bee">bee</a>s, <a href="ant">ant</a>s, and humans) who have demonstrated <a href="Displacement%20%28linguistics%29">displacement</a>, the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space or time from the communication. Young, unmated common ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens, the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find. The following day, a flock of unmated ravens will fly to the carcass and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that ravens are the only other <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a> to share this with humans.

One experiment designed to evaluate insight and <a href="problem-solving">problem-solving</a> ability involved a piece of meat attached to a string hanging from a perch. To reach the food, the bird needed to stand on the perch, pull the string up a little at a time, and step on the loops to gradually shorten the string. Four of five common ravens eventually succeeded, and "the transition from no success (ignoring the food or merely yanking at the string) to constant reliable access (pulling up the meat) occurred with no demonstrable <a href="trial-and-error">trial-and-error</a> learning." This supports the hypothesis that common ravens are 'inventors', implying that they can solve problems. Many of the feats of common ravens were formerly argued to be stereotyped innate behaviour, but it now has been established that their aptitudes for solving problems individually and learning from each other reflect a flexible capacity for intelligent insight unusual among non-human animals.

Another experiment proved that some could deceive intentionally at least to other common ravens.

Common ravens have been observed calling <a href="wolf">wolves</a> to the site of dead animals. The <a href="wolf">wolves</a> open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.

Common ravens are known to steal and cache shiny objects such as pebbles, pieces of metal, and golf balls. One theory is that they hoard shiny objects to impress other ravens. Other research indicates that juveniles are deeply curious about all new things, and that common ravens retain an attraction to bright, round objects based on their similarity to bird eggs. Mature birds lose their intense interest in the unusual, and become highly <a href="neophobia">neophobic</a>.

There has been increasing recognition of the extent to which birds engage in <a href="play%20%28activity%29">play</a>. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. They even engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.

They are also one of only a few wild animals who make their own toys. They have been observed breaking off twigs to play with socially.

Compared to many smaller "<a href="Corvus%20%28genus%29">Corvus</a>" species (such as <a href="American%20crow">American crow</a>), ravens prefer undisturbed montane or forest habitat or rural areas over urban areas. In other areas, their numbers have increased dramatically and they have become agricultural <a href="Pest%20%28organism%29">pests</a>. Common ravens can cause damage to crops, such as nuts and grain, or can harm livestock, particularly by killing young goat kids, lambs and calves. Ravens generally attack the faces of young livestock, but the more common raven behaviour of scavenging may be misidentified as predation by ranchers.

In the western <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a>, human settlement and land development have led to an estimated 16-fold increase in the common raven population over 25 years. Towns, landfills, sewage treatment plants and artificial ponds create sources of food and water for scavenging birds. Ravens also find nesting sites in utility poles and ornamental trees, and are attracted to roadkill on highways. The explosion in the common raven population in the Mojave has raised concerns for the <a href="desert%20tortoise">desert tortoise</a>, a <a href="threatened%20species">threatened species</a>. Common ravens prey upon juvenile tortoises, which have soft shells and move slowly. Plans to control the population have included shooting and trapping birds, as well as contacting landfill operators to ask that they reduce the amount of exposed garbage. A hunting bounty as a method of control was historically used in Finland from the mid-18th century until 1923. Culling has taken place to a limited extent in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>, where the population increase in common ravens is threatening the vulnerable <a href="Steller%27s%20eider">Steller's eider</a> ("Polysticta stelleri").

Across its range in the Northern Hemisphere, and throughout human history, the common raven has been a powerful symbol and a popular subject of mythology and folklore.

In some <a href="Western%20culture">Western tradition</a>s, ravens have long been considered to be birds of ill omen, death and evil in general, in part because of the negative symbolism of their all-<a href="Black%23Beliefs%2C%20religions%20and%20superstitions">black</a> plumage and the eating of <a href="carrion">carrion</a>. In Sweden, ravens are known as the ghosts of murdered people, and in Germany as the souls of the damned. In <a href="Danish%20folklore">Danish folklore</a>, <a href="valravn">valravn</a>e that ate a king's heart gained human knowledge, could perform great malicious acts, could lead people astray, had superhuman powers, and were "terrible animals".

As in traditional mythology and folklore, the common raven features frequently in more modern writings such as the works of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>, and, perhaps most famously, in the poem "<a href="The%20Raven">The Raven</a>" by <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>. Ravens have appeared in the works of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>, <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>, <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>, <a href="George%20R.%20R.%20Martin">George R. R. Martin</a> and <a href="Joan%20Aiken">Joan Aiken</a> among others.

It continues to be used as a symbol in areas where it once had mythological status: as the <a href="List%20of%20national%20birds">national bird</a> of <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a> (<a href="Druk%20Gyalpo">Kings of Bhutan</a> wear the <a href="Raven%20Crown">Raven Crown</a>), official bird of the <a href="Yukon">Yukon</a> territory, and on the coat of arms of the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> (once a Viking colony).

In Persia and Arabia the raven was held as a bird of bad omen but a 14th-century Arabic work reports use of the raven in falconry.

The modern <a href="unisex%20given%20name">unisex given name</a> "<a href="Raven%20%28given%20name%29">Raven</a>" is derived from the English word "raven". As a masculine name, "Raven" parallels the Old Norse "<a href="Hrafn">Hrafn</a>", and Old English "*Hræfn", which were both <a href="byname">byname</a>s and <a href="personal%20name">personal name</a>s.

In <a href="History%20of%20the%20Tlingit%23Creation%20story%20and%20the%20Raven%20Cycle">Tlingit</a> and <a href="Haida%20mythology">Haida cultures</a>, raven was both a <a href="trickster">trickster</a> and <a href="creator%20god">creator god</a>. Related beliefs are widespread among the peoples of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> and northeast Asia. The <a href="Kamchatka%20Peninsula">Kamchatka Peninsula</a>, for example, was supposed to have been created by the raven god <a href="Kutkh">Kutkh</a>. There are several references to common ravens in the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a> and it is an aspect of <a href="Mahakala">Mahakala</a> in <a href="Bhutan">Bhutan</a>ese mythology.

In <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a>, <a href="Huginn%20and%20Muninn">Huginn</a> (from the Old Norse for "thought") and <a href="Huginn%20and%20Muninn">Muninn</a> (Old Norse for "memory" or "mind") are a pair of ravens that fly all over the world, <a href="Midgard">Midgard</a>, and bring the god <a href="Odin">Odin</a> information. Additionally among the Norse, <a href="raven%20banner">raven banner</a> standards were carried by such figures as the <a href="Earl%20of%20Orkney">Jarls of Orkney</a>, King <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut the Great</a> of England, Norway and Denmark, and <a href="Harald%20Hardrada">Harald Hardrada</a>. In the British Isles, ravens also were symbolic to the <a href="Celts">Celts</a>. In <a href="Irish%20mythology">Irish mythology</a>, the goddess <a href="Morr%C3%ADgan">Morrígan</a> alighted on the hero <a href="C%C3%BA%20Chulainn">Cú Chulainn</a>'s shoulder in the form of a raven after his death. In <a href="Welsh%20mythology">Welsh mythology</a> they were associated with the Welsh god <a href="Bran%20the%20Blessed">Bran the Blessed</a>, whose name translates to "raven." According to the "<a href="Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a>", Bran's head was buried in the White Hill of London as a <a href="talisman">talisman</a> against invasion.

A legend developed that England would not fall to a foreign invader as long as there were <a href="Ravens%20of%20the%20Tower%20of%20London">ravens at the Tower of London</a>; although this is often thought to be an ancient belief, the official Tower of London historian, Geoff Parnell, believes that this is actually a romantic Victorian invention.

In the <a href="Judaism">Jewish</a>, <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> and <a href="Islamic">Islamic</a> traditions, the raven was the first animal to be released from <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark">Noah's Ark</a>. "So it came to pass, at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made. Then he sent out a raven, which kept going to and fro until the waters had dried up from the earth. He also sent out from himself a dove, to see if the waters had receded from the face of the ground." The raven is mentioned a dozen times in the Bible. In the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a> <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus</a> tells a parable using the raven to show how people should rely on God for their needs and not riches (). The raven is also mentioned in <a href="Quran">Quran</a> at the story of <a href="Cain%20and%20Abel">Cain and Abel</a>. <a href="Adam">Adam</a>'s firstborn son Cain kills his brother Abel but he doesn't know what to do with the corpse: ""Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother's naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother's naked corpse? And he became repentant.""

Tower Hill Memorial

The Tower Hill Memorial is a pair of <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> memorials in Trinity Square, on <a href="Tower%20Hill">Tower Hill</a> in <a href="London">London</a>, England. The memorials, one for the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and one for the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second</a>, commemorate civilian merchant sailors and fishermen who were killed as a result of enemy action and have no known grave. The first, the Mercantile Marine War Memorial, was designed by <a href="Sir%20Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a> and unveiled in 1928; the second, the Merchant Seamen's Memorial, was designed by <a href="Edward%20Maufe">Sir Edward Maufe</a> and unveiled in 1955. A third memorial, commemorating merchant sailors who were killed in the 1982 <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>, was added to the site in 2005.

The first memorial was commissioned in light of the heavy losses sustained by merchant shipping in the First World War – over 17,000 lives were lost and some 3,300 British and Empire-registered commercial vessels sunk as a result of enemy action. The Imperial War Graves Commission (IWGC) commissioned Lutyens, who initially designed a massive arch on the banks of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, but this was rejected by the authorities, to Lutyens' disdain. A compromise was struck, as a result of which the memorial was constructed in Trinity Square Gardens on Tower Hill, a site further from the river but with a long maritime history. The site was <a href="Crown%20Estate">crown land</a>, meaning a special <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> was required. <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> unveiled the memorial on 12 December 1928 at a ceremony broadcast live on the radio, her first use of the medium. The memorial is a vaulted corridor reminiscent of a <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> temple and similar to Lutyens' structures in cemeteries on the Western Front. The walls are clad with bronze panels which bear the names of the missing. 

Merchant shipping losses in the Second World War were significantly higher than in the first and the IWGC commissioned a second memorial on the same site, intended to complement the first. Maufe designed a sunken garden, accessed by steps behind the original memorial, the walls of which were again clad with bronze panels with the names of the missing. At regular intervals between the panels are relief sculptures (by <a href="Charles%20Wheeler%20%28sculptor%29">Charles Wheeler</a>) representing the seven seas. Wheeler also sculpted two sentries, a Merchant Navy sailor and officer, which stand at the top of the steps. The new memorial was unveiled by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in November 1955, after which relatives of those named on it were invited to lay flowers. 

The memorials to the world wars are both <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a>s—the Mercantile Marine Memorial is grade I and part of a national collection of Lutyens' war memorials, and Maufe's Merchant Seamen's Memorial is listed at grade II*. The Falklands War memorial is unlisted.

In the aftermath of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain and other countries affected. In particular, the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Imperial War Graves Commission</a> (IWGC) assumed responsibility for commemorating all casualties from the British Empire. The commission was established in 1917, and one of its first principal architects was <a href="Edwin%20Lutyens">Sir Edwin Lutyens</a>, an English architect who made his reputation building <a href="country%20house">country house</a>s and later designed much of <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a>. Lutyens acted as an unpaid advisor to the IWGC during the war, in which capacity he made several visits to France to make initial plans for organised cemeteries. The war had a profound effect on Lutyens; following it, he devoted much of his time to memorialising its casualties. He designed <a href="the%20Cenotaph%2C%20Whitehall">the Cenotaph</a> on <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a> in London (which became Britain's national memorial to the two world wars) and many other cemeteries and memorials for the IWGC, including the <a href="Thiepval%20Memorial">Thiepval Memorial</a> (completed 1932).

The IWGC and its founder, <a href="Fabian%20Ware">Fabian Ware</a>, were determined from the outset that all casualties should be individually and equally commemorated, regardless of military rank or social status. Where it was not possible to provide a headstone (for example because a body could not be recovered), a casualty's name was included on one of the commission's large memorials, such as Tower Hill. The <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> did not initially believe that the IWGC's remit extended to sailors lost at sea and planned its own commemorations, but after negotiation it was agreed that the commission would take responsibility for commemorating maritime casualties as it did with those who died on land. The commission's charter defined its scope as "members of the military and naval forces of the Crown"; in 1921 the commissioners resolved that this extended to the Mercantile Marine and other civilian organisations who were engaged in the war effort.

Merchant shipping and fishing fleets played a vital role in supporting the British war effort throughout the First World War, both by resupplying the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> at sea and by delivering food, products, and raw materials to the United Kingdom. Merchant ships were regularly sunk by the <a href="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a> from the outset of the war, particularly after Germany commenced <a href="U-boat%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">unrestricted submarine warfare</a>. By the end of the war, over 3,300 British- and empire-registered merchant ships had been sunk, with the loss of over 17,000 lives.

The IWGC sought advice on the form of the memorial from the seafarers' unions, who consistently requested a memorial in the form of a home for aged seamen or similar, but the commission was set against functional memorials in the belief that they became associated more with their function than with commemoration. It rejected the request, overruling its own advisory committee in doing so, on the grounds that its charter did not allow it to fund the ongoing costs of an institution. It insisted that merchant seamen would be commemorated on a monument. 

The commission first intended to site the memorial at Temple Steps, on the bank of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>, for which it commissioned Lutyens. The architect designed a massive arch. The proposed structure would have consisted of two stone piers of linked, alternating arches (reminiscent of the Thiepval Memorial, which he was designing for the IWGC at around the same time) joined by a large beam, itself supported by two <a href="Doric%20order">Doric</a> columns between the arches. This was approved by <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a>, but the <a href="Office%20of%20Works">Office of Works</a> rejected it on the advice of the <a href="Royal%20Fine%20Arts%20Commission">Royal Fine Arts Commission</a> (RFAC), which objected on two grounds: first, that Lutyens' proposal would involve the demolition of an arch built when the <a href="Thames%20Embankment">Thames Embankment</a> was constructed; and second, that the memorial would be better suited to a site further downstream, east of <a href="Tower%20Bridge">Tower Bridge</a>, where it would be seen by ocean-going vessels which could not travel west of the bridge. Both Lutyens and Ware attempted to persuade the RFAC to reconsider but to no avail. Lutyens was furious, feeling that the merchant seamen had been relegated to "some hole in the corner because they happened to be low in social status", and that <a href="Reginald%20Blomfield">Sir Reginald Blomfield</a> (a member of the RFAC and a rival of Lutyens) was acting out of spite. 

Lutyens described the RFAC's opinion as "bosh", and suggested to Ware that they should continue regardless and force a confrontation. Ware was more diplomatic, and the IWGC chose a new site in Trinity Square Gardens on <a href="Tower%20Hill">Tower Hill</a>, still west of Tower Bridge but further from the river. This site was considered appropriate because it was within sight of the Thames, albeit not on the riverbank, and the area already had maritime connections, including the headquarters of the <a href="Port%20of%20London%20Authority">Port of London Authority</a> at <a href="10%20Trinity%20Square">10 Trinity Square</a>, <a href="Trinity%20House">Trinity House</a>, and the church of <a href="All%20Hallows-by-the-Tower">All Hallows-by-the-Tower</a> (itself home to many nautically themed memorials). Philip Longworth, in a history of the IWGC, remarked that the location meant that the commission's only memorial in London "would never be seen by most Londoners, still less find a place in the national consciousness as did Lutyens' stark monument on Whitehall" (the Cenotaph was not commissioned by the IWGC). 

Trinity Square Gardens was <a href="Crown%20Estate">Crown land</a> administered by trustees. Although the trustees suggested they would not object to the memorial, they did not have the power to give full consent and a special <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> was required. The bill was laid before <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> in December 1926 and received <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> in June 1927, becoming the Mercantile Marine Memorial Act. The building work was undertaken by <a href="Holloway%20Brothers%20%28London%29">Holloway Brothers (London)</a> and the memorial was unveiled by <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a> (deputising for her husband, King <a href="George%20V">George V</a>) on 12 December 1928, her first solo engagement of the sort. The unveiling ceremony was broadcast live on the radio in the queen's first use of the medium. Despite taking place in torrential rain, the unveiling ceremony was attended by a large crowd, who cheered the queen as she was driven away.

The main structure is in <a href="Portland%20stone">Portland stone</a>. It takes the form of a <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vaulted</a> <a href="colonnade">colonnade</a> or pavilion reminiscent of a Doric temple but open at both ends. After the <a href="Arch%20of%20Remembrance">Arch of Remembrance</a> in <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, it is Lutyens' second-largest war memorial in the United Kingdom, and is the only British First World War memorial dedicated exclusively to merchant seamen. It is raised on a platform slightly above street level, oriented east to west and accessed from the street by a set of five stone steps at each end. The structure is long by wide and up to tall. It consists of three <a href="bay%20%28architecture%29">bays</a> on either side, created by eight alternating square <a href="Pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a> and six pairs of round columns. The eight piers are clad in rectangular bronze panels to give the impression of <a href="Rustication%20%28architecture%29">rustication</a>. The panels (divided into 24 numbered sections) contain the names of missing mariners, ordered by ship name and then alphabetically following the name of the captain or master. The vessels of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets are listed separately. Above the bays is a Doric <a href="entablature">entablature</a>. The low, pitched roof has shallow parapets on either side and <a href="gable">gable</a>d ends; on top, in the centre, is a large square <a href="Attic%20style">attic</a> which supports a large stone drum. The attic is similar to Lutyens' original design for the <a href="York%20City%20War%20Memorial">York City War Memorial</a>, which featured a <a href="Stone%20of%20Remembrance">Stone of Remembrance</a> rather than a drum. The sculptural element is the work of <a href="William%20Reid%20Dick">William Reid Dick</a>, who worked on several other war memorials, including the <a href="Menin%20Gate">Menin Gate</a> in <a href="Ypres">Ypres</a>, Belgium. 

The memorial's main dedication is in bronze letters to the front (south) of the attic: ; above it are the dates of the First World War (1914–1918), which are also carved into the stone on north side. To either side are decorative bronze wreaths. On the inside, the floor is in black and white stone in a chequerboard pattern. On the north side, bronze spikes occupy the otherwise-open bays.

The largest single loss of life commemorated on the memorial is from <a href="Sinking%20of%20the%20RMS%20Lusitania">the sinking</a> of the <a href="RMS%20Lusitania">RMS "Lusitania"</a> on 7 May 1915. Of the 1,200 dead, over 350 British crew members are commemorated on the Mercantile Marine memorial. In total, the First World War memorial records the names of some 12,000 casualties.

In his biography of Lutyens, Michael Barker described the design as "dignified classicism"; another Lutyens biographer, <a href="Christopher%20Hussey">Christopher Hussey</a>, described it as a "classical shrine". Tim Skelton, author of "Lutyens and the Great War", notes the similarity of the colonnade to the shelter buildings in Lutyens' cemeteries in France and Belgium and suggests that the memorial would be "equally well at home on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> as in the heart of London". The resemblance to the cemetery buildings is also noted by the Dutch architect Jeroen Geurst, who compares it in particular to those at <a href="Hooge%20Crater%20Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission%20Cemetery">Hooge Crater</a> in Belgium and <a href="Serre%20Road%20Cemetery%20No.%202">Serre Road</a> in France. In the opinion of the historian <a href="David%20Crane%20%28historian%29">David Crane</a>, the memorial never recovered from its "miserable start" and is consequently the least well-known of the IWGC's major works following the First World War.

From the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, shipping losses were again high and a similar convoy system was used in an effort to protect merchant vessels. By the war's end, 4,786 ships had been sunk, with the loss of some 32,000 lives (of which almost 24,000 are commemorated at Tower Hill); almost a quarter of the losses were in British waters. Although military casualties were lower in the Second World War than in the First, civilian casualties were higher and there was widespread destruction of British cities. By the end of the second war there was little appetite for another wave of large memorials. Instead, many memorials from the first war were adapted or expanded to commemorate the new casualties—an approach the IWGC took at Tower Hill and elsewhere. Generally, it only built new memorials to the missing in places which had not been touched by the First World War. The IWGC was by this time a much more established and well-respected institution and thus found it easier to obtain the agreements and public support necessary for its work. 

The architect was <a href="Edward%20Maufe">Edward Maufe</a>, who began his career designing churches and by the 1950s was the IWGC's principal architect for the United Kingdom for the Second World War commemorations. Maufe was also responsible for the <a href="Air%20Forces%20Memorial">Air Forces Memorial</a> in Surrey and extensions to the <a href="Plymouth%20Naval%20Memorial">Plymouth</a>, <a href="Portsmouth%20Naval%20Memorial">Portsmouth</a>, and <a href="Chatham%20Naval%20Memorial">Chatham</a> naval memorials.

Following the Second World War, the IWGC considered various sites for a memorial to the new casualties but, after consultation with the relevant public bodies, decided that Tower Hill was the most appropriate location. The commission briefed Maufe that the new memorial should complement Lutyens' design and fit in with the existing architecture in the area, including the Port of London Authority building. Maufe first proposed extending Lutyens' structure with a further colonnade, but this was rejected. His next design, for a sunken garden, was accepted. Another Act of Parliament was required, which was passed in July 1952 as the Merchant Navy Memorial Act. Work began later in 1952 and was completed in 1955. Some modifications to Maufe's design were necessary. Maufe initially planned a larger grassy area between Lutyens' colonnade and the sunken garden with a Stone of Remembrance at the centre. The stone was eliminated and the grass scaled back to reduce the overall size of the memorial and assuage the concerns of local people. The depth of the garden had to be reduced at the south end because of a <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> tunnel. 

The memorial commemorates merchant seamen from ships registered in Britain or its Empire or on loan to the governments of those countries, and who were lost at sea as a result of enemy action in the Second World War; it lists 23,765 men, of whom 832 were fishermen and 80 maritime pilots and lighthousemen. The much larger casualty figures and corresponding scale of the memorial reflect the vital contribution of the Merchant Navy to the British war effort in the Second World War. The memorial was unveiled by <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> at a modest ceremony on 5 November 1955, two days before <a href="Remembrance%20Sunday">Remembrance Sunday</a>. The ceremony, described by "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" as "all as modest and anonymous as the Merchant Navy itself", concluded with the sounding of the "<a href="Last%20Post">Last Post</a>" by buglers from the <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a>, answered by a single ship's horn on the River Thames. After the unveiling, 16,000 relatives of those commemorated on the memorial laid flowers around it, a process which lasted until late in the evening.

The Second World War memorial takes the form of a semi-circular sunken garden located behind the First World War Memorial, to its north in Trinity Square Gardens. The idea of a sunken garden appears to have originated from discussions immediately following the end of the war. There was a feeling among the new generation of artists and architects that the elaborate and artistic memorials to the First World War did not capture the national mood of mourning for the new wave of casualties and that spaces such as gardens, which provided a location for individual mourning and reflection, were more suitable. According to the architectural historian Philip Ward-Jackson, Maufe's memorial gives the impression of being a wing of an imaginary ruined church, complete with provided seats—an image which would have had "powerful resonance in the bombed City" (much of the surrounding area, including the Port of London Authority building, was severely damaged by German bombing). The architectural historian <a href="Nikolaus%20Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> described Maufe's extension as "less assertive" than the original memorial; he praised the idea of a memorial to the missing in the form of a void (the sunken garden), but felt it was let down by Wheeler's "strangely jaunty" reliefs between the lists of names. 

The ground-level entrance area to the Second World War memorial is on the southern side of the sunken garden and consists of two <a href="pylon%20%28architecture%29">pylons</a> flanking a low wall that faces the First World War memorial. Built into the low wall is a stone similar to Lutyens' Stone of Remembrance, which is inscribed with the years of the war (1939–1945) and carries the memorial's dedication: . Each of the flanking pylons supports an over-life-sized statue, representing a Merchant Navy sailor (on the east side) and officer (on the west). The entrance steps either side of the pylons descend to the sunken garden that contains the name panels. The walls of the garden are high in Portland stone, to match the original memorial, with the names of the missing from the Second World War listed on 132 bronze panels fixed to the walls. The name panels circle the entire sunken garden, lining both the northern and southern walls, and the eastern and western walls. Spaced at regular intervals along the semi-circular (northern) part of the memorial are seven <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> sculptures representing the <a href="Seven%20Seas">Seven Seas</a>. These are the work of <a href="Charles%20Wheeler%20%28sculptor%29">Charles Wheeler</a>, who also executed the sculptures for Maufe's extensions of the Royal Navy memorials. The garden is mainly grass, with a sculpture of a compass in a 'pool' of bronze, set to <a href="magnetic%20north">magnetic north</a>, in the centre. The <a href="Red%20Ensign">Red Ensign</a> (the flag flown by British-registered civilian vessels) flies over the site.

The Tower Hill memorial commemorates 36,087 sailors from both world wars. Only merchant seamen who have no known grave are listed at Tower Hill. Those whose bodies were recovered or who served with other organisations (such as the Indian Merchant Navy) are commemorated elsewhere—for example, 1,200 merchant seamen who served with the Royal Navy during the Second World War are commemorated on the <a href="Liverpool%20Naval%20Memorial">Liverpool Naval Memorial</a>. The memorial register for the Mercantile Marine Memorial was originally published by the IWGC in nine volumes in 1928. After the Second World War, a three-volume "Roll of Honour of the Merchant Navy and Fishing Fleets 1939–1945" was produced in 1958 by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Transport%20and%20Civil%20Aviation%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation</a> and distributed to a range of organisations in the UK and abroad. The first two volumes of this roll of honour contain the names listed on the Merchant Seamen's Memorial at Tower Hill. The registers for the Tower Hill memorials are held at the nearby Trinity House on the north side of Trinity Square Gardens.

Since 2000, 3 September has been celebrated annually as Merchant Navy Day; a memorial service is held close to that date at the Tower Hill Memorial. In 2005, the Merchant Navy Association unveiled another memorial on the site. The work of Gordon Newton, it is dedicated to the Merchant Navy and <a href="Royal%20Fleet%20Auxiliary">Royal Fleet Auxiliary</a> casualties of the 1982 <a href="Falklands%20War">Falklands War</a>. It consists of a bronze sundial, raised on a granite base; at the dial's centre is a large bronze anchor. Around the base are bronze plaques, one of which contains the inscription . The others record the names of the 17 dead, ordered by ship. The Falklands memorial, which is not listed, was unveiled on 4 September 2005 by the <a href="First%20Sea%20Lord">First Sea Lord</a>, Admiral <a href="Alan%20West%2C%20Baron%20West%20of%20Spithead">Sir Alan West</a> and is maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (the IWGC having changed its name in 1960). 

As part of the commemorations for the 70th anniversary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a> in the Second World War, a ceremony was held at the Tower Hill Memorial on 11 May 2013, along with other events elsewhere in London and Britain.

Lutyens' First World War Memorial became a grade II* <a href="listed%20building">listed building</a> in 1973. Listed status offers legal protection from demolition or modification; grade II* is reserved for "particularly important buildings of more than special interest" and is applied to about 5.5% of listings. It was upgraded to grade I status (which is applied to around 2.5% of listed buildings, those of "the greatest historic interest") in November 2015 when Lutyens' war memorials were declared a national collection. Maufe's Merchant Seamen's Memorial has separately been a grade II* listed building since 1998.
