U.S. Route 31 in Michigan

US Highway 31 (US 31) is a part of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> that runs from <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> to the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula</a> of the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. In Michigan, it is a <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway</a> that runs from the <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>–Michigan state line at <a href="Bertrand%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Bertrand Township</a> north to its terminus at <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">Interstate 75</a> (I-75) south of <a href="Mackinaw%20City%2C%20Michigan">Mackinaw City</a>. Along its route, US 31 follows the Michigan section of the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20Valley%20Parkway">St. Joseph Valley Parkway</a> as well as other freeways and divided highways northward to <a href="Ludington%2C%20Michigan">Ludington</a>. North of there, the trunkline is a rural undivided highway through the <a href="Northern%20Michigan">Northern Michigan</a> tourist destinations of <a href="Traverse%20City%2C%20Michigan">Traverse City</a> and <a href="Petoskey%2C%20Michigan">Petoskey</a> before terminating south of Mackinaw City. Along its route, US 31 has been dedicated in memory of a few different organizations, and sections of it carry the <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan Circle Tour</a> (LMCT) moniker. Four bridges used by the highway have been recognized for their historic character as well.

The first highways along the route of the modern US 31 corridor were the West Michigan Pike, an auto trail from 1913, and later a pair of state trunklines (the original <a href="M-11%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-11</a> and <a href="M-58%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-58</a>) in 1919. These state highways were redesignated US 31 on November 11, 1926, when the US Highway System was approved. Since then, the highway has been realigned in places. The highway crossed the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a> by ferry for about a decade in the 1920s and 1930s before the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a> was built, connecting to <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a> north of <a href="St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan">St. Ignace</a>. Later, sections were converted into freeways starting in the 1950s. These segments opened through the subsequent decades with the last one opening in 2003. Future plans by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) are to finish the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and bypass <a href="Grand%20Haven%2C%20Michigan">Grand Haven</a>.

Between <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Beach%2C%20Michigan">Lake Michigan Beach</a> and the northern terminus south of <a href="Mackinaw%20City%2C%20Michigan">Mackinaw City</a>, most of US 31 forms a portion of the <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan Circle Tour</a> (LMCT) except where the various <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a>s run between the main highway and <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>. Additionally, much of the highway from the Indiana–Michigan state line to <a href="Ludington%2C%20Michigan">Ludington</a> is built to <a href="freeway">freeway</a> standards. Two notable exceptions are a short segment along Napier Avenue between the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20Valley%20Parkway">St. Joseph Valley Parkway</a> and <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> near <a href="Benton%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Benton Harbor</a>, and between <a href="Holland%2C%20Michigan">Holland</a> and <a href="Ferrysburg%2C%20Michigan">Ferrysburg</a>. The remainder of US 31 is a two- or four-lane highway with some sections in cities comprising five lanes. The entire length of the highway is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.

US 31 and the St. Joseph Valley Parkway crosses into Michigan from Indiana southwest of <a href="Niles%2C%20Michigan">Niles</a> and parallels the <a href="St.%20Joseph%20River%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">St. Joseph River</a> as the two run northward through southwest Michigan. The freeway passes through farmland before crossing <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US 12</a> at the first of a set of three interchanges located between Niles on the east and <a href="Buchanan%2C%20Michigan">Buchanan</a> on the west. US 31 crosses the river north of the interchange with Niles–Buchanan Road. North of the Walton Road interchange, the freeway turns northwesterly to recross the St. Joseph River near Lake Chapin south of <a href="Berrien%20Springs%2C%20Michigan">Berrien Springs</a>. The parkway curves around the west side of town before crossing the river for a third time. As US 31 continues northward parallel to the river, it enters the eastern fringes of the Benton Harbor–<a href="St.%20Joseph%2C%20Michigan">St. Joseph</a> area. Traffic is forced to exit the freeway at the interchange with Napier Road although the freeway continues northward for less than .

After separating from its freeway, US 31 turns west along Napier Avenue for about before meeting I-94 and merging with it. I-94/US 31 <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">runs concurrently</a> on a northeasterly course through a <a href="partial%20interchange">partial interchange</a> with <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Benton%20Harbor-St.%20Joseph%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-94</a> (BL I-94) before meeting the southern end of <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> in <a href="Benton%20Charter%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Benton Charter Township</a>. At this <a href="trumpet%20interchange">trumpet interchange</a>, I-196/US 31 runs north from I-94 and passes to the west of the <a href="Point%20O%27Woods%20Golf%20%26amp%3B%20Country%20Club">Point O'Woods Golf & Country Club</a>. It continues northward in rural Berrien County through farm fields. The trunkline turns northwesterly near the Lake Michigan Hills Golf Course and crosses the <a href="Paw%20Paw%20River">Paw Paw River</a>. Past the river, the freeway turns northeasterly and runs roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline several miles inland. At the community of Lake Michigan Beach, I-196/US 31 meets the northern terminus of <a href="M-63%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-63</a> at exit 7, and the LMCT joins the freeway for the first time. North of this interchange, the freeway parallels a county road (<a href="A-2%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">A-2</a>, the <a href="Blue%20Star%20Memorial%20Highway">Blue Star Highway</a>) that is the former route of US 31.
Further north, I-196/US 31 crosses into <a href="Van%20Buren%20County%2C%20Michigan">Van Buren County</a> and assumes the Gerald R. Ford Freeway name. The inland side of the freeway is forested while the lakeward side is predominantly either forest or fields. As it approaches South Haven, the freeway passes near the <a href="Palisades%20Nuclear%20Generating%20Station">Palisades Nuclear Generating Station</a> and <a href="Van%20Buren%20State%20Park%20%28Michigan%29">Van Buren State Park</a>. North of the power plant and park, the freeway turns farther inland to bypass the city of South Haven. There is an interchange on the south side of town that provides access to <a href="Interstate%20196%20Business%20%28South%20Haven%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-196</a> and <a href="M-140%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-140</a>. The freeway crosses over <a href="M-43%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-43</a> without an interchange and then intersects the other end of the business loop about later. It crosses the <a href="Black%20River%20%28Southwest%20Michigan%29">Black River</a> near the Van Buren–<a href="Allegan%20County%2C%20Michigan">Allegan</a> county line.

In Allegan County, I-196/US 31 passes a pair of golf courses and continues northward through farm fields. Near the community of <a href="Glenn%2C%20Michigan">Glenn</a>, A-2 crosses over the freeway and runs parallel to it on the east. The two roads trade places again when I-196/US 31 turns northeasterly on the south side of the twin cities of <a href="Saugatuck%2C%20Michigan">Saugatuck</a> and <a href="Douglas%2C%20Michigan">Douglas</a>. The freeway crosses over a section of Kalamazoo Lake, a wider section of the <a href="Kalamazoo%20River">Kalamazoo River</a> that flows between the two towns. A-2 crosses back to the eastern side of the freeway north of Saugatuck, and I-196/US 31 continues north-northeasterly toward Holland.

On the south side of Holland, US 31 and I-196 separate as the Interstate turns northeasterly around the city to continue to <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a>. US 31 follows the <a href="Interstate%20196%20Business%20%28Holland%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-196</a> freeway northward into Holland around the north side of the <a href="West%20Michigan%20Regional%20Airport">West Michigan Regional Airport</a>. The business loop has an interchange for A-2 (Blue Star Highway) and Washington Avenue before the freeway ends in the southern reaches of Holland. The trunkline then runs as a <a href="divided%20highway">divided highway</a> northward, bypassing downtown Holland to the east and intersecting <a href="M-40%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-40</a>. Northeast of downtown Holland, BL I-196 leaves US 31 and the LMCT at an interchange to follow an <a href="limited-access%20highway">expressway</a> along the route of Chicago Drive while US 31 turns northwesterly on its own expressway alignment.

Northwest of Holland, the highway runs as a four-lane expressway and divided highway parallel, but inland from, the Lake Michigan shoreline. This section of US 31 runs through a mix of farm fields and forests as it runs to the community of <a href="Agnew%2C%20Michigan">Agnew</a>. There, US 31 intersects the western end of <a href="M-45%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-45</a> (Lake Michigan Drive) before continuing into the southern end of <a href="Grand%20Haven%2C%20Michigan">Grand Haven</a>. In that city, the highway follows a four-lane <a href="boulevard">boulevard</a> with a grass median. On the northern edge of the city of Grand Haven, US 31 crosses the <a href="Grand%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Grand River</a> on a <a href="bascule%20bridge">bascule bridge</a> that opens about 450–500 times per year. North of the structure, US 31 transitions into a freeway at the interchange with the western end of <a href="M-104%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-104</a> in Ferrysburg. This freeway continues northward through the suburban edges of the <a href="Muskegon%2C%20Michigan">Muskegon</a> area and meets the western end of <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a> near the <a href="Muskegon%20County%20Airport">Muskegon County Airport</a> in <a href="Norton%20Shores%2C%20Michigan">Norton Shores</a>.

At this interchange with I-96, US 31 has its southernmost business loop as <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20Business%20%28Muskegon%2C%20Michigan%29">U.S. Route 31 Business</a> runs westerly and northward into downtown Muskegon. The main freeway continues through the suburban eastern edge of the city through several interchanges, including one with <a href="M-46%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-46</a> (Apple Avenue). Just south of the <a href="Muskegon%20River">Muskegon River</a>, the business loop merges back into the main freeway. US 31 crosses the river and turns northwesterly through forests. The freeway passes to the east of <a href="Michigan%27s%20Adventure">Michigan's Adventure</a>, an amusement park, and crosses the <a href="White%20River%20%28White%20Lake%29">White River</a> near the communities of <a href="Whitehall%2C%20Michigan">Whitehall</a> and <a href="Montague%2C%20Michigan">Montague</a>; a <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20Business%20%28Whitehall%E2%80%93Montague%2C%20Michigan%29">business loop</a> curves off to the west to connect the two communities with the freeway. In this area, US 31 runs through the southern portion of the <a href="Manistee%20National%20Forest">Manistee National Forest</a> as well.
As the freeway continues northward, US 31 intersects the western end of <a href="M-20%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-20</a> in <a href="New%20Era%2C%20Michigan">New Era</a> in <a href="Oceana%20County%2C%20Michigan">Oceana County</a>. The landscape in this area is dominated by forest land as the trunkline crosses the <a href="Hart-Montague%20Trail%20State%20Park">Hart-Montague Trail State Park</a>, a linear state park that follows a bike trail in the area. North of the trail crossing, US 31 has a <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20Business%20%28Hart%2C%20Michigan%29">business spur</a> for <a href="Hart%2C%20Michigan">Hart</a> that runs east into that town; north of this interchange, the freeway crosses the <a href="Pentwater%20River">Pentwater River</a> near the community of <a href="Pentwater%2C%20Michigan">Pentwater</a> which also has its own <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20Business%20%28Pentwater%2C%20Michigan%29">business loop</a>.

North of Pentwater, US 31 crosses into <a href="Mason%20County%2C%20Michigan">Mason County</a> and passes Bass Lake and the <a href="Ludington%20Pumped%20Storage%20Power%20Plant">Ludington Pumped Storage Power Plant</a>, which uses a reservoir next to the freeway to generate electricity. Just north of that reservoir, the freeway turns to the northeast and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20Business%20%28Ludington%2C%20Michigan%29">Ludington's business spur</a> runs off to the northwest. US 31 curves around the east side of Ludington, crossing the <a href="Pere%20Marquette%20River">Pere Marquette River</a>. Due east of downtown, the freeway ends and US 31 turns east to merge with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a>. The concurrent highways follow a four-lane roadway to <a href="Scottville%2C%20Michigan">Scottville</a>. On the west side of that town, US 31 separates from US 10, turning northward to bypass Scottville.

US 31 runs due north through <a href="Northern%20Michigan">Northwest Michigan</a> forest land bypassing <a href="Freesoil%2C%20Michigan">Freesoil</a> to the west. Northwest of that town, the highway crosses the <a href="Big%20Sable%20River">Big Sable River</a> before entering <a href="Manistee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Manistee County</a>. Across the county line, the trunkline runs northwesterly parallel to <a href="Manistee%20Lake">Manistee Lake</a> as US 31 enters <a href="Manistee%2C%20Michigan">Manistee</a>. The highway follows Cypress Street to a drawbridge over the <a href="Manistee%20River">Manistee River</a> and then Cleveland Street on the northern side. As the trunkline rounds the northern shore of Manistee Lake, it passes the <a href="SS%20City%20of%20Milwaukee">SS "City of Milwaukee"</a>, a car ferry preserved as a museum. From there, the highway runs northeasterly, intersecting the western end of <a href="M-55%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-55</a> (Caberfae Highway). Next to the <a href="Little%20River%20Casino">Little River Casino</a>, the highway intersects the southern end of <a href="M-22%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-22</a> (Orchard Highway), and the LMCT separates from US 31.

The highway continues on a northeasterly course running inland along Chippewa Highway to the community of <a href="Bear%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Bear Lake</a>. US 31 rounds the east side of the community's namesake body of water on Lake Street and exits town on Pleasanton Highway. The trunkline continues northward and northeasterly through <a href="Pleasanton%2C%20Michigan">Pleasanton</a> and crosses into <a href="Benzie%20County%2C%20Michigan">Benzie County</a>. Over the county line, it follows Benzie Highway northward to an intersection with <a href="M-115%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-115</a> (Cadillac Highway). The two merge and run north into <a href="Benzonia%2C%20Michigan">Benzonia</a>, following Michigan Avenue in town. Near the south shore of Crystal Lake, M-115 turns westward toward <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Michigan">Frankfort</a> and US 31 follows Michigan Avenue into <a href="Beulah%2C%20Michigan">Beulah</a>, running around the eastern end of the lake. Near the eastern end of Platte Lake, US 31 turns to run easterly into <a href="Honor%2C%20Michigan">Honor</a> before crossing into <a href="Grand%20Traverse%20County%2C%20Michigan">Grand Traverse County</a>.

Across the county line, US 31 continues eastward, passing north of the community of <a href="Interlochen%2C%20Michigan">Interlochen</a>. At <a href="Interlochen%20Corners%2C%20Michigan">Interlochen Corners</a>, it intersects <a href="M-137%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-137</a>. The highway then angles northeasterly north of Duck Lake and south of Silver Lake. A few miles farther east, US 31 meets <a href="M-37%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-37</a> at a location known as <a href="Chums%20Corners%2C%20Michigan">Chums Corners</a>. The two highways join and run northward through the unincorporated community. It passes <a href="Wuerfel%20Park">Wuerfel Park</a>, the home stadium for the <a href="Traverse%20City%20Beach%20Bums">Traverse City Beach Bums</a>, a minor-league baseball team. From there, US 31/M-37 runs downhill into <a href="Garfield%20Township%2C%20Grand%20Traverse%20County%2C%20Michigan">Garfield Township</a>. In this area, the highway passes through a cluster of retail stores and car dealerships near the <a href="Grand%20Traverse%20Mall">Grand Traverse Mall</a>. North of the intersection with 14th Street, the trunkline follows Division Street into <a href="Traverse%20City%2C%20Michigan">Traverse City</a>. From there it runs to the east of Grand Traverse Commons, the former <a href="Traverse%20City%20State%20Hospital">Traverse City State Hospital</a>, before US 31/M-37 meets <a href="Grandview%20Parkway%20%28Michigan%29">Grandview Parkway</a> next to the West Arm of the <a href="Grand%20Traverse%20Bay">Grand Traverse Bay</a>.
At that intersection, the trunkline meets the northern end of M-22, which is running concurrently with <a href="M-72%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-72</a> along the parkway. As US 31/M-37 turns east to run along the bay north of downtown, the highway merges with M-72 and picks up the LMCT again. Grandview Parkway runs between the <a href="Boardman%20River">Boardman River</a> and the bay. Near the mouth of the river, US 31/M-37/M-72 turns to follow Front Street along the remainder of the bay's shoreline. At Garfield Avenue, M-37 turns northward to run up the <a href="Old%20Mission%20Peninsula">Old Mission Peninsula</a>, and US 31/M-72 continues across the base of the peninsula to the East Arm of the Grand Traverse Bay. The highway runs north of the <a href="Cherry%20Capital%20Airport">Cherry Capital Airport</a> near the east arm as it angles southeasterly to <a href="Traverse%20City%20State%20Park">Traverse City State Park</a>. East of the park, the trunkline exits suburban Traverse City and rounds the bay to run northward along its eastern shore. In the community of <a href="Acme%2C%20Michigan">Acme</a>, M-72 turns eastward while US 31 continues north past the <a href="Grand%20Traverse%20Resort%20%26amp%3B%20Spa">Grand Traverse Resort</a>.

About north of Acme, US 31 crosses into <a href="Antrim%20County%2C%20Michigan">Antrim County</a> as it runs between <a href="Elk%20Lake%20%28Michigan%29">Elk Lake</a> and the Grand Traverse Bay. Between towns, the landscape is mostly agricultural lands with mixed patches of forest. A few miles north of the county line, the trunkline passes through <a href="Elk%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Elk Rapids</a> and crosses a channel connecting the Spencer Bay portion of Elk Lake to Lake Michigan. North of this crossing, US 31 continues northeasterly, running on an isthmus between <a href="Torch%20Lake%20%28Antrim%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">Torch Lake</a> and Grand Traverse Bay. The highway passes through <a href="Eastport%2C%20Michigan">Eastport</a> at the northern end of Torch Lake and intersects the western end of <a href="M-88%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-88</a>. Further north, US 31 runs through <a href="Atwood%2C%20Michigan">Atwood</a> and crosses into <a href="Charlevoix%20County%2C%20Michigan">Charlevoix County</a>.

As US 31 curves around to the northeast and east in Charlevoix County, it follows a section of the Lake Michigan shoreline that is not considered to be part of any bay. The highway continues through Northern Michigan agricultural areas to the southeast of <a href="Charlevoix%2C%20Michigan">Charlevoix</a>. Once it enters the city, the trunkline intersects the northern end of <a href="M-66%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-66</a> and follows a series of city streets to a drawbridge over the channel that connects <a href="Lake%20Charlevoix">Lake Charlevoix</a> to Lake Michigan. South of the structure it is Bridge Street, and north of the bridge it is Michigan Avenue. The highway turns eastward to exit town on Petoskey Avenue and follow the Lake Michigan shoreline. Near the community of <a href="Bay%20Shore%2C%20Michigan">Bay Shore</a>, US 31 crosses into <a href="Emmet%20County%2C%20Michigan">Emmet County</a>. The trunkline continues past the <a href="Bay%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Bay Harbor</a> development on Charlevoix Avenue into the city of <a href="Petoskey%2C%20Michigan">Petoskey</a>.

Once in Petoskey, US 31 intersects the northern end of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20131">US 131</a> (Spring Street) and turns northward along Spring Street through downtown. The highway curves around to follow Mitchell Street to cross the <a href="Bear%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Bear River</a> and then follow Bay View Road. US 31 runs along the <a href="Little%20Traverse%20Bay">Little Traverse Bay</a> through the eastern end of Petoskey and into <a href="Bay%20View%2C%20Michigan">Bay View</a>. From there, it intersects the southern end of <a href="M-119%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-119</a> and passes through a pair of small towns, <a href="Conway%2C%20Michigan">Conway</a> and <a href="Oden%2C%20Michigan">Oden</a>, that border inland lakes like Round Lake and various bays of <a href="Crooked%20Lake%20%28Michigan%29">Crooked Lake</a>.
North of Oden, US 31 runs through <a href="Ponshewaing%2C%20Michigan">Ponshewaing</a> before entering the village of <a href="Alanson%2C%20Michigan">Alanson</a>. There the highway intersects the western end of <a href="M-68%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-68</a> and runs parallel to the Crooked River, part of the <a href="Inland%20Waterway%20%28Michigan%29">Inland Waterway</a>. North of town, US 31 runs through the town of <a href="Brutus%2C%20Michigan">Brutus</a> before entering <a href="Pellston%2C%20Michigan">Pellston</a>. The highway runs past the <a href="Pellston%20Regional%20Airport">Pellston Regional Airport</a> and continues due north to <a href="Levering%2C%20Michigan">Levering</a>. From there, US 31 turns northwesterly and then northeasterly on Mackinaw Highway to round <a href="Lake%20Paradise%20%28Michigan%29">Lake Paradise</a> in the community of <a href="Carp%20Lake%2C%20Michigan">Carp Lake</a>. North of the lake, US 31 follows a limited-access highway into <a href="Cheboygan%20County%2C%20Michigan">Cheboygan County</a>. Less than east of the county line, US 31 connects to <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> in a partial interchange. At this interchange, northbound traffic defaults onto northbound I-75 and US 31 terminates.

The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Indian</a> trails. Only one of these followed part of the path of US 31; the <a href="Mackinac%20Trail">Mackinac Trail</a> roughly paralleled the route of US 31 from Petoskey northward.

In the age of the <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a>, the roads that later formed US 31 through Michigan were given a few different highway names. The West Michigan Lake Shore Highway Association was founded on January 10, 1912, and the group reorganized on May 30, 1913, as the West Michigan Pike Association. Their auto trail was marked by a series of concrete markers tall along the roadway from the Indiana state line northward to Mackinaw City.

The highway was also a part of the Western Mainline of the <a href="Dixie%20Highway">Dixie Highway</a> in Michigan, another auto trail that was built starting in 1915. In 1916, the northern junction between the West Michigan Pike and the East Michigan Pike, which served as the connection for the two mainlines of the Dixie Highway in Michigan in Mackinaw City, was marked with a stone monument at the junction of Central Avenue and Huron Street. By the middle of 1921, the trail used about of roadways along its western branch parallel to Lake Michigan. Michigan led all other states in the Dixie Highway Association by 1922 at improvements to its sections of the roadway.

The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">State Trunkline Highway System</a> was created on May 13, 1913, by an act of the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a>; at the time, one of the system's divisions corresponded to US 31. Division 5 followed a course from Niles northward to Mackinaw City. In 1919, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) signposted the highway system for the first time, and the future US 31 corridor was assigned two numbers. From the state line north through Niles to St. Joseph, it carried the original <a href="M-58%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-58</a> designation and from there northward it was the original <a href="M-11%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-11</a>.

The <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20Officials">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> (AASHO) approved the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> on November 11, 1926, and the MSHD designated US 31 in Michigan according to AASHO's plan to run northward from the Indiana state line and along the Lake Michigan shoreline to Mackinaw City. A section in the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area overlapped <a href="U.S.%20Route%2012%20in%20Michigan">US 12</a> and the modern concurrency with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2010%20in%20Michigan">US 10</a> was also in place. By the end of the next year, the highway was extended across the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a> on the state car ferries to connect to <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a> in the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula">Upper Peninsula</a> north of <a href="St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan">St. Ignace</a>. In 1930, Muskegon was bypassed; the new highway east of downtown was numbered US 31A.
By the end of 1936, the last section of US 31 in the state was paved near Charlevoix, making the entire highway in Michigan a hard-surfaced road. Early the next year, the route of US 2 was realigned to run into St. Ignace; after the change, US 2 and US 31 ran concurrently. Later that year, a set of curves were straightened out south of Ludington and the routes of US 31 and a US 31A between Saugatuck and Holland were switched, and US 31 was realigned to bypass downtown Ludington.

In 1938, the southern end of US 31 was given a second designation when <a href="U.S.%20Route%2033%20in%20Michigan">US 33</a> was extended into the state from Indiana to terminate in St. Joseph. Later that year, the US 31A in the Holland area was decommissioned. The next year, the US 31 concurrency was removed from US 2 in the Upper Peninsula and the former highway no longer crossed the Straits of Mackinac, terminating instead in Mackinaw City. By the early 1940, the Muskegon Bypass was given the US 31 designation, and the route downtown was redesignated US 31A.

During World War II, a bypass of downtown South Haven was built; the former route of US 31 through the heart of the city was designated Bus. US 31 at that time. After the war, the route of US 31 north of Charlevoix was realigned to follow the shoreline; this section opened by the middle of 1949. The route of the highway between Holland and West Olive was changed to run on a more angular course northwesterly in 1950. A few years later, a bypass to the south and east of Holland opened and the former route through down was redesignated as a business loop in 1954.

On November 1, 1957, the <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a> opened to traffic. For the opening of the bridge, the highways coming into Mackinaw City from the south were realigned to connect to it; US 31 terminated at the southern approach to the Mackinac Bridge. In November 1960, sections of I-75's freeway opened from Indian River north to the southern Mackinac Bridge approaches, and US 31 was rerouted to follow segments of that freeway from the current northern terminus south of Mackinaw City northward. By the end of the decade, another freeway segment opened along the Muskegon Bypass as well. The next year, US 33 was extended northward along US 31 from St. Joseph for about .

In 1962, a section of freeway along US 31 was opened between <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> and the Berrien–Van Buren county line. This section was originally designated as part of <a href="Interstate%2096">I-96</a>/US 31; the former route near the lakeshore became just US 33. The MSHD petitioned federal highway officials to switch the Interstate designations west of Grand Rapids, reversing the I-96 and <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> numbers to their current configurations. After the designation switch was approved in 1963, an additional was opened from the northern end of the freeway near Benton Harbor to Holland as I-196/US 31. The freeway was also extended northward from Muskegon to the Muskegon–Oceana county line north of Montague in 1963.

When I-196 was completed between Holland and Grandville in 1974, the BL I-196 designation was applied along US 31 and Bus. US 31. The next year, the US 31 freeway was extended northward into Oceana County to New Era. In 1976, this freeway was lengthened further to Hart. The section of I-196/US 31 in all but Berrien County was dedicated as the "Gerald R. Ford Freeway" in July 1978. Also that year, the US 31 freeway was extended to the southern side of Pentwater.
At the end of the 1970s and into the early 1990s, US 31 gained additional freeway segments on both ends of the highway. The first section of the St. Joseph Valley Parkway was completed in 1979 and ran from the Indiana state line north to US 12. The freeway was extended northward from Pentwater to the Oceana–Mason county line in 1980. Construction of the Niles Bypass was finished in 1987, bringing the parkway north to Walton Road northwest of Niles. <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20Business%20%28Niles%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. US 31</a> was created along the former routing in Niles. The northern freeway was extended further into Mason County in two stages. In 1989, it was expanded to the south side of Ludington. The next year, Ludington was bypassed, completing the freeway to its current northern end at US 10 east of town. One more bypass, this time a non-freeway routing to the west of Scottville, opened in 1991. The Berrien Springs Bypass was completed in late 1992. Since then, MDOT built a freeway segment north from Berrien Springs to Napier Avenue that was opened on August 27, 2003, at a cost of $97 million (equivalent to $ in ). The last change to the routing of US 31 occurred in August 2004 when the route of Bus. US 31 in Holland was turned back to local control; BL I-196 was rerouted to follow US 31 around downtown instead of following the former business loop through it.

Starting in 1996, <a href="Traverse%20City%2C%20Michigan">Traverse City</a>-area residents and tourists requested a freeway bypass the city. These residents decided to not build the highway. In 2001, The idea was revived, but MDOT abandoned these plans in June of that year.

The MSHD started studies for a freeway routing of US 31 from the state line northward to I-94 in 1967. The first section northward to Niles was approved in 1972, and the remainder of the route was approved in 1981. Since then, MDOT re-evaluated the St. Joseph Valley Parkway extension east of Benton Harbor, due to environmental, economic, and historical site issues. One of the environmental concerns that was studied relates to the habitat of an endangered species, the <a href="Mitchell%27s%20satyr">Mitchell's satyr</a> butterfly, which has its habitat in the area of the proposed freeway. The habitat is home to the second-largest population of the rare butterfly. The freeway between Niles and Benton Harbor was planned as a series of five segments when approved in 1981. Since that approval, the butterfly was discovered in the Blue Creek Fen in the late 1980s, and it was listed as an endangered species in 1992. This listing stalled MDOT's planning and construction of the fifth freeway segment north of Berrien Springs. The <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">United States Fish and Wildlife Service</a> (USFWS) issued an opinion two years later that the project would jeopardize the species. MDOT was given permission to modify the previously approved freeway to cross the Blue Creek on longer bridges; the USFWS also required that any construction be done from elevated platforms, among other restrictions. In the interim, MDOT proceeded with construction of the southern portion of the last freeway segment, completing it northward from Berrien Springs to the Napier Avenue interchange in August 2003.

A revised environmental impact study to account for the butterfly's habitat in the northern area of the freeway was approved in 2004. The study compared the original routing for this extension that involved connecting directly to <a href="Interstate%20196">I-196</a> at <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> with an alternate route that involved an indirection connection via the <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Benton%20Harbor-St.%20Joseph%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I-94</a> interchange and an I-94 concurrency near Benton Harbor. The study recommended using a version of the alternate connection to avoid the Blue Creek Fen, both to save money and decrease impact to the Mitchell's satyr. At the time the freeway segment opened in 2003, MDOT expected the remaining segment would not take much longer to complete, but since then, funding has not been available. MDOT did not include construction of the extension for this reason in the department's 2014–18 highway projects plan released in 2013, although most of the design work and land acquisition has been completed. Until the missing freeway segment is built, US 31 follows a stretch of Napier Avenue, which was upgraded in conjunction with the St. Joseph Valley Parkway opening to that point, westward to I-94. The US 31/I-94/BL I-94 interchange will be converted to a <a href="cloverleaf%20interchange">cloverleaf interchange</a> and additional lanes will be added to I-94 as well. The St. Joseph Valley Parkway name has already been applied to this unbuilt section. MDOT's 2017–21 plan draft released in July 2016 split the remaining work into three phases. The department has listed funding for only the first two of these three phases, and construction is anticipated to start in 2021.

On December 6, 2018, MDOT announced that a $20 million discretionary grant had been received to complete the final phase of construction, building the last of freeway required to connect US 31 to I-94.

, travelers had to use either US 31 through Grand Haven or 68th Avenue through <a href="Eastmanville%2C%20Michigan">Eastmanville</a> to cross the Grand River in Ottawa County. A new highway, part of a long-range plan to build a US 31 bypass of Grand Haven, provides a river crossing almost equidistant between the two, greatly reducing drive times between areas north and south of the river. A drive from Nunica to Robinson is a trip; the new highway provides a route closer to in length. Called M-231, this highway is a scaled-down bypass of US 31 through Grand Haven, even though it will not physically connect to US 31. By January 4, 2013, MDOT had completed work for this highway, including a bridge over North Cedar Drive, additional ramps at the I-96 and M-104 interchange, and reconstruction and widening of M-104 near I-96. The department had also completed a reconfiguration of the intersection between M-104 and Cleveland Drive and widening the bridge that carries M-104 over I-96. The expected date of completion for M-231 was set for sometime in 2016 pending funding availability. MDOT planned to build of the new highway starting in 2013, including the bridges over the Grand River and Little Robinson Creek. The 2005 <a href="SAFETEA-LU">SAFETEA-LU</a> transportation bill provided funding earmarked for the project by US Representative <a href="Pete%20Hoekstra">Pete Hoekstra</a> from <a href="Holland%2C%20Michigan">Holland</a> as well as matching funds from the state's Michigan Jobs Today program. The total cost of the project was expected to be near $150 million. On October 30, 2015, the highway opened to traffic.

The sections of the route of US 31 in Michigan has been dedicated several times to various organizations. The route of US 33 in the state, which at the time was concurrent with US 31, was dedicated as the Blue & Gray Trail in 1938 to honor veterans of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. The Blue Star Memorial Highway designation was applied to the highway to honor those serving in the military. The designation was dedicated on October 10, 1948 by the State Highway Commissioner <a href="Charles%20Ziegler">Charles Ziegler</a>.

In 1917, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau created a tourist route that is a predecessor of the modern <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Circle%20Tour">Great Lakes Circle Tour</a>s (GLCT). The Great Lakes Automobile Route was a series of roads on both the Upper and Lower peninsulas of Michigan. It included US 31 between Manistee and the Benton Harbor–St. Joseph area. The concept did not last a year; the <a href="American%20entry%20into%20World%20War%20I">American entry into World War I</a> and a lack of focus on a single route consigned the idea into obscurity. The idea of a tourist route around the Great Lakes was revived in 1986 as a pet project of Michigan First Lady <a href="Paula%20Blanchard">Paula Blanchard</a>. MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Ontario created the GLCT scheme which includes the LMCT that follows US 31 from Lake Michigan Beach northward to Manistee and from Traverse City north to the terminus near Mackinaw City excluding locations where business loops run closer to the lake at <a href="South%20Haven%2C%20Michigan">South Haven</a>, <a href="Muskegon%2C%20Michigan">Muskegon</a>, <a href="Whitehall%2C%20Michigan">Whitehall</a>–<a href="Montague%2C%20Michigan">Montague</a> and <a href="Pentwater%2C%20Michigan">Pentwater</a>.

A group of area residents initiated an effort to have the former West Michigan Pike designated what is now called a <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a>. The designation would prioritize the area for historic preservation grants. A Preserve America grant funded a survey from June 2007 through September 2010, the results of which were a set of reports through the Michigan State Historic Preservation Office on the historical nature of the West Michigan Pike. In 2011, the group was in the process of securing resolutions from municipalities along the highway in support of the designation. According to officials working on the byway, it can take up to seven years to complete the process. The initial proposals had the byway continuing to Mackinaw City, but as approved in 2016, it runs from <a href="New%20Buffalo%2C%20Michigan">New Buffalo</a> on <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> to Ludington, following US 31 except between business loops at South Haven, Muskegon, Whitehall–Montague and Pentwater.

MDOT maintains a listing of the historic bridges in the state; along US 31, the department has listed four structures. In downtown <a href="Charlevoix%2C%20Michigan">Charlevoix</a>, the <a href="US-31%E2%80%93Island%20Lake%20Outlet%20Bridge">US-31–Island Lake Outlet Bridge</a> carries the highway over a channel dredged between Lake Michigan and Round Lake that also connects to <a href="Lake%20Charlevoix">Lake Charlevoix</a>. Built from 1947 through 1949, it is the fifth bridge at the location. It is a double-leaf <a href="bascule%20bridge">bascule bridge</a>. In <a href="Petoskey%2C%20Michigan">Petoskey</a>, the highway crosses Bear Creek on a concrete girder bridge built in 1930. At in length, it is the fourth longest such bridge in Michigan. In <a href="Manistee%2C%20Michigan">Manistee</a>, the <a href="Manistee%20River">Manistee River</a> is spanned by a double-leaf bascule bridge built in 1933. North of <a href="Hart%2C%20Michigan">Hart</a> in <a href="Pentwater%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Pentwater Township</a>, the <a href="US%2031%E2%80%93Pentwater%20River%20Bridge">US 31–Pentwater River Bridge</a> is a long-span steel bridge that crosses the <a href="Pentwater%20River">Pentwater River</a>. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on December 20, 1999. It carries Oceana Drive along a former routing of US 31.

Frank Berryman

<a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">Lieutenant General</a> Sir Frank Horton Berryman, (11 April 1894 – 28 May 1981) was an <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a> officer who served as a general during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The son of an <a href="Railroad%20engineer">engine driver</a>, he entered <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Duntroon</a> in 1913. His class graduated early after the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> broke out, and he served on the <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Western Front</a> with the <a href="field%20artillery">field artillery</a>. After the war, he spent nearly twenty years as a major.

Berryman joined the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) on 4 April 1940 with the rank of full <a href="colonel">colonel</a>, and became General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a>. He was responsible for the staff work for the attacks on <a href="Bardia%2C%20Libya">Bardia</a> and <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a>. In January 1941, Berryman became <a href="Commander%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">Commander, Royal Artillery</a>, <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a>, and was promoted to <a href="brigadier">brigadier</a>. During the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20campaign">Syria-Lebanon campaign</a>, he commanded "Berryforce". He returned to Australia in 1942, becoming Major General, General Staff, of the <a href="First%20Army%20%28Australia%29">First Army</a>. Later that year, he became Deputy <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> under the Commander in Chief, <a href="General%20%28Australia%29">General</a> Sir <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>, who brought him up to <a href="Port%20Moresby">Port Moresby</a> to simultaneously act as chief of staff of <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a>. Berryman was intimately involved with the planning and execution of the <a href="Salamaua-Lae%20campaign">Salamaua-Lae campaign</a> and the <a href="Huon%20Peninsula%20campaign">Huon Peninsula campaign</a>. In November 1943 he became acting commander of <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a>, which he led in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sio">Battle of Sio</a>. In the final part of the war, he was Blamey's representative at <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">General of the Army</a> Douglas MacArthur's headquarters and the Australian Army representative at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay.

After the war, Berryman commanded Eastern Command. He directed the military response to the <a href="1949%20Australian%20coal%20strike">1949 Australian coal strike</a>. Berryman hoped to become Chief of the General Staff but was passed over as he was seen as a "Blamey man" by <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Ben%20Chifley">Ben Chifley</a>. He retired and became the Director General of the <a href="Royal%20visits%20to%20Australia">Royal Tour</a> of Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a> in 1954. He was Chief Executive Officer of the <a href="Royal%20Agricultural%20Society%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales</a> from 1954 to 1961.

Frank Horton Berryman was born in <a href="Geelong%2C%20Victoria">Geelong, Victoria</a>, on 11 April 1894, the fourth of six children and the eldest of three sons of William Lee Berryman, a <a href="Victorian%20Railways">Victorian Railways</a> <a href="Railroad%20engineer">engine driver</a>, and his wife, Annie Jane, née Horton. William Berryman joined in the 1903 Victorian Railways strike and, when it failed, was reinstated with a 14 per cent pay cut, only regaining his 1903 pay level in 1916. Frank was educated at <a href="Melbourne%20High%20School%20%28Victoria%29">Melbourne High School</a>, where he served in the school <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">Cadet Unit</a>, and won the Rix prize for academic excellence. On graduation, he took a job with the Victorian railways as a junior <a href="Technical%20drawing">draughtsman</a>.

In 1913, Berryman entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, having ranked first among the 154 candidates on the entrance examination. Of the 33 members in his class, nine died in the First World War, and six later became generals: <a href="Leslie%20Beavis">Leslie Beavis</a>, Berryman, <a href="William%20Bridgeford">William Bridgeford</a>, <a href="John%20Austin%20Chapman">John Chapman</a>, <a href="Edward%20James%20Milford">Edward Milford</a> and <a href="George%20Alan%20Vasey">Alan Vasey</a>. Berryman rose to fifth in order of merit before his class graduated early, in June 1915, because of the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>.

Berryman's Duntroon class had not yet completed its military training. <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">Major General</a> <a href="William%20Throsby%20Bridges">William Throsby Bridges</a> decided that regimental duty would rectify that deficiency, so he assigned the Duntroon cadets as regimental officers of the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">First Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF), rather than as staff officers. Cadets were given the choice of service in the <a href="infantry">infantry</a> or <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">light horse</a>. One cadet, <a href="Lawrence%20Wackett">Lawrence Wackett</a>, protested that he wished to serve in the technical services. When asked if they would prefer the technical services, twelve cadets, including Berryman, Beavis, Clowes, Vasey, and Wackett stepped forward. Berryman was commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the Permanent Military Forces (PMF) on 29 June 1915 and again in the First AIF on 1 July 1915. He was posted to <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> <a href="Harold%20William%20Grimwade">Harold Grimwade</a>'s 4th Field Artillery Brigade of the <a href="Australian%202nd%20Division%20%28World%20War%20I%29">2nd Division</a> Artillery, along with Vasey and Milford. Berryman embarked for Egypt with the 4th Field Artillery Brigade on the transport "Wiltshire" on 17 November 1915. In Egypt, Berryman briefly commanded the 4th Brigade Ammunition Column before it was absorbed into the 2nd Division Ammunition Column.

The 2nd Division moved to France in March 1916. Berryman became a temporary <a href="captain%20%28OF-2%29">captain</a> on 1 April 1916, a rank which became substantive on 10 June 1916. In January 1917, he was posted to the <a href="7th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">7th Infantry Brigade</a> as a trainee staff captain. During the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arras%20%281917%29">Second Battle of Bullecourt</a> he served with 2nd Division headquarters. He was appointed to command the 18th Field Artillery Battery, and became a temporary <a href="major">major</a> on 1 September 1917, which became substantive on 10 September 1917. This was as far as he could go, for Duntroon graduates could not be promoted above major in the AIF. This policy was aimed at giving them a broad range of experience, which would benefit the Army, while not allowing them to outnumber the available post-war positions.

While commanding the 18th Field Battery, he saw action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Passchendaele">Battle of Passchendaele</a>. For his service as a <a href="Artillery%20battery">battery</a> commander in this battle, he received a <a href="Mention%20in%20Despatches">Mention in Despatches</a>: 
In September 1918, he was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>. His citation, signed by Major General <a href="Charles%20Rosenthal">Charles Rosenthal</a>, read: 

Berryman was later nominated for a <a href="medal%20bar">bar</a> to his Distinguished Service Order for the September 1918 fighting, but this was subsequently downgraded to a second Mention in Despatches. He was wounded in the right eye in September 1918 while he was commanding the 14th Field Artillery Battery. Although his wound was serious enough to warrant hospitalisation, there was no permanent damage to his vision. However, it was the end of his career as a battery commander, as the Army took the opportunity to transfer him to a staff post. From 28 October 1918 to 1 July 1919, he was <a href="Brigade%20Major">Brigade Major</a> of the 7th Infantry Brigade. With the war over, he returned to Australia in October 1919.

Berryman was appointed to the <a href="Australian%20Staff%20Corps">Staff Corps</a> on 1 October 1920. Although he was entitled to keep his AIF rank of major as an honorary rank, his substantive rank—and pay grade—was still lieutenant. Promotion was painfully slow. He was promoted to captain and <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> major on 1 March 1923, but was not promoted to the substantive rank of major until 1 March 1935.

Berryman attended the <a href="Royal%20Military%20Academy%2C%20Woolwich">Royal Military Academy, Woolwich</a>, from 1920 to 1923. On returning to Australia, he became an inspecting ordnance officer at the 2nd Military District. From its headquarters at <a href="Victoria%20Barracks%2C%20Sydney">Victoria Barracks, Sydney</a>, the 2nd Military District administered the Army in most of New South Wales. He enrolled in a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> program at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>. On 30 November 1925, he married Muriel Whipp. They eventually had a daughter and a son.

Berryman discontinued his university studies to prepare for the entrance examination for <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a>. Eighteen Australian Army officers sat the exam that year, but only Berryman and one other officer passed. Only two Australian officers were accepted into staff college each year, so Berryman's attendance from 1926 to 1928 marked him out as one of the Australian Army's rising talents. It also allowed him to forge useful contacts with the British Army. Berryman later recalled, "The advantage of this was that in war we had the same doctrine of tactics and administration, which was essential if we had to work together. More than that, the officers who had to carry out their duties in cooperation knew each other personally." After graduation he was posted to the <a href="High%20Commission%20of%20Australia%2C%20London">High Commission of Australia, London</a>, from 1929 to 1932, where he served under the Military Liaison Officer, Major General <a href="Julius%20Bruche">Julius Bruche</a>.

After nearly twenty years as a major, Berryman was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel on 12 May 1935. Promotion to substantive rank, which carried the rank's pay as well as status, occurred on 1 July 1938, when he became Assistant Director of Military Operations at Army Headquarters. From December 1938 to April 1940 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of the <a href="Australian%203rd%20Division%20%28World%20War%20II%29">3rd Division</a>. The slow rate of promotion of regular officers in the inter-war years fostered a sense of injustice and frustration among officers with good war records who found themselves outranked by <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Militia</a> officers who had enjoyed faster promotion.

The final straw for many regular officers was <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a>' announcement that all commands in the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second AIF</a> would go to Militia officers, which Berryman considered "a damn insult to the professional soldier, calculated to split the Army down the centre. We were to be the hewers of wood and the drawers of water. We, the only people who really knew the job, were to assist these Militia fellows."

Berryman joined the Second AIF on 4 April 1940 with the rank of full <a href="colonel">colonel</a>, receiving the AIF serial number of VX20308, and became General Staff Officer Grade 1 (GSO1) of Major General <a href="Iven%20Mackay">Iven Mackay</a>'s <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a>, in succession to <a href="Sydney%20Rowell">Sydney Rowell</a> who stepped up to become chief of staff of <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>. Berryman soon established a good working relationship with Mackay. Despite the friction between Militia and Staff Corps officers, Berryman chose to assess officers on performance. This meant that while Berryman viewed some Militia officers, like Brigadier <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a> of the 17th Infantry Brigade, with disdain, he maintained good relations with others. There were also personal and professional rivalries with other Staff Corps officers, such as Alan Vasey. Yet even those who disliked Berryman personally for his lack of patience and tact and referred to him as "Berry the Bastard" respected his abilities as a staff officer.

Mackay and Berryman were determined that the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bardia">Battle of Bardia</a> would not be a repeat of the disastrous <a href="landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">landing at Anzac Cove</a> in 1915. Berryman's talent for operational staff work came to the fore. From studies of aerial photographs, he selected a spot for the attack where the terrain was most favourable. His plan provided for the coordination of infantry, armour and artillery. While at times he proved secretive and hard to deal with, during the battle his forceful personality provided a good foil to the sometimes indecisive Mackay. Later that month Berryman planned the equally successful <a href="Battle%20of%20Tobruk%20%281941%29">Battle of Tobruk</a>. For his services in this campaign, he was made a Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE).

In January 1941, Berryman became <a href="Commander%2C%20Royal%20Artillery">Commander, Royal Artillery</a>, in <a href="Arthur%20Samuel%20Allen">Arthur "Tubby" Allen</a>'s <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a>, and was promoted to <a href="brigadier">brigadier</a>. During the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20campaign">Syria-Lebanon campaign</a>, Berryman demonstrated that he was a thrusting commander who led from the front and repeatedly demonstrated his coolness under fire. When his headquarters came under shell fire for the first time, Berryman sat calmly eating his breakfast "among the flying brick dust and bursting shells", simply telling the men to shut the door, "so they can eat breakfast without being covered in dust".
During the <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> counterattack, Berryman was given command of the Australian forces in the centre of the position around Merdjayoun. This scratch force became known as "Berryforce". His mission was to check the enemy advance in the Merdjayoun area. Berryman decided that the best way to do this would be to recapture Merdjayoun. This presented considerable difficulty, for although his force contained two infantry battalions, the <a href="2/25th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/25th</a> and <a href="2/33rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/33rd</a>, and a <a href="Pioneer%20%28military%29">pioneer</a> battalion, the 2/2nd, his headquarters was not equipped to control a battle in the manner of an infantry brigade, as it lacked appropriate staff and communications. Moreover, while he was supported by mechanised cavalry and 22 artillery pieces, the opposing French forces had tanks.

For the next two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce attempted to retake the strategically important town in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Merdjayoun">Battle of Merdjayoun</a>. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the <a href="French%20Foreign%20Legion">French Foreign Legion</a> and tanks. Berryman then tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.

The 7th Division was now concentrated in the coastal sector. Berryman clashed with Brigadier <a href="Jack%20Stevens">Jack Stevens</a> of the <a href="21st%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">21st Infantry Brigade</a> over the siting of Berryman's artillery observation posts, which were forward of the infantry's front lines. Berryman wanted Stevens' positions advanced so as to obtain effective observation of the enemy's lines for Berryman's gunners. Stevens refused, hampering Berryman's efforts to support him in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Damour">Battle of Damour</a>. Despite this, Berryman implemented an effective artillery plan. In the final stage of the battle, Berryman, without authority, ordered Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Denzil%20MacArthur-Onslow">Denzil MacArthur-Onslow</a> of the <a href="2/6th%20Cavalry%20Commando%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">2/6th Cavalry Regiment</a> to pursue the retreating French forces, but was overruled by Savige and Allen. For his part in the campaign, Berryman received a third Mention in Despatches.

On 3 August 1941, Berryman became Brigadier, General Staff (chief of staff) of I Corps under Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Lavarack">John Lavarack</a>, again in succession to Rowell, who became <a href="Deputy%20Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Deputy Chief of the General Staff</a> (DCGS). Berryman arrived in <a href="Jakarta">Jakarta</a> by air with the advanced party of the I Corps headquarters staff on 26 January 1942 to plan its defence. Berryman reconnoitred Java and prepared an appreciation of the situation. Berryman also attempted to find out as much as possible about Japanese tactics through interviewing Colonel <a href="Ian%20MacAlister%20Stewart">Ian MacAlister Stewart</a>. This information found its way into papers circulated throughout the Army in Australia. It soon became apparent that the situation was hopeless and any troops committed to the defence of <a href="Java">Java</a> would be lost.

Berryman returned to Australia, where he was promoted to major general on 6 April 1942, when he became Major General, General Staff (chief of staff) of Lavarack's <a href="First%20Army%20%28Australia%29">First Army</a>. On 14 September 1942, Berryman became DCGS under the Commander in Chief, General Sir <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a>, in succession to Vasey. When <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a> split into a rear headquarters under Blamey and an advanced headquarters under Lieutenant General <a href="Edmund%20Herring">Edmund Herring</a>, so the latter could go forward to direct the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buna-Gona">Battle of Buna-Gona</a>, Blamey brought Berryman up from Advanced LHQ in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> to simultaneously act as chief of staff of New Guinea Force from 11 December 1942. Berryman formed a very close professional and personal relationship with Blamey, and henceforth Berryman would be Blamey's chief of staff and head of operational planning, which made him "one of the most important officers in the Australian Army in its struggle against the Japanese."

Blamey and Berryman remained close for the rest of the war, and Blamey came to rely heavily on Berryman for advice. It was Berryman who was sent to <a href="Wau%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wau</a> to investigate the difficulties that Savige was having, and it was Berryman who exonerated Savige. "I reported the situation [to Blamey and Herring]," Berryman record in his diary, "and said Savige had done well and we had misjudged him." Berryman was intimately involved with the planning of the <a href="Salamaua-Lae%20campaign">Salamaua-Lae campaign</a>, working closely with Brigadier General <a href="Stephen%20J.%20Chamberlin">Stephen J. Chamberlin</a> at General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>'s General Headquarters (GHQ) in Brisbane. Berryman established good working relations with the Americans, even though their staff practices were quite different from those of the Australian Army.

Berryman was also involved in the plan's execution, once more becoming chief of staff at New Guinea Force under Blamey in August 1943. Berryman was frustrated at the failure of Vasey's 7th Division to destroy the Japanese retreating from <a href="Lae">Lae</a>, and personally annoyed by the way that Vasey forwarded compliments to Major General <a href="Ennis%20Whitehead">Ennis Whitehead</a> while leaving any complaints about air support to be taken up by Berryman. Berryman was next involved with the planning for the landing at <a href="Battle%20of%20Finschhafen">Finschhafen</a>, brokering a compromise landing plan between Rear Admiral <a href="Daniel%20E.%20Barbey">Daniel E. Barbey</a> and Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring. When Berryman discovered that the <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">United States Seventh Fleet</a> did not intend to reinforce the <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Division</a> he immediately went to Blamey, who took the matter up with MacArthur. However, it was Berryman who brokered a compromise deal with <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Arthur%20S.%20Carpender">Arthur S. Carpender</a> to reinforce Finschhafen with a battalion in <a href="High%20speed%20transport">APDs</a>.

On 7 November 1943, Berryman became acting commander of <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a>, a post which became permanent on 20 January 1944, superseding Vasey, whose <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a> was diplomatically placed directly under Lieutenant General <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Sir Leslie Morshead's</a> New Guinea Force. II Corps was left with the <a href="5th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">5th</a> and 9th Divisions. Berryman was promoted to lieutenant general on 20 January 1944. As in Syria, Berryman proved a hard-driving commander. In December 1943, II Corps broke out of the position around Finschhafen and began a pursuit along the coast. Whenever the Japanese Army attempted to make a stand, Berryman attacked with <a href="Ordnance%20QF%2025%20pounder">25-pounder</a> artillery barrages and <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda tanks</a>. Berryman was aware that seasonal changes were making the surf rougher and making it ever harder to operate the US Army <a href="landing%20craft">landing craft</a> (<a href="Landing%20Craft%20Mechanized">LCMs</a>) and Australian Army amphibious trucks (<a href="DUKW">DUKW</a>s) that he depended on for the logistical support of his troops, but he realised that the Japanese Army's supply difficulties were greater than his own, and he gambled that if he pushed hard enough the Japanese would be unable to regroup and organise a successful defence.
In the first phase of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sio">Battle of Sio</a>, the advance from Finschhafen to Sio, 3,099 Japanese dead were counted and 38 prisoners taken, at a cost of 8 Australians killed and 48 wounded. In the 5th Division's subsequent drive from Sio to link up with the <a href="32nd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">US 32nd Infantry Division</a> at Saidor, 734 Japanese were killed and 1,775 found dead, while 48 prisoners were taken. Australian casualties came to 4 killed and 6 wounded. MacArthur considered Berryman's performance "quite brilliant". For his part in the campaign, Berryman was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) on 8 March 1945.

II Corps was renumbered I Corps on 13 April 1944 and returned to Australia, where Blamey gave Berryman his next assignment. In preparation for the <a href="Philippines%20campaign%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29">Philippines Campaign</a>, General MacArthur moved the advanced element of GHQ to <a href="Jayapura%2C%20Indonesia">Hollandia</a> in Dutch West Papua, where it opened in late August 1944. To maintain contact with GHQ, Blamey formed a new headquarters, Forward Echelon LHQ, which opened at Hollandia on 7 September under Berryman, who became Blamey's personal representative at GHQ. Forward Echelon LHQ subsequently moved with GHQ to Leyte in February 1945, and Manila in April 1945. Berryman's role was to "safeguard Australian interests" at GHQ, but he also defended GHQ against criticism from the Australian Army. As well as liaising with GHQ, Forward Echelon LHQ became responsible for planning operations involving Australian troops. It worked on plans for operations on <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a> and <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a> before it was finally decided that <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> would be the Australian Army's next objective. In all of this Berrymen kept in close contact with Blamey, and the two were Australian Army representatives at the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay in September 1945. For his services in the final campaigns, Berryman received a fourth and final Mention in Despatches on 6 March 1947.

After the war, Berryman took charge of Eastern Command, an appointment he held from March 1946 until his retirement at age 60 in April 1954. Berryman became known for his involvement in charitable organisations such as the War Widows Association, and as head of the Remembrance Drive Project. For this and his commitment to beautifying the Army barracks, Berryman became colloquially known in the Army as "Frank the Florist".

In June 1949, the country was rocked by the <a href="1949%20Australian%20coal%20strike">1949 Australian coal strike</a>. The strike began when stocks of coal were already low, especially in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, and rationing was introduced. Prime Minister <a href="Ben%20Chifley">Ben Chifley</a> turned to the Army to get the troops to mine coal. This became possible when the transport unions agreed to transport coal that was mined. Responsibility for planning and organising the effort fell to Berryman. Soldiers began mining at <a href="Muswellbrook">Muswellbrook</a> and <a href="Lithgow">Lithgow</a> on 1 August, and by 15 August, when the strike ended, some 4,000 soldiers and airmen were employed. They continued work until production was fully restored.

Berryman hoped to become Chief of the General Staff in succession to Lieutenant General <a href="Vernon%20Sturdee">Vernon Sturdee</a> but he was seen as a "Blamey man" by Chifley and his <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor</a> government colleagues, who disliked the former Commander-in-Chief. The job was instead given to Rowell. The United States government awarded Berryman the <a href="Medal%20of%20Freedom%20%281945%29">Medal of Freedom</a> with Silver Palm in 1948. Following the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201949">change of government in 1949</a>, Berryman lobbied <a href="Eric%20Harrison">Sir Eric Harrison</a>, the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal</a> <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister for Defence Production</a>, for the job on the retirement of Rowell in 1954, but he was now considered too old for the job.

Berryman became the Director General of the <a href="Royal%20visits%20to%20Australia">Royal Tour</a> of Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a> in 1954, for which he was made a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order</a> (KCVO). He was Chief Executive Officer of the <a href="Royal%20Agricultural%20Society%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales</a> from 1954 to 1961. He died on 28 May 1981 at <a href="Rose%20Bay%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Rose Bay, New South Wales</a>, and was cremated with full military honours. At the time of his funeral the Ambassador for Lebanon, Raymond Heneine, wrote in the "<a href="Canberra%20Times">Canberra Times</a>": "The inhabitants of Jezzine will never forget General Berryman, who liberated their town from the forces of the Vichy French in collaboration with the Italian and German forces. He was for them not only a great general but also a great benefactor who provided them with food supplies and medical care. In fact he was the example of humanitarianism".

Nigel (bishop of Ely)

Nigel (<a href="circa">c.</a> 1100 – 1169) was an <a href="Anglo-Normans">Anglo-Norman</a> <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ely">Bishop of Ely</a>. He came from an ecclesiastical family; his uncle <a href="Roger%20of%20Salisbury">Roger of Salisbury</a> was a bishop and government minister for King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>, and other relatives also held offices in the <a href="History_of_Christianity_in_Britain%23Normans">English Church</a> and government. Nigel owed his advancement to his uncle, as did Nigel's probable brother <a href="Alexander%20of%20Lincoln">Alexander</a>, who like Nigel was advanced to episcopal status. Nigel was educated on the continent before becoming a royal administrator. He served as <a href="Lord%20High%20Treasurer">Treasurer of England</a> under King Henry, before being appointed to the <a href="Episcopal%20see">see</a>, or bishopric, of Ely in 1133. His tenure was marked by conflicts with the monks of his <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a>, who believed that Nigel kept income for himself that should properly have gone to them.

Following the accession of Henry I's successor, King <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a>, Nigel remained as treasurer only briefly before his family was ousted from political office by the new king. Nigel rebelled and deserted to Stephen's rival <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, but eventually reconciled with Stephen. Although he subsequently held some minor administrative posts, he never regained high office under Stephen. On the king's death, Nigel was returned to the treasurership by the new king, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>. Nigel's second tenure as treasurer saw him return the administration to the practices of Henry I. He withdrew from much of his public work after around 1164, following an attack of paralysis. He was succeeded as treasurer by his son, <a href="Richard%20FitzNeal">Richard fitzNeal</a>, whom he had trained in the operations of the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a>, or Treasury of England. Most historians, then and now, have felt that Nigel's administrative abilities were excellent; he is considered to have been more talented as an administrator than as a religious figure.

Nigel's date of birth is uncertain, but it is likely to have been some time around 1100. Historians occasionally refer to him as Nigel Poor or Nigel of Ely, but before his elevation to the episcopate he was commonly known as Nigel, the bishop's nephew, or Nigel, the treasurer. He was probably a <a href="Normans">Norman</a> by ancestry although he was brought up in England, which in 1066 had been conquered by the <a href="Duke%20of%20Normandy">Duke of Normandy</a>, <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a>. Following William's death in 1087 his realm was divided between two of his sons. His middle son, <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William Rufus</a>, inherited the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a>, and the Duchy of <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> passed to his eldest son, <a href="Robert%20Curthose">Robert Curthose</a>. The youngest son, <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry</a>, received a grant of money, which he used to purchase a lordship in Normandy. The brothers fought amongst themselves for the next twenty years; the initial conflict was between Rufus and Robert, but after Rufus' death in 1100 Henry, who succeeded Rufus as King of England, also became involved. Eventually, in 1106, Henry captured Robert, imprisoned him for life, and took control of Normandy.

Nigel's uncle Roger of Salisbury, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Salisbury">Bishop of Salisbury</a>, saw to Nigel's education at the school of <a href="Laon">Laon</a> in France, where he probably studied mathematics under <a href="Anselm%20of%20Laon">Anselm of Laon</a>. It is likely that his father was Roger's brother Humphrey. Other students at Laon included <a href="William%20de%20Corbeil">William de Corbeil</a>, later <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, <a href="Robert%20de%20Bethune">Robert de Bethune</a>, who became <a href="Bishop%20of%20Hereford">Bishop of Hereford</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20Brito">Geoffrey le Breton</a>, future <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Archdiocese%20of%20Rouen">Archbishop of Rouen</a>, and other men subsequently to hold bishoprics in the Anglo-Norman dominions.

When he took vows as a cleric is unrecorded, but Nigel held a <a href="Prebendary">prebend</a>, an ecclesiastical office in the cathedral, in the <a href="Diocese%20of%20London">see of London</a> before holding one of the offices of <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a> in the <a href="diocese%20of%20Salisbury">diocese of Salisbury</a>, although which archdeaconry he held is unclear. Most modern historians believe that Nigel was brother to Alexander of Lincoln, later <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>, but this relationship is not specifically attested in the sources, which merely state that both were Roger's nephews. <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a>, a medieval chronicler, considered both Alexander and Nigel to be well educated and diligent. Nigel attended the consecration of <a href="Bernard%20%28Bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s%29">Bernard</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20David%27s">Bishop of St David's</a> at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster</a> in 1115, and may have returned to England from Laon by 1112. From the time of his return until around 1120 he served as a royal chaplain and attested a number of royal charters.

Nigel first became Treasurer in the reign of Henry I, and seems to have held that office from around 1126. He was already a receiver, or auditor and administrator, in the treasury of Normandy, and he served as treasurer for both realms, moving with the king and court between England and Normandy. The date of his appointment is unclear, as until he became a bishop, royal charters listed him as "nephew of the bishop" (Roger of Salisbury), rather than by any office he held. In 1131, though, he was listed in a papal letter as "Nigel, the treasurer", which securely establishes that he held the office at that date.

In 1133, Roger of Salisbury secured the bishopric of Ely for Nigel. Ely had been without a bishop since 1131; after the two-year vacancy, King Henry made the appointment because he was settling outstanding business before leaving England to return to Normandy. At this time Henry also appointed <a href="Geoffrey%20Rufus">Geoffrey Rufus</a> to <a href="Diocese%20of%20Durham">Durham</a>, and <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Carlisle">Æthelwold</a> to the newly created <a href="Diocese%20of%20Carlisle">Diocese of Carlisle</a>. Nigel was consecrated on 1 October 1133 at <a href="Lambeth">Lambeth</a> by William de Corbeil—who was by then Archbishop of Canterbury—possibly with the assistance of Roger of Salisbury. Nigel continued to hold the office of treasurer until 1136, when he was replaced by a relative, <a href="Adelelm%20%28Lord%20High%20Treasurer%29">Adelelm</a>, although the historian <a href="C.%20Warren%20Hollister">C. Warren Hollister</a> placed his departure from the office in 1133 with his appointment to Ely. The "<a href="Constitutio%20domus%20regis">Constitutio domus regis</a>", or "Establishment of the King's Household", may have been written by Nigel, or possibly for his use, and probably was composed around 1135.

Ely had until 1109 been an independent monastery, but its last abbot, Richard, had proposed to the king a plan by which the abbey would become a bishopric, presumably with the abbot himself as bishop. Richard died before the proposal could be put into operation, but in 1109, the custodian of the vacant abbey secured permission to make the change, and became the first Bishop of Ely. However, the administrative changes needed to make the abbey into a bishopric took longer, and were still unresolved at the time of Nigel's appointment. Regardless, Nigel was constantly at court, as shown by his appearance 31 times as a witness to charters during the last 10 years of Henry I's reign. This left little time for administration of his diocese, and Nigel appointed a married clergyman, Ranulf of Salisbury, to administer the diocese. Ranulf seems to have tyrannized the monks of the cathedral chapter, and Nigel appears to have done little to protect his monks from abuse. Later, during the early years of Stephen's reign, Nigel claimed to have uncovered a plot led by Ranulf to assassinate Normans. The exact nature of the conspiracy is obscure, and it is unclear what prompted it. The medieval chronicler <a href="Orderic%20Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a> claimed that Ranulf planned to kill all the Normans in the government and hand the country over to the Scots. After the discovery of the plot, Ranulf fled the country and Nigel made peace with the monks of his cathedral chapter. Another source of conflict with his monks was the desire of the cathedral chapter to enjoy the same "liberty" as a corporate body that the bishops did in the diocese. This liberty was a group of rights that the abbey had originally held, and had transferred to the bishop when the abbey became a bishopric. The rights included <a href="Soke%20%28legal%29">sake and soke</a>, or the right to command dues from the land, and the right to levy tolls. They also included the right to hold courts dealing with theft. Around 1135, Nigel conceded this point to the monks. Although he restored some of the lands that had been taken from the monks by Ranulf, the "<a href="Liber%20Eliensis">Liber Eliensis</a>" (the house chronicle of the monks of Ely) continued to decry his administration of the diocese and the lands of the cathedral chapter, alleging that "he kept back for himself some properties of the church which he wanted, and very good ones they were". The chronicle contains a number of complaints that Nigel oppressed the monks or despoiled them.

Following King Henry's death in 1135, the succession was disputed between the king's nephews—<a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a> and his elder brother, <a href="Theobald%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Champagne">Theobald II, Count of Champagne</a>—and Henry's surviving legitimate child <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, usually known as the Empress Matilda because of her first marriage to the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Henry%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Henry V</a>. King Henry's only legitimate son, <a href="William%20Adelin">William</a>, had died in 1120. After Matilda was widowed in 1125, she returned to her father, who married her to <a href="Geoffrey%20V%2C%20Count%20of%20Anjou">Geoffrey, Count of Anjou</a>. All the magnates of England and Normandy were required to declare fealty to Matilda as Henry's heir, but when Henry I died in 1135, Stephen rushed to England and had himself crowned before either Theobald or Matilda could react. The Norman barons accepted Stephen as Duke of Normandy, and Theobald contented himself with his possessions in France. Matilda, though, was less sanguine, and secured the support of the Scottish king, <a href="David%20I%20of%20Scotland">David</a>, who was her maternal uncle, and in 1138 also the support of her half-brother, <a href="Robert%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Gloucester">Robert, Earl of Gloucester</a>, an illegitimate son of Henry I.

After Stephen's accession, Nigel was at first retained as treasurer, but the king came to suspect him and his family of secretly supporting the Empress Matilda. The prime movers behind Stephen's suspicions against the bishops were the <a href="House%20of%20Beaumont">Beaumont family</a>, headed by the twin brothers <a href="Robert%20de%20Beaumont%2C%202nd%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Robert, Earl of Leicester</a>, and <a href="Waleran%20de%20Beaumont%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Worcester">Waleran, Count of Meulan</a>, who wished to be the main advisors of the king. Roger, Alexander, and Nigel together held key castles, including Salisbury, Devizes, Sherborne, Malmesbury, Sleaford, and Newark. The Beaumonts alleged that Roger and his family were fortifying the castles they held in preparation for turning them over to Matilda. They urged the king to confiscate the castles before they were lost. Although the "<a href="Deeds%20of%20King%20Stephen">Gesta Stephani</a>", or "Deeds of King Stephen", a medieval chronicle of the events of Stephen's reign, alleges that Roger was disloyal to Stephen, the evidence is against such action by Roger, as he had been an opponent of Matilda since 1126, when she was first put forward as her father's heir. Roger and his family also had been early supporters of Stephen's seizure of the crown after Henry I's death. The contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis felt that Roger's family were going to betray the king, but William of Malmesbury believed that the allegations were based on envy from "powerful laymen". Whatever Roger's position, Nigel's own position on Matilda is less clear, and it is possible that he was never as opposed to her as his uncle. No evidence survives that he was estranged from Stephen, however, as Nigel continued to witness charters throughout the first four years of Stephen's reign. According to the historian <a href="Marjorie%20Chibnall">Marjorie Chibnall</a>, Nigel's family may have been caught up in a dispute between <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a> and the Beaumonts.

In 1139, supporters of Roger and his family brawled in public with some men who supported <a href="Alan%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Richmond">Alan of Brittany</a>. The brawl may have been provoked by the Beaumonts, for Alan was often associated with them. At a court held at Oxford in June 1139, Stephen required Roger of Salisbury, Alexander of Lincoln, and Nigel to surrender their castles as a consequence of the brawl. When Roger and his family delayed, the king ordered their arrest. Nigel managed to escape arrest by fleeing to the castle of <a href="Devizes">Devizes</a>, and the king followed and began a siege. The king threatened to hang Roger in front of the castle unless it capitulated, and Nigel, under pressure from Roger's wife, surrendered the castle after the siege had lasted three days. All three bishops then submitted and surrendered their secular offices and castles. They were, however, allowed to retain their dioceses. Nigel surrendered <a href="Newark%20Castle%2C%20Nottinghamshire">Newark Castle</a> and <a href="Sleaford%20Castle">Sleaford Castle</a>, both of which had been constructed by Alexander. Stephen promptly gave Newark to Robert, Earl of Leicester, who was in turn excommunicated by Alexander of Lincoln.

Stephen's brother, Henry of Blois, who was <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a> in England, called an ecclesiastical council at Winchester on 29 August 1139, and summoned the king to answer charges that he had unlawfully arrested clergy. The king refused to attend, and sent a representative instead. After meeting for a few days, the council was dismissed on 1 September without deciding anything except to appeal to the pope in Rome. In the end, the appeal never reached Rome. Part of the problem confronting the assembled bishops was that Stephen had not expelled Roger's family from their ecclesiastical offices, merely their secular ones. Stephen's representatives argued that the bishops had given up their castles and money voluntarily to avoid secular charges. The defence taken by the king was not novel; it had been used before by William I and William II against <a href="Odo%20of%20Bayeux">Odo of Bayeux</a> and <a href="William%20de%20St-Calais">William de St-Calais</a>, respectively.

Traditionally, the arrest of the bishops has been seen as a turning point in Stephen's reign, and the event that turned the ecclesiastical hierarchy against him. Recent historians have held a lively debate on the issue; a few still hold to the traditional interpretation, but most have decided that reactions in the English church were more ambivalent. One modern historian, <a href="David%20Crouch%20%28historian%29">David Crouch</a>, believes that the arrest of the bishops signalled the beginnings of the <a href="The%20Anarchy">Anarchy</a>, not because of any alienation of the church, but through court politics, where Stephen showed himself incapable of manipulating the factions of his court. The ascendency of the Beaumonts was marked by the placement of one of their protégés, <a href="Philip%20de%20Harcourt">Philip de Harcourt</a>, as Chancellor.

Roger died in December 1139 while in the king's custody. After the death of his uncle, Nigel, then in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, revolted. In January 1140, he fortified the <a href="Isle%20of%20Ely">Isle of Ely</a>, but was soon besieged and forced to flee. Even his own cathedral chapter refused to support him, and his revolt collapsed in January. Nigel took refuge at the court of Stephen's rival, the Empress Matilda, who had landed in England in the south on 30 September 1139 in a bid to take the throne. The revolt stood little chance of succeeding, for there were no supporters of Matilda close to East Anglia, and it is likely that Nigel reacted more out of fear and anger at his uncle's death than anything else. It appears likely that Nigel appealed to Pope <a href="Pope%20Innocent%20II">Innocent II</a> at this time, for in October 1140 Innocent issued a <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a>, or papal instruction, ordering the restoration to Nigel of the lands of his bishopric, and it appears that after the capture of Stephen, Matilda managed to restore Nigel to Ely briefly. In 1141, Nigel, along with his brother Alexander, was one of the supporters of Matilda who, after the capture of Stephen by Matilda's forces, reached an agreement with Henry of Blois to replace Stephen with Matilda on the throne. Ultimately, this agreement came to nothing when Matilda's chief supporter, her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, was captured and later exchanged for Stephen. Stephen's release meant that the king was free to send <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Mandeville%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Essex">Geoffrey de Mandeville</a> against Nigel, and Nigel submitted to the king, probably in 1142.

In 1143, Nigel became involved in a quarrel with the powerful Henry of Blois. Charges of depriving a priest of a church, giving church property to laymen, and encouraging sedition were brought against Nigel, and he was forced to go to Rome to defend himself, only reaching Rome in 1144. He did not return to his diocese until 1145. He probably accompanied <a href="Theobald%20of%20Bec">Theobald of Bec</a>, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who went to Rome around this time on separate business. While he was in Rome, Pope <a href="Pope%20Lucius%20II">Lucius II</a> issued a number of rulings in Nigel's favor, ordering his restitution to Ely. He was then finally reconciled with Stephen by paying a fine of £200 and offering his son Richard fitzNeal as a hostage. While Nigel was at Rome, Ely was attacked by the king's forces. The monks sent to Geoffrey de Mandeville for aid, and Geoffrey came and occupied the Isle of Ely, while the king's forces occupied the lands of the diocese outside the Isle. Both occupying forces did damage to the lands of the diocese and the cathedral chapter. The monks, in the "Liber Eliensis", complained that Nigel had taken items from the church to finance his trip to Rome, and that they were required to help contribute to the bribe when Nigel was reconciled with Stephen.

By 1147, Nigel was again witnessing Stephen's charters, and in 1153 or 1154 he was named in a grant of lands to <a href="St%20Radegund%27s%20Priory%2C%20Cambridge">St Radegund's Priory</a> in Cambridge. He assisted with the consecration of <a href="Hilary%20of%20Chichester">Hilary of Chichester</a> as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a> in August 1147. He took part in shire courts in both Norfolk and Suffolk in 1150, and continued to assist with episcopal consecrations throughout the remainder of Stephen's reign. No records exist of him being involved with treasury affairs during this time. His witnessing of charters is sparse, and almost always in company with other bishops; this suggests that he was only at court for councils or other similar events. Nigel was a witness to Stephen's charter that left England to Matilda's son, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry of Anjou</a>. When Henry succeeded Stephen, Nigel was present at the coronation.

After the accession of Henry II, Nigel was summoned to reorganize the Exchequer, or treasury, that was responsible for the production of the government's financial records, including the <a href="Pipe%20Rolls">Pipe Rolls</a>. The king had to ask Nigel several times to return before the bishop agreed, and one reason for Nigel's reluctance may have been that he would have to work with Robert, Earl of Leicester, one of the Beaumonts, who had been responsible for turning Stephen against Nigel's family in 1139. Another of Nigel's colleagues in the administration was a layman, <a href="Richard%20de%20Luci">Richard de Lucy</a>, who served as a justice until 1178. Nigel was the only surviving minister of Henry I, and his knowledge of the Exchequer was needed to help reorganize the revenues of the king and restore administrative practices lost during Stephen's reign. The lone pipe roll to survive from Henry I's reign, for the year 1130, may be Nigel's own copy, brought with him to the Exchequer when he returned under Henry II. Nigel was able to increase the revenues compared to what had been collected under Stephen, but he was unable to quickly return them to the amounts collected under Henry I. It may have been Nigel who urged the king to attempt to recover estates that had been alienated during Stephen's reign.

The pipe roll for 1155–1156 has several entries which declare that Nigel was making decisions about monetary affairs and issuing writs, but later pipe rolls do not contain any such entries. It appears likely that after the initial reorganization of the Exchequer, Nigel's involvement lessened. He continued to be active, though, and obtained <a href="Taxation%20in%20medieval%20England">tax exemptions</a> and other privileges until his death in 1169. His son, Richard fitzNeal, who is the main source for information about Nigel's career in the Exchequer, stated that he fulfilled Nigel's treasury duties when Nigel was ill. Nigel continued to spar with Robert, the Earl of Leicester, and Richard fitzNeal relays a story about Nigel and Robert confronting each other at the Exchequer over traditional exemptions of the <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Baron%20of%20the%20Exchequer">barons of the Exchequer</a>, or judges of the Exchequer. Among the reforms carried out by Nigel were the restoration of the "blanch farm" system, whereby a random sample of coins was assayed and any shortage was collected from the sheriff, and the restoration of collections from a swath of counties that had quit paying taxes during Stephen's reign. The most substantial change was the return to a unified system of finances, which in turn required a reconciliation of the two different systems in use by Stephen and Matilda. Despite Nigel's reinstatement to the Exchequer, and the nomination of his son as treasurer, Nigel did not enjoy the power that his uncle had wielded under Henry I. The exact date of Richard's appointment as treasurer is obscure, but it was sometime between 1158 and 1160, as he is securely attested as treasurer in 1160. The "Liber Eliensis" states that Nigel paid the king £400 to secure the office for Richard. Some historians have seen Nigel as Henry II's "minister of finance".

Nigel also served as a royal justice under Henry II. Although his relations with the government had improved, his relations with the monks of his cathedral chapter, which had never been good, continued to be marked by quarrels. In 1156, the English <a href="Pope%20Adrian%20IV">Pope Adrian IV</a> threatened to suspend Nigel from office unless the bishop restored all the lands that had belonged to the church when Nigel became bishop. The restitution was hampered by the absence of the king from England, and the dispute dragged on until finally it was resolved by Nigel pledging in front of Theobald of Bec, Archbishop of Canterbury, to restore the lands. By 1158, Nigel had managed to restore enough possessions that Adrian relaxed the conditions. Even this did not end the quarrels with the monks, as Nigel then named a married clerk as <a href="Sacristan">sacrist</a> of Ely, an action which was condemned by <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, the new Archbishop of Canterbury. Nigel did manage to secure a reduction in the assessment of knight's fees due from the diocese, from the 60 fees that were due under Henry I, to 40 in 1166.

Nigel died on 30 May 1169. In either 1164 or in 1166, or possibly both, he had been struck by paralysis, and after this he seems to have withdrawn from active affairs. He took little part in the <a href="Becket%20controversy">disputes</a> between the king and Thomas Becket, although he did agree with his fellow bishops who opposed the king's attempt to reduce clerical benefits. He may have been buried at Ely, where a 12th-century marble slab possibly marks his tomb.

Nigel was a married bishop, and his son Richard fitzNeal was later Lord Treasurer and <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. Another son was William, called William the Englishman. Richard, who wrote the "<a href="Dialogue%20concerning%20the%20Exchequer">Dialogus de Scaccario</a>", or "Dialogue concerning the Exchequer" about the procedures of the Exchequer, had been taught those procedures by his father. Nigel's uncle Roger had at least one son, Roger, who was King Stephen's chancellor; Adelelm, who succeeded Nigel as treasurer after his first term, was probably Roger's son also. Another relative was <a href="William%20of%20Ely">William of Ely</a>, who succeeded Richard fitzNeal as treasurer in 1196, although the exact relationship is unclear.

Nigel was active in draining <a href="the%20Fens">the Fens</a>, the swampy land around Ely, to increase the agricultural lands around his bishopric. He also fortified the Isle of Ely with stone defences, probably starting around 1140. The remains of one castle on Cherry Hill in Ely probably date to Nigel's fortifications. Early in his time as bishop he was active in recovering lands of the church that had been granted to knights by his predecessors, and soon after his consecration he ordered an inquest made into the lands actually owned by the diocese and cathedral chapter. The bishop spent most of his life in debt, but in the year he died he managed to clear it with his son's help. The monks of his cathedral chapter did not like the fact that they were required to pay for the bishop's appeals to Rome to recover his see, or pay for regaining the king's favour. Their dislike of their bishop is evident in the "Liber Eliensis". The art historian <a href="C.%20R.%20Dodwell">C. R. Dodwell</a> wrote of Nigel's efforts: When ... Nigel ... needed to raise money in order to repair his own political fortunes, he stripped down, sold, or used as security, a quite astounding number of Ely's monastic treasures. These numbered Crucifixes of gold and silver from the <a href="Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</a> past, and they included an <a href="alb">alb</a> with gold-embroidered apparels, given by St Æthelwold, and a <a href="chasuble">chasuble</a>, given by King Edgar, which was almost all of gold. A gold and bejewelled textile covering ... was sold to the Bishop of Lincoln, Alexander, who took it with him to Rome as a gift of particular splendour. It is a biting commentary on attitudes of the Anglo-Norman episcopy to <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20art">Anglo-Saxon art</a>, that it was left to the pope to point out that such an artistic heirloom should never have left Ely in the first place and to order its return.

Most historians have seen Nigel as an administrator, not a religious bishop. The historian <a href="David%20Knowles%20%28scholar%29">David Knowles</a> wrote that Nigel "had devoted all his energies and abilities to matters purely secular; in the department of financial administration he was supreme, and more than any other man he helped to ensure the continuity and development of the excellent administrative practice initiated under Henry I". The historian W. L. Warren said that "Stephen probably paid dearly for the dismissal of Bishop Roger of Salisbury and Bishop Nigel of Ely, for the expertise of the exchequer was lodged in their expertise." Whatever Nigel's administrative talent, his ecclesiastical abilities are generally held to be low; the "Gesta Stephani" says of both him and Alexander that they were "men who loved display and were rash in their reckless presumption ... disregarding the holy and simple manner of life that befits a Christian priest they devoted themselves so utterly to warfare and the vanities of this world that whenever they attended court by appointment they ... aroused general astonishment on account of the extraordinary concourse of knights by which they were surrounded on every side."

Morotai Mutiny

The "Morotai Mutiny" was an incident in April 1945 involving members of the <a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">Australian First Tactical Air Force</a> based on the island of <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a>, in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a>. Eight senior pilots, including Australia's leading <a href="flying%20ace">flying ace</a>, Group Captain <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a>, tendered their resignations to protest what they perceived as the relegation of <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> squadrons to strategically unimportant <a href="close%20air%20support">ground attack</a> missions against Japanese positions that had been bypassed in the Allies' "<a href="Leapfrogging%20%28strategy%29">island-hopping</a>" campaign. A government investigation vindicated the "mutineers", and three high-ranking officers at First Tactical Air Force Headquarters, including the commander, Air Commodore <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>, the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>' top-scoring ace during World War I, were relieved of their posts.

<a href="George%20Odgers">George Odgers</a> summed up the cause of the incident in <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20War%20of%201939%E2%80%931945">the official history</a> of the RAAF in World War II as "the conviction of a group of young leaders that they were engaging in operations that were not militarily justifiable—a conviction widely shared also by many Australian soldiers and political leaders." Odgers concluded that the ensuing inquiry "made it clear that almost everyone concerned acted from the highest motives, and was convinced that, in the crisis, he acted wisely".

<a href="Australian%20First%20Tactical%20Air%20Force">First Tactical Air Force</a> (No. 1 TAF), commanded by Air Commodore <a href="Harry%20Cobby">Harry Cobby</a>, was the main frontline combat formation of the RAAF in 1944–45. It fell under the operational control of <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">United States Army Air Forces</a> (USAAF) Lieutenant General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>, the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> air forces commander in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20Area%20%28command%29">South West Pacific Area</a> under General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>. Initially made up of one <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a> and two <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20variants">P-40 Kittyhawk</a> wings, No. 1 TAF was augmented in 1945 by <a href="No.%2080%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 80 Wing</a>, commanded by Group Captain <a href="Clive%20Caldwell">Clive Caldwell</a>. This wing comprised three <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> squadrons, whose pilots included veterans of the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a> and the <a href="Air%20raids%20on%20Australia%2C%201942%E2%80%9343">defence of Northern Australia against Japanese air raids</a>.

By early 1945, Japanese air power in the South West Pacific had been virtually destroyed. <a href="United%20States%20Army">US Army</a> forces were focused on completing the <a href="Philippines%20campaign%20%281944%E2%80%9345%29">recapture of the Philippines</a> as a stepping stone to an invasion of Japan. During this time, Australian forces including No. 1 TAF were increasingly assigned to garrison duties and harassing Japanese bases on islands bypassed by MacArthur's forces. The <a href="Chief%20of%20Air%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Air Staff</a>, Air Vice Marshal <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">George Jones</a>, would later contend that the RAAF, in the words of Air Force historian Alan Stephens, "was 'side-stepped' out of the final victory over Japan by MacArthur, who wanted all the glory for himself". <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">US Marine Corps</a> aviators from the <a href="AirSols">Air North Solomons</a> command also believed that MacArthur's headquarters was favouring the USAAF in the assignment of combat duties.

The overall situation led to dissatisfaction and poor morale among No. 1 TAF personnel based on <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a>, particularly the Spitfire pilots who had little opportunity for the air-to-air combat they specialised in and whose aircraft were ill-suited to ground attack missions. Group Captain <a href="Wilfred%20Arthur">Wilf Arthur</a>, former <a href="Officer%20Commanding">Officer Commanding</a> <a href="No.%2081%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 81 Wing</a> and now in charge of <a href="No.%2078%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 78 Wing</a>, became concerned that his units' expenditure in terms of men, machines and ordnance was not justified by the damage inflicted on enemy targets or by the relative importance of those targets. In December 1944 he asked his Intelligence staff to produce a "balance sheet" to quantify losses versus results. Arthur presented the balance sheet to Air Commodore Cobby, who reviewed it and disseminated it to his headquarters staff, but took no further action.

In March 1945, frustrated by the lack of response from Cobby and his staff and convinced that operations were becoming yet more wasteful, Arthur began discussing his concerns with other senior No. 1 TAF pilots. First, he spoke to <a href="Wing%20Commander%20%28rank%29">Wing Commander</a> Kenneth Ranger, a senior staff officer who had served with <a href="No.%209%20Operational%20Group%20RAAF">No. 9 Operational Group</a> and had made allegations regarding the leadership of its commander, Air Commodore <a href="Joe%20Hewitt%20%28RAAF%20officer%29">Joe Hewitt</a>, who was eventually dismissed from his post. Arthur sought out Ranger as someone with "moral guts", who would take "a stand against the type of operations we were engaged in". Next, he enlisted Caldwell's support, although Caldwell was, at the time, facing charges from Cobby over liquor trafficking which made it a risk that his involvement in a protest over operations would be misconstrued as an attempt to divert attention from the charges. Arthur believed, however, that Caldwell "would go as far as he possibly could to back up his opinions [which] were worth a lot more than the opinions of most other people in the area".

Through Caldwell more officers joined the protest, including two other celebrated aces, Wing Commander <a href="Bobby%20Gibbes">Bobby Gibbes</a> and Squadron Leader <a href="John%20Lloyd%20Waddy">John Waddy</a>, as well as Squadron Leader Bert Grace, Squadron Leader Douglas Vanderfield, and later, Squadron Leader Stuart Harpham. During a series of meetings early in April 1945, Caldwell proposed that the eight resign "en masse", and the others agreed. Arthur later stated that, "I meant to make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected ... All the same, we realised that, to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny, we might lessen the force of what we were doing, which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up."
Arthur also attempted to secure Cobby's support for the protest. The commander of No. 1 TAF had been the <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>' leading ace in World War I, as Caldwell was the RAAF's in World War II. Arthur reasoned that, although Cobby was partly to blame for the morale issue, "we felt that his value to our move, because of his name with the Public, together with Group Captain Caldwell, would give us a very considerable amount of public support ... he was the prima donna of one war, and ... arm-in-arm with the prima donna of the next war, we would put up a reasonable front and attract a lot of attention in the headlines of the newspapers." Cobby refused to join in and later claimed to be unaware of the depth of feeling among the pilots.

On 20 April 1945, the eight pilots presented Cobby with identically worded letters under the heading, "APPLICATION FOR RESIGNATION OF COMMISSION." The letters read, "I hereby respectfully make application that I be permitted to resign my Commission as an officer in the Royal Australian Air Force, forthwith." Cobby appeared taken aback and would not accept the resignations. He spoke to seven of the pilots individually, but not Caldwell, as he was already under charge. When the men refused to withdraw the letters or elaborate on the reason for their actions, Cobby contacted his immediate superior, Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">Bill Bostock</a>, head of <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>, the Air Force's main operational command. Bostock arrived on Morotai the next day and interviewed the pilots, asking them to tear up the letters, without success. His methods were later construed as an attempt to "make the situation go away or to at least cover it up". The pilots' only concession to Bostock's entreaty was to resubmit their resignations with the word "forthwith" replaced by "at the end of current operations".
Following these interviews, Bostock advised Air Vice Marshal Jones that morale in No. 1 TAF was at a "dangerously low level" and recommended that Jones fire Cobby and replace him with Air Commodore <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Frederick Scherger</a>. Jones considered the pilots' action "absurd", because an officer could not legally resign during wartime, but travelled to Morotai from his headquarters in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> to investigate the matter personally. He also interviewed the pilots, later declaring, "I believed them all to be sincere in what they were stating and what they had attempted to do ... Yes, sincerely held beliefs, no matter how ill-founded, coupled possibly with a rather exaggerated sense of national duty."

Lieutenant General Kenney also became embroiled in the affair, having been informed by Bostock, and insisted on speaking directly to the pilots himself over Jones' protest that this was an internal RAAF disciplinary matter. During a visit to Morotai from his <a href="Manila">Manila</a> headquarters, Kenney tried to persuade the officers to reconsider their positions, but again they refused. He agreed with Bostock that Cobby should be replaced by Scherger, and declared that if the pilots were <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a>led he would appear in their defence. The commander of the Australian Army's <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>, Lieutenant General <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Leslie Morshead</a>, who was at Morotai preparing for the Borneo campaign, also supported Cobby's removal. Morshead and other senior army officers were concerned that the dispute could disrupt preparations for the Australian landings in Borneo and consulted with Kenney on the matter. Jones resolved to dismiss not only Cobby but also his staff officers, Group Captains Gibson and Simms. Scherger took over as <a href="Air%20Officer%20Commanding">Air Officer Commanding</a> No. 1 TAF on 10 May.

Ultimately, no court-martial took place for any actions directly related to the "mutiny", and most of the pilots involved continued on operations until the end of the war. An RAAF investigation found that Jones' removal of Cobby, Gibson and Simms was justified. Upon Jones' request, the Australian government also set up an inquiry into events on Morotai, headed by Justice <a href="John%20Vincent%20Barry">John Vincent Barry</a>. Beginning on 16 May 1945, the inquiry focused on both the resignations and the reports of illegal trafficking in alcohol between RAAF and US service personnel on the island. Though Barry's terms of reference encompassed only No. 1 TAF, the inquiry also heard evidence of shortcomings in the Air Force's higher command that may have contributed to structural and morale problems on Morotai, particularly a bitter and long-running <a href="George%20Jones%20%28RAAF%20officer%29%23Divided%20command">feud between Jones and Bostock</a> over the division of operational and administrative control of the RAAF in the Pacific.

The complete report of the inquiry was released in October, preceded by a summary of findings issued on 14 September 1945. Judge Barry vindicated Arthur's "balance sheet" and the stand taken by the pilots, finding that their motives in tendering their resignations were sincere. No further action was taken against them over the "mutiny" itself, but Caldwell and Gibbes were court-martialled for their involvement in the alcohol racket and reduced to the rank of <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a>. Barry found that Cobby had "failed to maintain proper control over his command". Cobby defended his leadership of No. 1 TAF, contending that although there was "some discontent", it was "a healthy sign of discontent amongst certain officers who wished to do more in the war than they were doing. Unfortunately, it was not within the power of 1st T.A.F. to give them that more important or more interesting work ..." The incident did not change the RAAF's role in the dying days of the war in the Pacific and may have hindered No. 1 TAF's preparations for the upcoming <a href="Battle%20of%20Tarakan%20%281945%29">Battle of Tarakan</a>. It did improve the situation on Morotai, as Air Commodore Scherger successfully restored morale. The "mutineers" considered that they had achieved most of their goals by effecting a change of command in No. 1 TAF and instigating a governmental inquiry.
News of the resignations, the alcohol racket, and Caldwell's court-martial were widely reported in Australia. Following publication of Barry's findings, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph%20%28Sydney%29">The Daily Telegraph</a>" in Sydney commented that "the RAAF should have a complete new deal. It is a badly run show and the fault is high up." The same paper later called Caldwell's court-martial a "witch hunt". Despite this publicity, the action did not become popularly known as the "Morotai Mutiny" until years later. The phrase dated back to the earliest days of the incident, Group Captain Arthur having written it at the top of an "<a href="aide-m%C3%A9moire">aide-mémoire</a>". He later said that "the alliteration must have appealed to me". Shortly after writing it, he crossed out "Morotai" and added a question mark following "Mutiny". The term did not catch on with the public at the time, but Arthur's original words have been credited as the source of the name by which the incident eventually became known.

Family of Gediminas

The family of Gediminas is a group of family members of <a href="Gediminas">Gediminas</a>, <a href="Grand%20Duke%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duke of Lithuania</a> (ca. 1275–1341), who interacted in the 14th century. The family included the siblings, children, and grandchildren of the Grand Duke and played the pivotal role in the <a href="history%20of%20Lithuania">history of Lithuania</a> for the period as the <a href="Lithuanian%20nobility">Lithuanian nobility</a> had not yet acquired its influence. Gediminas was also the forefather of the <a href="Gediminids">Gediminid</a> dynasty, which ruled the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a> from 1310s or 1280s to 1572.

Gediminas' origins are unclear, but recent research suggests that <a href="Skalmantas%20%28Gediminids%29">Skalmantas</a>, an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and could be considered the dynasty's founder. Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the <a href="Grand%20Duchy%20of%20Lithuania">Grand Duchy of Lithuania</a>, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> and <a href="Poland">Poland</a>.

The relationships among Gediminas' children were generally harmonious, with the notable exception of <a href="Jaunutis">Jaunutis</a>, who was deposed in 1345 by his brothers <a href="Algirdas">Algirdas</a> and <a href="K%C4%99stutis">Kęstutis</a>. These two brothers went on to provide a celebrated example of peaceful power-sharing. However, Gediminas' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century. Gediminas' grandchildren <a href="Christianization%20of%20Lithuania">converted Lithuania to Christianity</a> and inaugurated the first <a href="Union%20of%20Krewo">personal union with Poland</a>.

Because written sources of the era are scarce, Gediminas' ancestry, early life, and assumption of the title of Grand Duke in ca. 1316 are obscure and continue to be the subject of scholarly debate. Various theories have claimed that Gediminas was either his predecessor Grand Duke <a href="Vytenis">Vytenis</a>' son, his brother, his cousin, or his <a href="hostler">hostler</a>. For several centuries only two versions of his origins circulated. Chronicles—written long after Gediminas' death by the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>, a long-standing enemy of Lithuania—claimed that Gediminas was a hostler to Vytenis; according to these chronicles, Gediminas killed his master and assumed the throne. Another version introduced in the <a href="Lithuanian%20Chronicles">Lithuanian Chronicles</a>, which also appeared long after Gediminas' death, proclaimed that Gediminas was Vytenis' son. However, the two men were almost the same age, making this relationship unlikely. In 1868, a letter issued by the Council of <a href="Riga">Riga</a> in 1323 was published that contained a small note mentioning Vytenis as "the brother and predecessor" of Gediminas. After the letter came to light, textbooks almost universally represented Vytenis and Gediminas as brothers. However, historian <a href="Tomas%20Baranauskas">Tomas Baranauskas</a> believes the word "brother" has been interpreted too literally, and that the two were in fact cousins.

Grand Duke Vytenis' origins are relatively well-established; he was the son of <a href="Butvydas">Butvydas</a>, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1291 to 1295. No consensus exists about the identity of Butvydas' father. While some genealogies give <a href="Traidenis">Traidenis</a> as the ancestor, this has been described as unlikely: the later marriage of Gediminas' daughter Eufemija and Traidenis' great-grandson <a href="Boleslaw-Yuri%20II%20of%20Galicia">Boleslaw-Yuri</a> would have violated <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>, since the two would have been related by blood, and this violation would likely have been noticed by the pope.

Recent research indicates that Gediminids' ancestor may have been <a href="Skalmantas%20%28Gediminids%29">Skalmantas</a>. In 1974 historian <a href="Jerzy%20Ochma%C5%84ski">Jerzy Ochmański</a> noted that "<a href="Zadonshchina">Zadonshchina</a>", a poem from the end of the 14th century, contains a line in which two sons of <a href="Algirdas">Algirdas</a> name their ancestors: "We are two brothers – sons of Algirdas, and grandsons of Gediminas, and great-grandsons of Skalmantas." This discovery led to the belief that Skalmantas was the long-sought ancestor of the Gediminids. Ochmański posited that the poem skipped the generation represented by Butvydas, and jumped back to the unknown ancestor. Baranauskas disagrees, believing Skalmantas was Butvydas' brother rather than his father, and that Vytenis and Gediminas were therefore cousins.

It is known that Gediminas, born about 1275, had one sister (or possibly two, see below for the wife of Andrei of Kozelsk) and several brothers: <a href="Vainius">Vainius</a>, <a href="Fiodor%20of%20Kiev">Fiodor of Kiev</a>, possibly <a href="Vytenis">Vytenis</a>, and possibly <a href="Margiris">Margiris</a>. If Vytenis, who was Grand Duke of Lithuania from about 1295 to 1315, was indeed Gediminas' brother, he was probably the eldest son. Historians recognize one son of Grand Duke <a href="Vytenis">Vytenis</a>, Žvelgaitis, who may have died before his father. In 1310 Žvelgaitis, already a mature man, led an army to nearby <a href="Livonia">Livonia</a> in modern-day <a href="Latvia">Latvia</a> and <a href="Estonia">Estonia</a>. After Vytenis died in about 1315, Gediminas became the Grand Duke. There are no sources indicating that Vytenis' brothers or other family members advanced competing claims.

Vainius first appears in written sources in 1324. In 1326, as Duke of <a href="Polatsk">Polatsk</a>, he signed a treaty with the <a href="Livonian%20Order">Livonian Order</a> and <a href="Novgorod">Novgorod</a>. Scholars place his death sometime between 1338 and 1342. Vainius' only known son, Liubko, died in 1342 during a battle with the Livonian Order.

<a href="Fiodor%20of%20Kiev">Fiodor</a>, whose relationship to Gediminas was not established until the 20th century, was the longest-lived brother, surviving until at least 1362. In about 1325, with help from Gediminas, he became a Duke of <a href="Kiev">Kiev</a>. Fiodor was baptized in the <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox%20Church">Eastern Orthodox rite</a> and his pagan name is unknown. Kiev was still under the influence of the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Golden Horde</a>, and Fiodor acknowledged fealty to the Horde's <a href="Khan%20%28title%29">Khan</a>. This subordination lasted until 1363, when Gediminas' son <a href="Algirdas">Algirdas</a> soundly defeated the Horde in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Blue%20Waters">Battle of Blue Waters</a>. Scholarly opinion had long considered Fiodor a <a href="Rurikid">Rurikid</a>, rather than a Lithuanian, because of his Christian name. In 1916, however, a list of property belonging to <a href="Theognostus">Theognostus</a>, a deceased <a href="List%20of%20Metropolitans%20and%20Patriarchs%20of%20Moscow">Metropolitan of Moscow</a>, and compiled in the 1330s, was published; among the items listed were two silver cups gifted by "Fiodor, brother of Gediminas".

<a href="Margiris">Margiris</a>, the defender of <a href="Pil%C4%97nai">Pilėnai</a>, is often suggested as the most likely candidate for the fourth brother. The chronicles of <a href="Hermann%20de%20Wartberge">Hermann de Wartberge</a> mention that in 1329 Gediminas and two of his brothers raided Livonia. By that time Vytenis was already dead and Fiodor was probably occupied with establishing himself in Kiev. One of these two brothers must then have been Vainius; the identity of the other still puzzles historians. <a href="Alvydas%20Nik%C5%BEentaitis">Alvydas Nikžentaitis</a> suggests that he was Margiris because sources attest to his high status and wealth. Sources mention one son of Margiris, who was captured by the Teutonic Knights soon after his father's suicide in 1336 and did not return.

The only direct written mention of Gediminas' sister is a legend describing the murder of two <a href="Franciscan">Franciscan</a> <a href="friar">friar</a>s who came to <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> to spread Christianity. This legend was first presented in "<a href="Chronica%20XXIV%20Generalium">Chronica XXIV Generalium</a>", a chronicle written before 1369. The events probably took place around 1340, and some eyewitnesses could still have been alive when the chronicle was written. According to the legend Friar Ulrich's preaching angered townspeople. He and his companion, Martin, were seized and brought before Gediminas, who ordered the friars killed. Ulrich was tortured and his body tossed into a river. Martin's body was rescued by Gediminas' sister, an Orthodox nun. She buried Martin at the monastery where she lived. The legend was possibly as the basis for the legend of <a href="14%20Franciscan%20martyrs%20of%20Vilnius">14 Franciscan martyrs of Vilnius</a>, first recorded in the <a href="Bychowiec%20Chronicle">Bychowiec Chronicle</a>.

It is uncertain how many wives Gediminas had. The <a href="Bychowiec%20Chronicle">Bychowiec Chronicle</a> mentions three wives: Vida from <a href="Courland">Courland</a>; Olga from <a href="Smolensk">Smolensk</a>; and <a href="Jewna">Jewna</a> from <a href="Polotsk">Polotsk</a>, who was <a href="Eastern%20Orthodox">Eastern Orthodox</a> and died in 1344 or 1345. Most modern historians and reference works say Gediminas' wife was Jewna, dismissing Vida and Olga as fictitious, since no sources other than this chronicle mention the other two wives. The historian S. C. Rowell argues that Gediminas' wife was a local pagan duchess, on the grounds that his marriage to a princess from a neighboring land would have been noted in other contemporary sources, and that the reliability of the Bychowiec Chronicle has been questioned.

An argument has been advanced that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan and another Orthodox. This case is supported only by the "<a href="J%C3%BCngere%20Hochmeisterchronik">Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik</a>", a late 15th-century chronicle, mentioning <a href="Narimantas">Narimantas</a> as half-brother to <a href="Algirdas">Algirdas</a>. Other historians support this claim by arguing this would explain Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, <a href="Jaunutis">Jaunutis</a>, as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas and a second wife.

Because none of Gediminas' siblings had strong heirs, Gediminas and his children were in a favorable position to assume and consolidate power in the Grand Duchy. Gediminas had at least five daughters and seven sons, whose shrewd marriages helped to consolidate and expand the Grand Duchy's influence to areas east and west of Lithuania. Those marriages speak to Gediminas' diplomatic talent in building alliances with the neighboring states that shared his goals to destroy the Teutonic Order and contain the growing power of <a href="Moscow">Moscow</a> and Poland. The marriages of Gediminas' sons helped to consolidate the dynasty's power over various territories already within the Grand Duchy, while his daughters' and granddaughters' marriages worked to strengthen Lithuanian relationships with neighboring powers.

In 1320 Maria married <a href="Dmitri%20of%20Tver">Dmitri of Tver</a>, ruler of a Russian principality. The marriage took place soon after <a href="Mikhail%20Yaroslavich">Mikhail Yaroslavich</a>, Dmitri's father, was killed; his sons were searching for strong allies against <a href="Yury%20of%20Moscow">Yury of Moscow</a>, their principal competitor for the throne of <a href="Vladimir%2C%20Russia">Vladimir</a> and All Rus'. After 1327 Lithuania began to supplant <a href="Tver">Tver</a> as Moscow's chief rival for supremacy in the Rus'. When Tver sought to rival Moscow, it needed an alliance with Lithuania. Dmitri was killed in 1325 and Maria never remarried. Maria's brother-in-law, <a href="Alexander%20I%2C%20Grand%20Prince%20of%20Tver">Alexander I</a>, nevertheless maintained friendly relationships with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and his daughter <a href="Uliana%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Tver">Uliana</a> married <a href="Algirdas">Algirdas</a>, the son of Gediminas, who continued the Gediminid line. The cooperation between Lithuania and Tver lasted well into the 15th century.

<a href="Aldona%20of%20Lithuania">Aldona</a> (baptized as Ona or Anna; her pagan name is known only from the writings of the 16th century chronicler <a href="Maciej%20Stryjkowski">Maciej Stryjkowski</a>) married <a href="Casimir%20III%20of%20Poland">Casimir III of Poland</a>, son of <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20I%20the%20Elbow-high">Władysław I of Poland</a>, when he was 15 or 16 years old. The marriage took place on either 30 April or 16 October 1325, and was a purely political maneuver to strengthen the Polish–Lithuanian coalition against the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a> (an alliance foreshadowing the <a href="Union%20of%20Krewo">Union of Krewo</a> in 1385 and the <a href="Union%20of%20Lublin">Union of Lublin</a> in 1569, with the latter resulting in a stable and powerful new state, the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a>). This preliminary coalition was short-lived, collapsing in about 1330, but there is no evidence of military conflict between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.

The marriage into the Lithuanian dynasty that had ruled since about 1289 might have lent legitimacy to the rule of Władysław I of the <a href="Piast%20dynasty">Piast dynasty</a>, who was crowned in 1320, replacing the <a href="P%C5%99emyslid%20dynasty">Přemyslid dynasty</a>. But Aldona died unexpectedly at the end of May 1339 and was buried in <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>. Aldona had two daughters: Cunigunde (d. 1357) married <a href="Louis%20VI%20the%20Roman">Louis VI the Roman</a>, the son of <a href="Louis%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor</a>, and Elisabeth (d. 1361) married Duke <a href="Bogislaw%20V%2C%20Duke%20of%20Pomerania">Bogislaw V</a> of <a href="Pomerania">Pomerania</a>, an area in modern-day Germany and Poland. Elisabeth's daughter, <a href="Elizabeth%20of%20Pomerania">Elizabeth of Pomerania</a>, was the fourth wife of <a href="Charles%20IV%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor</a>.

Gediminas' daughter Elzbieta married <a href="Wac%C5%82aw%20of%20P%C5%82ock">Wacław of Płock</a>, one of the <a href="dukes%20of%20Masovia">dukes of Masovia</a> in modern-day eastern Poland. Her second name is recorded in writings by <a href="Maciej%20Stryjkowski">Maciej Stryjkowski</a> as "Danmila" and <a href="Teodor%20Narbutt">Teodor Narbutt</a> as "Damila". It has been suggested these names are misread versions of "Danutė", a name derived from "<a href="Daniel%20%28biblical%20figure%29">Daniel</a>". Another interpretation is that historians confused <a href="Danut%C4%97%20of%20Lithuania">Danutė of Lithuania</a>, daughter of Kęstutis, with Elzbieta. As an alliance, the marriage was significant because passages to and from western Europe had to pass through <a href="Masovia">Masovia</a>; it can be seen as an attempt to revive Grand Duke <a href="Traidenis">Traidenis</a>' and his daughter <a href="Gaudemunda%20of%20Lithuania">Gaudemunda's</a> link with Masovia in the 1270s. The marriage's importance is attested by Elzbieta's <a href="dowry">dowry</a>: 720 Kraków silver <a href="Mark%20%28weight%29">marks</a> and nine marks of gold – three times more than an ordinary recorded dowry of the time. This marriage probably took place about 1316, when Gediminas supported Wacław during a civil war in the divided <a href="Duchy%20of%20Masovia">Duchy of Masovia</a>. After Wacław's death in 1336, Elzbieta managed her own wealth. She is mentioned for the last time in 1361, when her brother <a href="K%C4%99stutis">Kęstutis</a> escaped from <a href="Malbork">Marienburg</a> and sought refuge at his sister's house; historians put her date of death at around 1364. In 1337 Elzbieta's daughter Anna, first mentioned in late 1323, married Henry of <a href="%C5%BBaga%C5%84">Żagań</a>, in modern-day western Poland. Her son Bolesław III or Bolko died without a male heir in 1351 and his land was divided among other dukes.

Eufemija (also known as Marija, Ofka, and Anka) married <a href="Boleslaw-Yuri%20II%20of%20Galicia">Bolesław Jerzy II</a> of <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>, in modern-day Ukraine, in 1331. The marriage was engineered in 1323 when the brothers <a href="Lev%20II%20of%20Galicia">Lev</a> and <a href="Andrew%20of%20Galicia">Andrew of Galicia</a> were slain without leaving heirs. Instead of replacing them with his own son <a href="Liubartas">Liubartas</a> and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas forged a compromise with <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20I%20the%20Elbow-high">Władysław I of Poland</a>. Both parties agreed to install Bolesław, cousin of Władysław I and nephew of Gediminas' son-in-law Wacław of Płock, with the marriage to take place later. Bolesław at the time was fourteen years old. In this way the war for control of <a href="Galicia%E2%80%93Volhynia">Galicia–Volhynia</a> was postponed until after Bolesław's poisoning in 1340; control of the area was not stabilized until 1370. According to Teodor Narbutt, Eufemija was drowned beneath the ice of the <a href="Vistula">Vistula</a> River on 5 February 1342 in order to keep her out of the succession disputes.

<a href="Aigusta%20Anastasia%20of%20Lithuania">Aigusta</a> was baptized as Anastasia in order to marry <a href="Simeon%20of%20Russia">Simeon of Russia</a> in 1333; he became <a href="Grand%20Prince%20of%20Moscow">Grand Prince of Moscow</a> in 1341. There is no direct evidence that she was a daughter of Gediminas, but because the marriage was high-profile, most historians have concluded that she was a member of Gediminas' family. The marriage had great potential because Lithuania and Moscow were fierce rivals for supremacy in <a href="Ruthenia">Ruthenia</a>, but conflicts broke out again in 1335, just two years after the marriage. Her two sons Vasilei and Konstantin did not survive infancy; her daughter Vasilisa married Mikhail Vasilevich of <a href="Kashin%20%28town%29">Kashin</a>, a Tverite prince opposing Lithuania. Her brother <a href="Jaunutis">Jaunutis</a> sought her help when he was deposed by Algirdas in 1345. Immediately before her death on 11 March 1345 Aigusta became a nun. She was buried within the <a href="Moscow%20Kremlin">Moscow Kremlin</a> at a monastic church whose construction she had sponsored.

It is possible that Gediminas had two more daughters. According to Maciej Stryjkowski, one of Gediminas' daughters was married to <a href="David%20of%20Hrodna">David of Hrodna</a>, his favorite war leader. However, some historians disagree with the conclusion that David was Gediminas' son-in-law, expressing skepticism about the reliability of Stryjkowski's sources. The existence of another daughter, or possibly another sister, has been hypothesized based on the list of <a href="Metropolitan%20bishop">Metropolitan</a> <a href="Theognostus">Theognostus</a>' property published in 1916. The list contains a note describing Andrei Mstislavich, Duke of <a href="Kozelsk">Kozelsk</a> (ruled ca. 1320 — 1339), as Gediminas' son-in-law. On the other hand, the <a href="Ruthenian%20language">Ruthenian</a> word "ziat"' ("зять") can mean either "son-in-law" or "sister's husband". Hence Andrei of Kozelsk could have been Gediminas' brother-in-law.

The chronicle of <a href="John%20of%20Winterthur">John of Winterthur</a> contains a reference to Gediminas' eight sons. The names of seven sons can be found in various written sources, while the identity of the eighth remains disputed. Alvydas Nikžentaitis suggests that this son was the <a href="Duke%20of%20Trakai">Duke of Trakai</a> who perished in 1337 in the attack on <a href="Bayernburg">Bayernburg</a>. Duke of Trakai was an important position held either by the Grand Duke himself or his second-in-command. Therefore, 18th- and 19th-century historians believed that it was Gediminas himself who died at Bayernburg. Nikžentaitis further postulates that the name of the unknown son might have been Vytautas, as records mention a young and powerful Yuri, son of Vytautas and deputy of <a href="Andrei%20of%20Polotsk">Andrei, son of Algirdas</a>. Yuri died in 1348. His high position in youth could easily be accounted for by being a grandson of Gediminas. However, others dispute these theories, arguing that the note in John of Winterthur's chronicle was misinterpreted.

It is unclear why, but <a href="Jaunutis">Jaunutis</a>, a middle son not mentioned in any written sources before the "<a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>" accomplished by his brothers, was designated by Gediminas as his heir in <a href="Vilnius">Vilnius</a> and consequently became the Grand Duke. His brother <a href="K%C4%99stutis">Kęstutis</a>, Duke of Trakai, was assisting him in <a href="Samogitia">Samogitia</a>. Despite help from Narimantas, Jaunutis was deposed by his brothers <a href="Algirdas">Algirdas</a> and Kęstutis in 1345, just four years after Gediminas' death. Jaunutis tried, but failed, to solicit help from his brother-in-law <a href="Simeon%20of%20Russia">Simeon of Russia</a> and was baptized as "Iwan" in the process. He was forced to reconcile with Algirdas and in compensation received the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Zas%C5%82a%C5%ADje">Duchy of Zasłaŭje</a>, which he ruled until his death in 1366.

Several sons of Gediminas continued his male line, but it was <a href="Algirdas">Algirdas</a> who continued the main Gediminid line. Before deposing his brother Jaunutis in 1345, he ruled <a href="Kreva">Kreva</a> and, despite remaining pagan, married Maria, a daughter of the last prince of <a href="Vitebsk">Vitebsk</a>. After 1345 he became the Grand Duke of Lithuania and shared his power with his brother Kęstutis. Their successful collaboration is celebrated in Lithuanian <a href="historiography">historiography</a>, and gave rise to a much debated theory that a tradition of co-rule or diarchy in Lithuania was customary and arose as early as 1285. The Grand Duchy experienced its greatest expansion during their reign. While Algirdas was mostly active in the east, Kęstutis occupied himself by managing the Duchy's interactions with the Teutonic Knights, Poland, and other western European entities. In 1350 Algirdas contracted a second marriage with <a href="Uliana%20Alexandrovna%20of%20Tver">Uliana of Tver</a>; he chose their son <a href="Jogaila">Jogaila</a> as the next Grand Duke. In 1385 Jogaila opened a new chapter in the <a href="history%20of%20Lithuania">history of Lithuania</a> by <a href="Christianization%20of%20Lithuania">converting the country to Christianity</a> and signing a <a href="Union%20of%20Krewo">personal union with Poland</a>, becoming King of Poland. This <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20union">Polish–Lithuanian union</a>, in various forms, survived until the <a href="Partitions%20of%20Poland">third partition</a> of the <a href="Polish%E2%80%93Lithuanian%20Commonwealth">Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth</a> in 1795. Jogaila's branch of the Gediminids is known as the <a href="Jagiellon%20dynasty">Jagiellon dynasty</a>.
<a href="K%C4%99stutis">Kęstutis</a>, Duke of Trakai, despite exercising considerable autonomy while controlling the western provinces of the duchy, was loyal to Algirdas and acknowledged his superiority. Kęstutis was a devoted pagan and dedicated his life to defending Lithuania from the Teutonic Knights. A popular romantic legend arose about his marriage to the pagan priestess <a href="Birut%C4%97">Birutė</a> of <a href="Palanga">Palanga</a>. They had seven or eight children, including <a href="Vytautas%20the%20Great">Vytautas the Great</a>. After Algirdas' death in 1377, his son Jogaila became the Grand Duke. At first Kęstutis and his son Vytautas acknowledged Jogaila's rule, but after Jogaila signed the controversial <a href="Treaty%20of%20Dovydi%C5%A1k%C4%97s">Treaty of Dovydiškės</a> with the Teutonic Knights, Kęstutis seized Vilnius and became the Grand Duke in late 1381. In August 1382 he was imprisoned in <a href="Kreva">Kreva</a> and died there. Vytautas continued his fight for supremacy, and the conflicts between the descendants of Algirdas and Kęstutis lasted well into the 15th century.

<a href="Manvydas">Manvydas</a> was the eldest son of Gediminas and inherited the territories of <a href="Kernav%C4%97">Kernavė</a> and <a href="Slonim">Slonim</a> from his father. Little is known about him, and he died soon after Gediminas. It is believed that he was killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Str%C4%97va">Battle of Strėva</a> in 1348 along with his brother <a href="Narimantas">Narimantas</a>.

Narimantas was the second son of Gediminas. He was baptized as Gleb and went on to rule <a href="Pinsk">Pinsk</a>, Polotsk, and – as his <a href="Property">patrimony</a> by invitation of <a href="Novgorod">Novgorod</a>'s nobles – <a href="Staraya%20Ladoga">Ladoga</a>, <a href="Oreshek">Oreshek</a> and <a href="Korela">Korela</a>. He initiated a tradition of Lithuanian <a href="mercenary">mercenary</a> service north of Novgorod on the Swedish border that lasted until Novgorod's fall to Moscow in 1477 and helped keep Moscow at bay. In 1345 Narimantas became the strongest supporter of his deposed brother Jaunutis and went to <a href="Jani%20Beg">Jani Beg</a>, Khan of the <a href="Golden%20Horde">Golden Horde</a>, to ask for support against Algirdas and Kęstutis. There are rumors that Narimantas married a Tatar princess, but they lack credibility. After a few years the brothers reconciled, and it is believed that Narimantas led the Battle of Strėva in the name of Algirdas and died there. He left behind three to five sons who founded Russian princely families, including <a href="Kurakin">Kurakin</a> and <a href="Galitzine">Galitzine</a>.

<a href="Karijotas">Karijotas</a> was baptized as Mikhail and inherited <a href="Navahrudak">Navahrudak</a> in <a href="Black%20Ruthenia">Black Ruthenia</a>. In 1348 he was sent by Algirdas to Khan <a href="Jani%20Beg">Jani Beg</a> to negotiate a coalition against the <a href="Teutonic%20Knights">Teutonic Knights</a>, but was handed over to Moscow for ransom. He died about 1363. It is uncertain how many children he had: the number varies between four and nine.

<a href="Liubartas">Liubartas</a> (baptized Dymitr) was Gediminas' youngest son. In the early 1320s he married a daughter of <a href="Andrew%20of%20Galicia">Andrew of Galicia</a> and ruled <a href="Lutsk">Lutsk</a> in eastern Volhynia. After Andrew's and his brother <a href="Lev%20II%20of%20Galicia">Lev of Galicia</a>'s deaths about 1323, Galicia–Volhynia experienced a power vacuum. Rather than promoting Liubartas and risking a war with Poland, Gediminas married his daughter Eufemija to <a href="Boleslaw-Yuri%20II%20of%20Galicia">Boleslaw-Yuri II of Galicia</a>. War with Poland was thereby postponed until 1340. The <a href="Galicia%E2%80%93Volhynia%20Wars">Galicia–Volhynia Wars</a> were settled after 1370, when Poland received <a href="Galicia%20%28Eastern%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>, while Lithuania retained <a href="Volhynia">Volhynia</a>. Liubartas died around 1385, having ruled Volhynia for roughly sixty years. He had three sons.

Melford Stevenson

Sir Aubrey Melford Steed Stevenson (17 October 1902 – 26 December 1987) was an English <a href="barrister">barrister</a> and later a <a href="High%20Court%20judge%20%28England%20and%20Wales%29">High Court judge</a>, whose judicial career was marked by his controversial conduct and outspoken views.

After establishing a legal career in the field of <a href="United%20Kingdom%20insolvency%20law">insolvency</a>, Stevenson served during the Second World War as a Deputy <a href="Judge%20Advocate%20General%20of%20the%20Armed%20Forces">Judge Advocate General of the Armed Forces</a>. He was subsequently Judge Advocate at the 1945 <a href="war%20crimes%20trial">war crimes trial</a> of former personnel of the German submarine "<a href="German%20submarine%20U-852">U-852</a>" for their actions in what became known as the <a href="Heinz-Wilhelm%20Eck%23Peleus%20affair">"Peleus" affair</a>. In 1954 Stevenson represented the government of <a href="British%20Kenya">British Kenya</a> during <a href="Jomo%20Kenyatta">Jomo Kenyatta</a>'s unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel organisation <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Mau Mau</a>. Later that year he represented the litigants in the <a href="Crichel%20Down%20affair">Crichel Down affair</a>, which led to changes in the law on <a href="eminent%20domain">compulsory purchase</a>. In 1955 he defended <a href="Ruth%20Ellis">Ruth Ellis</a>, the last woman to be <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">executed for murder</a> in the United Kingdom, and two years later took part in the unsuccessful prosecution of suspected serial killer <a href="John%20Bodkin%20Adams">John Bodkin Adams</a>. He was deeply distressed by the execution of Ellis, for whom there had been no defence in law, but who was expected to have been reprieved by <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="Gwilym%20Lloyd%20George%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Tenby">Gwilym Lloyd George</a>.

Stevenson became a High Court judge in 1957, and acquired a reputation for severity in sentencing. He sentenced the <a href="Kray%20twins">Kray twins</a> to life imprisonment in 1969, with a recommendation that they serve not less than 30 years each. In 1970 Stevenson passed long sentences on eight Cambridge University students who took part in the <a href="Garden%20House%20riot">Garden House riot</a>, and the following year gave Jake Prescott of the <a href="Angry%20Brigade">Angry Brigade</a> 15 years for conspiracy to cause explosions.

One of his fellow judges, Sir <a href="Robin%20Dunn">Robin Dunn</a>, described him as "the worst judge since the war". After Dunn's attack, several high-profile legal figures came to Stevenson's defence, among them fellow judge and biographer <a href="Eustace%20Roskill%2C%20Baron%20Roskill">Lord Roskill</a>, who pointed out that Stevenson could be merciful to those he regarded as victims. <a href="Patrick%20Devlin%2C%20Baron%20Devlin">Lord Devlin</a> described Stevenson as the "last of the grand eccentrics". Stevenson retired from the bench in 1979 aged 76, and died at <a href="St%20Leonards-on-Sea">St Leonards</a> in East Sussex on 26 December 1987.

Stevenson was born in <a href="Newquay">Newquay</a>, Cornwall, on 17 October 1902, the eldest child and only son of the Reverend John George Stevenson and his wife Olive, sister of <a href="Henry%20Wickham%20Steed">Henry Wickham Steed</a>, journalist and editor of "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" from 1919 until 1922. The Rev. J. G. Stevenson, a <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregational</a> minister, died when his son was fourteen years old, plunging the family into relative poverty. An uncle who was a <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a> funded Stevenson's ongoing education at <a href="Dulwich%20College">Dulwich College</a> in London, intending that the young Stevenson would join the family firm once his schooling was complete. There was no money available to allow him to attend university, so Stevenson studied for an external London University LLB degree after becoming an <a href="articled%20clerk">articled clerk</a> in his uncle's legal practice. Stevenson was determined to become a <a href="barrister">barrister</a>, and joined the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a>, of which he became the treasurer in 1972.

Shortly after being <a href="call%20to%20the%20bar">called to the bar</a> in 1925 he joined the <a href="chambers%20%28law%29">chambers</a> of <a href="Wintringham%20Stable">Wintringham Stable</a> at 2 Crown Office Row, now <a href="Fountain%20Court%20Chambers">Fountain Court Chambers</a>. He remained there for the rest of his legal career except for the war years, eventually becoming head of chambers.

Most of Stevenson's early legal work was in the field of <a href="United%20Kingdom%20insolvency%20law">insolvencies</a>, "almost always with small fees", and he made steady progress until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. He did very little criminal work in this part of his career. In 1940 he joined the army and served until 1945 as a <a href="Judge%20Advocate%20General%20of%20the%20Armed%20Forces">Deputy Judge Advocate</a> with the rank of <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">major</a>; he was appointed a <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> in 1943. In 1945 he served as Judge Advocate at the war crimes trial in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> of former personnel of the German submarine "<a href="German%20submarine%20U-852">U-852</a>", the so-called "Peleus" affair. The U-boat captain, <a href="Heinz-Wilhelm%20Eck">Heinz-Wilhelm Eck</a>, was accused of ordering his crew to open fire on the survivors of a Greek ship, the <a href="SS%20Peleus">SS "Peleus"</a>, which they had just torpedoed and sunk. Eck and two of his junior officers were <a href="execution%20by%20firing%20squad">executed by firing squad</a>; he was the only U-boat commander of the war to be convicted of war crimes committed at sea.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s Stevenson started to build his chambers' high reputation for commercial litigation, together with <a href="Alan%20Stewart%20Orr">Alan Orr</a> and <a href="Leslie%20Scarman%2C%20Baron%20Scarman">Leslie Scarman</a>, supported by a notable clerk, Cyril Batchelor. He was elected a <a href="bencher">bencher</a> of the Inner Temple in 1950, and appointed <a href="Recorder%20%28judge%29">Recorder</a> of Cambridge, a part-time judge, in 1952; he had previously served as Recorder for <a href="Rye%2C%20East%20Sussex">Rye</a> from 1944 to 1951. In 1954 he represented the government of British Kenya during <a href="Jomo%20Kenyatta">Jomo Kenyatta</a>'s unsuccessful appeal against his conviction for membership of the rebel <a href="Mau%20Mau%20Uprising">Mau Mau</a>; Kenyatta was a moderate, and is now considered unlikely to have been a member of the organisation. He was imprisoned until 1959, lived under <a href="house%20arrest">house arrest</a> until 1961, and became the first president of the newly independent Kenya in 1964. Also in 1954 Stevenson represented the Marten family in the <a href="Crichel%20Down%20affair">Crichel Down affair</a>. The <a href="Air%20Ministry">Air Ministry</a> had <a href="eminent%20domain">compulsorily purchased</a> land for bombing practice before the war, promising to return it after the end of hostilities. When they did not honour this promise, the Martens successfully campaigned to be allowed to buy the land back. The case led to a public enquiry, changes in the law on compulsory purchase, and the first resignation of a government minister since 1917.

According to fellow judge <a href="Eustace%20Roskill%2C%20Baron%20Roskill">Eustace Roskill</a>, Stevenson's "fluent delivery, distinctive voice, remarkable sense of timing, and pungency of phrase soon marked him out as an advocate of note." One commentator described him as a "shameless performer" in court. He was probably the most successful barrister of his day.

In 1955, aided by junior counsel <a href="Sebag%20Shaw">Sebag Shaw</a> and <a href="Peter%20Rawlinson%2C%20Baron%20Rawlinson%20of%20Ewell">Peter Rawlinson</a>, Stevenson defended <a href="Ruth%20Ellis">Ruth Ellis</a> against the charge of murdering her lover. Stevenson's decision to keep his cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses to a minimum, and his "near silent performance in court", have been severely criticised by Muriel Jakubait, Ellis's sister. He opened the defence by saying: "Let me make this abundantly plain: there is no question here but this woman shot this man ... You will not hear one word from me – or from the lady herself – questioning that." The jury took 23 minutes to find Ellis guilty; she was sentenced to be hanged, the last woman executed for murder in the United Kingdom. Public revulsion at the case is thought to have played a part in the abolition of <a href="capital%20punishment%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">capital punishment in the UK</a> in 1969.

Stevenson was a leading member of the legal team assisting Sir <a href="Reginald%20Manningham-Buller">Reginald Manningham-Buller</a> during the failed prosecution of alleged serial killer Dr <a href="John%20Bodkin%20Adams">John Bodkin Adams</a> in 1957. The prosecution's conduct of the trial has been heavily criticised, and its decision to drop a second murder charge via a <a href="nolle%20prosequi">nolle prosequi</a> was scathingly described by the trial judge, <a href="Patrick%20Devlin%2C%20Baron%20Devlin">Patrick Devlin</a>, as "an abuse of process", saying: "The use of "nolle prosequi" to conceal the deficiencies of the prosection was an abuse of process, which left an innocent man under the suspicion that there might have been something in the talk of mass murder after all". Stevenson was of the opinion that had he been allowed to, he "could have successfully prosecuted Adams on six murder counts". Journalist <a href="Rodney%20Hallworth">Rodney Hallworth</a> reports that Stevenson said of Adams' decision not to give evidence in court "I firmly believe justice is not served by the present law. It should be possible for the prosecution to directly examine an accused ... It was a clear example of the privilege of silence having enabled a guilty man to escape." In Stevenson's opinion Adams "was so incredibly lucky to have literally got away with murder".

Stevenson was appointed a <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> judge on 1 October 1957, and (as is traditional) was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> a few days later. From 1958 until 1960 he was a member of an Inter-Departmental Committee on Human Artificial Insemination. For the first four years of his judicial career Stevenson was assigned to the <a href="Probate%2C%20Divorce%20and%20Admiralty%20Division">Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division</a>, after which he was transferred to the <a href="Queen%27s%20Bench%20Division">Queen's Bench Division</a>, where he presided over criminal cases. He then began to attract press attention. Known for his outspokenness, Stevenson described one case as a "pretty anaemic kind of rape", because the victim was the accused's ex-girlfriend and had been hitch-hiking, before sentencing the man to a two-year suspended sentence. To a man acquitted of rape, he remarked "I see you come from <a href="Slough">Slough</a>. It is a terrible place. You can go back there." In similar vein he told a husband involved in a divorce case that his decision to live in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> was "a wholly incomprehensible choice for any free man to make".

Following a 1964 parallel of his comments in the wake of the Bodkin Adams case, Stevenson attracted criticism for his summing up to the jury in the case of Ryan (1964) 50 Cr App R 144, at 148:
The academic lawyer <a href="Rupert%20Cross">Rupert Cross</a> described Stevenson's pronouncement as "gibberish", and to the Court of Appeal in 1977 it seemed that Stevenson had made a distinction "without a difference". Although Stevenson's direction was not in accordance with the law in 1964, Parliament introduced a form of caution under the <a href="Police%20and%20Criminal%20Evidence%20Act%201984">Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984</a> that reflects what he proposed. His earlier suggestion that defendants in criminal trials should be forced to answer prosecution questions has not been adopted.

Stevenson believed that it was the judge's duty to help prevent crime by imposing robust punishments on those found guilty, and he became noted for the severity of his sentencing, which led to occasional calls from the "<a href="liberal%20elite">liberal establishment</a>" for his resignation. In 1969 he sentenced the <a href="Kray%20twins">Kray twins</a>, Reggie and Ronnie, to a minimum of 30 years in jail each, saying, "In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities." He remarked later that the Krays had only told the truth twice during the trial: when Reggie referred to a barrister as "a fat slob" and when Ronnie accused the judge of being biased.

In 1970 he controversially gave what were seen as excessively long sentences to eight Cambridge University students who took part in the <a href="Garden%20House%20riot">Garden House riot</a>, a demonstration against the <a href="Greek%20military%20junta%20of%201967%E2%80%931974">Greek military government</a> that turned violent. He noted that the sentences would have been even longer but for the students' exposure to "the evil influence of some members of the university". There were few, if any, examples of serious violence at student demonstrations in the years which followed the trial. The following year he gave a 15-year sentence to Jake Prescott, a member of <a href="the%20Angry%20Brigade">the Angry Brigade</a>, for conspiracy to cause explosions. Prescott had been found not guilty of direct involvement in the bombings, but had admitted to addressing three envelopes. His sentence was reduced to ten years on appeal.

Stevenson turned down a chance to join the <a href="Court%20of%20Appeal%20of%20England%20and%20Wales">Court of Appeal</a>, a decision he later regretted, and was subsequently critical of some of its decisions. He was appointed a <a href="Privy%20Counsellor">Privy Counsellor</a> in the 1973 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>. His reference to the <a href="Sexual%20Offences%20Act%201967">Sexual Offences Act 1967</a> as a "buggers' charter" earned him a reprimand from the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> <a href="Elwyn%20Jones%2C%20Baron%20Elwyn-Jones">Elwyn Jones</a>, and a <a href="motion%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29">parliamentary motion</a> in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">UK House of Commons</a> calling for his resignation. In 1976 the Court of Appeal overturned three of Stevenson's decisions in a single day, and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">MP</a> <a href="Marcus%20Lipton">Marcus Lipton</a> tabled another parliamentary motion calling for his removal from the bench.

But Eustace Roskill cautions that "It would be wrong to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases ... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: "You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's something to be said for him, you do your best not to put him inside." Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.

When asked towards the end of his career whether he had been stung by the criticism he had received, Stevenson replied "A lot of my colleagues are just constipated Methodists". There was no compulsory retirement age for a judge with Stevenson's length of service, which resulted in some speculation following the announcement of his retirement from the bench in 1979 that perhaps his unpopularity with certain sections of the media and establishment had led to pressure on him to step down.

In an article published on the day of Stevenson's retirement <a href="Corinna%20Adam">Corinna Adam</a> of "The Guardian" observed that:
Stevenson married Anna Cecilia Francesca Imelda Reinstein, daughter of a Bavarian hairdresser, in 1929. They had one daughter. He "turned her [his wife] out" after he discovered that she had been having an affair with Colonel <a href="Maurice%20Buckmaster">Maurice Buckmaster</a>, head of the French section of the <a href="Special%20Operations%20Executive">Special Operations Executive</a>. They were divorced in 1942, and she married Buckmaster. Stevenson married his second wife, Rosalind Monica Wagner, the sister of <a href="Anthony%20Wagner">Anthony Wagner</a>, in 1947, and together they had a son – who also became a barrister – and a daughter.

After the war Stevenson stood as the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> candidate to represent <a href="Maldon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29%23Maldon%20county%20constituency%20%281885-1983%29">Maldon</a> in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201945">1945 United Kingdom general election</a>. He opened his campaign by declaring that in the interests of a clean fight, he would make no allusions to the "alleged homosexuality" of his opponent, <a href="Tom%20Driberg">Tom Driberg</a>, who heavily defeated him in the vote; Stevenson returned to his legal practice the following year.

Despite his severe manner, Stevenson was extremely sociable and he was often the centre of a lively crowd at the bar of the <a href="Garrick%20Club">Garrick Club</a>, of which he was a member. His home at <a href="Winchelsea">Winchelsea</a> on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views, but the area had been known by that name for many years before his arrival. Following his retirement, Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders, and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail. Among the programmes he took part in was <a href="ITV%20Granada">Granada Television</a>'s six-part series "<a href="State%20of%20the%20Nation%20%28TV%20series%29">The Bounds of Freedom</a>", broadcast in 1979.

Stevenson died at <a href="St%20Leonards-on-Sea">St Leonards</a> on 26 December 1987. A memorial tablet to him and his wife was erected in the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Rye, in 1992.

Tricholoma pardinum

Tricholoma pardinum, <a href="common%20name">commonly</a> known as spotted tricholoma, tiger tricholoma, tigertop, leopard knight, or dirty trich, is a <a href="Agaricales">gilled mushroom</a> widely distributed across North America and Europe, as well as parts of Asia. It is generally found in <a href="beech">beech</a> woodland in summer and autumn. Two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> have been described from southern Europe. First officially described by <a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a> in 1801, "Tricholoma pardinum" has had a confusing <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> history that extends over two centuries. In 1762, German naturalist <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Jacob Christian Schäffer</a> described the species "Agaricus tigrinus" with an illustration corresponding to what is thought to be "T. pardinum", and consequently, the name "Tricholoma tigrinum" has been used erroneously in some European field guides.

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> of "Tricholoma pardinum" is an imposing mushroom with a pale grey <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> up to 15 cm (6 in) in diameter that is covered with dark brownish to greyish scales. The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are whitish, and are not attached to the stout white to pale grey-brown <a href="stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a>. The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is white. One of the more toxic members of the genus "<a href="Tricholoma">Tricholoma</a>", the species has been implicated in a number of episodes of <a href="mushroom%20poisoning">mushroom poisoning</a>, probably because it is a large, attractive mushroom with a pleasant smell and taste, and it bears a superficial resemblance to several <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> species, like "<a href="Tricholoma%20terreum">Tricholoma terreum</a>". Ingesting "T. pardinum"—even in small quantities—results in a severe, persistent <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a> caused by an unknown <a href="mycotoxin">mycotoxin</a>.

<a href="Christiaan%20Hendrik%20Persoon">Christiaan Hendrik Persoon</a> described this species as "Agaricus myomyces" var. "pardinus" in 1801, although he queried whether it was a distinct species. However, the German naturalist <a href="Jacob%20Christian%20Sch%C3%A4ffer">Jacob Christian Schäffer</a> had in 1762 published "Fungorum qui in Bavaria et Palatinatu circa Ratisbonam nascuntur Icones", in which he described a mushroom he called "Agaricus tigrinus". The illustration accompanying the name fits what we now know as "Tricholoma pardinum", although the description is less clear. To confuse matters further, <a href="Elias%20Magnus%20Fries">Elias Magnus Fries</a> used the name "Agaricus tigrinus" in his 1821 work "<a href="Systema%20Mycologicum">Systema Mycologicum</a>", in accordance with Bulliard's 1782 description, which now corresponds with "<a href="Lentinus%20tigrinus">Lentinus tigrinus</a>". In his 1838 work "Epicrisis systematis mycologici: seu synopsis hymenomycetum", Fries assigned a different fungus again to the binomial name and linked it to Schäffer's 1762 description. French <a href="mycology">mycologist</a> <a href="Lucien%20Qu%C3%A9let">Lucien Quélet</a> reclassified it as a species in 1873, giving it its current <a href="binomial%20name">binomial name</a>. Italian mycologist Alfredo Riva has noted that Swiss mycologist <a href="Louis%20Secretan">Louis Secretan</a> provided a description forty years before Quélet, in his 1833 work "Mycographie Suisse", and queried why it was ignored. He has proposed the fungus be written as "Tricholoma pardinum" (Secr.) Quél. However, Secretan's works are generally not recognised for <a href="nomenclature">nomenclatural</a> purposes because he did not use <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial nomenclature</a> consistently.

There has been confusion over which scientific name to use for over two hundred years. "<a href="Tricholoma%20tigrinum">Tricholoma tigrinum</a>" has been used in some European field guides, but has been applied in error to this species. The uncertainty was such that Czech mycologists Josef Herink and <a href="Franti%C5%A1ek%20Kotlaba">František Kotlaba</a> suggested in 1967 that both designations were incorrect, and proposed the new name "T. pardalotum".

"Tricholoma pardinum" lies within the <a href="subgenus">subgenus</a> "Pardinicutis" of "<a href="Tricholoma">Tricholoma</a>", a grouping of similar species characterised by greyish, brownish, or pallid caps that are woolly or covered in small scales, <a href="spore">spore</a>s with a length between 8 and 11 <a href="micrometre">micrometre</a>s, and abundant <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s in the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e. <a href="Molecular%20phylogenetics">Molecular</a> analyses suggest that "T. pardinum" is closely related to "<a href="Tricholoma%20huronense">T. huronense</a>", "<a href="Tricholoma%20mutabile">T. mutabile</a>", and "<a href="Tricholoma%20venenatum">T. venenatum</a>". "Tricholoma pardinum" var. "filamentosum" is an uncommon <a href="variety%20%28botany%29">variety</a>, described in 1983 by Carlo Luciano Alessio, which produces mushrooms with more <a href="wikt%3Afibrillose">fibrillose</a> caps and stalks than the typical variety. It is found in southern Europe, where it associates with <a href="chestnut">chestnut</a> and <a href="spruce">spruce</a> trees. Another variety has been described as "T. pardinum" var. "unguentatum", characterised by daintier mushrooms that have a greasy coating on their caps.

The <a href="specific%20name%20%28botany%29">specific epithet</a> "pardinum" is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "pardus" "leopard", referring to its <a href="mottle">mottle</a>d or spotted <a href="pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a>. The <a href="genus">generic</a> name derives from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "trichos"/τριχος "hair" and "loma"/λωμα "hem", "fringe", or "border". <a href="Common%20name">Common name</a>s include striped tricholoma, spotted tricholoma, tiger tricholoma, poison trich, leopard knight, and tigertop. Dirty trich was a name coined by author Gary H. Lincoff in response to a publisher's request for a more accessible name than its binomial one for North American guidebooks.

The <a href="basidiocarp">fruit body</a> is a medium-sized mushroom, with a <a href="Pileus%20%28mycology%29">cap</a> 6–10 cm (2.5–4 in) in diameter, though larger specimens occasionally reach 15 cm (6 in). The cap is initially hemispherical before flattening with maturity, and has a broad, shallow <a href="umbo%20%28mycology%29">umbo</a>. The cap margin is initially curled inwards but uncurls as it matures. The cap surface is silvery-grey and covered with concentrically patterned darker scales of a grey, brown or blackish colour that grow paler toward the cap margin, Secretan noting its resemblance to the cap of "<a href="Sarcodon%20imbricatus">Sarcodon imbricatus</a>". The <a href="lamella%20%28mycology%29">gills</a> are free (unattached to the <a href="Stipe%20%28mycology%29">stalk</a>), white and thick, may have a yellow or greenish tint, and may drip water, as may the top of the stalk when broken. With age, the gill edges can become jagged and rough. The gill spacing is rather variable, ranging from distant to crowded; typically, between 100–120 gills extend fully from the stalk to the edge of the cap, with a variable number of lamellulae (shorter gills not extending fully from stalk to cap margin).

The stout stalk may be white, pale grey or pale brown, and is thicker at the base. The texture of the stalk surface ranges from fibrillose (appearing to be made of coarse fibers arranged longitudinally) to more or less smooth, and the stalk base will stain a dirty brown to yellow colour when bruised. It is high and wide, with the base in diameter, and bruises a dirty yellowish colour. There is no <a href="annulus%20%28mycology%29">ring</a> or <a href="volva%20%28mycology%29">volva</a>. The <a href="trama%20%28mycology%29">flesh</a> is whitish and has a pleasant mealy smell and taste. Variety "filamentosum" has a mealy odour and taste reminiscent of cucumber.

The <a href="spore%20print">spore print</a> is white, and the oval to oblong <a href="spore">spore</a>s are 7.5–9.5 <a href="micrometre">μm</a> long by 5.0–7.0 μm wide. Spores are smooth, <a href="hyaline">hyaline</a> (translucent), <a href="nonamyloid">nonamyloid</a>, and have a prominent <a href="hilum%20%28biology%29">hilum</a>. The <a href="basidia">basidia</a> (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to club shaped, four spored, and measure 39–50 by 8.0–9.6 μm. The <a href="cystidia">cystidia</a> present on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are thin walled, hyaline, have a short stalk and a spherical apical portion, and measure 29–41 by 12–21 μm; cystidia are absent from the gill face. The <a href="pileipellis">cap cuticle</a> ranges in cellular form from a cutis (in which the <a href="hypha">hypha</a>e are bent over, running parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (with hyphae emerging roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface); the hyphae comprising the cuticle are cylindrical, and measure 2.0–9.0 μm wide with a club-shaped tip up to 11 μm wide.

"Tricholoma pardinum" mushrooms may be confused with several <a href="edible%20mushroom">edible</a> grey-capped members of the genus "Tricholoma", and some authorities recommend leaving all grey-capped "Tricholoma" mushrooms for experienced <a href="Mushroom%20hunting">hunters</a>. There are several superficially similar European species that could be mistaken for "T. pardinum". The smaller "<a href="Tricholoma%20terreum">T. terreum</a>" lacks a mealy smell and cap scales, is darker coloured and less robust, and has smaller spores measuring 5–7.5 by 4–5 μm. The edible "<a href="Tricholoma%20argyraceum">T. argyraceum</a>" somewhat resembles "T. pardinum"—but with finer scales, and gills and bruised parts that yellow with age. Unlike the preferentially montane "T. pardinum", these lookalikes tend to fruit at lower elevations. "<a href="Tricholoma%20atrosquamosum">T. atrosquamosum</a>" is smaller and darker than "T. pardinum", and has a peppery aroma. "<a href="Tricholoma%20orirubens">T. orirubens</a>" has fine dark scales and pinkish gills, brittle flesh, and is generally smaller. "<a href="Tricholoma%20myomyces">T. myomyces</a>" is smaller than "T. pardinum", has a thin, fibrous partial veil on young specimens, and elliptical spores measuring 5–6 by 3.5–4 μm. The edible and highly regarded "<a href="Tricholoma%20portentosum">T. portentosum</a>" is of a similar size, though has a uniform grey cap that is never scaled.

In North America, "Tricholoma pardinum" can be confused with "<a href="Tricholoma%20nigrum">T. nigrum</a>" and forms of "<a href="Tricholoma%20virgatum">T. virgatum</a>" that have more streaked rather than spotted caps. A form of "T. pardinum" in North America can be nearly white with pale scales, and may be confused with the whitish edible species "<a href="Tricholoma%20resplendens">T. resplendens</a>". Microscopically, the presence of <a href="clamp%20connection">clamp connection</a>s sets "T. pardinum" apart from most other members of the genus, although the similar-looking (though more tan-coloured) "<a href="Tricholoma%20venenatum">T. venenatum</a>" also has them. According to <a href="Alexander%20H.%20Smith">Alexander H. Smith</a>, "<a href="Tricholoma%20huronense">T. huronense</a>" is closely related, but can be distinguished from "T. pardinum" by its narrower gills, its tendency to form drops of reddish liquid on the gills and stalk, and an ash-grey and scaly stalk surface.

"Tricholoma pardinum" is found across Europe, where it is more common in the south. It is abundant in the <a href="Jura%20Mountains">Jura Mountains</a> in eastern France. The species is found in Belgium and Germany, but has not been recorded from the Netherlands or the British Isles. A historical record from Estonia has been discarded because no <a href="herbarium">herbarium</a> specimens could be found. In Asia, it has been recorded from <a href="%C4%B0zmir%20Province">İzmir Province</a> in southwestern Turkey, China, and <a href="Sado%2C%20Niigata">Sado Island</a> in Japan. It is found widely across <a href="temperate">temperate</a> North America, where <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20County%2C%20California">Santa Cruz County</a> and <a href="Sierra%20Nevada%20%28U.S.%29">Sierra Nevada</a> in central <a href="California">California</a> in the west of the continent, and the central <a href="Appalachians">Appalachians</a> in the east form the southern limits of its distribution. "T. pardinum" is commonly associated with <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s in the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and <a href="Pacific%20Northwest">Pacific Northwest</a>, and with tanoak ("<a href="Lithocarpus%20densiflorus">Lithocarpus densiflorus</a>") and madrone ("<a href="Arbutus">Arbutus</a>" spp.) in California. The mushroom can be abundant in some years, especially warmer years with higher rainfall, yet missing or rare for several years in between. In Europe, it is found on chalky soil in woodland with <a href="beech">beech</a> and <a href="fir">fir</a> in summer and autumn, where it prefers areas of some elevation. Although it may be found in groups or <a href="fairy%20ring">fairy ring</a>s, it most commonly occurs singly.

"Tricholoma pardinum" is one of several <a href="poisonous%20mushroom">poisonous</a> members of the genus "<a href="Tricholoma">Tricholoma</a>"; its large size, fleshy appearance, and pleasant smell and taste add to the risk of it being accidentally consumed. It was responsible for over 20 percent of cases of mushroom poisoning in <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> in the first half of the 20th century. Many cases of poisoning arise in the Jura Mountains. Eating it causes highly unpleasant <a href="gastrointestinal%20symptom">gastrointestinal symptom</a>s of <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="dizziness">dizziness</a>, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, and <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>. These arise 15 minutes to 2 hours after consumption and often persist for several hours; complete recovery usually takes 4 to 6 days. <a href="Sweating">Sweating</a> and <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a> may be evident, and disturbance in <a href="liver">liver</a> function has been recorded. Cramping may occur in the calves. In one case, seven people and a cat suffered severe symptoms after sharing a meal that contained only two mushroom caps. The toxin, the identity of which is unknown, appears to cause a sudden <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> of the <a href="mucous%20membrane">mucous membrane</a>s lining the stomach and intestines.

These symptoms may be severe enough to warrant hospitalisation. Treatment is supportive; <a href="antispasmodic">antispasmodic</a> medicines may lessen colicky abdominal cramps, and <a href="Activated%20carbon%23Medical%20applications">activated charcoal</a> may be administered early on to bind residual toxin. <a href="Intravenous%20therapy">Intravenous fluids</a> may be required if <a href="dehydration">dehydration</a> has been extensive, especially with children and the elderly. Once gastric contents are emptied, <a href="metoclopramide">metoclopramide</a> may be used in cases of recurrent vomiting.

God of War: Chains of Olympus

God of War: Chains of Olympus is a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> <a href="video%20game">video game</a> developed by <a href="Ready%20at%20Dawn">Ready at Dawn</a> and <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Santa Monica Studio</a>, and published by <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment">Sony Computer Entertainment</a> (SCE). It was first released for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP) <a href="handheld%20video%20game%20console">handheld console</a> on March 4, 2008. The game is the fourth installment in the <a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29">"God of War" series</a>, the second chronologically, and a prequel to the original "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29">God of War</a>". It is loosely based on <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> and set in <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>, with vengeance as its central motif. The player controls <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a>, a <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n warrior who serves the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian Gods</a>. Kratos is guided by the goddess <a href="Athena">Athena</a>, who instructs him to find the Sun God <a href="Helios">Helios</a>, as the Dream God <a href="Morpheus%20%28mythology%29">Morpheus</a> has caused many of the gods to slumber in Helios' absence. With the power of the Sun and the aid of the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> <a href="Atlas%20%28mythology%29">Atlas</a>, Morpheus and the Queen of the <a href="Greek%20underworld">Underworld</a> <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a> intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Olympus</a>.

The gameplay is similar to the previous installments, with a focus on <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo</a>-based combat, achieved through the player's main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and secondary weapons acquired throughout the game. It features <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a>s that require the player to complete game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">bosses</a>. The player can use up to three magical attacks as alternative combat options. The game also features <a href="puzzle%20video%20game">puzzles</a> and <a href="platform%20game">platforming</a> elements. The control setup was reconfigured for the PSP, as it has fewer buttons than the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>'s <a href="DualShock%202">controller</a>. Ready at Dawn's solution for the controls received praise from critics.

Debuting at No. 5 on the North American charts, "Chains of Olympus" achieved the highest composite score for a PSP title from <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> and <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>. <a href="1UP.com">1UP</a> stated that the game is "a technical showpiece for Sony, and arguably the best-looking game on the system." It won several awards, including "Best PSP Action Game", "Best Graphics Technology", and "Best Use of Sound". In September 2010, "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" named "Chains of Olympus" the best PSP game. By June 2012, the game had sold 3.2 million copies worldwide, making it the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20video%20games%23PlayStation%20Portable">fourth best-selling PlayStation Portable game of all time</a>. Together with "", "Chains of Olympus" was remastered and released on September 13, 2011, as part of the "" for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> (PS3). The remastered version was included in the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20Saga">God of War Saga</a>" released on August 28, 2012, also for PlayStation 3.

"God of War: Chains of Olympus" is a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a> <a href="single-player%20video%20game">single-player</a> video game viewed from a <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Fixed">fixed camera</a> perspective. The player controls the character Kratos in <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo-based combat</a>, <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a>, and <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle game</a> elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, including <a href="cyclops">cyclopes</a>, <a href="Gorgons">Gorgons</a>, <a href="satyr">satyr</a>s, <a href="harpies">harpies</a>, <a href="minotaur">minotaur</a>s, <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a>s, and <a href="sphinx">sphinx</a>es. Morpheus beasts, shades, <a href="banshee">banshee</a>s, fire guards, fire sentries, hyperion guards, and death knights were created specifically for the game. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls, jump across chasms, swing on ropes, and balance across <a href="Beam%20%28structure%29">beams</a> to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can use it as a jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door.

Kratos' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos: a pair of <a href="blade">blade</a>s attached to <a href="Chain%20weapon">chains</a> that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a>—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">magical</a> abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the <a href="Efreet">Efreet</a>, the Light of Dawn, and <a href="Charon%20%28mythology%29">Charon</a>'s Wrath, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a>'s Trident in "God of War"— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.

The challenge mode in this game is called the Challenge of Hades (five trials), and requires players to complete a series of specific tasks (e.g., Burn 50 soldiers with the Efreet). It is unlocked by completing the game. The player may <a href="Unlockable%20%28gaming%29">unlock</a> bonus costumes for Kratos, behind-the-scenes videos, and <a href="concept%20art">concept art</a> of the characters and environments, as rewards. Completion of each of the game's difficulty levels unlocks additional rewards.

As with the previous games in the "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%28franchise%29">God of War</a>" franchise, "God of War: Chains of Olympus" is set in an alternate version of <a href="ancient%20Greece">ancient Greece</a>, populated by the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian Gods</a>, <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titans</a>, and other beings of <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>. With the exception of <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a>, the events are set between those of the games "" (2013) and "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29">God of War</a>" (2005). Several locations are explored, including the real world locations of the ancient cities of <a href="Attica">Attica</a> and <a href="Marathon%2C%20Greece">Marathon</a>, the latter including fictional settings of the Temple of <a href="Helios">Helios</a> and the Caves of <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Olympus</a>, and several other fictional locations, including the <a href="Greek%20underworld">Underworld</a>, which features scenes at the <a href="Styx">River Styx</a>, <a href="Tartarus">Tartarus</a>, the Fields of <a href="Elysium">Elysium</a>, and the Temple of <a href="Persephone">Persephone</a>.

Attica is a war-torn city under assault by the <a href="Persian%20Empire">Persian Empire</a> and their pet <a href="basilisk">basilisk</a>, and is the site of <a href="Eurybiades">Eurybiades</a>' last battle. The city of Marathon is covered in the black fog of the Dream God, <a href="Morpheus%20%28mythology%29">Morpheus</a>. Just beyond the city is the Temple of Helios, which sits atop the Sun Chariot, which has plummeted to Earth in Helios' absence. <a href="Boreas%20%28god%29">Boreas</a>, <a href="Zephyrus">Zephyros</a>, <a href="Eurus">Euros</a>, and <a href="Notus">Notos</a>, <a href="Anemoi">gods</a> of the <a href="North%20wind">north</a>, <a href="West%20wind">west</a>, <a href="East%20wind">east</a>, and <a href="South%20wind">south</a> winds, respectively, reside in the temple and guide the chariot. The Caves of Olympus is a cavern below Mount Olympus and houses the goddess <a href="Eos">Eos</a>, the Primordial Fires, and a statue of <a href="Triton%20%28mythology%29">Triton</a>. The Underworld is the underground realm of the dead and is host to the River Styx and ferryman of the dead, <a href="Charon%20%28mythology%29">Charon</a>. Tartarus is the prison of the dead and the Titans where the massive Titan <a href="Hyperion%20%28mythology%29">Hyperion</a> is chained. The Fields of Elysium are home to deserving souls that roam peacefully and are overlooked by the Temple of Persephone.

The protagonist of the game is <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a> (voiced by <a href="Terrence%20C.%20Carson">Terrence C. Carson</a>), a former Captain of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>'s Army, and once servant to the God of War, <a href="Ares">Ares</a>. He now serves the other Olympian Gods in hopes that they will free him of his nightmares. Other characters include Kratos' mentor and ally <a href="Athena">Athena</a> (<a href="Erin%20Torpey">Erin Torpey</a>), the Goddess of Wisdom; Eos (Erin Torpey), the Goddess of Dawn and sister of Helios; Persephone (<a href="Marina%20Gordon">Marina Gordon</a>), the Queen of the Underworld and the main antagonist; and <a href="Atlas%20%28mythology%29">Atlas</a> (<a href="Fred%20Tatasciore">Fred Tatasciore</a>), a four-armed Titan imprisoned in Tartarus after the <a href="Titanomachy">Great War</a>. Kratos' deceased daughter Calliope (<a href="Debi%20Derryberry">Debi Derryberry</a>) briefly reunites with him in the Fields of Elysium and his wife Lysandra appears in a flashback. Minor characters include Helios (<a href="Dwight%20Schultz">Dwight Schultz</a>), the captured Sun God; Charon (Dwight Schultz), the ferryman of the Underworld; and the <a href="Persian%20Empire">Persian King</a> (Fred Tatasciore), leader of the Persian forces attacking Attica. The Dream God Morpheus is an <a href="unseen%20character">unseen character</a> that affects the plot.

During Kratos' ten years of service to the Olympian Gods, he is sent to the city of Attica to help defend it from the invading Persian army. After successfully killing the Persian King, decimating his army and slaying their pet basilisk, Kratos observes the Sun fall from the sky, plunging the world into darkness. As he fights his way through the city of Marathon, the Spartan witnesses the black fog of the Olympian Morpheus cover the land. He hears a haunting flute melody, which he recognizes as a melody once played by his deceased daughter Calliope. Finding the Temple of Helios, Kratos is tasked by Athena to find the missing Sun God, as Morpheus has caused many of the gods to fall into a deep slumber in the absence of light. The Spartan eventually locates Helios' sister, Eos, who tells Kratos that the Titan Atlas has abducted her brother. Eos advises Kratos to seek the Primordial Fires, which he uses to awaken the fire steeds of Helios. The steeds take the Spartan to the Underworld, where he has two encounters with Charon at the River Styx. Although Charon initially defeats Kratos and banishes him to Tartarus, the Spartan returns and destroys the ferryman.

After locating the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos is given a choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power to be reunited with his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband <a href="Hades">Hades</a>. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold the weight of the world on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will <a href="God%20of%20War%20II">meet again</a>. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.

In a <a href="post-credits%20scene">post-credits scene</a>, Kratos is still riding Helios' chariot back into the sky and after seeing the return of the Sun, Kratos loses consciousness from the exertion and plummets to the ground. At the last moment, Kratos is saved by Athena and Helios, and Athena tells Helios that "He will live."

Game developer <a href="Ready%20at%20Dawn">Ready at Dawn</a> pitched the idea of a "God of War" game for the PlayStation Portable to <a href="SCE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">SCE Santa Monica Studio</a> soon after the original "God of War" launched. In February 2007, Ready at Dawn posted a teaser featuring "Coming Soon" in the "God of War" font. An editor from <a href="1UP.com">1UP</a> obtained an early copy of "God of War II" and posted the game's instruction manual, featuring a one-page teaser with "PSP" in the Omega symbol and stating "Coming 2007". On March 12, 2007, "God of War II" was launched at the <a href="Metreon">Metreon</a>: "God of War II" Game Director <a href="Cory%20Barlog">Cory Barlog</a> officially confirmed the development of "Chains of Olympus", stating "It is its own story that connects to the overall story. "God of War", "God of War II", and then if all the stars align "God of War III" will be the telling of a trilogy. This PSP story will be a further fleshing out." An initial trailer for "Chains of Olympus" was released on April 25, 2007, coinciding with the announcement of a demo on <a href="Universal%20Media%20Disc">UMD</a>—the <a href="optical%20disc">optical disc</a> medium for the PSP. The trailer is narrated by voice actress <a href="Linda%20Hunt">Linda Hunt</a>.

"God of War: Chains of Olympus" uses a proprietary, in-house engine referred to as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, "<a href="Daxter%20%28video%20game%29">Daxter</a>" (2006), to include a fluid and cloth simulator. The <a href="camera%20system">camera system</a> was modified to cater to the fixed cinematic camera for "God of War" gameplay, and the lighting system was reworked to aid in presenting realistic graphics. The game was originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222 <a href="megahertz">megahertz</a> (MHz) processor. Ready at Dawn repeatedly contacted Sony regarding increasing the <a href="clock%20speed">clock speed</a> of the PSP on account of the difference to the game and had developed a version of the game with higher speed. Sony released <a href="PlayStation%20Portable%20system%20software%23Version%203">a firmware upgrade</a> that allowed games to use the full 333 MHz processor. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence. The upgrade, however, noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, Game Director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.

Two of the voice actors returned from the previous installments to reprise their roles, which were Terrence C. Carson and Linda Hunt, who voiced Kratos and the narrator respectively. Erin Torpey adopted the dual roles of Athena and Eos. Fred Tatasciore, who voiced different characters in previous installments, returned, and in this game, voiced both Atlas and the Persian King. <a href="Carole%20Ruggier">Carole Ruggier</a> and <a href="Michael%20Clarke%20Duncan">Michael Clarke Duncan</a> did not return to reprise their roles, which were Athena and Atlas respectively.

Due to the delay of the game, Ready at Dawn offered a "special edition" version of the demo to pre-order customers, with one Ready at Dawn developer stating that preparation of the special demo disc took up to 40% of the team's production time.

"God of War: Chains of Olympus" was originally scheduled to be released during the fourth quarter of 2007, but it was rescheduled and released on March 4, 2008, in North America, March 27 in Australia, March 28 in Europe, and July 10 in Japan, where it was published by <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a>. The game was a commercial success, debuting at No. 5 on the North American charts with 340,500 copies sold in the first month. The game was re-released in Europe on October 17, 2008, as part of Sony's <a href="Platinum%20Range">Platinum Range</a> and was also re-released in Japan and North America in April 2009 under Capcom's Best Price and Sony's <a href="Greatest%20Hits%20%28budget%20range%29">Greatest Hits</a> labels, respectively. It became available for download from the PlayStation Store on September 30, 2009, in North America, October 1 in Europe, and November 11, 2010, in Japan. Sony released a limited-edition bundle pack only in North America, on June 3, 2008. The pack included the game, a UMD of the 2007 film "<a href="Superbad%20%28film%29">Superbad</a>", a voucher for the PSP title "", and a red edition of the console imprinted with an image of Kratos' face on the rear. As of June 2012, "Chains of Olympus" has sold more than 3.2 million copies worldwide.

Together with "", the game was released for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> as part of the "" (called "God of War Collection – Volume II" in Europe) on September 13, 2011, in North America, September 16 in Europe, September 29 in Australia, and October 6 in Japan. The collection is a remastered <a href="Video%20game%20porting">port</a> of both games to the PS3 hardware, with features including <a href="high-definition%20video">high-definition</a> resolution, <a href="stereoscopic%203D">stereoscopic 3D</a>, <a href="Multisample%20anti-aliasing">anti-aliased</a> graphics locked at 60 frames per second, <a href="DualShock%203">DualShock 3</a> vibration function, and <a href="PlayStation%203%20Trophies">PlayStation 3 Trophies</a>.

"God of War: Chains of Olympus" received "universal acclaim" according to <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> with a score of 91 out of 100, and a 91.44% at <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>, achieving the highest composite score for a PlayStation Portable title. The game was praised for its graphics and presentation. Matt Leone of 1UP claimed "Chains of Olympus" is "a technical showpiece for Sony, and arguably the best-looking game on the system." Robert Falcon of Modojo.com similarly praised the presentation, calling it "an absolute stunner, the pinnacle of PSP development". He also praised the visuals as "absolutely breathtaking," and that the "game moves beautifully throughout, with very little loss in detail or speed." However, <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a>'s Jonathan Hunt said that it "occasionally suffers from screen tearing and framerate drops."

Several reviewers praised Ready at Dawn's solution for the controls and gameplay. Because the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> (PS2) controller has two analog sticks and the PSP only has one, "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" stated "the lack of a second analog stick could have been problematic but it's not." Modojo.com similarly stated that despite the lack of a second analog stick, "Kratos handles superbly on the PSP" and that the weapon and magic attacks are "mapped out perfectly around the PSP's control set-up." <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s Chris Roper even claimed the control scheme "works better than on the PS2." Roper further claimed that Ready at Dawn "has done a stellar job of keeping Kratos' move set intact," stating that "combat is extremely responsive." Matt Leone of 1UP similarly praised developers solution for the control scheme as well as the game's "fantastic" pacing. However, "GamePro" criticized the relative lack of variety in enemies. The puzzles were criticized, and G4 claimed that some "are so maddeningly difficult to solve", while <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Aaron Thomas noted the lack of puzzles, claiming that it "could have used more". "GamePro" also criticized the fact that "You still have to lug boxes around to solve environmental puzzles". Kristan Reed of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> also criticized Ready at Dawn for cutting some puzzles, as well as cutting co-op play, multiplayer, dialogue, and characters.

GameSpot and IGN criticized the short length and minimal boss fights, although "GamePro" stated that it has "the same epic feel" as the previous installments and claimed that if it was the only "God of War" title, "it would still stand on its own merits." Cheat Code Central claimed "Chains of Olympus" is "one of the best games ever made for the PSP." They claimed that it is "definitely a must-buy game for all current fans" and that it "has everything you've come to expect from "God of War", just in a little disc and on a smaller screen." GameTrailers went on to praise the replay value for being able to "bring your powered-up methods of destruction with you."

In IGN's Best of 2008 Awards, "Chains of Olympus" received the awards for "Best PSP Action Game", "Best Graphics Technology", and "Best Use of Sound". In GameSpot's Best Games of 2008, it received the "Readers' Choice Award". <a href="GameFan">Diehard GameFAN</a> awarded it "Best PSP Game" for 2008. At the 2008 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, it was a nominee for "Best Handheld Game". It was Metacritic's 2008 "PSP Game of the Year".

Uriel Sebree

Uriel Sebree (February 20, 1848 – August 6, 1922) was a career officer in the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. He entered the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">Naval Academy</a> during the <a href="United%20States%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and served until 1910, retiring as a <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a>. He is best remembered for his two expeditions into the <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> and for serving as acting <a href="governor%20of%20American%20Samoa">governor of American Samoa</a>. He was also commander-in-chief of the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">Pacific Fleet</a>.

After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1867, Sebree was posted to a number of vessels before being assigned to a rescue mission to find the remaining crew of the missing <a href="Polaris%20expedition">"Polaris"</a> in the Navy's first mission to the Arctic. This attempt was only a partial success—the "Polaris" crew was rescued by a British ship rather than the US Navy—but this led to Sebree's selection eleven years later for a second expedition to the Arctic. That mission to rescue <a href="Adolphus%20Greely">Adolphus Greely</a> and the survivors of the Lady Franklin Bay expedition was a success. Sebree was subsequently appointed as the second acting <a href="governor%20of%20American%20Samoa">governor of American Samoa</a>. He served in this position for only a year before returning to the United States. In 1907, he was promoted to rear admiral and given command of the Pathfinder Expedition around the South American coast before being appointed commander of the 2nd Division of the Pacific Fleet and then commander-in-chief of the entire fleet. He retired in 1910 and died in <a href="Coronado%2C%20California">Coronado, California</a>, in 1922. Two geographical features in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>—<a href="Sebree%20Peak">Sebree Peak</a> and <a href="Sebree%20Island">Sebree Island</a>—are named for Admiral Sebree.

Uriel Sebree was born in <a href="Fayette%2C%20Missouri">Fayette, Missouri</a>, on February 20, 1848, to Judge John Sebree, called "one of the prominent citizens of old Howard County" by the "Jefferson County Tribune", and his wife. Uriel was the first of two sons. His brother, Frank P. Sebree, became a <a href="lawyer">lawyer</a>. Uriel entered the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> on July 23, 1863, during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. After his graduation in 1867, his first assignment was on board . Over the next few years Sebree won repeated promotion: to <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a> in 1868, <a href="master%20%28naval%29">master</a> in 1870, and <a href="Lieutenant%20%28navy%29">lieutenant</a> in 1871. In 1873 he transferred to the <a href="ironclad">ironclad</a> .

One episode in Sebree's early military history which influenced his later career was his participation in the second "Polaris" rescue mission. The <a href="Polaris%20expedition">Polaris expedition</a> was an 1871–72 exploration of the Arctic that had aimed to reach the <a href="North%20Pole">North Pole</a>. The expedition was troubled from the start: its leader, <a href="Charles%20Francis%20Hall">Charles Francis Hall</a>, died in mysterious circumstances before the end of their first winter. The following year, the "Polaris" remained trapped in ice and unable to return home. During a violent storm, the crew was separated into two groups: a small group of explorers was stranded on the now-crippled "Polaris" and the remainder were marooned on an <a href="Drift%20ice">ice floe</a>. These latter 19 survivors were discovered by chance and rescued by the civilian <a href="whaler">whaler</a> . Because of the "Tigress"'s success, the Navy chartered the ship, temporarily rechristened her USS "Tigress", and used her to launch a rescue attempt to locate the remainder of the crew. For this attempt the ship would be commanded by a group of eight navy officers, led by Captain James A. Greer, although much of the original civilian crew was retained. Lieutenant Sebree was one of the officers chosen for the mission.

This rescue mission was the first official United States military expedition to the Arctic; previous expeditions, including that of the "Polaris" itself, had been led by civilians. The "Tigress" sailed from <a href="New%20York%2C%20New%20York">New York</a> on July 14, 1873, traveling first to <a href="St.%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland">St. John's, Newfoundland</a> and then to <a href="Godhavn">Godhavn</a> and <a href="Upernavik">Upernavik</a> in <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> before following the coast further north. The crew searched <a href="North%20Star%20Bay">North Star Bay</a>, <a href="Northumberland%20Island">Northumberland Island</a>, and <a href="Hartstene%20Bay">Hartstene Bay</a> before discovering the first sign of the "Polaris" crew: a camp on <a href="Littleton%20Island%20%28Arctic%29">Littleton Island</a> where they had wintered, now occupied by <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a>. The missing men, the rescuers were told, had constructed makeshift boats salvaged from their destroyed ship and traveled south. Acting on this clue, the "Tigress" searched the <a href="Baffin%20Island">Baffin Island</a> coast to <a href="Cumberland%20Sound">Cumberland Sound</a>, and then the Greenland coast from <a href="Ivigtut">Ivigtut</a> to <a href="Fisken%C3%A6sset">Fiskenæsset</a> and the <a href="Davis%20Strait">Davis Strait</a>, before returning to St. John's for fuel. Once there, they learned that the "Polaris" survivors had been rescued by a <a href="United%20Kingdom">British</a> ship and that their search was over. After returning to New York the "Tigress" was transferred back to civilian use.

After this expedition, Sebree was assigned to the <a href="screw%20frigate">screw frigate</a> where he remained for three years. In 1878, he was assigned to work with the <a href="United%20States%20Coast%20Survey">United States Coast Survey</a> on board the <a href="USC%26amp%3BGS%20A.%20D.%20Bache">"A. D. Bache"</a>. The following year he was given his first two commands: the <a href="USC%26amp%3BGS%20Silliman">"Silliman"</a> and then the <a href="USC%26amp%3BGS%20Thomas%20R.%20Gedney">"Thomas R. Gedney"</a>, both ships of the United States Coast Survey. He remained on the latter ship for nearly three years before being assigned to in 1882. In 1883, he was given his first command of a Navy ship, , with orders to sail to <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>.

On October 3, 1883, prior to leaving for Alaska, the "Pinta" collided with the civilian <a href="brig">brig</a> "Tally Ho" off the coast of <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a>. Sebree was not held directly responsible for the collision, as he was below deck at the time, but it was alleged that he did not do enough to determine whether the other ship was damaged before sailing away. Charges were brought against him in November and in December he was found guilty of "culpable negligence and inefficiency in the performance of his duty". He was sentenced to be suspended from rank and duty for three years with an official reprimand from the <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a>. Believing the sentence to be too harsh, Secretary <a href="William%20E.%20Chandler">William E. Chandler</a> reduced it to a public reprimand only. Sebree was subsequently transferred to , although not as the ship's commanding officer.

One month after joining the "Powhatan", Sebree was transferred again, this time to serve as the <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a> of for another trip into the Arctic. In 1881, Army Lieutenant <a href="Adolphus%20Greely">Adolphus Greely</a> had left on an expedition to establish a base at <a href="Lady%20Franklin%20Bay">Lady Franklin Bay</a> on northern <a href="Ellesmere%20Island">Ellesmere Island</a> (now part of the <a href="Canada">Canadian</a> territory of <a href="Nunavut">Nunavut</a>). Greely was left with provisions for three years but was to expect supply ships in 1882 and 1883. Both attempts to resupply the expedition failed and, with Greely's provisions running low, the Navy prepared an expedition in early 1884 to attempt a resupply or rescue. The expedition was led by Captain <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Schley">Winfield Scott Schley</a> and consisted of lead ship USS "Thetis" (with Sebree as the executive officer and navigator), , and the borrowed <a href="HMS%20Alert%20%281856%29">HMS "Alert"</a>. Many of the officers, including Sebree, were selected for their previous Arctic experience. The "Thetis" left New York on May 1, 1884, and the group slowly progressed through the ice of <a href="Melville%20Bay">Melville Bay</a>, chasing clues and records left by the expedition, to finally discover the survivors of Greely's camp off <a href="Cape%20Sabine">Cape Sabine</a> on June 22, 1885. Of the 25 members of the expedition, only 6 survived (one more died on the return journey). The expedition sailed first for <a href="Upernavik%2C%20Greenland">Upernavik, Greenland</a>, arriving on July 2, 1884, and then made its way back to the United States, landing at <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Portsmouth, New Hampshire</a> on August 1, 1884. Schley later reported that a delay of just two more days would have been fatal to the remaining six members of the expedition. Sebree and the other members of the relief expedition gained fame from the voyage. Even ten years later, in 1895, a report by "The New York Times" celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United States Naval Academy listed Sebree as one of the most "famous" graduates, despite his relatively low rank.

After his return from the expedition Sebree taught at the Naval Academy for two years before being transferred to the 13th Lighthouse District, to serve as the <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a> inspector for <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a> and <a href="Washington%20Territory">Washington Territory</a>. While stationed there he was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20commander%20%28United%20States%29">lieutenant commander</a> in March 1889.

In September 1889 he was made the <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a> of , again under Captain Schley. Both men were still serving aboard the "Baltimore" when its sailors were attacked in <a href="Valparaiso%2C%20Chile">Valparaiso, Chile</a> in October 1891, and gave testimony toward the events during the later investigation.

From September 1892 to July 1893, Sebree served as assistant to the inspector of the 3rd <a href="United%20States%20Lighthouse%20Board">Lighthouse District</a>.

Sebree taught at the Academy from 1893 to 1896. At the end of his time there, he was briefly given command of before being put in command of the "Thetis", which was doing survey work off the coast of <a href="California">California</a>. In 1897 he was promoted to <a href="commander">commander</a>. During the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>, Sebree again commanded the "Wheeling" in the Pacific for the duration of the war. His assignment was to patrol the coast of Alaska and the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, far from both the Caribbean and Pacific theaters of the war, and he saw no significant action. After the war, he was transferred to the 12th Lighthouse District as an inspector.

On October 9, 1901, Sebree was promoted to <a href="captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a> and received orders to travel to <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a> to take command of and to be <a href="commandant">commandant</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Station%20Tutuila">United States Naval Station Tutuila</a>. Three days later, he was promoted to <a href="captain%20%28United%20States%29">captain</a>. At this time the commandant of the naval station was considered the acting governor of the territory as Congress had not yet formalized the U.S. Navy's role there. Sebree was the replacement for Commandant <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Tilley">Benjamin Franklin Tilley</a>, who had recently had charges brought against him for immorality and drunkenness. While Sebree was in transit to the islands, Tilley was tried and acquitted of the charges against him but the decision to replace him was not changed. Captain Sebree arrived in Samoa and took up his new post on November 27, 1901.

Unlike Tilley, who had been the first acting governor of the territory, Sebree was very concerned about his legal status. Officially, he was only commandant of the naval station then under construction, although the deed of cession of the territory acknowledged his theoretical authority to govern the people. He was concerned that lawsuits could be brought against him or future acting governors until the situation was clarified and made official by the United States government. To this end, he made a recommendation to the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> to assemble a panel to consider the territory's status and requested that an Assistant Secretary of the Navy come to the territory to meet with him. Both requests were refused. A further example of this ambiguity came in March 1902, when Sebree received orders to give up command of the "Abarenda" to give him additional time as commandant and "governor". To these orders, he responded that he still had not been officially made "governor" and that, if he were to act as a governor, he should be given the proper credentials and legal authority to do so. The Navy did not respond directly to Sebree's request, but he was given command of USS "Wheeling" three months later.

Despite his protests, Sebree did act as the governor of the territory. During his administration, the United States Congress approved $35,000 to pay off debts related to construction costs for the naval station, and planning began for the construction of a <a href="lighthouse">lighthouse</a> on <a href="Aunu%27u">Aunu'u</a>. The Fita Fita Guard, the local militia that Tilley had organized, continued its training, and Sebree arranged to train some members of the force as a military-style <a href="brass%20band">brass band</a>. Sebree also attempted to improve local agriculture and even petitioned the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">Department of Agriculture</a> for assistance, but was turned down.

Tensions escalated between foreign traders on Samoa and the local populace, due in part to controls which Tilley had put in place to protect Samoan farmers from exploitation. Dr. David Starr Jordan, a prominent American <a href="biologist">biologist</a> doing research in the territory, was so concerned by these tensions that he sent a letter to <a href="United%20States%20President">President</a> <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> asking that a trader not be made governor of the territory, if a civil administration were created. Shortly after, many traders and locals, including a Samoan tax collector, circulated a petition requesting a change in the way the <a href="copra">copra</a> crop was taxed and asking for the Navy to cease governing the territory. The petition was sent to members of Congress and the cause was picked up by <a href="California">California</a> representative <a href="Julius%20Kahn%20%28congressman%29">Julius Kahn</a> and gathered significant press coverage. This movement eventually reached President Roosevelt; his decision was not to act on the petition.

On December 16, 1902, Sebree was granted a leave of absence to return to the United States and care for his wife who had been badly hurt in a fall. In his place, Lieutenant Commander <a href="Henry%20Minett">Henry Minett</a>, Sebree's executive officer, was made acting commandant of the station and therefore acting governor of the territory. He was also given command of the "Wheeling". Captain <a href="Edmund%20Beardsley%20Underwood">Edmund Beardsley Underwood</a> was selected as Sebree's replacement, but that decision was not made official immediately, and Underwood remained in Washington to consult with Sebree and President Roosevelt on the governance of the territory. Underwood's selection was not announced until May 1903.

Following his wife's recovery, Sebree returned to service and was given command of on February 11, 1903. The "Wisconsin" was the flagship of the North Squadron of the Pacific fleet under <a href="Robley%20D.%20Evans">Robley D. Evans</a>. While under Sebree's command, the "Wisconsin" and her crew were evaluated as one of the best, according to annual targeting exercises.

In the late summer of 1903, <a href="Paymaster">Paymaster</a> Rishworth Nicholson of assaulted a <a href="Germany">German</a> <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">Consul</a> at a <a href="Ball%20%28dance%29">ball</a> in <a href="Yantai%2C%20China">Yantai, China</a>. He was promptly brought up on charges of "drunkenness", "scandalous conduct tending to the destruction of good morals", and "falsehood" and taken to the "Wisconsin" for his court martial. Sebree and a group of six other officers found him guilty of the first charge, guilty of a lesser offense for the second charge, and not guilty on the third. His sentence was determined to be a reduction in grade equivalent to one year of seniority. Three of the officers, not including Sebree, wrote a supplementary opinion requesting clemency for Nicholson.

However, Rear Admiral Evans, the commander of the <a href="Asiatic%20Squadron">Asiatic Squadron</a>, rejected the verdict as inadequate and requested that the court reconsider the decision. The court reconvened and returned the same judgment and sentence. In response, Evans wrote a scathing critique of the process, calling it a "travesty of justice" and stating that Nicholson's actions were "less reprehensible than his judges". This critical essay was required to be posted at every naval base and on every ship in the Pacific and was reprinted in full by "The New York Times" and other civilian newspapers. Evans banned the three officers who had publicly requested clemency from participating in future courts martial. Press reports questioned whether Evans had that authority as the military justice system was intended to be impartial. In late September 1903, the three officers who had been named in the critique filed a protest with <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="William%20Henry%20Moody">William Henry Moody</a> stating that Admiral Evans had overstepped his authority by publicly reprimanding them without a court martial and that charges should be brought against him. On November 18, 1903, Moody denied the petition and the sentences were left to stand.

During this controversy, Sebree remained silent on the issue, and it is unknown whether he was a member of the majority or not. Evans commented in his critique that he was unsure who the other supporters of the majority decision were. As criticism swirled around the trial itself, the editors of the magazine "United Service" defended Sebree and stated that he had "universal esteem throughout the Navy service" and that he had a "large experience, sound judgment, even temper and most excellent record". Following this announcement, Sebree was transferred to the <a href="Naval%20War%20College">Naval War College</a> in <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> to work as an instructor and as Secretary of the <a href="United%20States%20Lighthouse%20Board">Lighthouse Board</a>.

In December 1905, a storm and mechanical failures caused major problems for the crew of the <a href="lightvessel">lightvessel</a> <a href="Nantucket%20Lightship%20LV58">Lightship "No. 58"</a> anchored off of <a href="Nantucket">Nantucket</a>. Her crew, led by Captain James Jorgensen, fought for two days to prevent the vessel from foundering, but were ultimately unsuccessful. They were rescued by Captain Gibbs of the <a href="USLHT%20Azalea%20%281891%29">"Azalea"</a>. The fallout over this incident caused enough of a stir that the military had to respond to it directly. Under Navy rules, the eleven officers and crew members of the "No. 58" were denied pay while they were recovering from their injuries and until they were posted to new vessels under a regulation that prohibited pay to sailors whose ships had sunk. The sailors appealed to Sebree, as Secretary of the Lighthouse Board, but he did not or could not accommodate them. Instead, the officers were given commendations by Secretary <a href="Victor%20H.%20Metcalf">Victor H. Metcalf</a> and "preference in future appointments". Admiral Dewey and Captain Sebree made a second recommendation, which was approved, that Captain Gibbs receive a commendation and a pay increase for his service.

Sebree was promoted to <a href="rear%20admiral">rear admiral</a> in 1907 and was given command of a <a href="Squadron%20%28naval%29">squadron</a> of two ships: his <a href="flagship">flagship</a>, , and . This so-called "Pathfinder Squadron" would travel from New York to California via Cape Horn. This mission allowed the Navy to show off two of its newest <a href="cruisers">cruisers</a> to South American governments as well as transfer ships to the Pacific Fleet in what was seen as an example of American <a href="gunboat%20diplomacy">gunboat diplomacy</a>. Along the way, Sebree had formal meetings with <a href="President%20of%20Brazil">Brazilian President</a> <a href="Afonso%20Pena">Afonso Pena</a>, <a href="President%20of%20Peru">Peruvian President</a> <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Pardo%20y%20Barreda">José Pardo y Barreda</a>, and United States diplomatic staff in both countries. He also met with representatives in <a href="Chile">Chile</a> and other countries. When the squadron finally arrived in California, it was joined by and participated in public-relations events at West Coast ports. The diplomatic mission over, the Pathfinder Squadron, with the "California" and others, became the 2nd division of the <a href="United%20States%20Pacific%20Fleet">United States Pacific Fleet</a>, with Sebree remaining in command. Rear Admiral <a href="William%20T.%20Swinburne">William T. Swinburne</a> was placed in command of the full fleet.

On June 5, 1908, Sebree was nearly killed during a speed trial of the "Tennessee" off the coast of California. He had just completed a tour of the starboard boiler room when a steam pipe burst, instantly killing two officers and wounding ten others, three fatally. Witnesses reported that Sebree and other officers had left the boiler room only 50 seconds earlier.

In August 1908, the full Pacific Fleet was dispatched to numerous ports in the Pacific Ocean on a diplomatic mission similar to the one undertaken by Sebree in South America the previous year. On this voyage, Sebree and Swinburne met with leaders and representatives from the <a href="Territory%20of%20Hawaii">Territory of Hawaii</a>, the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="Western%20Samoa">Western Samoa</a>, and <a href="Panama">Panama</a>. While visiting the Western Samoan capital of <a href="Apia">Apia</a>, Sebree was presented with a souvenir album of Samoan scenery in honor of his time as governor of neighboring American Samoa.

On April 15, 1909, Admiral Swinburne, the commander-in-chief of the Pacific Fleet, announced his retirement, and Sebree was appointed to replace him on May 17. Good public relations remained a major goal of the fleet, and in June, the fleet was displayed at the <a href="Alaska%E2%80%93Yukon%E2%80%93Pacific%20Exposition">Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition</a>. President <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a> led the exposition's opening ceremony, and many American dignitaries were in attendance.

Sebree's final mission before his retirement saw him lead the Pacific Fleet on a tour of ports in east Asia. The fleet left San Francisco on September 5, 1909, sailing west to the Philippines, with only brief stops en route. Speed testing was a major goal of the early part of the voyage and he and his fleet of eight ships broke speed records by sailing to Honolulu in just over four days. Six of the eight ships were able to make the voyage in that time; the "Colorado" and "West Virginia" had mechanical failures which prevented them from completing the voyage on time. On the "Colorado", those failures led to the deaths of two crewmen due to a steam pipe explosion. From Hawaii, the fleet moved on to <a href="Manila">Manila</a> where the ships performed target practices and exercises, as well as being cleaned and repainted, before resuming their primary mission by sailing to <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. In Japan, the fleet dispersed and small groups of cruisers were dispatched to the ports of British-controlled <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>, <a href="Wusong">Wusong</a> in <a href="China">China</a>, and <a href="Kobe%2C%20Japan">Kobe, Japan</a>. Afterwards, the fleet returned home. Just before Sebree's retirement the Pacific Fleet was split into two: a smaller Pacific Fleet and an <a href="Asiatic%20Fleet">Asiatic Fleet</a> commanded by Rear Admiral <a href="John%20Hubbard%20%28admiral%29">John Hubbard</a>. On February 19, 1910, Sebree officially retired and was replaced as head of the Pacific Fleet by Rear Admiral <a href="Giles%20B.%20Harber">Giles B. Harber</a>.

Shortly after retiring, Sebree was given a farewell banquet which included British <a href="Field%20Marshal">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Herbert Kitchener</a> as a notable guest and <a href="Governor%20of%20California">California Governor</a> <a href="James%20Gillett">James Gillett</a> as toastmaster. In retirement, Sebree continued to attend Navy functions. In 1916, Sebree reported that the United States Navy lagged behind the world's other major navies. A single <a href="dreadnought">dreadnought</a>, he claimed, could ravage the entire Pacific Fleet which was at that time relying on <a href="submarine">submarine</a>s for defense. The Atlantic Fleet already had dreadnoughts in commission.

Sebree died at his home in <a href="Coronado%2C%20California">Coronado, California</a> on August 6, 1922. He and his wife, Anne Bridgman Sebree, are buried in <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>. They had one son, John Bridgman Sebree (1889–1948), who served in the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a>.

<a href="Sebree%20Peak">Sebree Peak</a> and <a href="Sebree%20Island">Sebree Island</a>, both in Alaska, are named for the admiral.

William Warelwast

William Warelwast (died 1137), was a medieval Norman cleric and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Exeter">Bishop of Exeter</a> in England. Warelwast was a native of Normandy, but little is known about his background before 1087, when he appears as a royal clerk for King <a href="William%20II%20of%20England">William II of England</a>. Most of his royal service to William was as a diplomatic envoy, as he was heavily involved in the king's dispute with <a href="Anselm%20of%20Canterbury">Anselm</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>, which constituted the English theatre of the <a href="Investiture%20Controversy">Investiture Controversy</a>. He went several times to Rome as an emissary to the <a href="Pope">papacy</a> on business related to Anselm, one of whose supporters, the medieval chronicler <a href="Eadmer">Eadmer</a>, alleged that Warelwast bribed the pope and the papal officials to secure favourable outcomes for King William.

Possibly present at King William's death in a hunting accident, Warelwast served as a diplomat to the king's successor, <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>. After the resolution of the Investiture Controversy, Warelwast was rewarded with the <a href="Episcopal%20see">bishopric</a> of <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a> in Devon, but he continued to serve Henry as a diplomat and royal judge. He began the construction of a new <a href="Exeter%20Cathedral">cathedral at Exeter</a>, and he probably divided the diocese into <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a>ries. Warelwast went blind after 1120, and after his death in 1137 was succeeded by his nephew, <a href="Robert%20Warelwast">Robert Warelwast</a>.

Little is known of Warelwast's background or family before 1087. Later in life he was involved in founding <a href="Order%20of%20Saint%20Augustine">Augustinian</a> houses of <a href="canon%20%28priest%29">canons</a>, which – according to historian  – implies that he was an Augustinian canon or spent some of his early years in a house of such canons. Several medieval chroniclers hostile to Warelwast, including Eadmer, claim that he was illiterate, but his career suggests otherwise, as it involved the extensive use of written documents. He must also have been an accomplished speaker, given the number of times he was used as a diplomat. He was possibly educated at <a href="Laon">Laon</a>, where later in life he sent his nephew, Robert Warelwast, to school. Another nephew, William, became the bishop's steward.

Warelwast may have been a clerk for King <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William I of England</a>, as a confirmation charter from the time of King <a href="Stephen%2C%20King%20of%20England">Stephen</a> (reigned 1135–1154) records that a grant of churches in Exeter was given to Warelwast by ""Willelmus, avus meus"", or "William, my grandfather/ancestor"; Stephen was a grandson of William I, who reigned 1066–1087. But this charter may be a forgery, or the Willelmus referred to may have been William II rather than William I. The charter itself is insufficient evidence to confidently assert that Warelwast served William I, even though most such grants were made as a reward for royal service. It may have been that Warelwast was awarded land by William I not because he was a royal servant but because he was a relative; certainly the late-medieval writer <a href="William%20Worcester">William Worcester</a> claimed that Warelwast was related to the king.

The first reliable mentions of Warelwast occur early in the reign of King William II, when Warelwast appears as authorizing <a href="writ">writ</a>s for the king. As well as being a royal clerk, Warelwast acted as a judge in a legal case between <a href="St%20Florent%20Abbey">St Florent Abbey</a> in <a href="Saumur">Saumur</a> and <a href="F%C3%A9camp%20Abbey">Fécamp Abbey</a>, heard before King William II some time between 1094 and 1099 at <a href="Foucarmont">Foucarmont</a>.

Warelwast served the king as an envoy to Pope <a href="Pope%20Urban%20II">Urban II</a> in 1095, when the king was seeking to have the newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Canterbury, removed from office. He visited the pope with another royal clerk, <a href="Gerard%20%28Archbishop%20of%20York%29">Gerard</a>, with orders to recognize Urban as pope in return for Anselm's deposition, at least according to Eadmer, an Anselm partisan. The two clerks travelled very quickly, as they did not leave before 28 February 1095 and were back in England by 13 May 1095. Eadmer claimed that the ambassadors were supposed to acquire a <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, for the king to give to his new choice as archbishop. But although the king may have instructed his envoys to attempt to secure these objects, he was probably willing to negotiate and to settle for less. The two clerks returned with a <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>, <a href="Walter%20of%20Albano">Walter of Albano</a>, who accepted the king's recognition of Urban but refused to allow Anselm's deposition. The king did nevertheless manage to secure recognition of his royal rights in the church, and a concession that no papal legates or communications would be sent without his approval. It may well be that the king always regarded Anselm's deposition as unlikely.

Warelwast was probably sent as an envoy to Urban in 1096 to bribe the pope into recalling the papal legate Jarento, who had been sent to England to protest the king's conduct towards the church. In addition to his ambassadorial duties Warelwast acted as a royal justice under King William; the records of one case have survived.

Shortly before Anselm went into exile in 1097 Warelwast searched his baggage, probably looking for communications to the pope, either from Anselm or other English bishops rather than for valuables, and in particular for any letters of complaint. Warelwast was the king's envoy at Rome when during his exile Anselm petitioned to have the king excommunicated, which according to Eadmer, who was also present, Warelwast succeeded in preventing by bribing the pope and papal officials. The king had sent Warelwast to Urban at Christmas 1098, with his reply to a letter the pope had written ordering the restoration of Anselm's estates.

Warelwast may have been with the hunting party on 2 August 1100 in which King William was accidentally killed, as he was one of the witnesses to the letter sent on 5 August 1100 from William IIs brother, the new King Henry I to Anselm recalling the archbishop. King Henry continued to use Warelwast as an ambassador, sending him to Rome in 1101 to bring back Pope <a href="Pope%20Paschal%20II">Paschal II</a>'s reply to a letter written by Henry immediately after his accession. Henry was seeking a reconciliation with the papacy, and confirmed to the pope the rights and obedience which his father had rendered, but he also requested the same rights within the Church as his father had enjoyed, chiefly the lay <a href="investiture">investiture</a> of bishops and the granting of the symbols of episcopal authority by laymen. Paschal declined to grant Henry those rights.

It was Warelwast who told Anselm in 1103 that the king would not permit his return to England. This came after a failed joint mission by Warelwast and Anselm to Paschal attempting to resolve the dispute between Henry and the archbishop over the king's investiture of bishops, a dispute generally known as the Investiture Controversy. It is quite likely that the king had given instructions that if the mission failed, Warelwast was to inform Anselm that he should only to return to England if he agreed with the king's position in the dispute. In 1106 Warelwast was the king's negotiator in the discussions that led to the settlement of the Investiture Controversy in England. The king ultimately lost little, relinquishing the right to give the actual symbols of episcopal authority to a newly elected bishop in return for continuing to receive <a href="Homage%20%28feudal%29">homage</a> from the bishops. Early in 1106 Warelwast was sent to <a href="Bec%20Abbey">Bec Abbey</a>, where Anselm was residing in exile, to inform him of the settlement and deliver to the archbishop the king's invitation to return to England. In May 1107 Warelwast acted as the king's envoy at Paschal's council at <a href="Troyes">Troyes</a>, where Paschal was attempting to secure support for <a href="Bohemond%20I%20of%20Antioch">Bohemond of Antioch</a>'s proposed <a href="Bohemond%20I%20of%20Antioch%23Wars%20between%20Antioch%20and%20the%20Byzantine%20Empire">campaign</a> against <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a>. Warelwast probably relayed to the pope the news that King Henry would make no contribution to Bohemond's efforts.

Henry had reserved the <a href="episcopal%20see">episcopal see</a> of Exeter for Warelwast since the death of <a href="Osbern%20FitzOsbern">Osbern FitzOsbern</a> in 1103, but the controversy over investiture meant that his election and consecration were not possible before a settlement was reached. Instead the king gave Warelwast the office of <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Exeter">Archdeacon of Exeter</a> after Osbern's death. The medieval chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> records that Warelwast had earlier tried to remove Osbern from office, but this story probably originates with Eadmer and is of dubious veracity. While archdeacon, Warelwast is recorded as being present at the transfer of a Devon church to <a href="Bath%20Abbey">Bath Cathedral</a>. He was elected Bishop of Exeter, and was consecrated on 11 August 1107, by Anselm at the royal palace of Westminster. Other bishops consecrated at the same time included <a href="William%20Giffard">William Giffard</a> to <a href="Diocese%20of%20Winchester">Winchester</a>, <a href="Roger%20of%20Salisbury">Roger of Salisbury</a> to <a href="Diocese%20of%20Salisbury">Salisbury</a>, <a href="Reynelm">Reynelm</a> to <a href="Diocese%20of%20Hereford">Hereford</a>, and <a href="Urban%20%28bishop%20of%20Llandaff%29">Urban</a> to <a href="Diocese%20of%20Llandaff">Llandaff</a>. Warelwast's elevation was a reward for his diplomatic efforts in the investiture crisis. The mass consecration signalled the end of the investiture crisis in England.

After his consecration Warelwast continued to serve the king, often appearing on documents or in accounts of the royal court. The bishop served the king as a messenger, once more carrying messages to Anselm in 1108. He also served as a royal judge, hearing a case at Tamworth in 1114 and another at Westbourne the same year. He was with the king in Normandy in 1111, 1113, and 1118, and may have been in Normandy more frequently. During Henry's reign Warelwast was a witness to 20 of the king's charters.

In 1115 Henry sent Warelwast back to Rome to negotiate with Paschal, who was angry that the king was prohibiting papal legates in England, not allowing clerics to appeal to the papal court, and was failing to secure papal sanction for church councils or the translation of bishops. Warelwast was unable to change the pope's mind, but he did manage to prevent sanctions against the king. Henry also employed Warelwast as a papal envoy during the <a href="Canterbury%E2%80%93York%20dispute">Canterbury–York dispute</a>s over the <a href="Primate%20%28bishop%29">primacy</a> in the English Church, with visits in 1119, 1120, and possibly also in 1116.

As a bishop, Warelwast attended the <a href="Council%20of%20Reims">Council of Reims</a> in 1119 along with three other bishops from England, as well as the Council of <a href="Rouen">Rouen</a> in 1118, a provincial <a href="synod">synod</a> for Normandy. In his diocese of Exeter he began the construction of a new cathedral in about 1114; it was consecrated in 1133. The existing two towers in the <a href="transept">transept</a>s date from that period. He also replaced the <a href="secular%20clergy">secular clergy</a> staffing collegiate churches with regular canons: at <a href="Plympton">Plympton</a> in 1121 with canons from <a href="Aldgate">Aldgate</a> in London, and in 1127 at the church in <a href="Launceston%2C%20Cornwall">Launceston</a> in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. In addition he founded a house of regular canons at <a href="Bodmin">Bodmin</a>. Royal charters survive that granted several churches in Cornwall, Devon, and Exeter to Warelwast.

Warelwast's relations with his <a href="cathedral%20chapter">cathedral chapter</a> were good, and no disputes arose during his episcopate. It was not until late in his bishopric that the diocese was split into multiple <a href="archdeacon">archdeacon</a>ries, which appears to have happened in 1133. Warelwast instituted the two offices of treasurer and <a href="precentor">precentor</a> for the cathedral chapter, as well as the first sub-archdeacons, who were under the archdeacons. Sub-archdeacons are not attested again at Exeter until the episcopate of <a href="Bartholomew%20Iscanus">Bartholomew Iscanus</a>, who was bishop from 1161–1184. William of Malmesbury felt that during Warelwast's episcopate the cathedral chapter relaxed its communal living, which previously had been strong. It is likely that during Warelwast's episcopate the canons of the cathedral chapter quit living in a communal dormitory.

Warelwast went blind in his later years, starting in about 1120, which William of Malmesbury regarded as a fitting punishment for Warelwast's alleged attempts to remove his predecessor from office early. He died about 26 September 1137, and was buried in the priory at Plympton. He may have resigned his see prior to his death. The 16th-century antiquary <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a> thought that Warelwast resigned his see before 1127, became a canon at Plympton, and died in 1127. Although Leland's year of death is incorrect, it is possible that Warelwast became a canon shortly before his death. The "Annales Plymptonienses" records that <a href="Robert%20of%20Bath">Robert of Bath</a>, the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Bath">Bishop of Bath</a>, gave Warelwast his <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a> on 26 September 1137, and records that the dying bishop was made a member of the collegiate church at Plympton. Warelwast's nephew Robert Warelwast succeeded as Bishop at Exeter in 1138; Robert had been appointed archdeacon of Exeter by his uncle.

The historian <a href="C.%20Warren%20Hollister">C. Warren Hollister</a> described William Warelwast as a "canny and devoted royal servant".

Battle of Labuan

The Battle of Labuan was an engagement fought between <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> and <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Imperial Japanese</a> forces on the island of <a href="Crown%20Colony%20of%20Labuan">Labuan</a> off Borneo during June 1945. It formed part of the Australian <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Borneo">invasion of North Borneo</a>, and was initiated by the Allied forces as part of a plan to capture the <a href="Brunei%20Bay">Brunei Bay</a> area and develop it into a base to support future offensives.

Following several weeks of air attacks and a short naval bombardment, soldiers of the Australian <a href="24th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">24th Brigade</a> were landed on Labuan from American and Australian ships on 10 June. The Australians quickly captured the island's harbour and main airfield. The greatly outnumbered Japanese garrison was mainly concentrated in a fortified position in the interior of Labuan, and offered little resistance to the landing. The initial Australian attempts to penetrate the Japanese position in the days after the invasion were not successful, and the area was subjected to a heavy bombardment. A Japanese raiding force also attempted to attack Allied positions on 21 June, but was defeated. Later that day, Australian forces assaulted the Japanese position. In the following days, Australian patrols killed or captured the remaining Japanese troops on the island. A total of 389 Japanese personnel were killed on Labuan and 11 were captured. Australian casualties included 34 killed.

After securing the island, the Allied forces developed Labuan into a significant base. The 24th Brigade left from the island to capture the eastern shore of Brunei Bay in late June, and the island's airfield was repaired and expanded to host <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> units. While occupying Labuan, the Allies had to reconstruct the island's infrastructure and provide assistance to thousands of civilians who had been rendered homeless by the pre-invasion bombardment. Following the war, a major <a href="Commonwealth%20War%20Graves%20Commission">Commonwealth War Graves Commission</a> cemetery was established on Labuan.

Labuan is a small island in the mouth of <a href="Brunei%20Bay">Brunei Bay</a> with an area of . Before the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific War</a>, it formed part of the British-administered <a href="Straits%20Settlements">Straits Settlements</a> and had a population of 8,960. The island had a town, <a href="Victoria%2C%20Labuan">Victoria</a>, on its south coast which fronted onto Victoria Harbour, with a population of 8,500 and limited port facilities. Aside from a beach just to the east of Victoria, the coast was ringed by coral.

On 3 January 1942, Japanese forces captured Labuan unopposed during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Borneo%20%281941%E2%80%9342%29">Battle of Borneo</a>. The Japanese developed two airfields (<a href="Labuan%20Airport">Labuan</a> and <a href="Timbalai%20Airfield">Timbalai</a>) on the island, which were built by labourers who had been conscripted from the <a href="Lawas">Lawas</a> and <a href="Terusan">Terusan</a> regions of mainland Borneo. The island population was also subjected to <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20British%20Borneo">harsh occupation policies</a>. After Japanese forces suppressed <a href="Jesselton%20Revolt">a revolt at the town of Jesselton</a> in late 1943, which was led by Chinese-ethnic civilians, 131 of the rebels were held on Labuan. Only nine rebels survived to be liberated by Australian forces in 1944. Until mid-1944, few Japanese combat units were stationed in Borneo.

In March 1945 the Australian Army's <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>, whose main combat elements were the veteran <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th</a> and <a href="9th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">9th Divisions</a>, was assigned responsibility for liberating <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>. Planning for the offensive was undertaken over the following weeks. While invading the Brunei Bay area did not form part of the initial iteration of the plans, it was added in early April after a proposed landing on <a href="Java">Java</a> was cancelled. The main purpose of attacking Brunei Bay was to secure it as a base for the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> (BPF), and gain control of oil fields and rubber plantations in the area. Labuan was to be developed as an air base and form part of a string of strategic positions which would allow the Allies to control the seas off the Japanese-occupied coast between Singapore and Shanghai.

While the liberation of the Brunei area had been authorised by the United States <a href="Joint%20Chiefs%20of%20Staff">Joint Chiefs of Staff</a>, it was not supported by the British <a href="Chiefs%20of%20Staff%20Committee">Chiefs of Staff Committee</a>. The British leadership did not want the BPF to be diverted from the main theatre of operations off Japan and preferred to establish a base for the fleet in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. In response to a suggestion from the Joint Chiefs of Staff that Brunei Bay could support future operations in south-east Asia, the Chiefs of Staff Committee judged that it would take too long to establish facilities there, especially as Singapore might have been recaptured by the time they were complete.

The plans for the invasion of Borneo evolved considerably during April. Initially, the offensive was to commence on 23 April with the landing of a brigade from the <a href="6th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">6th Division</a> on the island of Tarakan, off the east coast of Borneo. The 9th Division would then assault <a href="Balikpapan">Balikpapan</a> followed by <a href="Banjarmasin">Banjarmasin</a> in south-east Borneo. These positions would be used to support the invasion of Java by the remainder of I Corps. After the attack on Java was cancelled, it was decided to employ two brigades of the 7th Division at Brunei Bay, and I Corps conducted further preparations on this basis. However, on 17 April General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur's</a> General Headquarters (to which I Corps reported) swapped the roles of the 7th and 9th Divisions. Accordingly, the final plan for the attack against Borneo specified that one of the 9th Division's brigades would <a href="Battle%20of%20Tarakan%20%281945%29">land on Tarakan island</a> on 29 April (later postponed to 1 May), with the remainder of the division to invade the Brunei Bay area on 23 May. The 7th Division was scheduled to <a href="Battle%20of%20Balikpapan%20%281945%29">assault Balikpapan</a> on 1 July. The Borneo campaign was designated the "Oboe" phase of the Allied offensive through the southern Philippines towards the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Netherlands East Indies</a>, and the landings at Tarakan, Brunei Bay and Balikpapan were designated Operations Oboe One, Six and Two respectively.
The 9th Division began to move from Australia to the island of <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> in the Netherlands East Indies, where the Borneo campaign would be staged, in March 1945. The division had seen extensive combat in North Africa and New Guinea, and its officers and enlisted men were well trained for amphibious operations and jungle warfare. However, the 9th Division had been out of action since early 1944, leading to poor morale among its combat units. A large number of support, logistics and <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) units were assigned to the division for the operations at Brunei Bay, taking its strength to over 29,000 personnel (including 1,097 in United States and British units).

Final preparations for the landings in the Brunei Bay area took place in May 1945. After shortages of shipping delayed I Corps' movement from Australia to Morotai, General Headquarters agreed on 8 May to reschedule the operation from 23 May to 10 June. The 9th Division's staff completed their plans for operations in the Brunei Bay area on 16 May. The <a href="24th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">24th Brigade Group</a> was assigned responsibility for capturing Labuan, and the <a href="20th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">20th Brigade Group</a> was tasked with securing Brunei and Muara Island. Both brigades were to land simultaneously on the morning of 10 June. The invasion of the Brunei Bay region was to be preceded by attacks on Japanese bases and transport infrastructure across western and northern Borneo by United States and Australian air units, as well as three days of <a href="minesweeping">minesweeping</a> operations in the bay itself.

The 24th Brigade Group was commanded by Brigadier <a href="Selwyn%20Porter">Selwyn Porter</a>. His main combat units for operations on Labuan were the <a href="2/28th%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/28th</a> and <a href="2/43rd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/43rd Battalions</a>, the <a href="2/11th%20Commando%20Squadron%20%28Australia%29">2/11th Commando Squadron</a> and the <a href="2/12th%20Field%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">2/12th Field Regiment</a>. In addition, a squadron from the <a href="2/9th%20Armoured%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">2/9th Armoured Regiment</a> (equipped with <a href="Matilda%20II">Matilda II</a> tanks), a company of the <a href="2/2nd%20Machine%20Gun%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/2nd Machine Gun Battalion</a> and a range of engineer, signals and logistics units formed part of the brigade group. A party of 13 officers from the <a href="British%20Borneo%20Civil%20Affairs%20Unit">British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit</a> (BBCAU) was also attached to the 24th Brigade and were tasked with restoring the colonial government on the island and distributing supplies to its civilian population. The 24th Brigade's third infantry battalion, the <a href="2/32nd%20Battalion%20%28Australia%29">2/32nd Battalion</a>, was assigned to the 9th Division's reserve force. Porter and the 2/28th Battalion's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Norman, had a difficult relationship which generated ill-feeling between the two men and their respective headquarters. Porter considered relieving Norman of command before the landing on Labuan in the belief that he was exhausted and not capable of effectively leading his battalion, but decided against doing so after Norman made an emotional appeal to remain in his position.
The plans for the capture of Labuan specified that the 24th Brigade Group's two infantry battalions were to land simultaneously on the beach near Victoria (designated Brown Beach) at 9:15 am, with the 2/28th Battalion coming ashore on the western side of the beach and the 2/43rd to the east. The 2/11th Commando Squadron was to be initially held in reserve on board the invasion fleet. The brigade group's objectives were to secure a beachhead, capture the main airfield (located north of Victoria and designated "No. 1 Strip" by the Australians), destroy the Japanese garrison, and prepare for further operations on the eastern shore of Brunei Bay. Priority was given to rapidly opening the port and airfield so that they could be used to support other operations.

Porter expected that fighting for the main objectives would begin soon after the landing, and decided to begin landing his artillery and heavy mortars with the assault waves of infantrymen, just before the tanks came ashore. The 2/28th Battalion was initially assigned responsibility for securing Victoria and Flagstaff Hill to its north, while the 2/43rd Battalion was tasked with capturing the airfield. Once these areas were in Australian hands, the 2/28th Battalion would secure the western part of the island while the 2/11th Commando Squadron captured the western shore of Victoria Harbour. Due to the Australian Army's manpower shortages, all elements of the 9th Division were under orders to minimise their casualties during the Borneo Campaign and unit commanders would rely heavily upon the available air and artillery support during operations. The Australians estimated that the Japanese garrison on Labuan comprised 650 personnel, made up of 400 airfield troops, 100 naval troops and 150 other lines-of-communications personnel.

As the Allies advanced towards Borneo, additional units were dispatched from Japan during the second half of 1944 and the <a href="Thirty-Seventh%20Army%20%28Japan%29">37th Army</a> was established in September to coordinate the island's defence. In December 1944, Japanese staff officers deduced that it was likely that Australian troops would be landed at strategic points on the east and west coasts of Borneo in about March the next year (by which time they also expected United States forces to have liberated the Philippines). Accordingly, several Japanese units stationed in north-east Borneo were ordered to march to the western side of Borneo. This movement proceeded slowly, owing to the distances involved and disruptions caused by Allied air attacks.

By June 1945 around 550 Japanese military personnel were stationed on Labuan. The main unit on the island was the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion (almost in its entirety, save for one company located elsewhere) with a strength of around 350. This battalion formed part of the <a href="56th%20Independent%20Mixed%20Brigade">56th Independent Mixed Brigade</a>, which had arrived at <a href="Tawau">Tawao</a> in north-east Borneo from Japan in July 1944 with six infantry battalions. During early 1945 the brigade headquarters, 371st Independent Infantry Battalion and three other battalions marched across the island to assume responsibility for defending the Brunei Bay area. Many of the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade's soldiers fell sick during the march, and all four combat battalions were considerably below their authorised strength by the time they arrived at Brunei Bay. In June 1945 the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion was commanded by Captain Shichiro Okuyama. A detachment of about 50 men from the 111th Airfield Battalion was also on Labuan, along with around 150 men assigned to other small units. In line with Japanese doctrine, the Labuan garrison did not make preparations to contest the Allied landing force as it came ashore. Instead, it constructed defensive positions inland from the island's beaches. Documents captured by Australian soldiers during the fighting on Labuan indicated that Okuyama had instructions to attempt to withdraw his force from the island if the battle went against him.

Australian and United States air units began their pre-invasion attacks on north Borneo in late May. The first attack on the Brunei Bay area took place on 3 May, and included a raid targeting the town of Victoria on Labuan. A large number of further attacks were conducted to suppress Japanese airfields and other facilities throughout north-western and north-eastern Borneo. The plans for the invasion of Brunei Bay had specified that the landings would be supported by aircraft based at Tarakan, but delays in rebuilding the airfield there rendered this impossible and reduced the scale of the pre-invasion bombardment.

<a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> minesweepers commenced operations in Brunei Bay on 7 June, and a flotilla of four <a href="Cruiser%20%28warship%29">cruisers</a> and seven <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s (including an Australian light cruiser and destroyer) served as a <a href="covering%20force">covering force</a>. The minesweeping operation was successful, though struck a mine on 8 June and sank with the loss of four lives. Underwater demolition teams investigated all of the landing beaches on 9 June searching for obstacles which could impede the landing craft. The teams assigned to clear obstacles off Labuan were endangered by an unauthorised attack on the island conducted by a force of American <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> heavy bombers. Following the landings on 10 June, American <a href="Thirteenth%20Air%20Force">Thirteenth Air Force</a> aircraft flying from a base on <a href="Palawan%20%28island%29">Palawan Island</a> in the Philippines provided <a href="close%20air%20support">close air support</a> for the forces on Labuan until RAAF units based on the island were ready to take over.
The Australian <a href="Services%20Reconnaissance%20Department">Services Reconnaissance Department</a> (SRD) also collected intelligence on Labuan and other parts of the Brunei Bay area during May. On the first of the month several RAAF <a href="Consolidated%20PBY%20Catalina">PBY Catalina</a> aircraft carrying SRD personnel overflew Labuan. These aircraft later landed near two native <a href="Proa">prahu</a> and questioned their crews; two sailors were flown back to an Allied base for further questioning. On 15 May two Malays working for the SRD were landed in Brunei Bay by a Catalina, and sailed to Labuan on board a prahu. These agents recruited a local civilian from Labuan, and the party was extracted by a Catalina near the mainland village of <a href="Kampong%20Mengalong">Kampong Mengalong</a> on 19 May. The intelligence gained from these operations provided the Australians with a good understanding of Labuan's geography and infrastructure. In addition, civilians who had been recruited by the SRD's SEMUT 2 team (which had been parachuted into Borneo during April) provided intelligence on the size and movements of Labuan's garrison force.

During the last days of May the 9th Division embarked at Morotai onto the ships which would transport it to Brunei Bay, and undertook rehearsals for the landing. Due to a shortage of shipping, the available vessels were heavily loaded and many soldiers were forced to endure cramped and hot conditions during the ten days before the landing. Australian official historian <a href="Gavin%20Long">Gavin Long</a> later wrote that for many troops these conditions "were as uncomfortable as any of the experiences that followed" during the campaign. The 24th Brigade Group was carried by a variety of landing ships: the two large Australian <a href="landing%20ship%20infantry">LSIs</a> and , as well the <a href="attack%20cargo%20ship">attack cargo ship</a> , <a href="landing%20ship%20dock">LSD</a> , ten <a href="Landing%20Ship%2C%20Tank">LSTs</a>, five <a href="landing%20Craft%20Infantry">LCIs</a> and seven <a href="Landing%20Ship%20Medium">LSMs</a> from the United States Navy. A total of 38 small <a href="LCVP%20%28United%20States%29">LCVPs</a> and 26 <a href="Landing%20Craft%20Mechanized">LCMs</a> were also assigned to land the brigade once it arrived off Labuan. Due to the coral reefs surrounding the island, the assault waves landed in <a href="Landing%20Vehicle%20Tracked">LVTs</a> of the US Army's 727th Amphibious Tractor Battalion. The convoy carrying the 9th Division left Morotai on 4 June and arrived in Brunei Bay before dawn on 10 June. The main body of the convoy anchored off Labuan, and the remainder proceeded to the Brunei area. A Japanese aircraft dropped a bomb near two of the transport ships off Labuan at 6:51 am, but caused no damage.

The landing of the assault troops at Labuan went well. The Allied fleet began bombarding the landing area from 8:15 am, and seven Australian B-24 Liberators dropped anti-personnel bombs in the area behind the intended beachhead. No Japanese forces opposed the two battalions' assault forces as they came ashore in LVTs, and the landing of later waves of infantry and tanks went smoothly. The 2/43rd Battalion rapidly advanced north and captured No. 1 Strip in the evening of 10 June. Some Japanese soldiers attempted to defend the airfield area, and the 2/43rd Battalion claimed to have killed 23 Japanese for the loss of four Australians wounded.

A company from the 2/28th Battalion captured Victoria shortly after coming ashore, and the battalion first met opposition at Flagstaff Hill at 10:45 am. One of the battalion's companies subsequently captured the hill, while its other companies continued to advance. The 2/28th Battalion encountered increasing opposition as the day progressed, particularly to the west of its area of responsibility. During the afternoon of 10 June the battalion engaged Japanese troops in the area west of Flagstaff Hill (at the junction of Callaghan and MacArthur Roads), with the infantrymen being supported by tanks and mortars; the Australians counted 18 Japanese dead by the end of the day, and suffered several fatalities and men wounded in this fighting. After civilians reported that no Japanese were stationed on the Hamilton peninsula which formed the western side of Victoria Harbour, a troop from the 2/11th Commando Squadron was landed in the area during 10 June and secured it without opposition.

During the afternoon of 10 June a group of senior officers, including General Douglas MacArthur, his air commander General <a href="George%20Kenney">George Kenney</a>, and Australians Lieutenant General <a href="Leslie%20Morshead">Leslie Morshead</a> and Air Vice Marshal <a href="William%20Bostock">William Bostock</a> (head of <a href="RAAF%20Command">RAAF Command</a>), made an inspection tour of the Labuan beachhead. MacArthur insisted on seeing Australian soldiers in action, and the party visited a group of infantrymen from the 2/43rd Battalion before departing. The Australians had just killed two Japanese soldiers and fighting was still taking place in the area when MacArthur and the other senior officers arrived. The process of unloading supplies from the invasion fleet during 10 June proceeded quickly, and the ships began to depart for Morotai during the afternoon of 11 June.
The 24th Brigade's goal for 11 June was to secure the airfield area. The 2/43rd Battalion patrolled to the north and west of the airfield during the day, meeting only light opposition. In contrast, the 2/28th Battalion (which was tasked with advancing into Labuan's interior) encountered entrenched Japanese forces, and it became clear that it was facing the main body of the island's garrison. Norman manoeuvred his companies to push the Japanese back, but the rate of advance was slow. The airfield engineers of <a href="No.%2062%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 62 Wing RAAF</a> were also landed during 11 June to begin work on returning No. 1 Strip to service; reconstruction of the airfield began the next day.

On the basis of the fighting on 11 June, Porter judged that the Japanese were withdrawing into a stronghold position located to the north of Victoria and about to the west of the airfield. On 12 June he directed the two battalions to patrol around the stronghold area. The 2/43rd Battalion patrolled the interior of Labuan to the west of No. 1 Strip, but located only a single Japanese position. This position was attacked and destroyed that day by the 2/43rd Battalion's C Company supported by three tanks. The 2/28th Battalion sent patrols towards the stronghold area, with a company supported by a tank troop meeting heavy resistance as it pushed westwards along a track towards MacArthur Road. The 2/11th Commando Squadron also advanced north, and linked up with elements of the 2/43rd Battalion near the centre of Labuan during the late afternoon. The 371st Independent Infantry Battalion's main radio was destroyed during an air attack on 12 June, cutting the unit off from the 37th Army's headquarters. As a result of the patrolling, by the end of 12 June the location of the Japanese position was fairly well known to the Australian force. The 24th Brigade's casualties to this point in the battle were 18 killed and 42 wounded, and the Australians believed that at least 110 Japanese had been killed. The 2/32nd Battalion was also landed on Labuan during 12 June, but remained in divisional reserve.

On 13 and 14 June the 24th Brigade Group continued operations aimed at forcing the Japanese garrison into the stronghold—dubbed "the Pocket" by the Australians. The 2/43rd Battalion secured the emergency airstrip at Timbalai on Labuan's west coast on 13 June, and elements of the 2/28th Battalion continued to push west into the Pocket along MacArthur Road. A company from the 2/28th Battalion made another attack into the Pocket the next day after the 2/12th Field Regiment had fired 250 rounds into the area, but was forced to withdraw after being unable to overcome heavy resistance. By the conclusion of 14 June the Australians judged that, aside from the Pocket, the island was now secure. Porter assessed that an attack on this position would need to be made in strength using well-coordinated forces. This task was largely assigned to the 2/28th Battalion, with the 2/43rd being used to patrol the island.

Following the landing the BBCAU detachment and 24th Brigade were faced with a significant humanitarian challenge. The Allied air and naval attacks had destroyed almost all of the buildings on Labuan, rendering large numbers of civilians homeless. Within days of the invasion, about 3,000 civilians were housed in a compound within the beachhead. The BBCAU party were unable to assist so many civilians, and the 24th Brigade needed to assign soldiers to support them and transport supplies.

The Japanese stronghold position was about long from north to south, and wide. The terrain within this area comprised a series of small jungle-covered ridges, and the position was bordered on the western and southern sides by swamps. The main terrain features within the Pocket were three areas of high ground named Lushington Ridge, Norman Ridge and Lyon Ridge by the Australians. There were only two feasible routes into the area. The first was a track which led south into the position along Lyon Ridge and Norman Ridge; this was passable by tanks but heavily mined. The other route was a track which ran into the eastern side of the Pocket from MacArthur Road along Lushington Ridge and joined the other track at Norman Ridge. It is likely that around 250 Japanese personnel were initially stationed within the Pocket.

In order to minimise the casualties to his brigade, Porter decided to isolate the Pocket with two infantry companies while a <a href="Artillery">heavy artillery</a> barrage was fired into the area over several days. An attempt to capture the Pocket would only be made once it was judged that the Japanese were no longer capable of resisting effectively. As part of this plan, the 2/12th Field Regiment eventually fired 140 tons of shells into the Pocket between 15 and 20 June.
The 2/28th Battalion probed into the Pocket on 16 June. The previous day a 2/11th Commando Squadron patrol had reported that the track along Lyon Ridge would be passable by tanks if a bomb crater was filled, and on the morning of the 16th A Company from the 2/28th Battalion accompanied by a troop of three tanks and a bulldozer began to move south along it. After the bulldozer filled the crater, the force continued along Lyon Ridge but became pinned down by heavy fire from Japanese troops on Eastman Spur to the south-east of the ridge. One of the Australian tanks was damaged. A subsequent attempt by a section from the 2/11th Commando Squadron to advance towards Eastman Spur to the east of A Company was also beaten back, with two Australians killed and another wounded. A Company resumed its advance during the afternoon, supported by a new troop of tanks. The three tanks moved ahead of the infantry, and killed eight or ten Japanese personnel, but one was damaged by a bomb and another became bogged. By the end of the day, A Company had suffered five men killed and 23 wounded. Overall, 150 patients were admitted by the 24th Brigade's attached medical units during 16 June, which stretched their capacity.

Due to the losses his brigade suffered on 16 June, Porter decided to continue the bombardment before undertaking further attacks. On 18 and 19 June the bombardment of the Pocket was intensified when the heavy cruiser <a href="HMS%20Shropshire">HMAS "Shropshire"</a> fired into the area. Infantrymen supported by tanks conducted another probe into the Pocket on 19 June, and killed 10 Japanese; three Australians were wounded. On 20 June the 2/12th Field Regiment fired a particularly heavy bombardment and six Allied bombers attacked the Pocket. Porter judged that this would be sufficient to suppress the Japanese defenders, and ordered that the Pocket be attacked by two companies from the 2/28th Battalion supported by tanks (including "Frog" <a href="flamethrower">flamethrower</a> variants of the Matilda II) the next day.
In the early hours of 21 June a force of about 50 Japanese troops slipped out of the Pocket and attempted to attack Australian positions on Labuan. Different groups of Japanese troops attacked a prisoner of war enclosure, dock facilities and No. 1 Strip, but all were defeated by Australian and American logistics personnel and engineers. A total of 32 Japanese personnel were killed around Victoria, and another 11 were killed at the airfield. Three Americans and two Australians were killed in these engagements.

The Japanese attack did not delay the Australian assault on the Pocket. At 10 am on 21 June, C Company of the 2/28th Battalion began to advance to the west along Lushington Ridge, and D Company moved south from Eastman Spur. D Company was supported by a troop of three conventional Matilda tanks and two Frog flamethrowers. C Company advanced about half of the way into the Pocket before being halted by Norman who was concerned that they might be accidentally attacked by D Company, which was also making good progress. The force built around D Company subsequently completed the occupation of the Pocket, with the flamethrower tanks playing a key role. The Japanese soldiers who had survived the artillery bombardment offered little resistance to the Australian forces. The 24th Brigade assessed that 60 Japanese personnel were killed in the final assault on the Pocket, with 117 being killed by the artillery bombardment which had preceded it.

From 21 June, the <a href="2/12th%20Commando%20Squadron%20%28Australia%29">2/12th Commando Squadron</a> conducted patrols of the outlying areas of Labuan to clear them of any Japanese forces; up to this point the squadron had formed part of the 9th Division's reserve. Each troop of the squadron was assigned a different sector of Labuan, and by mid-July had completed its task. During these patrols the squadron killed 27 Japanese soldiers, mainly as part of repelling a raid on the BBCAU compound on 24 June, and captured a single prisoner. The 2/12th Commando Squadron was subsequently directed to undertake topographic work in order to improve the quality of maps of the island. The 24th Brigade's total combat casualties in its operations on Labuan were 34 killed and 93 wounded. The Australian soldiers counted 389 Japanese dead and took 11 prisoners.

The process of bringing No. 1 Strip back into service went well. Nos <a href="No.%204%20Airfield%20Construction%20Squadron%20RAAF">4</a> and <a href="No.%205%20Airfield%20Construction%20Squadron%20RAAF">5 Airfield Construction Squadron</a>s were assigned the task. A unsurfaced temporary runway was constructed at a 5° angle to the existing strip. The first RAAF aircraft, two <a href="Curtiss%20P-40%20Warhawk">P-40 Kittyhawks</a> from <a href="No.%2076%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 76 Squadron</a>, landed on the strip on 17 June, and commenced operations from this base the next day. <a href="No.%20457%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 457 Squadron</a>, which was equipped with <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Spitfires</a>, arrived on 18 June though two of its aircraft crashed on the still-unfinished runway and had to be written off. The units based at the airfield took over responsibility for providing air support for the Army units on Labuan that day, and flew their first close air support sorties over the island on 19 June. <a href="No.%2086%20Wing%20RAAF">No. 86 Wing's</a> two flying squadrons—<a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1</a> and <a href="No.%2093%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 93</a>—also arrived on Labuan in late July, but conducted few operations from this base before the end of the war. The wing had originally been scheduled to move to Labuan in late June, but it took longer than expected to extend No. 1 Strip's runway to the length needed by No. 1 Squadron's <a href="de%20Havilland%20Mosquito">Mosquito</a> light bombers.

To reconstruct No. 1's existing runway as an all-weather strip, the bomb craters had to have the water pumped out of them and then be filled in. <a href="Sandstone">Sandstone</a> from a quarry on northern Labuan was placed over the clay and sand subbase, and the runway was topped with crushed coral from the west coast of the island, and sealed with bitumen. The runway had 70 hardstandings for aircraft. With 70 also on the dry weather strip, the air base could accommodate 140 aircraft. The 9th Division's engineers also undertook a wide range of construction projects on Labuan. These included building of storage, new port facilities, bridges and oil tanks as well as surfacing of roads. A wharf for <a href="Liberty%20ship">Liberty ship</a>s was begun on 18 June, allowing the first ship to berth on 10 July. A fuel jetty was in operation by 20 June, and a fuel tank farm with seven tanks was completed on 12 July, as was a 600-bed hospital. Work then began on a 1,200-bed general hospital. The 2/4th and 2/6th Australian General Hospitals were transferred from Morotai to Labuan during July, though the later unit's hospital facilities were not completed until 17 September.
Once Labuan was secured, the 24th Brigade was ordered to capture the eastern shore of Brunei Bay. On 16 June, the 2/32nd Battalion was transported from Labuan to Padas Bay. The battalion captured the town of <a href="Weston%2C%20Sabah">Weston</a> the next day. The remainder of the 24th Brigade was transported across the bay during the last weeks of June, and the force advanced inland to capture the town of <a href="Beaufort%2C%20Malaysia">Beaufort</a> which was defended by between 800 and 1,000 Japanese personnel. Following some heavy fighting, the town was secured on 28 June. The brigade then advanced further inland to <a href="Papar%2C%20Malaysia">Papar</a> in early July. Later that month the 9th Division's commander, Major General <a href="George%20Wootten">George Wootten</a>, relieved Norman from command over an incident in which he had lost control of the 2/28th Battalion during the fighting on Labuan. Following the announcement of the <a href="surrender%20of%20Japan">surrender of Japan</a> on 15 August 1945 and the formal ceremony held in Tokyo Bay on 2 September, the commander of the 37th Army, Major General <a href="Masao%20Baba">Masao Baba</a>, surrendered to Wootten on 10 September at a ceremony conducted at the 9th Division's headquarters on Labuan.

After the war, Labuan was one of several locations at which the Australian military conducted trials to prosecute suspected <a href="Japanese%20war%20crimes">Japanese war criminals</a>. A total of 16 trials were held on the island between 3 December 1945 and 31 January 1946, during which 128 men were convicted and 17 acquitted. <a href="Labuan%20War%20Cemetery">Labuan War Cemetery</a> was also established as the burial place for all of the Commonwealth personnel killed on or near Borneo. It includes 3,900 graves, most of which are for prisoners of war who died while being held by the Japanese.

Memorials have also been erected on Labuan to mark its wartime history. These include the Australian Battle Exploit Memorial at Brown Beach, a plaque marking the location of the 37th Army's surrender ceremony and a Japanese peace park.

After more than two years of development, the game was released in late 2007 for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>.

A <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> <a href="porting">port</a> of the game was released in 2008 by <a href="Ambrosia%20Software">Ambrosia</a>, and an updated version of the game was released on <a href="Valve%20Corporation">Valve's</a> <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> platform that same year. A <a href="Linux">Linux</a> version of the game was released as part of the <a href="Humble%20Indie%20Bundle">Humble Indie Bundle</a> collection in 2010, and a version for the <a href="iPad">iPad</a> was released in 2011. An <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> port of the game was released as part of the <a href="Humble%20Bundle%23Humble%20Bundle%20with%20Android%206">Humble Bundle with Android 6</a> collection in 2013. In 2009, an album with the "Aquaria" soundtrack was made available for sale. It includes all of the music in the game as well as a new nine-minute vocal track and a few remixes.

The game follows Naija, a mermaid-like woman, as she explores the underwater world of Aquaria. Along her journey, she learns about the history of the world she inhabits as well as her own past. The <a href="gameplay">gameplay</a> focuses on a combination of swimming, singing, and combat, through which Naija can interact with the world. Her songs can move items, affect plants and animals, and change her physical appearance into other forms that have different abilities, like firing projectiles at hostile creatures, or passing through barriers inaccessible to her in her natural form.

Reviews of the game were generally positive. Critics focused primarily on the visuals, music and atmosphere as being particularly praiseworthy. The controls and gameplay were also lauded, while negative critiques more often centered on the map system and limited variety of <a href="glossary%20of%20video%20game%20terms%23O">objectives</a>. The game won the <a href="Seumas%20McNally%20Grand%20Prize">Seumas McNally Grand Prize</a> at the <a href="Independent%20Games%20Festival">Independent Games Festival</a> in March 2007.

"Aquaria" is a 2D sidescrolling <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a>, heavily focused on exploration and puzzle-solving, with <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay">non-linear gameplay</a>. The player controls Naija, a lone underwater dweller; although similar to a human woman, Naija also has several fish-like qualities, such as the ability to breathe underwater and propel herself quickly with webbed feet. The game, originally only available for <a href="personal%20computer">personal computer</a>s, was designed to be primarily controlled solely through the mouse, though it can also be controlled with a keyboard or <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> controller. The player directs Naija through an underwater world composed of several distinct regions, ranging from caves to underwater ruins to sunlit oases. These areas are filled with plant and animal life, which can be hostile, friendly, or neutral towards her. Hostile plants and animals can hurt Naija, reducing her <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health meter</a>, by touching her or firing projectiles at her.

In general, Naija cannot interact directly with objects in the world. Instead, the majority of actions are accomplished through singing short tunes. The player does this by selecting a series of notes displayed in a circle of eight choices in the correct order. Each note corresponds with a different color. Singing notes affects plants and objects of the same color as the note, while singing the tunes, once learned through the plot, can lift objects, create a shield around Naija, or change Naija into different "forms" which have different appearances and unique abilities critical to overcoming the various challenges and obstacles found in the game. The specific tones that are played when the player selects a note can subtly change in different regions, matching the background music. The default form, or "normal form", is the only one in which Naija can sing, and is the only one where her appearance is modifiable by the player by having Naija wear costumes found throughout the game.
Other forms, which can only be used once found in-game, are the "energy form", in which Naija can shoot projectiles to attack enemy creatures, "beast form", which allows Naija to swim faster through the water and eat small fish to restore health, and "nature form", in which Naija can shoot seeds that produce flowers and spiky plants that can harm other creatures. In this form, Naija is not harmed by thorns on any plants. The player can also learn the "sun form", which allows Naija to give off light in dark regions, "spirit form", which allows the player to move to specific locations marked by blue crystals without time passing, "fish form", where Naija turns into a small, fast fish, and "dual form", found at the end of the game, which allows Naija and another character named Li who is met late in the game's plot to merge, with actions taken by one affecting the other.

While exploring the world, Naija can collect various ingredients from interaction with plants and animals, mainly by combating her foes. These ingredients can be used to cook dishes, which have varying effects on Naija. The most common effects are healing and enhancing various characteristics such as speed and defense, but there are some more exotic dishes which grant her new abilities. The player can learn new recipes by collecting new dishes directly, but can also learn them by combining ingredients without first knowing the recipe.

As the game opens, Naija has lost almost all of her memories, and is unaware of the world outside of her home as she "lives as a simple creature". The player is told this in voice-over narrations in the form of a story told by a future Naija. These narrations serve as the primary source of information about Naija throughout the game, though there are occasional <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s. After being confronted by a shadowy figure and being shown a series of <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashbacks</a> she does not understand, Naija awakens. Feeling loneliness as the only member of her species, Naija decides to explore the world around her. As the player explores, Naija discovers more and more about the history of the world, "Aquaria", and about her own past. The player is not forced to go through the plotline in a set sequence. The only limiting factor is physical barriers such as areas that can only be accessed by using a specific form. Combinations of these physical limitations place some plot elements later in the game. The narrative for the majority of the game is centered on Naija's exploration of a series of ruined civilizations that she finds, each with a large monster in them. These civilizations make up the different regions of the game.

Towards the end of the game, Naija discovers that all of the ruined civilizations she has found throughout the game were destroyed by a god, "the Creator", who was jealous of the rising power of that civilization or of their gods. The powerful monsters she has found and defeated in each region were once the gods of that civilization. Each of these civilizations had a unique power, symbolized by the form that Naija learns after defeating their former gods. Along with Li, a human diver from the land she meets at the top of the ocean, Naija then descends to the bottom of the sea to confront the god. There she discovers that the Creator fell into the ocean as a child, and bonded with an ancient spirit to gain god-like powers. He then created Aquaria, threading a <a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29%23Verse">verse</a> of a <a href="lullaby">lullaby</a> his mother had sung to him throughout, the only part of the song he remembers. The <a href="melody">melody</a> of this song, the "verse", is what allows Naija to sing songs that affect the world around her; parts of the melody can be heard in different forms in the songs within the game's soundtrack.

The Creator, after creating Aquaria, created a series of civilizations, making a new one in turn when each one was destroyed. The Creator kidnaps Li, with whom Naija has fallen in love, and she attacks the Creator to get him back. The player defeats the god as the final boss of the game, and returns home with Li. In the <a href="epilogue">epilogue</a>, Naija is shown with Li and their child. If the player has found all of Naija's memories by discovering places she remembers, they reveal that the shadowy figure at the beginning of the game was her mother, Mia. Mia was made by the Creator and had the ability, like Naija, to use the different powers of all of the civilizations. She fled the Creator, and hid herself and Naija among several communities in succession; after the destruction of the last one she erased Naija's memory so that she would find out the history of Aquaria on her own and defeat the Creator. In the extended epilogue shown if the player has found all of the memories, Mia appears, telling Naija that the two of them can conquer the civilisations above the water. After Naija refuses, Mia kidnaps her, and vanishes; the extended epilogue ends with Lucien, Naija and Li's son, leaving to find her. If the player has not found all of the memories, the epilogue instead ends with Naija asking the player to find out about her past, and revealing that the narration of the game was intended to be heard by her son.

"Aquaria" was developed by <a href="Derek%20Yu">Derek Yu</a> and <a href="Alec%20Holowka">Alec Holowka</a> over the course of two years, off of a concept that Holowka had thought of a year prior. Yu was the lead artist, and Holowka handled the programming and audio components. Both designers had previously worked in video games; Yu had made several freeware games, including "<a href="I%27m%20O.K%20%E2%80%93%20A%20Murder%20Simulator">I'm O.K</a>" with Holowka and others, while Holowka had worked for several video game start-ups, none of which had ever gotten a game published. Some additional work on the game, including some level design and scripting for some enemies, was done by Brandon McCartin. Holowka and Yu officially formed the studio Bit Blot to back the game a week before submitting it to the 2007 <a href="Independent%20Games%20Festival">Independent Games Festival</a>. "Aquaria" is the studio's only game. Both members of the team continue to make video games, but are not doing so as a partnership; Holowka went on to form a separate team called Infinite Ammo, and Yu went back to working on freeware games and various ports of "<a href="Spelunky">Spelunky</a>".

The initial prototype of the game had styling similar to a text-based role-playing game, with a large open world and many sub-quests. After moving towards "multiple-choice text answers" and a complicated gameplay system, the team decided to simplify the game and set the 2007 Independent Games Festival as a deadline to complete everything. With this time pressure, they forced themselves to cut out a lot of what they felt was unneeded complexity, bringing the game to its core. After removing many of what they decided were extraneous elements they then added back in the cooking system, which they felt fit well with the rest of the game, as well as a map system. They then developed the game world and story in a roughly linear manner, creating basic designs of each region and then coming back to fill in details. They felt that this allowed them to create interesting ideas at the beginning of the game and then fill them out and resolve them at the end. One of these ideas was that of the "verse"; Holowka realized partway through development that he had been using the same twelve-note sequence transposed into different keys throughout the music, and realized that the idea of a pervasive musical theme to the world fit with the story. The game also includes a level and animation editor; several <a href="Mod%20%28computer%20gaming%29">mods</a> have been made for the game.

The game was developed to be able to be controlled by the player with only the mouse, after it was suggested by Yu's father. The developers felt that this control scheme forced them to make the gameplay fluid and easy to grasp, though they also added the option to control the game with a keyboard or <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> controller. Yu and Holowka considered the "hallmark" of exploratory games to be a sense of loneliness, which they made a part of the narrative, but also wanted the player to get a sense of Naija's character. To that end, they used voice-overs to demonstrate to the player what Naija was feeling during key points of the game. The voice of Naija was performed by Jenna Sharpe, who was chosen after auditioning several other voice actresses. She additionally sang the vocals for one song on the soundtrack, "Lost to the Waves". She also sang a nine-minute vocal piece, "Fear the Dark", especially for the release of the "Aquaria" soundtrack album, which was published by Bit Blot on November 14, 2009. The album features 50 tracks on two discs, including all of the music in the game as well as the new vocal track and a few remixes.

The game was released for Windows computers on December 7, 2007. A patch was later released which added new functionality to the in-game map, added widescreen support, and tweaked several game settings. A Macintosh port was released November 13, 2008, courtesy of <a href="Ambrosia%20Software">Ambrosia Software</a>. The game was released on <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> on December 15, 2008; it included the addition of 27 Steam Achievements. A Linux version of the game was developed by <a href="Ryan%20C.%20Gordon">Ryan C. Gordon</a> in 2009; an open beta ran until February 6, 2010, and the Linux version of the game was released as part of the <a href="Humble%20Indie%20Bundle">Humble Indie Bundle</a>. The source code for the game's engine was released under the <a href="GNU%20General%20Public%20License">GNU General Public License</a> on June 3, 2010. A modified version was released on the <a href="iPad">iPad</a> on November 2, 2011. This version, which includes touchscreen support and changes to the way the map works, was created by Andrew Church, who was approached to do the port by Holowka after he did an unofficial <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> <a href="source%20port">source port</a>.

"Aquaria" was the <a href="Seumas%20McNally%20Grand%20Prize">Seumas McNally Grand Prize</a> winner of the 2007 Independent Games Festival, and was also a finalist in the categories of Design Innovation, Excellence in Visual Art, and Excellence in Audio. The festival praised the game's "fluid controls, unique, non-linear gameplay, and vibrant hand-drawn storybook-style graphics". The game received praise from many different reviewers; Cam Shea of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> called it "a stunning effort from such a small team", Richard Naik of GameCritics called it "an extremely high-quality product" and a fine example of the <a href="side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scroller</a> genre, while Chris Dahlen of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" termed it "not so much a retro adventure as a fresh take on everything that made the old 2D adventures great". Praise for the game was centered primarily on its visuals and atmosphere. "<a href="Hyper%20%28magazine%29">Hyper</a>"s Tim Henderson commended the game for "a rare and genuine sense of exploration, wonder and discovery". A review by Scott Colbourne from "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" termed "Aquaria" "drop-dead beautiful" with a "deep and affecting story" and summarized it as "a game you can get comfortably lost in".
Other reviewers, such as Tom Bramwell of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> and Chris Holt of <a href="Macworld">Macworld</a> echoed the praises for the graphics and atmosphere, while Craig Pearson of "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20UK">PC Gamer UK</a>" added praises for the music and voiceovers and Suzie Ochs of <a href="MacLife">MacLife</a> praised the music and story. Other praises for the game came for its control scheme and for the gameplay mechanics, with Holt calling out the cooking system as worthy of praise. Though noting that the visuals and presentation of the game would be the first thing that players noticed, Nathan Cocks of "<a href="PC%20PowerPlay">PC PowerPlay</a>" claimed that "from a design standpoint, "Aquaria" is a triumph," with the right amount of complexity and level design that is "spot on".

Several reviewers, such as Bramwell and Holt, criticized the map system present in the initial version of the game as being confusing and difficult. Other reviewers had different concerns, such as Henderson, who critiqued the initial release version for "lack of widescreen support and being occasionally fiddly", or Naik, who felt that the control scheme was not as intuitive when using an Xbox 360 controller. Shea and Pearson felt that the game could have used more puzzles or a wider variety of quests and objectives to balance out the exploration and combat. They did not feel, though, that these downsides compared to the game's positives, with Pearson stating that "the good far outweighs what are, essentially, niggles."

History of Ipswich Town F.C.

<a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town F.C.</a> is an English <a href="association%20football">association football</a> club based in <a href="Ipswich">Ipswich</a>, Suffolk, which was formed in 1878. The side played amateur football until 1936 when the club turned professional and was elected into the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a>. Ipswich Town were <a href="Football%20Conference%23Promotion%20and%20relegation">elected</a> into <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Division Three</a> of the <a href="The%20Football%20League">Football League</a> in place of <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham F.C.</a> on 30 May 1938.

The club experienced league success during the early 1960s, winning the <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20One">Football League Championship</a> in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20in%20English%20football">1961–62</a>, one season after winning promotion from the <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Two">Second Division</a>. Two decades later, under the guidance of <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a>, the club achieved success both in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> and in <a href="UEFA%23Club">European competition</a>, winning the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> in <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20UEFA%20Cup">1981</a>.

Ipswich Town have made a contribution to the history of the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national football team</a>; both Robson and <a href="Sir%20Alf%20Ramsey">Sir Alf Ramsey</a> moved on from Ipswich to manage England, presiding over the nation's best results in the World Cup: fourth place in <a href="1990%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1990</a> and world champions in <a href="1966%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1966</a>.

The club was founded on 16 October 1878 as an amateur side known as Ipswich A.F.C., under the presidency of local <a href="member%20of%20parliament">MP</a> <a href="Thomas%20Cobbold%20%28diplomat%29">Thomas Cobbold</a> who had played football at <a href="Charterhouse%20School">Charterhouse School</a>. George S Sherrington & J. M. Franks were elected joint Captains. Ipswich A.F.C.'s first match was a 6–1 home victory over Stoke Wanderers at the <a href="Broomhill%20Park">Broom Hill</a> ground on 2 November 1878. This was followed by a 2–0 victory over Harwich in the club's first away match. Losing only one game in 17 in its second season, the club was able to build enough interest to enrol players for a second team. Ipswich recorded their biggest ever victory during the <a href="1880%E2%80%9381%20in%20English%20football">1880–81</a> season, a 15–0 defeat of East Stamford with one player, John Knights, registering a treble <a href="hat%20trick">hat trick</a>; both achievements remain club records. The team moved to <a href="Portman%20Road">Portman Road</a>, the current ground, in 1884, and would share, until 1936, the facilities with the East Suffolk Cricket Club who had played there since 1855. The <a href="Cobbold%20family">Cobbold family</a> involvement continued when, in 1885, Nathanael Fromanteel Cobbold was elected as a vice-president of the club. Following his sudden death the following year, the position was then held by his nephew John Dupuis Cobbold.

The club won their first trophy in the <a href="1886%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1886–87 season</a>, triumphing 2–1 against a team representing <a href="Ipswich%20School">Ipswich School</a> in the final of the Suffolk Challenge Cup. In <a href="1888%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1888</a> the club merged with Ipswich Rugby Club to form Ipswich Town F.C. In 1890, the club entered the qualifying rounds of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> for the first time and was knocked out in the final qualifying round by the <a href="93rd%20Highlanders">93rd Highlanders</a>. The club experienced scant success in the Cup during the 1890s but won a number of local cup competitions, including the <a href="Suffolk%20Senior%20Cup">Suffolk Senior Cup</a> and the Ipswich Charity Cup. Having received invitations to join from both the Southern League and the <a href="Norfolk%20%26amp%3B%20Suffolk%20League">Norfolk & Suffolk League</a>, Ipswich joined the latter in the <a href="1899%E2%80%931900%20in%20English%20football">1899–1900</a> season, finishing fourth in their first league season. They were league runners-up in 1902–03. In 1903 they also entered a team into the new <a href="East%20Anglian%20League">South East Anglian League</a> and were its inaugural champions. They left the South East Anglian League in 1906, but continued playing in the Norfolk & Suffolk League.

In <a href="1907%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">1907</a>, Ipswich became founder members of the <a href="Southern%20Amateur%20Football%20League">Southern Amateur League</a>. The club narrowly avoided relegation in many of the following seasons, and suffered a club record 15–1 defeat at the hands of <a href="Corinthian%20F.C.">the Corinthians</a> at Portman Road on New Year's Day, 1910. The outbreak of the First World War and the commandeering of Portman Road by the Army curtailed the <a href="1914%E2%80%9315%20in%20English%20football">1914–15 season</a> and organised football did not return until the <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">1920–21 season</a>. Just one year later, Ipswich Town became champions of the Southern Amateur League, clinching the title on the last day of the season. The club won the league a further three times, in <a href="1929%E2%80%9330%20in%20English%20football">1929–30</a>, <a href="1932%E2%80%9333%20in%20English%20football">1932–33</a> and <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34</a>, before becoming founder members of the <a href="Eastern%20Counties%20Football%20League">Eastern Counties Football League</a> at the end of the <a href="1934%E2%80%9335%20in%20English%20football">1934–35</a> season.

In 1936, local businessman Leonard P. Thompson threatened to lead a breakaway from the amateur club to create an entirely separate professional club, Ipswich United. John Murray Cobbold, the club President, called together rival factions for a meeting at the Town Hall on 1 May 1936, at which it was agreed that Ipswich Town should turn professional. The club was unanimously <a href="Football%20Conference%23Promotion%20and%20relegation">elected</a> to the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> for the <a href="1936%E2%80%9337%20in%20English%20football">1936–37 season</a> and former <a href="Ireland%20national%20football%20team%20%281882%E2%80%931950%29">Irish</a> international footballer <a href="Mick%20O%27Brien%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201893%29">Mick O'Brien</a> was appointed as the club's first professional manager.

The club's first professional game at Portman Road resulted in a 4–1 win against <a href="Tunbridge%20Wells%20Rangers">Tunbridge Wells Rangers</a> and the club went on to win the Southern League in their debut season. O'Brien left after just one season following the death of his wife. Ipswich Town were managerless until 10 November 1936 when the club appointed <a href="Scott%20Duncan%20%28footballer%29">Scott Duncan</a>, who had left recently relegated <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. He led Ipswich to third place in the <a href="1937%E2%80%9338%20in%20English%20football">1937–38 season</a>.

Ipswich Town F.C. were <a href="Football%20Conference%23Promotion%20and%20relegation">elected</a> to <a href="The%20Football%20League">The Football League</a> on 30 May 1938 by a margin of just two votes, at the expense of <a href="Gillingham%20F.C.">Gillingham F.C.</a>, initially playing in <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division%20South">Division Three (South)</a>. The club's last competitive match before the league was suspended due to the Second World War was a 1–1 draw with local rivals, <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>. Both John Murray Cobbold and director Robert Nevill Cobbold were killed during the war, the position of director being filled by John Cavendish Cobbold in 1948. Despite the interruption due to the war, Duncan managed the club for over 500 games between 1937 and 1955. Following three successive top-eight finishes, the <a href="1949%E2%80%9350%20in%20English%20football">1949–50 season</a> ended with Ipswich in 17th position in Division Three (South), the club's lowest ever league finish.
During the early 1950s <a href="Striker%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> <a href="Tom%20Garneys">Tom Garneys</a> finished as club top-scorer for four seasons in a row, and became the first professional Ipswich player to score four times in a game. During this period, Ipswich won the title and <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">promotion</a> to the <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Two">Second Division</a> in the <a href="1953%E2%80%9354%20in%20English%20football">1953–54</a> season, during which eight consecutive wins were recorded. The club was relegated back to Division Three (South) the following year at the end of a poor season, the highlight of which was progress to the fifth round of the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, a run ended by <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20One">First Division</a> <a href="Preston%20North%20End%20F.C.">Preston North End</a>. Duncan resigned but stayed on at the club in a secretarial role for a further three years. His replacement was a managerial novice, former <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> international and double Championship winner at <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>, <a href="Alf%20Ramsey">Alf Ramsey</a>.

Alf Ramsey's appointment led <a href="Billy%20Wright%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201924%29">Billy Wright</a> to comment, "In appointing Alf to become their manager Ipswich Town paid a tremendous tribute to intelligent football – and footballers who think!" In Ramsey's first season at the club, Ipswich scored 106 goals in 46 games and finished third in <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Three%20South">Division Three (South)</a>. The following season, <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57</a>, the club won the Division Three (South) title for the second time and saw the emergence of local striker <a href="Ted%20Phillips%20%28footballer%29">Ted Phillips</a> who scored 46 times during the season; this remains the highest number of goals scored by an Ipswich player in a season. During the same season, Ipswich played under <a href="floodlight">floodlight</a>s for the first time, at <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a> in September 1956. At the end of that season that John Cavendish Cobbold was appointed as the club's Chairman. Three seasons of mid-table finishes followed as Ipswich established themselves in Division Two, along with moderate success in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, most notably reaching the fifth round in the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a> season.

Ipswich had their most successful season to that point in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a>, winning the Second Division and promotion to the top level of English football, ahead of <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> and <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>. In the top flight, Ipswich became champions of the Football League at the first attempt in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20in%20English%20football">1961–62</a>, with <a href="Ray%20Crawford%20%28footballer%29">Ray Crawford</a> joint English and European top scorer with <a href="Derek%20Kevan">Derek Kevan</a> of <a href="West%20Bromwich%20Albion%20F.C.">West Bromwich Albion</a>. <a href="Matt%20Busby">Matt Busby</a> described the title-winners as "... one of the First Division's most attractive sides ...". As English league champions, Ipswich qualified for European football for the first time. They met <a href="Football%20in%20Malta">Maltese</a> side <a href="Floriana%20F.C.">Floriana</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">European Cup</a>, defeating them 14–1 on aggregate in the first round before losing to <a href="A.C.%20Milan">A.C. Milan</a> in the second round; it would be another 11 years before the club would qualify for Europe again. Ramsey quit the club in April 1963 to take charge of the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England national football team</a>, and Ipswich finished only four places above relegation in the <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20in%20English%20football">1962–63 season</a>. To commemorate Ramsey's success at the club, a statue of him was unveiled outside Portman Road in 2000 by Ray Crawford.

Ramsey was replaced by <a href="Jackie%20Milburn">Jackie Milburn</a>, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch declined. Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich dropped into the Second Division in <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20in%20English%20football">1963–64</a>, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games, still the highest number of goals conceded by Ipswich in a season. Patrick Mark Cobbold, John's brother, joined the board of directors in 1964 and their mother, Lady Blanche Cobbold, became honorary president of the club. Milburn quit after just one full season and was replaced by <a href="Bill%20McGarry">Bill McGarry</a> early in the <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20in%20English%20football">1964–65 season</a>. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion in the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20in%20English%20football">1967–68 season</a>, winning the division by a single point ahead of <a href="Queens%20Park%20Rangers%20F.C.">Queens Park Rangers</a>. McGarry left to manage <a href="Wolverhampton%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wolves</a> and was replaced by <a href="Bobby%20Robson">Bobby Robson</a> in January 1969.

Bobby Robson's appointment followed a chance encounter with Ipswich director Murray Sangster while scouting at <a href="Portman%20Road">Portman Road</a> for <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> manager <a href="Dave%20Sexton">Dave Sexton</a>. Robson had some experience of management from his time at <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a>, although he had been sacked after failing to avoid relegation from <a href="Football%20League%20Division%20Two">Division Two</a>. Robson's sides finished 18th and 19th in his first two seasons at Ipswich, but he kept the team in the top division, before finding greater success. Robson led the club to fourth place in the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">First Division</a> and success in the <a href="Texaco%20Cup">Texaco Cup</a>, beating local rivals <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a> 4–2, in the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20in%20English%20football">1972–73</a> season.

The fourth-place finish meant Ipswich qualified for the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20UEFA%20Cup">1973–74 UEFA Cup</a>. In the first round, they were drawn against six-time European champions <a href="Real%20Madrid%20C.F.">Real Madrid</a>. Following a 1–0 victory at Portman Road, Ipswich needed to defend their slim lead. Ipswich captain <a href="Mick%20Mills">Mick Mills</a> was reported in the Spanish press suggesting that "El Real no es invincible" ("Real are not invincible") and a 0–0 draw at the <a href="Santiago%20Bernab%C3%A9u%20Stadium">Bernabéu</a> secured Ipswich's shock passage into the second round. The club fell at the quarter final stage but fourth place in the league enabled Ipswich to return to the tournament in the following season.

In the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">1974–75 season</a>, Ipswich finished third in the First Division and were losing semi-finalists in the FA Cup. Suffering from cancer and becoming less able to carry out his duties as Chairman, John Cobbold swapped roles with director Patrick Cobbold in 1976. In the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1975–76 season</a> Ipswich finished sixth of the league, and in October 1976, they signed <a href="Paul%20Mariner">Paul Mariner</a> from <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth</a> for a club record £220,000. The team challenged <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a> for the First Division title for much of the <a href="1976%E2%80%9377%20in%20English%20football">1976–77 season</a>, going top of the table in February 1977 with a 5–0 defeat of Norwich City in the <a href="East%20Anglian%20derby">East Anglian derby</a>. Mariner's efforts helped the club to a third place finish, and the following season, he scored seven goals in the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> as the club won the second major honour in its history, <a href="Roger%20Osborne">Roger Osborne</a> scoring the winning goal in a 1–0 victory over <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> in the <a href="1978%20FA%20Cup%20Final">FA Cup Final</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. The club's league fortunes dipped dramatically during the season finishing 18th, just three points above the relegation places, but the team reached the third round of the <a href="1977%E2%80%9378%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, where they beat <a href="FC%20Barcelona">Barcelona</a> 3–0 at Portman Road; Barcelona won the second leg 3–0, <a href="Johan%20Cruyff">Johan Cruyff</a> scoring twice, and Ipswich went out on penalties. The team's FA Cup success secured qualification for the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20European%20Cup%20Winners%27%20Cup">1978–79 European Cup Winners' Cup</a>, where they reached the quarter-finals, again losing to Barcelona. Over the next two seasons Robson brought Dutchmen <a href="Arnold%20M%C3%BChren">Arnold Mühren</a> and <a href="Frans%20Thijssen">Frans Thijssen</a> to the club while the team achieved two further top six finishes in the First Division. However, it was the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20in%20English%20football">1980–81 season</a> which, in Robson's words, "... helped put Ipswich on the map ...".

The club finished second in the league once more and were losing semi-finalists in the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a>, but the real success of the season was victory in the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>. Beating <a href="Michel%20Platini">Michel Platini</a>'s <a href="AS%20Saint-%C3%89tienne">AS Saint-Étienne</a> 4–1 at the <a href="Stade%20Geoffroy-Guichard">Stade Geoffroy-Guichard</a> in the quarter-finals and a 2–0 <a href="Two-legged%20match">aggregate</a> victory over <a href="1.%20FC%20K%C3%B6ln">1. FC Köln</a> in the semi-final led Ipswich to the club's first European final, played over <a href="Two-legged%20tie">two legs</a> against <a href="AZ%2067%20Alkmaar">AZ 67 Alkmaar</a>. A 3–0 victory at Portman Road was followed by a 4–2 defeat at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam, resulting in a 5–4 aggregate victory over the Dutch side.

Ipswich therefore began the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20UEFA%20Cup">1981–82 UEFA Cup campaign</a> as holders, but lost in the first round to Scottish opponents <a href="Aberdeen%20F.C.">Aberdeen</a>. Domestically, the club had continued success, finishing second in the First Division yet again, this time four points behind <a href="Liverpool%20F.C.">Liverpool</a>.

Robson's achievements with Ipswich earned him an offer from <a href="the%20Football%20Association">the Football Association</a> to become the <a href="England%20national%20football%20team">England</a> national coach; he declined an offer of a ten-year contract extension from Ipswich director Patrick Cobbold. On 7 July 1982, two days after England were knocked out of the <a href="1982%20FIFA%20World%20Cup">1982 World Cup</a>, Bobby Robson left Ipswich to succeed <a href="Ron%20Greenwood">Ron Greenwood</a> as coach of England. During his 13-year tenure at Ipswich, Robson brought in only 14 players from other clubs, relying instead on players developed through the club's youth programmes. In 2002, in recognition of Robson's achievements with the club, a life-size statue of him was unveiled opposite the Cobbold Stand at Portman Road. On 7 July 2006, Robson was named as honorary president of Ipswich Town Football Club, the first since Lady Blanche Cobbold who had died in 1987.

Bobby Robson was replaced at Ipswich by his chief coach, <a href="Bobby%20Ferguson%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201938%29">Bobby Ferguson</a>. Ferguson made the transition from coach to manager in July 1982, but some success in the various cup competitions was offset by an end to the high league positions the club had enjoyed under Robson. In the three seasons from <a href="1982%E2%80%9383%20in%20English%20football">1982–83</a> to <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85</a>, Ipswich reached the FA Cup quarter-final and League Cup semi-final in 1985, but declined in the league, finishing 9th, 12th and 17th. In the following season, the team's league form was even poorer, resulting in a 20th-place finish and relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a>. Ipswich finished fifth in the Second Division in the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">1986–87</a> season to qualify for the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship%20playoffs">play-offs</a>, but Ferguson resigned after losing to 2–1 on aggregate to <a href="Charlton%20Athletic%20F.C.">Charlton Athletic</a>.
From 1987 to 1990, Ipswich Town were managed by <a href="John%20Duncan%20%28footballer%29">John Duncan</a>, but achieved only mid-table finishes each season with the club gaining a reputation as a "competent Second Division side". Duncan was sacked in June 1990 and was replaced by <a href="John%20Lyall">John Lyall</a>, whose 14-year reign as <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> manager had ended the previous summer. During that time the Hammers had won the FA Cup twice and finished third in the league. Lyall guided Ipswich to a mid-table finish in the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20in%20English%20football">1990–91 season</a> but a considerable improvement the following season led to winning the Second Division championship. The team was promoted to join the inaugural season of the <a href="FA%20Premier%20League">FA Premier League</a>.

After a good start to the season, Ipswich were in fourth place in the league in January 1993, but a dip in form during the final weeks of the season saw the club finish 16th. <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20FA%20Premier%20League">The next season</a> was almost a mirror of the previous; Ipswich again made a good start, followed by a late slump in results. The club only avoided relegation when <a href="Sheffield%20United%20F.C.">Sheffield United</a> suffered a last-gasp 3–2 defeat at <a href="Chelsea%20F.C.">Chelsea</a> on the final day of the season. Lyall was sacked as Ipswich manager in December 1994 with the club at the bottom of the Premiership. His successor <a href="George%20Burley">George Burley</a> was unable to turn things around and Ipswich suffered a "humiliating" 9–0 defeat at <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> in early March, the biggest margin in a Premiership match. Relegation was confirmed soon afterwards and Ipswich ended the season having conceded 93 goals in 42 league games. Patrick Cobbold had left his role as club Chairman in 1991, handing his position to John Kerr. His brother had died in 1983 and Patrick died suddenly in 1994, but the Cobbold connection continued when Patrick and John's nephew Major Philip William Hope-Cobbold joined the board in 1995.

Having served on the board of directors since 1986, <a href="David%20Sheepshanks">David Sheepshanks</a> was appointed as club Chairman in 1995. The next four seasons brought near-misses as the club flirted with promotion; in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20Football%20League">1995–96</a>, Ipswich fell one place short of the First Division play-off zone, and the ensuing three seasons brought successive semi-final play-off defeats. In 2000, Ipswich qualified for the <a href="Football%20League%20First%20Division">Division One</a> play-off final, the last such match at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> before the stadium was to be redeveloped. They beat <a href="Barnsley%20F.C.">Barnsley</a> 4–2 securing their return to the Premiership after an absence of five years.

Ipswich made only one major signing during the off-season, buying <a href="Hermann%20Hrei%C3%B0arsson">Hermann Hreiðarsson</a> from <a href="Wimbledon%20F.C.">Wimbledon F.C.</a> for a club record £4m two days before the season commenced. Television pundits <a href="Rodney%20Marsh%20%28footballer%29">Rodney Marsh</a> and <a href="Mark%20Lawrenson">Mark Lawrenson</a> both agreed relegation would be the obvious outcome. Ipswich surprised the doubters; they sustained a high league position and narrowly missed out on qualification for the <a href="UEFA%20Champions%20League">UEFA Champions League</a>, when the team failed to win on the last day of the season against <a href="Derby%20County%20F.C.">Derby County</a>. The fifth-place finish gained the club a <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> place and earned George Burley the title of <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%20Manager%20of%20the%20Year">FA Premier League Manager of the Year</a>, an award that until 2010 had, in every other season, been given to the manager of the Premier League champions.

<a href="Matteo%20Sereni">Matteo Sereni</a> and <a href="Finidi%20George">Finidi George</a> arrived before the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20FA%20Premier%20League">2001–02</a> season to boost the squad for its foray into Europe. The club's league form was poor, and 18 games into the campaign, Ipswich were bottom of the table with just one league victory. However, there was some relief in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a> with a victory over <a href="Inter%20Milan">Inter Milan</a> 1–0 at home in the third round, despite which the tie was lost over two legs after a 4–1 defeat at the <a href="San%20Siro">San Siro</a>. From bottom of the table at Christmas, a run of seven wins from eight fixtures appeared to have secured the team's league status, but another decline set in and relegation was confirmed on the final day of the season with a 5–0 defeat by Liverpool at <a href="Anfield">Anfield</a>. The loss of income due to relegation to the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship">Championship</a> contributed to the club going into <a href="Administration%20%28law%29">financial administration</a>, resulting in the sale of a number of players including <a href="Jamie%20Clapham">Jamie Clapham</a>, <a href="Darren%20Ambrose">Darren Ambrose</a>, and club captain <a href="Matt%20Holland">Matt Holland</a>. Ipswich had the consolation of again qualifying for the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, through <a href="UEFA">UEFA</a>'s <a href="UEFA%20Fair%20Play%20ranking">Fair Play system</a>, losing in the second round to Czech side <a href="Slovan%20Liberec">Slovan Liberec</a>. A poor start to the domestic season, leaving the club 19th in the table by mid-October, resulted in George Burley being sacked after nearly eight years as manager.

First team coach <a href="Tony%20Mowbray">Tony Mowbray</a> was in charge for four games as caretaker manager, winning once, but he was replaced as manager by the permanent appointment of former <a href="Oldham%20Athletic%20A.F.C.">Oldham Athletic</a>, <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a> and <a href="Manchester%20City%20F.C.">Manchester City</a> manager <a href="Joe%20Royle">Joe Royle</a>, whose managerial career had previously yielded four promotions and one FA Cup victory; as a player, he had been named <a href="List%20of%20Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20players%20of%20the%20year">player of the year</a> in his only full season at Ipswich's local rivals Norwich City.
When Royle became Ipswich manager, the club was struggling near the Division One relegation zone, but the change in management sparked a revival and Ipswich narrowly failed to reach the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">2002–03</a> play-offs. The club came out of administration during the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Football%20League">2003–04 season</a>, and continued to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League. Ipswich finished that season in fifth place, but were beaten in the play-off semi finals by <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a> 2–1 on aggregate. Ipswich missed automatic promotion in the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20Football%20League%20Championship">2004–05 season</a>, finishing third, only two points behind second-placed <a href="Wigan%20Athletic%20F.C.">Wigan Athletic</a>. Again, they lost to West Ham United in the play off semi-finals, this time by a 4–2 aggregate score. Although they had been pre-season promotion favourites for the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20Football%20League%20Championship">2005–06 season</a>, Ipswich finished 15th, the club's lowest finish since 1966, and Joe Royle resigned on 11 May 2006.

At a press conference held on 5 June 2006, <a href="Jim%20Magilton">Jim Magilton</a> was officially named as the new manager and former academy director <a href="Bryan%20Klug">Bryan Klug</a> was appointed as first team coach. In Magilton's first season, the club reached a final placing of 14th place in the table. That year, Ipswich became the first <a href="carbon%20neutral">carbon neutral</a> football club in England following a collaboration between the fans and the club's main sponsor <a href="E.ON">E.ON</a>. In October 2007, Ipswich agreed to sell a £44m stake in the club to British businessman <a href="Marcus%20Evans">Marcus Evans</a> who became the majority owner and shareholder. <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08</a> brought further progress for Magilton and his side, who finished eighth in the final table. Magilton's team failed to gain promotion or reach the <a href="Football%20League%20Championship%20play-offs">play-offs</a> in the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Football%20League%20Championship">2008–09</a> season, and on 22 April 2009 Magilton was sacked. His successor, <a href="Roy%20Keane">Roy Keane</a>, was appointed as manager the following day. Sheepshanks stood down as chairman after 14 years on 20 May 2009. Ipswich started the 2009–10 season winless in the league after 14 games and bottom of the Championship, their worst ever start to a league season. Limited success throughout the year saw the club finish 15th in Keane's first full season at the club. Keane's second season at the club started well but by the start of 2011, the club were 19th in the Championship, and he left the club on 7 January 2011. First team coach <a href="Ian%20McParland">Ian McParland</a> stood in as caretaker manager for two matches, including a semi-final first leg win in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a> against Arsenal, before <a href="Paul%20Jewell">Paul Jewell</a> took the role on permanently in mid-January 2011. Ipswich finished 13th that season, and 15th the following, Jewell's first full season at the club. The longest-serving members of the Championship, Ipswich were bottom of the league by late October, and Jewell left the club by "mutual consent", leaving <a href="Chris%20Hutchings">Chris Hutchings</a> in a caretaker role. After a single match, Hutchings was replaced by <a href="Mick%20McCarthy">Mick McCarthy</a> on a full-time basis. McCarthy led Ipswich to finish in 14th position <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">that season</a>, and 9th in the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">following season</a>. Despite losing their final match of the <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2014–15 season</a>, Ipswich finished in sixth place and secured a <a href="2015%20Football%20League%20play-offs">play-off place</a> where they played their local rivals <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City</a>, losing 4–1 on aggregate. The following season Ipswich finished just outside the playoff places, in seventh place. The <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2016–17 season</a> saw Ipswich finish 16th, their lowest finish since the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20Football%20League">1958–59 season</a>. On 29 March 2018, the club announced that Mick McCarthy's contract, which was due to expire at the end of the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2017–18 season</a>, would not be extended. McCarthy announced that he was quitting during the post-match press conference following a 1–0 victory over Barnsley on 10 April 2018. He was replaced until the end of the season by <a href="Bryan%20Klug">Bryan Klug</a> as a caretaker manager. 

<a href="Paul%20Hurst">Paul Hurst</a> was appointed as manager for the start of the <a href="2018%E2%80%9319%20Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.%20season">2018–19 season</a>, with the club heralding it as "a new era", but was sacked less than five months later after securing a single victory in fourteen league matches, leaving Ipswich bottom of the Championship. On 27 October 2018, former Norwich City manager <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a> was appointed as the new manager.

Armament of the Iowa-class battleship

The s were the most heavily armed gunships the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> has ever put to sea due to the continual development of their onboard weaponry. The first "Iowa"-class ship was laid down in June 1940; in their World War II configuration, each of the "Iowa"-class battleships had a main <a href="artillery%20battery">battery</a> of guns that could hit targets nearly 20 statute miles (32 km) away with a variety of <a href="artillery">artillery</a> shells designed for anti-ship or bombardment work. The secondary battery of guns could hit targets nearly 9 statute miles (14 km) away with solid projectiles or proximity fuzed shells, and were equally adept in an anti-aircraft role and for damaging smaller ships. Each of the four battleships carried a wide array of 20 mm and 40 mm <a href="Anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft guns</a> for defense against enemy aircraft.

When reactivated and modernized in the 1980s each battleship retained the original battery of nine guns, but the secondary battery on each battleship was reduced from ten twin-gun mounts and twenty guns to six twin-gun mounts with 12 guns to allow for the installation of two platforms for the Tomahawk missiles. Each battleship also received four Harpoon missile magazines, <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx</a> anti-aircraft/anti-missile <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a> systems, and <a href="electronic%20warfare">electronic warfare</a> suites.

The primary armament of an "Iowa"-class battleship consisted of nine <a href="Breech-loading%20weapon">breech-loading</a> <a href="16%20inch%20%28406%20mm%29/50%20caliber%20Mark%207%20naval%20gun">16 inch (406 mm)/50-caliber Mark 7 naval guns</a>, which were housed in three 3-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s: two forward and one aft in a configuration known as "2-A-1". The guns were 66 feet (20 m) long (50 times their bore, or 50 calibers, from <a href="breechface">breechface</a> to <a href="muzzle%20%28firearm%29">muzzle</a>). About 43 feet (13 m) protruded from the gun house. Each gun weighed about 239,000 pounds (108 000 kg) without the breech, or 267,900 pounds with the breech. They fired armor-piercing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of , or high-capacity projectiles at , up to .

Each gun rested within an armored turret, but only the top of the turret protruded above the main deck. The turret extended either four decks (Turrets 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate the turret and to elevate the guns attached to each turret. At the bottom of the turret were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. All of the compartments within the turrets were separated by flameproof bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the turret. Each turret required a crew of 77–94 men to operate. The turrets were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were to <a href="capsize">capsize</a> the turrets would fall out. Each turret cost US$1.4 million, but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves.

The turrets were "three-gun," not "triple," because each barrel could be elevated and fired independently. The ship could fire any combination of its guns, including a <a href="broadside">broadside</a> of all nine.

The guns could be elevated from −5° to +45°, moving at up to 12° per second. The turrets could be rotated about 300° at a rate of about four degrees per second and can even be fired back beyond the <a href="Beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a>, which is sometimes called "over the shoulder." The guns were never fired horizontally forward (in the 1980s refit, a satellite up-link antenna was mounted at the bow). To distinguish between the rounds fired from different battleships the "Iowa" class used dye bags which allowed artillery observers to determine which rounds had been fired by which ship. "Iowa", "New Jersey", "Missouri," and "Wisconsin" were assigned the colors orange, blue, red and green, respectively.

Within each turret, a red stripe on the interior wall, inches from the railing, marked the boundary of the barrel's recoil, warning the crew to keep back.
When brought into service during World War II the guns had a barrel life of roughly 290 rounds, limited in large part by the nitrated cellulose (NC) propellant. After World War II the Navy switched to smokeless powder diphenylamine (SPD), a cooler-burning propellant, which increased the barrel life from 290 to about 350 rounds. This was increased further by the introduction of a titanium dioxide and wax compound known as "Swedish Additive" on for her tour in Vietnam, and later used on all four "Iowa"s when they were reactivated in the 1980s. These measures were further augmented by the addition of polyurethane jackets, which were placed over the powder bags to reduce gaseous erosion during the firing of the guns. These measures greatly prolonged barrel life, and ultimately resulted in a shift from measuring barrel life in equivalent service rounds (ESR) to measuring barrel life in fatigue equivalent rounds (FER).

After the guns were fired, each rifle barrel had to be cleaned. Unlike small caliber guns which can be field-stripped, the guns aboard an "Iowa"-class battleship could not be disassembled, so the gunners mates assigned the job of cleaning the rifles required a full day or more to ensure that the barrels were correctly and adequately cleaned. To clean the rifles, a bore brush was lifted by two sailors and inserted into the gun barrel, where it was pulled through the rifle with the same equipment used to load the shells. Within the turret, crewmen checked to ensure that the breech fittings were properly cleaned and lubricated, while sailors outside the turret scraped off soot, and painted over flash burns left from the explosive expulsion of the 16-inch shells from the gun barrels.

The early main battery fire control consisted of the Fire Control Tower, two Mark 38 Gun Fire Control Systems (GFCS), and fire control equipment located in two of the three turrets. As modernized in the 1980s, each turret carried a DR-810 radar that measured the muzzle velocity of each gun, which made it easier to predict the velocity of succeeding shots. Together with the Mark 160 FCS and better propellant consistency, the improvements created the most accurate battleship-caliber guns ever made.

The Fire Control Tower is the tallest superstructure on the ship. It houses several interesting areas, including a second Captain's Sea Cabin (on the 08 level), the 08 Battle Bridge, and at the top, the Mk 38 Fire Control Director (Spot 1) for the main guns. The aft Mk 38 is Spot 2. (9)

The Captain's 08 Sea Cabin is smaller and less outfitted than his cabin on the 04 Bridge behind the Chart House.

The 08 Battle Bridge Is a fully equipped Helm, and is armored, although it is not as large as the Helm in the Armored Conning Tower on the 04 level Navigation Bridge, nor is the armor as thick. The Battle Bridge gave better visibility in those early days of Radar.

While the Mk 38 Director is on the 012 level, the Gunnery Officer's station is the top level of the Armored Conning Tower on the 05 level (Spot 3).It was equipped with periscopes poking through the armor, and control consoles showing the status of the ship's weapons (director bearings, turret bearings, gun's loaded status, Fire Control (FC) Radar displays, etc.). With the radar's displays, the Gunnery Officer could determine what aim corrections (Spots) were needed by watching the fall of shot around the target.

The major components of the Mk 38 Gun Fire Control System (GFCS) were the Director, Plotting Room, and interconnecting data transmission equipment. Two systems, forward and aft, were each complete and independent, though they could be cross-connected. Their plotting rooms were isolated to protect against battle damage propagating from one to the other.

The forward Mk 38 Director ("pictured") was situated on top of the fire control tower. The director was equipped with optical sights, optical Mark 45 Rangefinder (the long thin boxes sticking out of each side), and a Mark 13 Fire Control Radar antenna (the rectangular shape sitting on top). The purpose of the director was to track the target's present bearing and range. This could be done optically by the men inside using the sights and Rangefinder, or electronically with the <a href="radar">radar</a>. (The FC radar was the preferred method.) The present position of the target was called the Line-Of-Sight (LOS), and it was continuously sent down to the Mk 8 Rangekeeper in the plotting room by <a href="Synchro">Synchro</a> transmitters. Also, when not using the radar's display to determine Spots, the director was the optical spotting station.

The forward main battery plotting room was located below the waterline and inside the armored belt. It housed the forward system's Mark 8 Rangekeeper, Mark 41 Stable Vertical, Mk13 FC Radar controls and displays, <a href="Parallax">Parallax</a> Correctors, Fire Control Switchboard, battle telephone switchboard, battery status indicators, assistant Gunnery Officers, and Fire Control Technicians (FTs).

The Mk 8 Rangekeeper was an electromechanical <a href="analog%20computer">analog computer</a> whose function was to continuously calculate the gun's bearing and elevation, Line-Of-Fire (LOF), to hit a future position of the target. It did this by automatically receiving information from the director (LOS), the FC Radar (range), the ship's <a href="gyrocompass">gyrocompass</a> (true ship's course), the ship's <a href="Pitometer%20log">Pitometer log</a> (ship's speed), the Stable Vertical (ship's roll and pitch), and the ship's anemometer (relative wind speed and direction). Also, before the surface action started, the FTs made manual inputs for the average initial velocity of the projectiles fired out of the battery's gun barrels, and air density. With all this information, the Rangekeeper calculated the relative motion between "OWN SHIP" and "TARGET". It then could calculate an offset angle and change of range between the target's present position (LOS) and future position at the end of the projectile's time of flight. To this bearing and range offset, it added corrections for gravity, wind, <a href="Magnus%20effect">Magnus effect</a> of the spinning projectile, earth's curvature, and <a href="coriolis%20effect">coriolis effect</a>. The result was the turret's bearing and elevation orders (LOF). During the surface action, range and deflection Spots and target altitude (not zero during Gun Fire Support) were manually entered.

The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a vertical seeking gyroscope. Its function was to establish and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. ("see picture") The left key was the <a href="Salvo">Salvo</a> Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.

The Mk 13 FC Radar supplied present target range, and it showed the fall of shot around the target so the Gunnery Officer could correct the system's aim with range and deflection spots put into the Rangekeeper. It could also automatically track the target by controlling the director's bearing power drive. Because of radar, Fire Control systems are able to track and fire at targets at a greater range and with increased accuracy during the day, night, or inclement weather. This was demonstrated in November 1942 when the battleship engaged the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a> <a href="Japanese%20battleship%20Kirishima">"Kirishima"</a> at a range of at night. The engagement left "Kirishima" in flames, and she was ultimately scuttled by her crew. This capability gave the United States Navy a major advantage in World War II, as the Japanese did not develop radar or automated fire control to the level of the US Navy and were at a significant disadvantage. See also <a href="Battle%20of%20Surigao%20Strait">The Battle of Surigao Strait (25 October 1944)</a> during the WWII Leyte Gulf landings.
The <a href="Parallax">Parallax</a> Correctors were needed because the turrets were located hundreds of feet from the director. There was one for each turret, and each had the turret/director distance manually set in. They automatically received Relative Target Bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and Target Range. They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the same point.

The Fire Control Switchboard configured the battery. With it, the Gunnery Officer could mix and match the three turrets to the two GFCSs. He could have the turrets all controlled by the forward system, all controlled by the aft system, or split the battery to shoot at two targets.

The assistant Gunnery Officers and Fire Control Technicians operated the equipment, talked to the turrets and ship's command by <a href="sound-powered%20telephone">sound-powered telephone</a>, and watched the Rangekeeper's dials and system status indicators for problems. If a problem arose, they could correct the problem, or reconfigure the system to mitigate its effect.

Turrets 2 and 3 had optical rangefinders and ballistics computers. (The rangefinders are the boxes on the turret's rear corners). If in a surface action the GFCSs were damaged, the Turret Officer could turn the Auto-Local rotary switch to Local and continue the action using the turret's fire control equipment.

The large caliber guns were designed to fire two different 16-inch shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment. A third type of ammunition for delivering tactical nuclear warheads was developed subsequently.

The Mk. 8 APC (Armor-Piercing, Capped) shell weighed 2,700 lb (1225 kg) and was designed to penetrate the hardened steel armor carried by foreign battleships. At 20,000 yards (18 km) the Mk. 8 could penetrate 20 inches (500 mm) of steel armor plate. At the same range, the Mk. 8 could penetrate 21 feet (6.4 m) of reinforced concrete.

For unarmored targets and shore bombardment, the 1,900 lb (862 kg) Mk. 13 HC (High-Capacity – referring to the large bursting charge) shell was available. The Mk. 13 shell would create a <a href="impact%20crater">crater</a> 50 feet (15 m) wide and 20 feet (6 m) deep upon impact and detonation, and could defoliate trees 400 yards (360 m) from the point of impact. Mk. 13 High Capacity shells that were made by manufacturers other than the Naval Gun Factory received the designation Mk. 14 HC, but were otherwise identical.

The final type of ammunition developed for the "Iowa" class were "<a href="W19%20%28nuclear%20artillery%20shell%29">Katie</a>" shells. These shells were born from the concept of <a href="mutual%20assured%20destruction">nuclear deterrence</a> that had begun to shape the United States armed forces as the Cold War began. To compete with the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">Air Force</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a>, which had developed nuclear bombs and nuclear shells for use on the battlefield, the US Navy began a top-secret program to develop Mk. 23 nuclear naval shells with an estimated yield of 15 to 20 kilotons. These shells were designed to be launched from the best seaborne artillery platform available, which at the time were the four ships of the "Iowa" class. The shells entered development around 1953, and were reportedly ready by 1956; it is not known whether they were ever deployed on the "Iowa"-class battleships because the US Navy does not confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons aboard its ships. In 1991 the US unilaterally withdrew its nuclear artillery shells from service, and Russia responded in kind in 1992. The US removed around 1,300 nuclear shells from Europe and reportedly dismantled its last shells by 2003.

The secondary battery was a dual-purpose weapon system; it was designed to defend the ship from either surface or airborne threats. The original secondary battery consisted of 10 Mark 28, Mod 2 twin gun mounts, and four Mark 37 Gun Fire Control Systems. At first, this battery's effectiveness against aircraft diminished as planes became faster, but this changed toward the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> through a combination of an upgrade to the Mk37 System and the development of the VT (Variable Time) <a href="proximity%20fuze">proximity fuze</a>. In preparation for the reactivations in the 1960s and 1980s, the battery was updated to the latest gun and fire control system modifications. In the 1968 upgrade to the USS "New Jersey" for service off Vietnam, three Mark 56 Gun Fire Control Systems were installed, two on either side just forward of the aft stack, and one between the aft mast and the aft Mk 38 Director tower. This increased New Jersey's anti-aircraft capability, because the Mk 56 system could track and shoot at faster planes. In the 1980s modernization, the Mk 56 GFCSs and four mounts were removed to make room for missiles, leaving the Secondary battery with four Mk 37 GFCSs and six twin mounts on all the "Iowa" class. By the time of the <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a> the secondary battery was largely relegated to shore bombardment and <a href="littoral">littoral</a> defense. Since each battleship carried a small detachment of <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a> aboard, the Marines would man one of the 5-inch gun mounts.

Each Mk 28 Mod 2 Mount carried two <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">Mark 12, 5in/38cal gun assemblies</a>, electric-hydraulic drives for bearing and elevation, optical sights, automatic fuze setter, automatic sight setter, and an upper handling room. Each armored twin mount weighed . The mount had a crew of 13, not including the ammunition movers in the upper handling room and magazines, drawn from the sailors and Marines serving aboard the ship.

The Mk 12 Gun Assembly ("pictured") was a semi-automatic, power rammed, vertical sliding-wedge breech block type gun. The Gun Assembly shown in the picture is the mount's right gun. The left gun is the mirror image of the right gun. Since this gun assembly fired <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun%23Ammunition">semi-fixed ammunition</a>, ("pictured") each round was delivered to the guns in two pieces. Each gun, in this twin mount, had its own projectile hoist and powder case hoist from the upper handling room. The electric-hydraulic projectile hoist would deliver a projectile next to the projectile man with the nose down and waist high. The electric-hydraulic powder case hoist poked the case through a powder scuttle in the gun room's deck just next to the powder man's feet. At the load command, the powder man would slip a primer protector off the end of the powder case, extract the case from the scuttle, and lift it into the gun's rammer tray. Meanwhile, the projectile man would pull a projectile out of the hoist, and place it in the rammer tray in front of the powder case. Then, as he turned to get the next projectile out of the hoist, the projectile man would pull down on the rammer lever. This caused the power rammer to ram the projectile and powder case into the chamber. As the powder case cleared the top of the breechblock, the block would rise to seal the chamber. The gun was ready to fire. The case combination primer in the base of the powder case could be fired either electrically or by percussion. Electrical firing was the preferred method because the firing circuit could be energized by firing keys down in the plotting room when firing salvos at surface targets, or up in the director when firing at air targets. Percussion firing could be executed by the Pointer (man controlling elevation) by pushing a foot treadle. When the gun fired, the recoil's rearward motion returned the rammer lever to the up position, and the rammer would drive back to the rear of the rammer tray. During counter-recoil, the breechblock was automatically lowered and the spent powder case was ejected from the chamber. When the gun returned to battery, a blast of compressed air was sent down the bore to clean it out. The gun was ready to be reloaded.

The electric-hydraulic drives powered the mount's motion. The three modes of drive operation were automatic, local, and manual. In automatic, the drives would follow the bearing and elevation orders of the fire control system. In local, the drives would follow the motion of the trainer's and pointer's hand wheels. (This is similar to power steering on a car.) Manual was direct gear linkage from the hand wheels to move the mount with no power assist.

The periscopic sights (the boxes on the side of the mount) allowed the trainer and pointer to see the target from inside the armored enclosure. Each sight had movable prisms that allowed its line of sight to be moved relative to the barrel's bore axis. These prisms could be controlled by the fire control system when the mount was in Automatic, or by the mount's sight setter operator when the mount was in Local. Local control was not the preferred combat method, but it could be used if the fire control systems were damaged. The mount captain was trained in aiming and correcting the fall of shot.

The upper handling room was just below the visible part of the mount. It was armored and reinforced to support the weight of the mount. A person standing in the upper handling room could look up and see the bottom of the gun mount inside the training circle on which the mount rotated. Hanging from the mount, and rotating with it, was the equipment used to pass ammunition up to the mount. This included the lower ends of the projectile and powder case hoists. In the center of the room there was a vertical tube that also turned with the mount. This tube enclosed the electrical power and control cables going up to the mount. Around the perimeter of the upper handling room were the ready service ammunition racks welded to the bulkheads. Close by, either in a corner of the handling room or in an adjoining compartment was the upper end of an ammunition hoist from the magazine. The responsibility of the men stationed in the upper handling room was to shuttle 30 to 40 projectiles and 30 to 40 powder cases per minute from the ready service racks to the hoists while avoiding the equipment rotating with the mount. During quiet spells, they would replenish the ready service racks with ammunition from the magazines.

 The <a href="Mark%2037%20Gun%20Fire%20Control%20System">Mark 37 Gun Fire Control System</a> (GFCS) was the primary Fire Control System for the Secondary Battery. There were four Mk37 GFCSs on board; one forward above the navigation bridge, two amidships on either side of the forward stack, and one aft between the aft Mk38 Director and Turret three. The major components of the Mk 37 GFCS were the Mk 37 Director, and the equipment in the plotting room.

The function of the <a href="Mark%2037%20director">Mark 37 director</a> ("pictured") was to track the present position of the target in bearing, elevation, and range. To do this, it had optical sights (the rectangular windows on the front), an optical rangefinder (the tubes sticking out each side), and Fire Control Radar antennas. On the MK 37 Director pictured, the rectangular antenna is for the Mark 12 FC radar, and the parabolic antenna on the left is for the Mk 22 FC radar. They were part of an upgrade to improve tracking of aircraft. The Director Officer also had a Slew Sight that he could use to quickly point the director towards a new target.

The secondary battery plotting rooms were down below the waterline and inside the armor belt. They contained four complete sets of fire control equipment needed to aim and shoot at four targets. Each set included a Mark 1A computer, a Mark 6 Stable Element, FC Radar controls and displays, Parallax correctors, a switchboard, and crew to operate it all.
The <a href="Mark%20I%20Fire%20Control%20Computer">Mark 1A Fire Control Computer</a> ("pictured") was an electro-mechanical analog ballistic computer. Its function was to automatically aim the guns so that a fired projectile would collide with the target. This was the same function as the main battery's Mk 8 Rangekeeper above except that some of the targets the Mark 1A had to deal with also moved in elevation – and much faster. For a surface target, the Secondary Battery's Fire Control problem is the same as the Main Battery's with the same type inputs and outputs. The major difference between the two computers was their ballistics calculations. The amount of gun elevation needed to project a 5-inch (127 mm) shell is different than the elevation needed to project a 16-inch shell the same distance. The ballistics calculations in these mechanical analog computers were performed by mechanisms like differential gears, levers, and small rods riding on the surface of three-dimensional cams. These mechanical adders, multipliers, and table lookup devices were handmade at the factory, and were buried deep in the workings of the computer. It was not possible to change a computer's ballistics at sea until the advent of fast digital computers. The anti-aircraft fire control problem was more complicated because it had the additional requirement of tracking the target in elevation and making target predictions in three dimensions. The outputs of the Mk 1A were the same (gun bearing and elevation), except fuze time was added. The fuze time was needed because the ideal of directly hitting the fast moving aircraft with the projectile was impractical. With fuze time set into the shell, it was hoped that it would explode near enough to the target to destroy it with the shock wave and shrapnel. Towards the end of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the invention of the VT <a href="proximity%20fuze">proximity fuze</a> eliminated the need to use the fuze time calculation and its possible error. This greatly increased the odds of destroying an air target.
The function of the Mk 6 Stable Element ("pictured") in this fire control system was the same as the function of the Mk 41 Stable Vertical in the main battery system above. It was a vertical seeking gyroscope that supplied the system with a stable up direction on a rolling and pitching ship. In surface mode, it replaced the director's elevation signal. It also had the surface mode firing keys.

The <a href="Fire-control%20radar">Fire-control radar</a> used on the Mk 37 GFCS has evolved. In the 1930s, the Mk 37 Director did not have a radar antenna. Then in September 1941, the rectangular Mk 4 Fire-control radar antenna was mounted on top. Soon aircraft flew faster, and in c1944 to increase speed and accuracy the Mk 4 was replaced by a combination of the Mk 12 (rectangular antenna) and Mk 22 (parabolic antenna) radars. ("pictured") Finally, the circular SPG 25 antenna was mounted on top as seen in the USS "Wisconsin" photo at the top of this article. (Look at the Mk 37 Director just above the bridge.)

Since they were designed to escort the US fleet of fast attack aircraft carriers, the "Iowa"-class battleships were all intended to carry a fearsome array of anti-aircraft guns to protect US aircraft carriers from Japanese fighters and dive bombers. This array included up to 20 quad 40 mm mounts and 49 single 20 mm mounts. In the 1968 USS "New Jersey" re-activation for service off Vietnam, the 20 mm and 40 mm batteries were removed. In the 1980s re-activation, all the ships with 20 mm and 40 mm batteries had them removed, and four Phalanx CIWS mounts were added to all.

The <a href="Oerlikon%20Contraves">Oerlikon</a> <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">20 mm anti-aircraft gun</a> was one of the most heavily produced <a href="anti-aircraft%20gun">anti-aircraft gun</a>s of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>; the US alone manufactured a total of 124,735 of these guns. When activated in 1941 these guns replaced the <a href="M2%20Browning%20machine%20gun">0.50"/90 (12.7 mm) M2 Browning MG</a> on a one-for-one basis. The Oerlikon 20 mm AA gun remained the primary anti-aircraft weapon of the United States Navy until the introduction of the <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">40 mm Bofors AA gun</a> in 1943.

These guns were air-cooled and used a gas blowback recoil system. Unlike other automatic guns employed during World War II the barrel of the 20 mm Oerlikon gun did not recoil, the breechblock never locked against the breech and actually moved forward when the gun fired. This weapon lacked a counter-recoil brake, as the force of the counter-recoil was checked by the explosion of the next round of ammunition.
Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon, with the high point being 48.3% for the second half of 1942. In 1943 the revolutionary Mark 14 Gun Sight was introduced which made these guns even more effective; however, the 20 mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese <a href="Kamikaze">Kamikaze</a> attacks used during the latter half of World War II. They were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">40 mm Bofors AA guns</a>.

Arguably the best light anti-aircraft weapon of World War II, the <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20anti-aircraft%20gun">Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun</a> was used on almost every major warship in the US and UK fleet during World War II from about 1943 to 1945. Although a descendant of German and Swedish designs, the Bofors mounts used by the US Navy during World War II had been heavily "Americanized" to bring the guns up to the standards placed on them by the US Navy. This resulted in a guns system set to English standards (now known as the <a href="United%20States%20customary%20units">Standard System</a>) with interchangeable ammunition, which simplified the logistics situation for World War II. When coupled with electric-hydraulic drives for greater speed and the Mark 51 Director ("pictured") for improved accuracy, the Bofors 40 mm gun became a fearsome adversary, accounting for roughly half of all Japanese aircraft shot down between 1 October 1944 and 1 February 1945.

When the "Iowa"-class battleships were launched in 1943 and 1944 they carried twenty quad Bofors 40 mm gun mounts, which they used for defense against enemy aircraft. These heavy guns were also employed in the protection of allied aircraft carriers operating in the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">Pacific Theater of World War II</a>. These guns remained on the battleships "Iowa, Missouri," and "Wisconsin" from the time they were commissioned until they were reactivated for service in the 1980s. As each battleship arrived for modernization during the early and mid-1980s the Bofors mounts that remained aboard were removed due in large part to the ineffectiveness of such manually aimed weapons against modern day jet fighters and enemy missiles. The replacement for the Bofors guns was the US Navy's <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx</a> <a href="Close-in%20weapon%20system">Close-in weapon system</a> (CIWS).

During their modernization in the 1980s, each "Iowa"-class battleship was equipped with four of the US Navy's <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx CIWS</a> mounts, two of which sat just behind the bridge and two which were forward and outboard of the after ship's funnel. , , and were equipped with the Block 0 version of the Phalanx, while received the first operational Block 1 version in 1988.

Developed as the final line of defense (terminal defense or point defense) against anti-ship missiles, the Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS, pronounced ""sea-whiz"") is the anti-aircraft/anti-missile gun currently in use in the US Navy. Due to their distinctive shape, they have been nicknamed "R2D2s", in reference to the droid <a href="R2-D2">R2-D2</a> from the <a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a> universe. Designed in the early 1970s by <a href="General%20Dynamics">General Dynamics</a>, and currently produced by <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a>, the Phalanx CIWS mount utilizes a 20 mm <a href="M61%20Vulcan">M61 Vulcan</a> <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a> to destroy enemy missiles and aircraft that manage to escape anti-missile and anti-aircraft missiles fired from friendly ships.

The Phalanx guns worked by using a search radar and a tracking radar to follow targets that approached within 1 to . When a target was within this range the CIWS mount moved to track the target while simultaneously evaluating the target against several preset criteria to determine the next course of action. Depending on whether the target criteria were met, the Phalanx mount automatically engaged the incoming target if it was judged to be hostile in nature, or the system recommended that the Phalanx operator engage the target.

Phalanx CIWS mounts were used by "Missouri" and "Wisconsin" during the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>; "Wisconsin" alone fired 5,200 20 mm Phalanx CIWS rounds. "Missouri" also received Phalanx fire during a "<a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a>" incident in which the <a href="guided%20missile%20frigate">guided missile frigate</a> mistook <a href="Chaff%20%28radar%20countermeasure%29">chaff</a> fired by "Missouri" for a legitimate target and shot at "Missouri". Rounds from this attack struck the ship in the bulkhead above the famed "surrender deck" and bounced off the armor, one round penetrated the forward funnel and passed completely through it, and another round penetrated a bulkhead and embedded in an interior passageway of the ship.

During the modernization in the 1980s, three important weapons were added to the "Iowa"-class battleships. The first was the CIWS anti-aircraft/anti-missile system discussed above. The other two were missiles for use against both land and sea targets. At one point the NATO <a href="Sea%20Sparrow">Sea Sparrow</a> was to be installed on the reactivated battleships; however, it was determined that the system could not withstand the over-pressure effects when the main battery was fired.

The <a href="BGM-109%20Tomahawk">BGM-109 Tomahawk Land Attack Missile</a> (TLAM) was first introduced in the 1970s, and entered service with the United States in 1983. Designed as a long-range, all-weather, subsonic <a href="cruise%20missile">cruise missile</a>, the Tomahawk was capable of reaching targets at a much greater range than the guns on the "Iowa"-class ships. When added to the battleships in the 1980s the Tomahawk became the longest-ranged weapon carried by the battleships.

Owing to the original 1938 design of the battleships, the Tomahawk missiles could not be fitted to the "Iowa" class unless the battleships were physically rebuilt in such a way as to accommodate the missile mounts that would be needed to store and launch the Tomahawks. This realization prompted the removal of the anti-aircraft guns previously installed on the "Iowas" and the removal of four of each of the battleships' ten 5"/38 DP mounts. The mid and aft end of the battleships were then rebuilt to accommodate the missile magazines. This resulted in the construction of two separate platforms, one located between the first and second funnel and one located behind the second funnel, to which MK-143 <a href="Armored%20Box%20Launcher">Armored Box Launcher</a> (ABL) canisters could be attached. Each Armored Box Launcher carried four missiles, and each of the battleships was outfitted with eight canisters, enabling the "Iowa"-class to carry and fire a total of 32 Tomahawk missiles.

The type of Tomahawk carried by the battleships varied, as there were three basic configurations for the Tomahawk: the Anti-Ship Missile (TASM), the Land-Attack Missile-Conventional (TLAM-C), and the Land-Attack Missile-Nuclear (TLAM-N). Each version was similar in appearance and used the same airframe body and launcher. The conventional Tomahawk missile could carry a explosive warhead or <a href="submunition">submunition</a>s which used the missile body to reach their destination. The nuclear variant carried a 200 <a href="Kilotons%20of%20TNT">kt</a> <a href="W80%20%28nuclear%20warhead%29">W80</a> <a href="nuclear%20warhead">nuclear warhead</a>.

The TLAM could be equipped with an inertial and terrain contour matching (<a href="TERCOM">TERCOM</a>) radar guidance package to find and destroy its target. The TERCOM radar used a stored map reference to compare with the actual terrain to determine the missile's position. If necessary, a course correction was then made to place the missile on course to the target. Terminal guidance in the target area was provided by the optical Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) system, which compared a stored image of target with the actual target image.

The firing weight of the Tomahawk was plus a booster. It had a cruising speed of 0.5 Mach and an attack speed of 0.75 Mach. The anti-ship version of the Tomahawk had an operating range of and a maximum range of , while the conventional land attack missile version had a maximum range of and TLAM-N had maximum range of .

During the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, USS "Missouri" and USS "Wisconsin" used ABL launchers to fire Tomahawk missiles at Iraqi targets during Operation Desert Storm. "Wisconsin" served as the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile (TLAM) strike commander for the Persian Gulf, directing the sequence of launches that marked the opening of Operation Desert Storm and fired a total of 24 of her own TLAMs during the first two days of the campaign.

For protection against enemy ships, the "Iowa" class was outfitted with the Harpoon Weapons System. The system consisted of four Mk 141 "shock-hardened" quad cell launchers designed to carry and fire the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas">McDonnell Douglas</a> <a href="Boeing%20Harpoon">RGM-84 Harpoon</a> anti-ship missile. Each Harpoon was placed in one of four Mk 141 launchers located alongside the aft <a href="Funnel%20%28ship%29">stack</a>; eight per side, in two pods of four. The weight of the Harpoon at firing was , which included a booster weighing about . The cruising speed was 0.87 Mach and the maximum range was in Range and Bearing Launch mode and in Bearing Only Launch mode.

When an "Iowa"-class battleship fired a Harpoon missile, a booster propelled the missile away from the ship; after approximately , the booster dropped away. After the booster was discarded a turbojet engine ignited and propelled the missile to the target. The stabilizing and actuator fins, which helped to guide the missile to its target, were stored folded in the canister and sprang into position after launching. These fins directed the missile to the target through inputs from the AN/SWG-1 Harpoon Fire Control System.

The battleships carried and used the RGM/UGM-84 variants of the Harpoon missile, which was designed to be fired by surface ships. The version used a solid-fueled rocket booster in an A/B44G-2 or -3 booster section, which was discarded after burn-out. The maximum range was around .

After launch, the missile was guided towards the target location as determined by the ship using a three-axis Attitude Reference Assembly (ATA) in an AN/DSQ-44 guidance section. The ATA was less accurate than a full-fledged inertial system, but good enough for Harpoon's range. For stabilization and control, the AGM-84A had four fixed cruciform wings (3x BSU-42/B, 1x BSU-43/B) and four movable BSU-44/B tail fins. The missile flew at a low cruise altitude and at a predetermined distance from the expected target position, its AN/DSQ-28 J-band active radar seeker in the nose was activated to acquire and lock on the target. The radar switch-on distance could be set to lower or higher values, the former requiring a more precisely-known target location but reducing the risk to be defeated by enemy <a href="Electronic%20Counter%20Measures">Electronic Counter Measures</a> (ECM).

An alternative launch mode was called Bearing-Only Launch (BOL). In this mode, the missile was launched in the general direction of the target, and its radar activated from the beginning to scan for the target in a +/- 45° sector in front of the flight path. Once a target was located and the seeker locked the xGM-84A missile climbed rapidly to about 1800 m before diving on the target in what was known as a "pop-up maneuver". The 221 kg (488 lb) WDU-18/B penetrating blast-fragmentation warhead (in the WAU-3(V) /B warhead section) was triggered by a time-delayed impact fuze. When no target was acquired after radar activation, the Harpoon would self-destruct.

Rock martin

The rock martin ("Ptyonoprogne fuligula") is a small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a> in the <a href="swallow">swallow</a> family that is resident in central and southern Africa. It breeds mainly in the mountains, but also at lower altitudes, especially in rocky areas and around towns, and, unlike most swallows, it is often found far from water. It is 12–15 cm (4.7–5.9 in) long, with mainly brown <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, paler-toned on the upper breast and underwing <a href="Covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a>, and with white "windows" on the spread tail in flight. The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale fringes to the upperparts and <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s. The former northern <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are smaller, paler, and whiter-throated than southern African forms, and are now usually split as a separate species, the <a href="pale%20crag%20martin">pale crag martin</a>. The rock martin hunts along cliff faces for flying insects using a slow flight with much gliding. Its call is a soft twitter.

This martin builds a deep bowl nest on a sheltered horizontal surface, or a neat quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, and may be built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man-made structures such as buildings, dam walls, culverts and bridges. It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. This species is a solitary breeder, and is not gregarious, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. The two or three eggs of a typical <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16–19 days prior to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. <a href="Fledge">Fledging</a> takes another 22–24 days, but the young birds will return to the nest to roost for a few days after the first flight.

This small martin is caught in flight by several fast, agile <a href="falcon">falcon</a> species, such as <a href="Hobby%20%28bird%29">hobbies</a>, and it sometimes carries parasites, but it faces no major threats. Because of its range of nearly 10 million km (4 million sq mi) and large, apparently stable, population, it is not seen as vulnerable and is assessed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

The rock martin was formally described in 1842 as "Hirundo fuligula" by German physician, explorer and zoologist <a href="Martin%20Lichtenstein">Martin Lichtenstein</a> and was moved to the new genus "Ptyonoprogne" by German ornithologist <a href="Heinrich%20Gustav%20Reichenbach">Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach</a> in 1850. Its nearest relatives are the three other members of the genus, the <a href="pale%20crag%20martin">pale crag martin</a>, "P. obsoleta" of north Africa, the <a href="dusky%20crag%20martin">dusky crag martin</a> "P. concolor" of southern Asia and the <a href="Eurasian%20crag%20martin">Eurasian crag martin</a> "P. rupestris". The genus name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "ptuon" (πτύον), "a fan", referring to the shape of the opened tail, and <a href="Procne">Procne</a> (Πρόκνη), a mythological girl who was turned into a swallow. The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "fuligula" means "sooty-throated", from Latin "fuligo" "soot" and "gula" "throat".

The three "Ptyonoprogne" species are members of the swallow family, and are placed in the subfamily Hirundininae, which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive <a href="river%20martin">river martin</a>s. <a href="DNA%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae, broadly correlating with the type of nest built. The groups are the "core martins" including burrowing species like the <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a>, the "nest-adopters", which are birds like the <a href="tree%20swallow">tree swallow</a> that utilise natural cavities, and the "mud nest builders". The "<a href="Ptyonoprogne">Ptyonoprogne</a>" species construct open mud nests and therefore belong to the last group. "<a href="Hirundo">Hirundo</a>" species also build open nests, "<a href="Delichon">Delichon</a>" house martins have a closed nest, and the "<a href="Cecropis">Cecropis</a>" and "<a href="Petrochelidon">Petrochelidon</a>" swallows have <a href="retort">retort-like</a> closed nests with an entrance tunnel.

The genus "Ptyonoprogne" is closely related to the larger swallow genus, "Hirundo", but a DNA analysis showed that a coherent enlarged "Hirundo" should contain "all" the mud-builder genera. Although the nests of the "Ptyonoprogne" crag martins resembles those of typical "Hirundo" species like the <a href="barn%20swallow">barn swallow</a>, the DNA research suggested that if the "Delichon" house martins are considered to be a separate genus, as is normally the case, "Cecropis", "Petrochelidon" and "Ptyonoprogne" should also be split off.

There are several subspecies differing in plumage shade or size, although the differences are <a href="cline%20%28biology%29">clinal</a>, and races interbreed where their ranges meet. The small, pale former subspecies ("obsoleta, peroplasta, perpallida, presaharica, spatzi, arabica" and "buchanani") found in the mountains of <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, the <a href="Arabia">Arabia</a>n peninsula and southwest Asia are now normally split as a separate species, the pale crag martin, following German <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="Jean%20Cabanis">Jean Cabanis</a>, who first formally described these birds, but the changes in size and colour are continuous, and the forms often intergrade where they meet, so the evidence for separate species is not strong. The southern forms of the rock martin can weigh more than twice as much as the smallest northern subspecies of pale crag martin. The average weight for "P. f. fusciventris" is 22.4 g (0.79 oz) against 10 g (0.35 oz) for "P. o. obsoleta". The robust, large-billed southernmost forms ("P. f. fuligula", "P. f. pretoriae", and "P. f. anderssoni") are sufficiently different from dark, fine-billed "P. f. fusciventris" that the latter could also be regarded as a potentially different species. However, Rhodesian ornithologist Michael Irwin collected specimens from southern Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) which were dark above like "P. f. fusciventris" and rich reddish below like "P. f. fuligula". This led him to suggest that the two groups had previously been isolated, but were probably hybridising following secondary contact.

The rock martin of the nominate subspecies "P. f. fuligula" is 12–15 cm (4.7–5.9 in) long with earth-brown upperparts and a short square tail that has small white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers. It has a cinnamon chin, throat, upper breast and underwing <a href="Covert%20%28feather%29">coverts</a>, with the rest of the underparts being a similar brown to the upperparts. The eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are similar in appearance, but juveniles have pale edges to the upperparts and flight feathers. The other subspecies differ from the nominate form as detailed above.

The rock martin's flight is slow, with rapid wing beats interspersed with flat-winged glides, and it is more acrobatic than the larger Eurasian crag martin. It is a quiet bird; the song is a muffled twitter, and other calls include a "trrt" resembling the call of the <a href="common%20house%20martin">common house martin</a>, a nasal "vick", and a high pitched "twee" contact call.

The rock martin is much drabber than most African swallows, and confusion is unlikely except with other crag martins or with sand martins of the genus "<a href="Riparia">Riparia</a>". The pale crag martin is smaller, paler and greyer than its southern relative. Although only slightly larger than the sand martin and <a href="brown-throated%20sand%20martin">brown-throated sand martin</a>, the rock martin is more robust, has white tail spots, and lacks a breast band. It is paler on the throat, breast and underwings than the all-dark form of the brown-throated sand martin.

The rock martin breeds in suitable habitat in Africa north to Nigeria, Chad and Ethiopia. It is largely resident apart from local movements or a descent to lower altitudes after breeding. This species has been recorded as a <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> in Gabon, and its status in Congo is uncertain.

The natural breeding habitat is hilly or mountainous country with cliffs, gorges and caves up to 3,700 m (12,000 ft) above sea level, but this martin also breeds in lowlands, especially if rocks or buildings are available, and may be found far from water. It readily uses man-made structures as a substitute for natural precipices.

Rock martin pairs often nest alone, although where suitable sites are available small loose <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a> may form with up to 40 pairs. These martins aggressively defend their nesting territory against <a href="Conspecificity">conspecifics</a> and other species. Breeding dates vary geographically and with local weather conditions. Two broods are common, and three have been raised in a season. Breeding mainly August to September. The nest, built by both adults over several weeks, is made from several hundred mud pellets and lined with soft dry grass or sometimes feathers. It may be a half-cup when constructed under an overhang on a vertical wall or cliff, or bowl-shaped like that of the barn swallow when placed on a sheltered ledge. The nest may be built on a rock cliff face, in a crevice or on a man-made structure, and is re-used for the second brood and in subsequent years.

The clutch is usually two or three buff-white eggs blotched with sepia or grey-brown particularly at the wide end. The average egg size in South Africa was 20.8 x 14.1 mm (0.82 x 0.56 in) with a weight of 2.17 g (0.077 oz). Both adults incubate the eggs for 16–19 days prior to hatching and feed the chicks about ten times an hour until they <a href="fledge">fledge</a> and for several days after they can fly. The fledging time can vary from 22–24 days to 25–30 days, though the latter estimates probably take into account fledged young returning to the nest for food.

The rock martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight, although it will occasionally feed on the ground. When breeding, birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and feed close to the nesting territory. At other times, they may hunt low over open ground. The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include <a href="mosquito">mosquito</a>es and other <a href="fly">flies</a>, <a href="Hymenoptera">Hymenoptera</a>, <a href="ant">ant</a>s and <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s. This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at <a href="wildfire">grass fire</a>s to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300 may form where food is abundant. Cliff faces generate <a href="standing%20wave">standing wave</a>s in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns.

A study of nine bird species including four hirundines showed that the more young there are in a nest, the more frequent are the parents' feeding visits, but the visits do not increase in proportion to the number of young. On average a solitary nestling therefore gets more food than a member of a pair or of a trio. Since the nestling period is not prolonged in proportion to the drop in feeding rate, an individual fledgling from a larger brood is likely to weigh less when it leaves the nest. However, a subspecies of the rock martin ("P. f. fusciventris") was an anomaly in respect of both feeding rate and nestling time. There was no difference in parental feeding rate for members of a pair and members of a trio, but the nestling period averaged 1.5 days longer for trios than pairs.

Some <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s have the speed and agility to catch swallows and martins in flight, and rock martins may be hunted by species such as the <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>, <a href="Taita%20falcon">Taita falcon</a>, <a href="African%20hobby">African hobby</a> and wintering <a href="Eurasian%20hobby">Eurasian hobby</a>. Rock martins often share their nesting sites with <a href="little%20swift">little swift</a>s, which sometimes forcibly take over the martin's nests. In 1975, one of the first findings of the tick "Argas (A.) africolumbae" was in a nest of "Ptyonoprogne f. fusciventris" in <a href="Kenya">Kenya</a>, at that time the martin was described under its <a href="synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonym</a> "Ptyonoprogne fuligula rufigula" (<a href="Gustav%20Fischer">Fischer</a> & <a href="Anton%20Reichenow">Reichenow</a>).

The rock martin has a very large range of 9.5 million km (3.7 million sq mi). The total population is unknown, but the bird is described as generally common, although scarce in Botswana and Namibia. The population is thought to be stable, mainly due to the absence of evidence of any declines or substantial threats. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the rock martin is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>.

Green rosella

The green rosella or Tasmanian rosella ("Platycercus caledonicus") is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="parrot">parrot</a> native to <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a> islands. It was <a href="species%20description">described</a> by the German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> in 1788, and named on the mistaken assumption it came from New Caledonia. At 37 cm (14.5 in) long it is the largest species of the <a href="rosella">rosella</a> genus, "Platycercus". Two subspecies are recognised. The green rosella's underparts, neck and head are yellow, with a red band above the beak and violet-blue cheeks. The back is mostly black and green, and its long tail blue and green. The sexes have similar plumage, except the female has duller yellow plumage and more prominent red markings, as well as a smaller beak. Juvenile and immature birds have predominantly green plumage.

Found in a wide range of <a href="habitat">habitat</a>s with some form of tree cover, the green rosella is predominantly <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a>, consuming seeds, berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers, but may also eat insect <a href="larva">larva</a>e and insects such as <a href="Jumping%20plant%20louse">psyllids</a>. Nesting takes place in <a href="tree%20hollow">tree hollow</a>s. Common and widespread across Tasmania, the green rosella is rated as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN)'s <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red List</a> of Endangered species. The <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King Island</a> subspecies has been classed as vulnerable as its population has declined after much of its habitat on King Island was cleared.

A green rosella specimen was collected in <a href="Adventure%20Bay%2C%20Tasmania">Adventure Bay, Tasmania</a>, by ships' surgeon <a href="William%20Anderson%20%28naturalist%29">William Anderson</a> on the <a href="third%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">third voyage of James Cook</a> between 26 and 30 January 1777. Cook wrote of seeing "yellowish paroquets" in the woods there. Anderson collected many bird specimens while tasked as the expedition's naturalist, although he died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1778 before the return home. Many collection localities were incorrect, and notes were lost or pieced together many years later. The specimen, along with many others, ended up in the collection of British naturalist Sir <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a>. English naturalist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> saw it there and wrote about the green rosella in his 1780s work "A General Synopsis of Birds". He called it the Caledonian parrot as he assumed (incorrectly) it came from <a href="New%20Caledonia">New Caledonia</a>. He even suspected it might be the female of the <a href="horned%20parakeet">horned parakeet</a>, which he also saw in Banks' collection. Latham did not give them binomial names, however. It was left to German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Friedrich%20Gmelin">Johann Friedrich Gmelin</a> to <a href="species%20description">describe</a> the species, which he did as "Psittacus caledonicus" in the 13th edition of "<a href="Systema%20Naturae">Systema Naturae</a>" in 1788.

In 1820, German naturalist <a href="Heinrich%20Kuhl">Heinrich Kuhl</a> described a specimen that Robert Brown had collected from northwestern <a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King Island</a> on 23 April 1802 during Matthew Flinders' circumnavigation of Australia, naming it "Psittacus Brownii" in honour of its collector. He based it on the description of "la Perruche à large queue", "the long-tailed parrot" by French naturalist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Levaillant">François Levaillant</a> in his 1805 work "Histoire Naturelle des Perroquets". Kuhl's name also took priority over Dutch zoologist <a href="Coenraad%20Jacob%20Temminck">Coenraad Jacob Temminck</a>'s published name of "Psittacus flavigaster", which was published in 1822.

Irish zoologist <a href="Nicholas%20Aylward%20Vigors">Nicholas Aylward Vigors</a> established the genus "Platycercus" in 1825, based on the distinctive architecture of the feathers in the tail and wing, including "P. flavigaster" and "P. brownii" within it. English naturalist <a href="James%20Francis%20Stephens">James Francis Stephens</a> named it "Platycercus xanthogaster" in 1826, though there was no need for a new binomial name. Australian amateur ornithologist <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> noted that the name "Platycercus flaviventris" was commonly used in the 19th century, but highlighted the priority of both "P. brownii" and "P. caledonicus" over this, positing the last as the most senior name. He believed the specimens used for "P. brownii" had come from Derwent in Tasmania.

Mathews did feel the King Island form was distinctive, being larger and having more red in the plumage than Tasmanian populations and so described it as "P. c. henriettae" in 1915. This has since been reclassified as a synonym of "P. c. brownii" as its status has been recognized as distinct from the Tasmanian mainland taxon—now known as "P. c. caledonicus". Mathews also described "P. c. flindersi" from Flinders Island in 1917, on the basis of darker plumage. It is now considered as not distinct from the Tasmanian mainland subspecies.

"Green rosella" has been designated the official name by the <a href="International%20Ornithological%20Committee">International Ornithological Committee</a> (IOC). Alternative common names include Tasmanian rosella, yellow-breasted parakeet and mountain parrot. English zoologist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> called it the yellow-bellied parakeet, and early Tasmanian settlers knew it as the hill parrot.

One of six species of <a href="rosella">rosella</a> in the genus "Platycercus", the green rosella and related <a href="crimson%20rosella">crimson rosella</a> make up a "blue-cheeked" lineage. A 1987 genetic study on mitochondrial DNA found that the green rosella was basal to the other blue-cheeked forms, with the north Queensland population of the crimson rosella ("P. elegans nigrescens") divergent from other subspecies of crimson rosella. In 2015, Ashlee Shipham and colleagues published a molecular study based on <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> finding that the North Queensland crimson rosella diverged earlier than the green rosella. They also estimated that the green rosella had diverged from the main crimson rosella lineage around 0.5 million years ago.

The green rosella is the largest member of the rosella genus. Measuring from in length, an adult has long narrow wings with a wingspan of , and a long tail with twelve feathers, the central two of which are wider. The adult male is heavier, averaging around to the female's , and has a larger bill.

The adult green rosella has a yellow head and underparts with blue cheeks and red band on the forehead and upper lores. The yellow feathers of the forecrown, lower lores, cheeks, chest and thighs can have red markings, while the yellow feathers of the sides and rear of the head and neck, and the underparts have dark brown bases. The edges of the feathers on the underparts can be pale brown, resulting in a faint scalloping, which disappears with wear. Some of the yellow feathers of the nape have white bases and when worn, the bird can have a whitish patch on their nape. The yellow of the back of the head merges indistinctly into the dark plumage of the hindneck, mantle and back, which is black or dark brown with green margins. The feathers of the shoulders are blackish with yellow tips. These margins and tips are often worn by the finish of breeding season, leaving the plumage more solid black. The blue-violet feathers of the chin, throat and cheeks have brown-black bases. The blackish plumage of the back extends to the rump, and the long tail is dark green with brown shafts and dark blue outer feathers and tips. The wings are mostly black and green, with violet-blue marginal coverts, primary coverts, and alula, and blue-tinted dark brown primaries and outer secondaries. Underneath the feathers of the wings are dark brown with blue-violet tips. The iris is brown with a dark grey orbital ring, and the bill is pale-grey, with a dark grey cere. The legs are grey. The yellow plumage of the female is duller and more likely marked with red than that of the male, and the green edges to the black plumage of the upperparts are more prominent.

Young birds leaving the nest have juvenile plumage in their first year of life. Juveniles have a dark green head and neck, upperparts and underparts. The feathers all have dark brown bases. The wings are predominantly dark brown and black with a blue sheen. The wings and tail are shorter than those of adult birds. The bill may have a buff sheen. They have an under-wing stripe, which is not present in the adults. Moulting generally takes place between January and April for birds of all ages. Juvenile birds then adopt immature plumage, which is similar but with patches of yellow feathers on the underparts of adult plumage as well as some adult-coloured wing feathers. Some green juvenile feathers remain until the bird is in its second year of age, though are very worn by this time.

Found across Tasmania and <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a> islands, the green rosella is one of the commonest birds encountered. It also occurs on offshore islands such as Maria, Bruny, De Witt and Maatsuyker Islands. Its movements have not been much studied. Although possibly locally nomadic in places, the green rosella is sedentary; even birds at higher altitudes do not migrate. It has become rare on King Island, due to land clearing and possibly competition with the introduced <a href="common%20starling">common starling</a> ("Sturnus vulgaris") for nesting sites. During breeding season there it is restricted to the Pegarah forest, though may venture elsewhere at other times.

It lives in most habitats with some form of tree cover up to 1500 m (5000 ft) above sea level. These include temperate beech rainforest (where it generally keeps to the <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>), wet and dry <a href="sclerophyll">sclerophyll</a> forest, <a href="woodland">woodland</a>, "Melaleuca" <a href="shrubland">shrubland</a>, coastal <a href="heath">heath</a>, dwarf alpine conifer forest, sedgeland, <a href="Gymnoschoenus%20sphaerocephalus">buttongrass</a> moors, tussock grassland, as well as fields, orchards and urban parks and gardens.

Green rosellas are generally encountered in pairs or small groups, though young birds may gather in groups of 20 or more outside the breeding season. They sometimes share the company of eastern rosellas. They fly in a straight line, making rapid shallow wingbeats and gliding briefly in between.

The green rosella has a repeated two-syllable <a href="contact%20call">contact call</a>, which has been written as "kussik kussik" or "cossack cossack" and is heard in flight. When perched, it utters a rising "kwik-kweek kwik-kweek" contact call. Birds also make a chattering call during courtship. They can screech shrilly when alarmed.

The green rosella generally breeds at two years of age, though younger birds may pair up and look for nests. The breeding season is September to January, with one brood. The nesting site is usually a hollow over 1 m (3 ft) deep in a tree trunk anywhere up to 30 m (100 ft) above the ground. The tree chosen is generally a eucalypt such as Tasmanian bluegum, manna gum or mountain ash ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20regnans">E. regnans</a>"), or myrtle beech. Chimneys, holes in walls and even the vertical pipes of tennis court fences have been used. Green rosellas nested in a wall cavity at <a href="Port%20Arthur%2C%20Tasmania">Port Arthur</a> convict prison site in 1958 and 2009.

Laying takes place in September and October. A <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> of four or five white and slightly shiny eggs, measuring 30 x 24 mm, is laid. The incubation period has been recorded as anywhere from 19 to 23 days, with the female performing this duty alone. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white <a href="Down%20feather">down</a>, and are largely helpless (<a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>). They leave the nest four to five weeks after hatching and join up with other young birds in flocks, though rely on their parents for food for another fortnight after fledging.

The green rosella is predominantly herbivorous, with the seeds of grasses and trees—especially eucalypts—forming the bulk of its diet; other items eaten include the seed of the soft tree fern ("<a href="Dicksonia%20antarctica">Dicksonia antarctica</a>"), cranberry heath ("<a href="Astroloma%20humifusum">Astroloma humifusum</a>"), myrtle beech ("<a href="Lophozonia%20cunninghamii">Lophozonia cunninghamii</a>"), Australian blackwood ("<a href="Acacia%20melanoxylon">Acacia melanoxylon</a>"), silver wattle ("<a href="Acacia%20dealbata">Acacia dealbata</a>") and buttercups ("<a href="Ranunculus">Ranunculus</a>"), berries, nuts and fruit, as well as flowers and new buds of southern sassafras ("<a href="Atherosperma">Atherosperma moschatum</a>"), mānuka ("<a href="Leptospermum%20scoparium">Leptospermum scoparium</a>"), shining tea-tree ("<a href="Leptospermum%20nitidum">Leptospermum nitidum</a>"), swamp honey-myrtle ("<a href="Melaleuca%20squamea">Melaleuca squamea</a>"), Tasmanian bluegum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20globulus">Eucalyptus globulus</a>"), Smithton peppermint ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20nitida">Eucalyptus nitida</a>"), messmate stringybark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20obliqua">Eucalyptus obliqua</a>"), snow gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20pauciflora">Eucalyptus pauciflora</a>"), manna gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20viminalis">Eucalyptus viminalis</a>"), small-fruit hakea ("<a href="Hakea%20microcarpa">Hakea microcarpa</a>") and native plum ("<a href="Cenarrhenes">Cenarrhenes nitida</a>"). The green rosella has at times partaken of the berries of the common hawthorn ("<a href="Crataegus%20monogyna">Crataegus monogyna</a>"), as well as "<a href="Coprosma">Coprosma</a>" and "<a href="Cyathodes">Cyathodes</a>", and even leaf buds of the common osier ("<a href="Salix%20viminalis">Salix viminalis</a>"). It may eat insect <a href="larva">larva</a>e and insects such as <a href="psyllid">psyllid</a>s of the genus "<a href="Schedotrioza">Schedotrioza</a>", which they extract from leaf galls on the black peppermint ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20amygdalina">Eucalyptus amygdalina</a>").

Green rosellas generally forage in the canopy or understory of forested areas, or in hedges, shrubs and trees in more open areas. They come to the ground to eat fallen fruit or spilt grain in orchards or farmland. They keep quiet while on the ground, and are quite noisy when in trees. Green rosellas forage in pairs or small groups of under 20 individuals, though larger groups of 50 to 70 have been observed at stands of blackberries or thistles in fields. When feeding, they generally hold food items in their left feet and extract edible parts or break and discard nut shells with their beaks.

Gould noted that early Tasmanian settlers regarded the abundant green rosella highly as food, and often shot and ate it. He agreed that it was very tasty after trying it himself. Many farmers saw the species as a pest of orchards, and green rosellas were shot.

In 2016, the green rosella was rated as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> of Endangered species. This was on the basis of its large range—greater than 20,000 km (7700 mi)—and small rate of decline in population. The King Island subspecies is listed under the <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a> as "vulnerable", and its population thought to number fewer than 500 birds. Around 70% of King Island's native vegetation has been cleared, and the remainder is highly fragmented and at risk of too-frequent bushfires. Like most species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.

Green rosellas were regularly captured and kept as pets until the early 20th century. The species is reported to be hardier and easier to keep in captivity than other rosellas. However, it is not a popular bird in the aviary trade, possibly on account of its subdued colours. Like most species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal. The species has a reputation for being apathetic and vulnerable to weight gain in captivity; hence it is recommended to be kept in a large aviary of at least 5 m (15 ft) long to keep it active, and to be fed little or no sunflower seeds. As it breeds late in the season, chicks are often small in the heat of summer and can suffer as a result.

Northern rosella

The northern rosella ("Platycercus venustus"), formerly known as Brown's rosella or the smutty rosella, is a species of parrot native to northern Australia, ranging from the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Carpentaria">Gulf of Carpentaria</a> and <a href="Arnhem%20Land">Arnhem Land</a> to the <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a>. It was described by <a href="Heinrich%20Kuhl">Heinrich Kuhl</a> in 1820, and two subspecies are recognised. The species is unusually coloured for a <a href="rosella">rosella</a>, with a dark head and neck with pale cheeks—predominantly white in the <a href="Subspecies%23Nominotypical%20subspecies%20and%20subspecies%20autonyms">nominate</a> subspecies from the Northern Territory and blue in the Western Australian subspecies "hillii". The northern rosella's <a href="Bird%23Anatomy%20and%20physiology">mantle</a> and <a href="List%20of%20terms%20used%20in%20bird%20topography">scapulars</a> are black with fine yellow scallops, while its back, rump and underparts are pale yellow with fine black scallops. The long tail is blue-green and the wings are black and blue-violet. The sexes have similar plumage, while females and younger birds are generally duller with occasional spots of red.

Found in woodland and open savannah country, the northern rosella is predominantly <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a>, consuming seeds, particularly of grasses and eucalypts, as well as flowers and berries, but it may also eat insects. Nesting takes place in <a href="tree%20hollow">tree hollow</a>s. Although uncommon, the northern rosella is rated as <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> on the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN)'s <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">Red List</a> of Endangered species.

The northern rosella was first <a href="species%20description">described</a> as "Psittacus venustus" by German naturalist <a href="Heinrich%20Kuhl">Heinrich Kuhl</a> in 1820. The description was based on an illustration by <a href="Ferdinand%20Bauer">Ferdinand Bauer</a> from a specimen collected by <a href="Robert%20Brown%20%28botanist%2C%20born%201773%29">Robert Brown</a> in February 1803, during <a href="Matthew%20Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a>' voyage around the Australian coastline. The specific epithet is derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "venustus" "charming, lovely or graceful". Dutch zoologist <a href="Coenraad%20Jacob%20Temminck">Coenraad Jacob Temminck</a> published the name "Psittacus brownii" in honour of Brown in 1821, and Irish zoologist <a href="Nicholas%20Aylward%20Vigors">Nicholas Aylward Vigors</a> transferred it (as "P. brownii") to the genus "<a href="Platycercus">Platycercus</a>" in 1827, describing it as the "most beautiful of the family". But <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> wrote in his 1865 work "<a href="Handbook%20to%20the%20Birds%20of%20Australia">Handbook to the Birds of Australia</a>", "Hitherto this bird has been known to ornithologists as "Platycercus brownii", a specific appellation in honour of the celebrated botanist; but which, I regret to say, must give place to the prior one of "venustus.""

<a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> described the subspecies "P. venustus hillii" in 1910, collected by G.F. Hill from <a href="Napier%20Broome%20Bay">Napier Broome Bay</a> in Western Australia. He noted that its cheeks had more blue and less white than the <a href="Subspecies%23Nominotypical%20subspecies%20and%20subspecies%20autonyms">nominate</a> subspecies. The <a href="Victoria%20River%20%28Northern%20Territory%29">Victoria River</a> marks the border between this and the nominate subspecies. Animal taxonomist <a href="Arthur%20Cain">Arthur Cain</a> treated the subspecies as synonymous to the nominate as the only difference he knew of was the colour of the cheeks, but conceded further evidence could prove them distinct. As well as the differences in cheek plumage, the two differ in that subspecies "hillii" has brighter yellow feathers on the breast and belly with thinner black edges, and a consistently longer and wider bill. A subspecies, "P. venustus melvillensis" from <a href="Melville%20Island%20%28Australia%29">Melville Island</a>, was described by Mathews in 1912, noting it to have blacker plumage on its back. It is now thought to be indistinguishable from the nominate subspecies.

"Northern rosella" has been designated the official name by the <a href="International%20Ornithologists%27%20Union">International Ornithologists' Union</a> (IOC). Early names used include Brown's rosella, parrot or parakeet for its collector, with Brown's parakeet remaining a name used in aviculture in Europe and the United Kingdom, and smutty rosella, parrot or parakeet, from its dark plumage. Gould reported in 1848 that the latter was the local name used, and it was the most common name at the end of the 19th century. It was changed—possibly through <a href="Expurgation">bowdlerisation</a>—to sooty parrot by the <a href="Royal%20Australasian%20Ornithologists%20Union">Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union</a> (RAOU) in 1913. "Bulawirdwird" and "Djaddokorddokord" are two names from the <a href="Kunwinjku%20language">Kunwinjku language</a> of the western <a href="Arnhem%20Land">Arnhem Land</a>.

One of six species of <a href="rosella">rosella</a> in the genus "Platycercus", the northern rosella and related <a href="Eastern%20rosella">eastern</a> ("P. eximius") and <a href="pale-headed%20rosella">pale-headed rosella</a> ("P. adscitus") make up a "white-cheeked" lineage. A 1987 genetic study on <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> by Ovenden and colleagues found that the northern rosella was the earliest offshoot (<a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a>) of a lineage that gave rise to the other white-cheeked forms. But a study with <a href="nuclear%20DNA">nuclear DNA</a> by Ashlee Shipham and colleagues published in 2017 found that the eastern rosella was basal to the lineage that split into the pale-headed and northern rosellas, and hence, that non-<a href="Sister%20group">sister</a> taxa were able to hybridise among the rosellas.

Smaller than all rosella species except the <a href="western%20rosella">western rosella</a>, the adult northern rosella weighs and is long. It has broad wings with a wingspan of around , and a long tail with twelve feathers. The sexes are almost indistinguishable, though some adult females have duller plumage and are more likely to have some red feathers on the head and breast. The adult bird has a black forehead, crown, <a href="Lore%20%28anatomy%29">lores</a>, ear <a href="Covert%20feather">coverts</a>, upper neck and nape, a whitish throat and large cheek-patches, which are mainly white with violet lower borders in the nominate subspecies, and more blue with a narrow white upper segment in subspecies "hillii". The feathers of the lower neck, <a href="Bird%23Anatomy%20and%20physiology">mantle</a> and <a href="List%20of%20terms%20used%20in%20bird%20topography">scapulars</a> are black narrowly fringed with yellow, giving a scalloped appearance, while the feathers of the back, rump, upper tail coverts and underparts are pale yellow with black borders and concealed grey bases. Those of the breast have very dark grey bases, occasionally tinged with red. The undertail covert feathers are red with black fringes. The feathers on the upper leg are pale yellow tinged with blue. The central <a href="Flight%20feather%23Rectrices">rectrices</a> of the long tail are dark green changing to dark blue at the tips, while the other feathers are dark blue with two bands of pale blue and white tips. The undertail is pale blue with a white tip. The wings have a wide purplish blue shoulder patch at rest, with the secondary feathers edged darker blue and the primaries black edged with blue. The <a href="beak">beak</a> is off-white with a grey <a href="Beak%23Cere">cere</a>, the legs and feet are grey, and the <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is dark brown. Immature birds resemble adults but are duller overall, with less-well defined cheek patches. The black plumage in particular is more greyish and there are more likely to be scattered red feathers on the head, neck and underparts.

The northern rosella is found across northern Australia. In Western Australia, it is found across the <a href="Kimberley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Kimberley</a> south to the <a href="18th%20parallel%20south">18th parallel</a>, around <a href="Derby%2C%20Western%20Australia">Derby</a>, <a href="Windjana%20Gorge%20National%20Park">Windjana Gorge National Park</a>, the northern <a href="King%20Leopold%20Ranges">King Leopold Ranges</a>, <a href="Springvale%20Station">Springvale Station</a> and <a href="Warmun%20Community%2C%20Western%20Australia">Warmun</a>, with vagrants reported at <a href="Halls%20Creek%2C%20Western%20Australia">Halls Creek</a> and <a href="Fitzroy%20Crossing%2C%20Western%20Australia">Fitzroy Crossing</a>. In the Northern Territory it is found from Victoria River north to the <a href="Tiwi%20Islands">Tiwi Islands</a> and east into western Arnhem Land, and across northern Arnhem Land through <a href="Milingimbi%20Island">Milingimbi Island</a> and the <a href="Wessel%20Islands">Wessel Islands</a> to the <a href="Gove%20Peninsula">Gove Peninsula</a>. It is absent from central Arnhem Land, but is found further east around the western and southern coastline of the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Carpentaria">Gulf of Carpentaria</a>, south to <a href="Borroloola">Borroloola</a> and across the border into western Queensland as far as the <a href="Nicholson%20River%20%28Queensland%29">Nicholson River</a>.

The northern rosella lives in grassy open forests and woodlands, including deciduous eucalypt <a href="savannah">savannah</a> woodlands. Typical trees include species of "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>", such as Darwin stringybark ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20tetrodonta">Eucalyptus tetrodonta</a>"), "<a href="Melaleuca">Melaleuca</a>", "<a href="Callitris">Callitris</a>" and "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>". More specific habitats include vegetation along small creeks and gorges, sandstone outcrops and escarpments, as well as some forested offshore islands. The northern rosella is occasionally found in mangroves or public green spaces in suburban <a href="Darwin%2C%20Northern%20Territory">Darwin</a>. It avoids dense forest.

Not a <a href="Social%20animal">gregarious</a> bird, the northern rosella is generally found alone or in pairs, although several birds perch together in the same tree. Sometimes they are encountered in larger troops—usually 6 to 8 birds but rarely up to 15 individuals. It is shyer than other rosellas, and flees to the upper tree canopy if disturbed. It is a quieter and less vocal species than other rosellas, and its call repertoire has been little studied. It exhibits a sharp and short "chit-chut chit-chut" contact call in flight; while perched it makes a three-note whistle on ascending scale or metallic piping sounds. Soft chattering can be heard while feeding, and sometimes when squabbling at the beginning of breeding season.

Nesting occurs in tree hollows in the Southern Hemisphere winter, often in eucalypts located near water. The <a href="Clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is anywhere from two to five white matte or slightly glossy eggs, measuring roughly 26 x 21 mm (1 x 0.8 in). The female incubates the eggs alone, over a period of 19 or 20 days. Newly hatched chicks are covered with long white <a href="Down%20feather">down</a> and are largely helpless (<a href="nidicolous">nidicolous</a>). They may remain in the nest for seven weeks after hatching and are fed by both parents. Fledglings remain with their parents for a year or more, often feeding together in small family groups.

The northern rosella feeds on the ground in grassy glades in woodlands, on roadsides, riverbanks, as well as in the canopy of trees. It eats seeds, particularly those of eucalypts, wattles, cypress ("<a href="Callitris%20intratropica">Callitris intratropica</a>") and grasses. It eats both the seeds and nectar of white gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20alba">Eucalyptus alba</a>"), Darwin stringybark, long-fruited bloodwood ("<a href="Corymbia%20polycarpa">Corymbia polycarpa</a>"), fibrebark ("<a href="Melaleuca%20nervosa">Melaleuca nervosa</a>") and fern-leaved grevillea ("<a href="Grevillea%20pteridifolia">Grevillea pteridifolia</a>"). It also eats flowers, such as those of Darwin woollybutt ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20miniata">Eucalyptus miniata</a>"), and fruit. It also eats larval and adult insects.

The northern rosella is a prey item of the <a href="rufous%20owl">rufous owl</a> ("Ninox rufa"). The <a href="mallophaga">bird louse</a> "Forficuloecus wilsoni" has been recovered from the northern rosella.

The northern rosella is listed as being a <a href="least%20concern">species of least concern</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), on account of its large range and stable population, with no evidence of any significant decline. Despite this, the northern rosella is an uncommon bird. Grazing by livestock and frequent burning of grassy woodland may have a negative impact on northern rosella numbers. Like most species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s, the northern rosella is protected by the <a href="CITES">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora</a> (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.

Most northern rosellas in captivity in Australia are the nominate subspecies, but there are blue-cheeked specimens that are either subspecies "hillii" or intermediate. Its attractive colours make it a desirable species to keep. In captivity in the Northern Hemisphere, the northern rosella has been reported to breed in the same calendar months as it does in its Southern Hemisphere native range. As it breeds early in the season, clutches laid in cooler months of cooler Australian states may fail. Breeders have attempted to use sprinklers in enclosures to induce pairs to breed at other times.

History of Norwich City F.C.

The history of Norwich City F.C. stretches back to <a href="1901%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">1902</a>. After a brief period in amateur football, <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City F.C.</a> spent 15 years as a semi-professional team in the <a href="Southern%20Football%20League">Southern League</a> before admission to <a href="English%20Football%20League">English Football League</a> in <a href="1920%E2%80%9321%20in%20English%20football">1920</a>. For most of the next 50 years, <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.">Norwich City F.C.</a> played in <a href="Division%20Three%20%28South%29">Division Three (South)</a>, then the joint lowest tier of <a href="English%20football%20league%20system">the football league</a>, a period that was distinguished by "a thrilling giant-killing sequence which took them to the <a href="FA%20Cup">FA Cup</a> <a href="semi-final">semi-final</a>s" in <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1959</a>. Shortly afterwards, the club won its first major trophy, the <a href="1962%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1962 League Cup</a>. Norwich finally reached the pinnacle of the league structure in 1972, with their first promotion to the top tier.

Since then, Norwich City has acquired a reputation as a "<a href="yo-yo%20club">yo-yo club</a>", with, to the end of the 2017–18 season, 25 seasons in the top league and 19 in the second tier. It is during this period that the club has achieved most of its greatest distinctions, claiming its second major trophy, the <a href="League%20Cup">League Cup</a> in <a href="1985%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">1985</a>, reaching two more FA Cup semi finals, finishing <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20in%20English%20football">fifth</a>, <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">fourth</a> and <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">third</a> in the top division and <a href="Bayern%20Munich%20v%20Norwich%20City">beating Bayern Munich</a> in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>.

In the course of its history, Norwich City has survived incidents that threatened its survival, including ousting from amateur football, the need to be re-elected to The Football League and financial crises. <a href="Geoffrey%20Watling">Geoffrey Watling</a>, who was to become club Chairman and after whom <a href="Carrow%20Road%23%27Geoffrey%20Watling%20City%20Stand%27">a stand</a> at the club's stadium, <a href="Carrow%20Road">Carrow Road</a> is named, was instrumental in saving the club from bankruptcy, both in the 1950s and 1990s; his father had played a similar role in 1919.

Norwich City F.C. was formed following a meeting at the Criterion Cafe in Norwich on 17 June 1902 by a group of friends led by two former <a href="Norwich%20CEYMS%20F.C.">Norwich CEYMS</a> players, and played their first competitive match against <a href="Harwich%20%26amp%3B%20Parkeston%20F.C.">Harwich & Parkeston</a>, at Newmarket Road on 6 September 1902. They also joined the <a href="Norfolk%20%26amp%3B%20Suffolk%20League">Norfolk & Suffolk League</a> for the 1902–03 season. Originally, the club was nicknamed the "Citizens", and played in light blue and white halved shirts. The popular pastime of canary rearing had given rise to the team's nickname of "The Canaries" by April 1905, and by February 1907 this <a href="moniker">moniker</a> had been adopted by the national press. The following season, inspired by the nickname, City played for the first time in Canary livery; yellow shirts with green collars and cuffs. A local paper reported that "The Cits are dead but the Canaries are very much alive".

Norwich played for just over two seasons as an amateur club under <a href="The%20Football%20Association">The Football Association</a> (FA). Following an FA Commission of inquiry, the club was informed on the last day of <a href="1904%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">1904</a> that they had been deemed a professional organisation and hence ineligible to compete in amateur football. The main allegations were: 
fees ... paid for the use of a gymnasium and also for the training and massage of players. The sum of £8 was also paid to a player when he left the club. Payments were made to players without a receipt being taken. The club advertised for players ... [the] secretary ... spent considerable sums of money in travelling to other towns in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> ... complete outfits ... were bought for players out of club funds ... there was no adequate system for checking <a href="Gate%20receipts">gate money</a> ... <a href="travel%20expenses">travelling expenses</a> were ... excessive.

With increasing attendances at matches and strict new clauses included in a proposed lease extension, Norwich were forced to leave Newmarket Road and move to a converted disused chalk pit in Rosary Road which became known as "<a href="The%20Nest%20%28football%20ground%29">The Nest</a>". Works at The Nest, which included dismantling and moving the stands from Newmarket Road, were complete in time for the start of the <a href="1908%E2%80%9309%20in%20English%20football">1908–09 season</a>. On 10 December 1917, with football suspended during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> and the club facing spiralling debts, City went into voluntary <a href="liquidation">liquidation</a>. The club was officially reformed on 15 February 1919; a key figure in the events was a Mr C Watling, father of future club Chairman, <a href="Geoffrey%20Watling">Geoffrey Watling</a>. In May 1920, the <a href="English%20Football%20League">Football League</a> formed a <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a>, to which Norwich was admitted for the following season. Their first league fixture, against <a href="Plymouth%20Argyle%20F.C.">Plymouth</a>, on 28 August 1920, ended in a 1–1 draw. The club endured a mediocre first decade in the League, finishing no higher than eighth but no lower than 18th. It was during this period that the players began to wear a canary emblem on their shirts. A simple canary badge was first adopted in 1922; a variation is used to this day.

The 1930s began with a brush with disaster – the side finished bottom of the League in 1931, but were successful in their bid for re-election. The rest of the decade proved more successful for Norwich, with a club-record victory, 10–2, over <a href="Coventry%20City%20F.C.">Coventry City</a> and promotion to the <a href="Football%20League%20Second%20Division">Second Division</a> as champions in the <a href="1933%E2%80%9334%20in%20English%20football">1933–34</a> season under the management of <a href="Tom%20Parker%20%28footballer%29">Tom Parker</a>.

With rising crowds and the Football Association raising concerns over the suitability of The Nest, the club considered renovation, but ultimately decided on a move to <a href="Carrow%20Road">Carrow Road</a>. The original stadium was <a href="Terrace%20%28stadium%29">terraced</a> on three sides, with only one stand (along Carrow Road) having wooden bench seating and a roof. Construction took 82 days and the inaugural match at the new ground, held on 31 August 1935, against <a href="West%20Ham%20United%20F.C.">West Ham United</a>, ended in a 4–3 victory for the home team and set a new record attendance of 29,779. A highlight of the fourth season at Carrow Road was the visit of <a href="King%20George%20VI">King George VI</a> on 29 October 1938; this was the first occasion a reigning monarch attended a second tier football match. The club was relegated back to the Third Division at the end of the season. Norwich's anguish was exacerbated by the closeness of the relegation fight; having finished second from bottom of Division Two, they were demoted on a <a href="goal%20average">goal average</a> difference of just 0.05.

The league was suspended the following season as a result of the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, and professional play did not resume until the <a href="1946%E2%80%9347%20in%20English%20football">1946–47</a> season. City finished this and the following season in 21st place, the poor results forcing the club to apply for re-election to the league. The lacklustre performances did not deter the crowds, and, in 1948, Carrow Road attracted its record attendance; 37,863 spectators watched City play <a href="Notts%20County%20F.C.">Notts County</a>. The club narrowly missed out on promotion under the guidance of manager <a href="Norman%20Low">Norman Low</a> in the early 1950s, but following the return of Tom Parker as manager, Norwich finished bottom of the football league in the <a href="1956%E2%80%9357%20in%20English%20football">1956–57</a> season. Events off the field were to overshadow the team's performances as the club faced financial difficulties severe enough to render them non-viable. With debts amounting to more than £20,000, the club was rescued by the formation of a new Board, chaired by <a href="Geoffrey%20Watling">Geoffrey Watling</a> and the creation of an appeal fund chaired by the <a href="Lord%20Mayor">Lord Mayor</a> of Norwich, <a href="Arthur%20South">Arthur South</a>, which raised more than £20,000. For these and other services to the club, both men (now deceased) were later honoured by having <a href="Carrow%20Road%23Stands">stands named after them at Carrow Road</a>.

<a href="Archie%20Macaulay">Archie Macaulay</a> became manager when the club was reformed and he oversaw one of the club's greatest achievements, its run to the semi-final of the <a href="1958%E2%80%9359%20in%20English%20football">1958–59</a> FA Cup. Competing as a <a href="Football%20League%20Third%20Division">Third Division</a> side, Norwich defeated two First Division opponents along the way, notably a 3–0 win against the <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a> "<a href="Busby%20Babes">Busby Babes</a>". City lost the semi-final only after a replay against another First Division side, <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C.">Luton Town</a>. The team of 1958–59 – including <a href="Terry%20Bly">Terry Bly</a> who scored seven goals in the run, and <a href="Ken%20Nethercott">Ken Nethercott</a> who played most of the second half of one match in goal despite a <a href="dislocated">dislocated</a> shoulder – is today well represented in the <a href="Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20Hall%20of%20Fame">club Hall of Fame</a>. The "59 Cup Run" as it is now known locally, "remains as one of the truly great periods in Norwich City's history". Norwich were the third-ever Third Division team to reach the FA Cup semi-final. In the <a href="1959%E2%80%9360%20in%20English%20football">1959–60</a> season, Norwich were promoted to the Second Division after finishing second to <a href="Southampton%20F.C.">Southampton</a>, and achieved a fourth-place finish in the <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20in%20English%20football">1960–61</a> season. From 1960, Norwich spent the next 12 seasons in the second tier, with finishes of fourth in 1961 and sixth in 1965 being among the most notable.

In 1962, <a href="Ron%20Ashman">Ron Ashman</a> guided Norwich to their first trophy, defeating <a href="Rochdale%20A.F.C.">Rochdale</a> 4–0 on <a href="Aggregate%20score">aggregate</a> in <a href="1962%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">a two-legged final</a> to win the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">League Cup</a>. Norwich finally achieved promotion from Division Two when they finished as champions in the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20in%20English%20football">1971–72</a> season under manager <a href="Ron%20Saunders">Ron Saunders</a>; Norwich City had reached the highest level of English football for the first time.

Norwich made their first appearance at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a> in 1973, losing the <a href="1973%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a> 1–0 to <a href="Tottenham%20Hotspur%20F.C.">Tottenham Hotspur</a>. Relegation to the Second Division in <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20in%20English%20football">1974</a> resulted in the resignation of Saunders and the appointment of <a href="John%20Bond%20%28footballer%29">John Bond</a>. A highly successful <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20in%20English%20football">first season</a> saw promotion back to the First Division and another visit to Wembley, again in the <a href="1975%20Football%20League%20Cup%20Final">League Cup final</a>, this time losing 1–0 to <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. They remained in the top-tier of English football for another six seasons. The club finished tenth in the <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20in%20English%20football">1975–76 season</a>; at the time their highest ever finish. Off the field, during Bond's tenure, a new River End stand was constructed at Carrow Road. Bond resigned during the <a href="1980%E2%80%9381%20in%20English%20football">1980–81</a> season and the club were relegated, but bounced back the <a href="1981%E2%80%9382%20in%20English%20football">following season</a> after finishing third.

The <a href="1984%E2%80%9385%20in%20English%20football">1984–85 season</a> was one of mixed fortunes for the club; a fire gutted the old Main Stand on 25 October 1984 but on the pitch, under <a href="Ken%20Brown%20%28footballer%29">Ken Brown</a>'s management, they reached the final of the <a href="Football%20League%20Cup">Milk Cup</a> at <a href="Wembley%20Stadium%20%281923%29">Wembley Stadium</a>. They defeated local rivals <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a> in the semi-final. In the final, they beat <a href="Sunderland%20A.F.C.">Sunderland</a> 1–0, but in the league both Norwich and Sunderland were relegated to the second tier of English football. Norwich had qualified for a place in the <a href="UEFA%20Cup">UEFA Cup</a>, but were denied their first foray into European competition when English club sides were banned, following the <a href="Heysel%20Stadium%20disaster">Heysel Stadium disaster</a>. City made an immediate return to the top flight by winning the Second Division championship in the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20in%20English%20football">1985–86</a> season. High league placing in the First Division in <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20in%20English%20football">1988–89</a> would have been enough for UEFA Cup qualification, but the ban on English clubs was still in place. They also had good cup runs during his period, reaching the FA Cup semi-finals in 1989 and again in 1992.

In <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20in%20English%20football">1992–93</a>, the <a href="FA%20Premier%20League%201992-93">inaugural season</a> of the English <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a>, Norwich City led the league for much of the season, having been among the pre-season favourites for relegation, and were eight points clear of the field shortly before Christmas, before faltering in the final weeks to finish third behind the champions, <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>, and <a href="Aston%20Villa%20F.C.">Aston Villa</a>. They had shown that they were a force to be reckoned with from the very first day of the Premier League season, achieving an impressive 4–2 away win over an <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal</a> side who were among the pre-season title favourites in a race finally won by <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>. This was a big surprise not least to the media and pundits who had tipped Norwich for a season of struggle.

The following season Norwich played in the UEFA Cup for the first time, defeating <a href="Vitesse%20Arnhem">Vitesse Arnhem</a> of the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> 3–0 in the first round. In the second round, they faced <a href="Bayern%20Munich">Bayern Munich</a> of Germany. Norwich won the tie 3–2 on <a href="Two-legged%20match">aggregate</a>; their 2–1 victory in Munich earning them a place in history, as <a href="Bayern%20Munich%201%E2%80%932%20Norwich%20City">the only English team to beat Bayern Munich in the Olympic Stadium</a>. "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" described the win in Munich as "the pinnacle of Norwich City's history". Reflecting on the shock result, "<a href="Four%20Four%20Two">Four Four Two</a>" wrote "The news that Norwich had gone 2–0 up in the Olympic Stadium seemed frankly surreal." Norwich's cup run was ended by <a href="Italy">Italy</a>'s <a href="Internazionale%20Milano%20F.C.">Internazionale</a>, who defeated them 2–0 over <a href="Two-legged%20match">two legs</a>. <a href="Mike%20Walker%20%28football%20manager%29">Mike Walker</a>'s success at Norwich attracted attention and, in January 1994, he left the club to take charge of <a href="Everton%20F.C.">Everton</a>. Walker's replacement was first team coach <a href="John%20Deehan">John Deehan</a>, who was assisted by <a href="Gary%20Megson">Gary Megson</a>, then still a player. Deehan led the club to 12th place in the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20in%20English%20football">1993–94</a> season in the Premier League.

During the 1994 <a href="close%20season">close season</a>, the club sold 21-year-old striker <a href="Chris%20Sutton">Chris Sutton</a> to <a href="Blackburn%20Rovers%20F.C.">Blackburn Rovers</a> for a then British record fee of £5 million. By Christmas 1994, Norwich City were seventh in the Premiership and were therefore challenging for a return to the UEFA Cup. But, following a serious injury to <a href="Goalkeeper%20%28association%20football%29">goalkeeper</a> <a href="Bryan%20Gunn">Bryan Gunn</a>, the club's performance nosedived; with just one win in their final 20 Premiership fixtures, Norwich plummeted to 20th place and relegation to the second tier of English football. Deehan resigned just before relegation was confirmed and his deputy, Megson, took over as temporary manager until the end of the season. <a href="Martin%20O%27Neill">Martin O'Neill</a>, who had taken <a href="Wycombe%20Wanderers%20F.C.">Wycombe Wanderers</a> from the Conference to the Second Division with successive promotions, was appointed as Norwich City manager in mid-1995. He lasted just six months in the job before resigning after a dispute with chairman <a href="Robert%20Chase%20%28businessman%29">Robert Chase</a> over Chase's refusal to permit O'Neill to spend significant sums on strengthening the squad. Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players and was to blame for the relegation. Between 1992 and January 1995, Norwich had disposed of several key attacking players: <a href="Robert%20Fleck%20%28footballer%29">Robert Fleck</a> (for £2.1M), <a href="Ruel%20Fox">Ruel Fox</a> (for £2.25M), Chris Sutton (for £5M), <a href="Efan%20Ekoku">Efan Ekoku</a> (£0.9M) and <a href="Mark%20Robins">Mark Robins</a> (£1M). Nearly 40 years after being instrumental in saving the club from bankruptcy, Geoffrey Watling bought Chase's majority shareholding. Gary Megson was appointed Norwich manager on a temporary basis for the second time in eight months. Megson remained in charge until the end of the season before leaving the club. Just four seasons after finishing third in the Premiership and beating Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup, Norwich had finished 16th in Division One.

English television cook <a href="Delia%20Smith">Delia Smith</a> and her husband <a href="Michael%20Wynn-Jones">Michael Wynn-Jones</a> took over the majority of Norwich City's shares from Watling in 1996, and Mike Walker was re-appointed as the club's manager. He was unable to repeat the success achieved during his first spell and was sacked two seasons later with Norwich mid-table in the First Division. His successor <a href="Bruce%20Rioch">Bruce Rioch</a> lasted two seasons and departed in mid-2000, with promotion yet to be achieved.

Rioch's successor, Bryan Hamilton, lasted in the job for six months before he resigned with the club 20th in the First Division, and in real danger of relegation to the third tier of English football for the first time since the 1960s. The new appointee was <a href="Nigel%20Worthington">Nigel Worthington</a>, who had been Hamilton's assistant manager. Worthington's time as Norwich manager was one of peaks and troughs, with mid-table comfort a rarity. In his first part-season, he successfully steered the team away from the threat of relegation. <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20in%20English%20football">The following season</a>, Norwich exceeded expectations and reached the <a href="2002%20Football%20League%20First%20Division%20play-off%20Final">2002 play-off final</a>, losing to <a href="Birmingham%20City%20F.C.">Birmingham City</a> on <a href="Penalty%20shootout%20%28association%20football%29">penalties</a>.

Norwich City celebrated its centenary in 2002. Among the celebrations and events was an initiative to create a <a href="Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a>, to honour players, coaches, managers, directors and executives who have "made the greatest contribution to the club in its long history both on and off the pitch". Initially, 100 significant figures from the club's history were honoured; 25 were nominated by the club and a further 75 were subsequently chosen by a fan vote. A further 10 members were inducted in 2006, elected by the club's supporters.
After a <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20in%20English%20football">season</a> of consolidation, in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20in%20English%20football">2003–04</a> Worthington led the club to the First Division title, <a href="2003-04%20in%20English%20football%23Football%20League%20First%20Division">a success achieved by a margin of eight points</a> and Norwich returned to the top flight for the first time in nine years. For much of the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20in%20English%20football">2004–05</a> season, the club struggled in the Premiership, but the team staged a remarkable comeback in the final weeks of the season: Norwich, who had not won in months, secured 13 points out of 18. On the last day of the season, the club needed a win to ensure top flight football the following season, but a 6–0 away defeat to <a href="Fulham%20F.C.">Fulham</a> condemned them to relegation.

The club was expected to make a quick return to the Premiership in the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20in%20English%20football">2005–06 season</a>, but a terrible first four months to the campaign saw City fall as low as 18th in <a href="The%20Championship">The Championship</a> and "the fans started to turn on Nigel Worthington". <a href="Dean%20Ashton">Dean Ashton</a> was sold for a club-record £7million, approximately double what they had paid just one year earlier. Half of Ashton's fee was immediately reinvested in the purchase of <a href="Wales%20national%20football%20team">Welsh</a> <a href="Striker%20%28association%20football%29">striker</a> <a href="Robert%20Earnshaw">Robert Earnshaw</a>, who helped the Canaries' revival to a ninth-place finish. Worthington made just one permanent signing in the close season, and when a poor run of form ensued, leaving the club in 17th place in the Championship, he was dismissed. First team coach <a href="Martin%20Hunter%20%28football%20coach%29">Martin Hunter</a> acted as caretaker manager for a fortnight before former City player <a href="Peter%20Grant%20%28footballer%2C%20born%201965%29">Peter Grant</a> left <a href="West%20Ham%20United">West Ham United</a> to become the new manager.

Grant managed to lift the side to finish 16th in the league. During the 2007 close season, Grant brought in nine players; ten players, including Earnshaw, departed and <a href="Darren%20Huckerby">Darren Huckerby</a> criticised the club for selling their best players. When the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20in%20English%20football">2007–08 season</a> opened with only two Norwich wins by early October, Grant left the club by "mutual consent". On 30 October, former <a href="Newcastle%20United%20F.C.">Newcastle United</a> boss <a href="Glenn%20Roeder">Glenn Roeder</a> was confirmed as the new manager. Roeder released several players, largely replacing them with inexperienced loan signings. Results improved enormously, lifting the club from five points adrift at the foot of the table to a comfortable mid-table position. Following a poor first half of the 2008–09 campaign, Roeder was dismissed in January 2009.

The appointment of the club's "legendary former goalkeeper", <a href="Bryan%20Gunn">Bryan Gunn</a>, as manager did not prevent relegation to the third tier of English league football (League One), a level the club had not played at since 1960. Norwich started their <a href="Football%20League%20One">League One</a> campaign at home to fellow East Anglians <a href="Colchester%20United">Colchester United</a>. They were widely expected to return swiftly to the Championship, but suffered a shock 1–7 defeat, the worst home defeat in their 107-year history. Gunn was sacked six days later. The club moved swiftly to appoint the man who had masterminded the downfall of Gunn, Colchester manager <a href="Paul%20Lambert">Paul Lambert</a>.

Lambert oversaw a turnaround in fortunes to lead Norwich to promotion back to The Championship as League One champions, during a season that included a 16-game unbeaten run. The following season, two victories in the <a href="Old%20Farm%20derby">Old Farm derby</a> over <a href="Ipswich%20Town%20F.C.">Ipswich Town</a>, were part of a season in which Norwich finished runners-up and returned to the <a href="Premier%20League">Premier League</a> following a six-year absence.

The club finished in 12th place in their first season back in the Premier League but Lambert resigned within a month of the season's close. He was replaced by <a href="Chris%20Hughton">Chris Hughton</a> for the 2012–13 season. Hughton's reign started poorly, but the bad run of form was followed by a club record unbeaten run in the Premier League and Norwich secured their third consecutive year in the Premier League. A 1–0 home defeat to <a href="Luton%20Town%20F.C">Luton Town</a> that season resulted in Norwich becoming the first English top-flight team to lose a FA Cup tie to a non-league side in 24 years.

At the end of the 2013–14 season, Hughton's second as manager, shortly before Norwich were relegated back to the Championship, Hughton was replaced by former Norwich player <a href="Neil%20Adams%20%28footballer%29">Neil Adams</a>. After a mediocre first half of the 2014–15 season, Adams resigned and <a href="Hamilton%20Academical">Hamilton Academical</a> manager <a href="Alex%20Neil%20%28footballer%29">Alex Neil</a> was appointed in January 2015; at 33 years old, he was the second youngest manager in <a href="the%20Football%20League">the Football League</a>. The appointment reinvigorated Norwich's season and after narrowly missing out on automatic promotion back to the Premier League, victory in the <a href="2015%20Football%20League%20Championship%20play-off%20Final">2015 Championship playoff final</a> secured an immediate return to the top division of English football. During the 2015–16 season, former <a href="Shadow%20Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Shadow Chancellor</a> <a href="Ed%20Balls">Ed Balls</a> was appointed Chairman. At the end of that season, Norwich were relegated once more, to play in the <a href="2016%E2%80%9317%20EFL%20Championship">2016–17 EFL Championship</a>. When it became clear that the club would not be promoted, Neil left his post and was replaced in May 2017 by German coach, <a href="Daniel%20Farke">Daniel Farke</a>, on a two-year contract.

The post-millennium period has seen changes to the way the club is run as a business. When a new business management team was appointed at the start of the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20Norwich%20City%20F.C.%20season">2009–10 season</a>, it inherited a business saddled with debt. Substantial work was done to restructure the finances, with a plan for all debt to be repaid within five years. In 2016, the club reported that it was debt-free.

Edward the Elder

Edward the Elder (c. 874 – 17 July 924) was <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Wessex">King of the Anglo-Saxons</a> from 899 until his death. He was the elder son of <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a> and his wife <a href="Ealhswith">Ealhswith</a>. When Edward succeeded to the throne, he had to defeat a challenge from his cousin <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20%C3%A6theling">Æthelwold</a>, who had a strong claim to the throne as the son of Alfred's elder brother and predecessor, <a href="%C3%86thelred%20I%2C%20King%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred</a>. 

Alfred had succeeded Æthelred as king of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> in 871, and almost faced defeat against the Danish <a href="Viking">Viking</a>s until his decisive victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edington">Battle of Edington</a> in 878. After the battle, the Vikings still ruled <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> and eastern <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>, leaving only Wessex and western Mercia under Anglo-Saxon control. In the early 880s <a href="%C3%86thelred%2C%20Lord%20of%20the%20Mercians">Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians</a>, the ruler of western Mercia, accepted Alfred's lordship and married his daughter <a href="%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d">Æthelflæd</a>, and around 886 Alfred adopted the new title King of the Anglo-Saxons as the ruler of all Anglo-Saxons not subject to Danish rule.

In 910 a Mercian and West Saxon army inflicted a decisive defeat on an invading Northumbrian army, ending the threat from the northern Vikings. In the 910s, Edward conquered Viking-ruled southern England in partnership with his sister Æthelflæd, who had succeeded as Lady of the Mercians following the death of her husband in 911. Historians dispute how far Mercia was dominated by Wessex during this period, and after Æthelflæd's death in June 918, her daughter <a href="%C3%86lfwynn">Ælfwynn</a>, briefly became second Lady of the Mercians, but in December Edward took her into Wessex and imposed direct rule on Mercia. By the end of the 910s he ruled Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, and only Northumbria remained under Viking rule. In 924 he faced a Mercian and Welsh revolt at <a href="Chester">Chester</a>, and after putting it down he died at <a href="Farndon%2C%20Cheshire">Farndon</a> in <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> on 17 July 924. He was succeeded by his eldest son <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a>.

Edward was admired by medieval chroniclers, and in the view of William of Malmesbury, he was "much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters" but "incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule". He was largely ignored by modern historians until the 1990s, and Nick Higham described him as "perhaps the most neglected of English kings", partly because few primary sources for his reign survive. His reputation rose in the late twentieth century and he is now seen as destroying the power of the Vikings in southern England while laying the foundations for a south-centred united English kingdom.

<a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> was the dominant kingdom in southern England in the eighth century and maintained its position until it suffered a decisive defeat by <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ellandun">Battle of Ellandun</a> in 825. Thereafter the two kingdoms became allies, which was to be an important factor in English resistance to the Vikings. In 865 the Danish Viking <a href="Great%20Heathen%20Army">Great Heathen Army</a> landed in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a> and used this as a starting point for an invasion. The East Anglians were forced to pay off the Vikings, who invaded <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> the following year. They appointed a puppet king in 867, and then moved on Mercia, where they spent the winter of 867–868. King <a href="Burgred">Burgred</a> of Mercia was joined by King <a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Wessex">Æthelred of Wessex</a> and his brother, the future <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">King Alfred</a>, for a combined attack on the Vikings, who refused an engagement; in the end the Mercians bought peace with them. The following year, the Danes conquered East Anglia, and in 874 they expelled King Burgred and, with their support, <a href="Ceolwulf%20II%20of%20Mercia">Ceolwulf</a> became the last King of Mercia. In 877 the Vikings partitioned Mercia, taking the eastern regions for themselves and allowing Ceolwulf to keep the western ones. In early 878 they invaded Wessex, and many West Saxons submitted to them. Alfred, who was now king, was reduced to a remote base in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Athelney">Isle of Athelney</a> in <a href="Somerset">Somerset</a>, but the situation was transformed when he won a decisive victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edington">Battle of Edington</a>. He was thus able to prevent the Vikings from taking Wessex and western Mercia, although they still occupied Northumbria, East Anglia and eastern Mercia.

Edward's parents, Alfred and <a href="Ealhswith">Ealhswith</a>, married in 868. Her father was <a href="%C3%86thelred%20Mucel">Æthelred Mucel</a>, <a href="Ealdorman">Ealdorman</a> of the <a href="Gaini">Gaini</a>, and her mother, Eadburh, was a member of the Mercian royal family. Alfred and Ealhswith had five children who survived childhood. The oldest was <a href="%C3%86thelfl%C3%A6d">Æthelflæd</a>, who married <a href="%C3%86thelred%2C%20Lord%20of%20the%20Mercians">Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians</a>, and ruled as Lady of the Mercians after his death. Edward was next, and the second daughter, <a href="%C3%86thelgifu%2C%20abbess%20of%20Shaftesbury">Æthelgifu</a>, became <a href="Shaftesbury%20Abbey">abbess of Shaftesbury</a>. The third daughter, <a href="%C3%86lfthryth%2C%20Countess%20of%20Flanders">Ælfthryth</a>, married <a href="Baldwin%20II%2C%20Margrave%20of%20Flanders">Baldwin, Count of Flanders</a>, and the younger son, <a href="%C3%86thelweard%20%28son%20of%20Alfred%29">Æthelweard</a>, was given a scholarly education, including learning Latin. This would usually suggest that he was intended for the church, but it is unlikely in Æthelweard's case as he later had sons. There were also an unknown number of children who died young. Neither part of Edward's name, which means 'protector of wealth', had been used previously by the West Saxon royal house, and <a href="Barbara%20Yorke">Barbara Yorke</a> suggests that he may have been named after his maternal grandmother Eadburh, reflecting the West Saxon policy of strengthening links with Mercia.

Historians estimate that Edward was probably born in the mid-870s. His eldest sister, Æthelflæd, was probably born about a year after her parents' marriage, and Edward was brought up with his youngest sister, Ælfthryth; Yorke argues that he was therefore probably nearer in age to Ælfthryth than Æthelflæd. Edward led troops in battle in 893, and must have been of marriageable age in that year as his oldest son Æthelstan was born about 894. According to <a href="Asser">Asser</a> in his "Life of King Alfred", Edward and Ælfthryth were educated at court by male and female tutors, and read ecclesiastical and secular works in English, such as the <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a> and <a href="Old%20English%20poetry">Old English poems</a>. They were taught the courtly qualities of gentleness and humility, and Asser wrote that they were obedient to their father and friendly to visitors. This is the only known case of an Anglo-Saxon prince and princess receiving the same upbringing.

As a son of a king, Edward was an <a href="%C3%A6theling">ætheling</a>, a prince of the royal house who was eligible for kingship. Even though he had the advantage of being the eldest son of the reigning king, his accession was not assured as he had cousins who had a strong claim to the throne. <a href="%C3%86thelhelm">Æthelhelm</a> and <a href="%C3%86thelwold%20of%20Wessex">Æthelwold</a> were sons of Æthelred, Alfred's older brother and predecessor as king, but they had been passed over because they were infants when their father died. Asser gives more information about Edward's childhood and youth than is known about other Anglo-Saxon princes, providing details about the training of a prince in a period of <a href="Carolingian%20Renaissance">Carolingian</a> influence, and Yorke suggest that we may know so much due to Alfred's efforts to portray his son as the most throneworthy ætheling.

Æthelhelm is only recorded in Alfred's will of the mid-880s, and probably died at some time in the next decade, but Æthelwold is listed above Edward in the only <a href="charter">charter</a> where he appears, probably indicating a higher status. Æthelwold may also have had an advantage because his mother Wulfthryth witnessed a charter as queen, whereas Edward's mother Ealhswith never had a higher status than king's wife. However, Alfred was in a position to give his own son considerable advantages. In his will, he only left a handful of estates to his brother's sons, and the bulk of his property to Edward, including all his <a href="Bookland%20%28law%29">booklands</a> (land vested in a charter which could be alienated by the holder, as opposed to folkland, which had to pass to <a href="heirs%20of%20the%20body">heirs of the body</a>) in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. Alfred also advanced men who could be depended on to support his plans for his succession, such as his brother-in-law, a Mercian ealdorman called Æthelwulf, and his son-in-law Æthelred. Edward witnessed several of his father's charters, and often accompanied him on royal peregrinations. In a Kentish charter of 898 Edward witnessed as "rex Saxonum", suggesting that Alfred may have followed the strategy adopted by his grandfather <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert</a> of strengthening his son's claim to succeed to the West Saxon throne by making him sub-king of Kent. 

Once Edward grew up, Alfred was able to give him military commands and experience in royal administration. The English defeated renewed Viking attacks in 893 to 896, and in <a href="Richard%20Abels">Richard Abels</a>' view, the glory belonged to Æthelred and Edward rather than Alfred himself. In 893 Edward defeated the Vikings in the Battle of Farnham, although he was unable to follow up his victory as his troops' period of service had expired and he had to release them. The situation was saved by the arrival of troops from London led by Æthelred. Yorke argues that although Alfred packed the <a href="witan">witan</a> with members whose interests lay in the continuation of Alfred's line, that may not have been sufficient to ensure Edward's accession if he had not displayed his fitness for kingship. 

In about 893, Edward probably married <a href="Ecgwynn">Ecgwynn</a>, who bore him two children, the future King Æthelstan and a daughter who married <a href="Sitric%20C%C3%A1ech">Sitric Cáech</a>, a Viking King of York. The twelfth-century chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> described Ecgwynn as an "illustris femina" (noble lady), and stated that Edward chose Æthelstan as his heir as king. She may have been related to St <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a>, the aristocratic tenth-century <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>. But William also stated that Æthelstan's accession in 924 was opposed by a nobleman who claimed that his mother was a concubine of low birth. The suggestion that Ecgwynn was Edward's mistress is accepted by some historians such as <a href="Simon%20Keynes">Simon Keynes</a> and Richard Abels, but Yorke and Æthelstan's biographer, <a href="Sarah%20Foot">Sarah Foot</a>, disagree, arguing that the allegations should be seen in the context of the disputed succession in 924, and were not an issue in the 890s. Ecgwynn probably died by 899, as around the time of Alfred's death Edward married <a href="%C3%86lffl%C3%A6d%2C%20wife%20of%20Edward%20the%20Elder">Ælfflæd</a>, the daughter of Ealdorman Æthelhelm, probably of <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>.

<a href="Janet%20Nelson">Janet Nelson</a> suggests that there was conflict between Alfred and Edward in the 890s. She points out that the contemporary "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", produced under court auspices in the 890s, does not mention Edward's military successes. These are only known from the late tenth century chronicle of <a href="%C3%86thelweard%20%28historian%29">Æthelweard</a>, such as his account of the Battle of Farnham, in which in Nelson's view "Edward's military prowess, and popularity with a following of young warriors, are highlighted". Towards the end of his life Alfred invested his young grandson Æthelstan in a ceremony which historians see as designation as eventual successor to the kingship. Nelson argues that while this may have been proposed by Edward to support the accession of his own son, on the other hand it may have been intended by Alfred as part of a scheme to divide the kingdom between his son and grandson. Æthelstan was sent to be brought up in Mercia by Æthelflæd and Æthelred, but it is not known whether this was Alfred's idea or Edward's. Alfred's wife Ealhswith was ignored in the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" in her husband's lifetime, but emerged from obscurity when her son acceded. This may be because she supported her son against her husband.

Alfred died on 26 October 899 and Edward succeeded to the throne, but Æthelwold disputed the succession. He seized the royal estates of <a href="Wimborne">Wimborne</a>, symbolically important as the place where his father was buried, and <a href="Christchurch%2C%20Dorset">Christchurch</a>, both in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. Edward marched with his army to the nearby <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> hillfort at <a href="Badbury%20Rings">Badbury Rings</a>. Æthelwold declared that he would live or die at Wimborne, but then left in the night and rode to Northumbria, where the Danes accepted him as king. Edward was crowned on 8 June 900 at <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Thames">Kingston upon Thames</a>.

In 901, Æthelwold came with a fleet to <a href="Essex">Essex</a>, and the following year he persuaded the East Anglian Danes to invade English Mercia and northern Wessex, where his army looted and then returned home. Edward retaliated by ravaging East Anglia, but when he retreated the men of Kent disobeyed the order to retire, and were intercepted by the Danish army. The two sides met at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Holme">Battle of the Holme</a> (perhaps <a href="Holme%2C%20Cambridgeshire">Holme</a> in <a href="Huntingdonshire">Huntingdonshire</a>) on 13 December 902. According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", the Danes "kept the place of slaughter", meaning that they won the battle, but they suffered heavy losses, including Æthelwold and a King Eohric, possibly of the East Anglian Danes. Kentish losses included Sigehelm, ealdorman of Kent and father of Edward's third wife, Eadgifu. Æthelwold's death ended the threat to Edward's throne.

In London in 886 Alfred had received the formal submission of "all the English people that were not under subjection to the Danes", and thereafter he adopted the title "Anglorum Saxonum rex" (King of the Anglo-Saxons), which is used in his later charters and all but two of Edward's. This is seen by Keynes as "the invention of a wholly new and distinctive polity", covering both West Saxons and Mercians, which was inherited by Edward with the support of Mercians at the West Saxon court, of whom the most important was <a href="Plegmund">Plegmund</a>, Archbishop of Canterbury. In 903 Edward issued several charters concerning land in Mercia. Three of them are witnessed by the Mercian leaders and their daughter <a href="%C3%86lfwynn">Ælfwynn</a>, and they all contain a statement that Æthelred and Æthelflæd "then held rulership and power over the race of the Mercians, under the aforesaid king". Other charters were issued by the Mercian leaders which did not contain any acknowledgment of Edward's authority, but they did not issue their own coinage. This view of Edward's status is accepted by Martin Ryan, who states that Æthelred and Æthelflæd had "a considerable but ultimately subordinate share of royal authority" in English Mercia. 

Other historians disagree. <a href="Pauline%20Stafford">Pauline Stafford</a> describes Æthelflæd as "the last Mercian queen", while in Charles Insley's view Mercia kept its independence until Æthelflæd's death in 918. Michael Davidson contrasts the 903 charters with one of 901 in which the Mercian rulers were "by grace of God, holding, governing and defending the monarchy of the Mercians". Davidson comments that "the evidence for Mercian subordination is decidedly mixed. Ultimately, the ideology of the 'Kingdom of the Anglo-Saxons' may have been less successful in achieving the absorption of Mercia and more something which I would see as a murky political coup." The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" was compiled at the West Saxon court from the 890s, and the entries for the late ninth and early tenth centuries are seen by historians as reflecting the West Saxon viewpoint; Davidson observes that "Alfred and Edward possessed skilled 'spin doctors'". Some versions of the "Chronicle" incorporate part of a lost "Mercian Register", which gives a Mercian perspective and details of Æthelflæd's campaign against the Vikings.

In the late ninth and early tenth centuries, connection by marriage with the West Saxon royal house was seen as prestigious by continental rulers. In the mid-890s Alfred had married his daughter Ælfthryth to Baldwin II of Flanders, and in 919 Edward married his daughter <a href="Eadgifu%20of%20Wessex">Eadgifu</a> to <a href="Charles%20the%20Simple">Charles the Simple</a>, King of <a href="West%20Francia">West Francia</a>. In 925, after Edward's death, another daughter <a href="Eadgyth">Eadgyth</a> married <a href="Otto%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Otto</a>, the future <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Germany">King of Germany</a> and (after Eadgyth's death) <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>.

No battles are recorded between the Anglo-Saxons and the Danish Vikings for several years after the Battle of the Holme, but in 906 Edward agreed peace with the East Anglian and Northumbrian Danes, suggesting that there had been conflict. According to one version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" he made peace "of necessity", which implies that he was forced to buy them off. He encouraged Englishmen to purchase land in Danish territory, and two charters survive relating to estates in <a href="Bedfordshire">Bedfordshire</a> and <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>. In 909 Edward sent a combined West Saxon and Mercian army which harassed the Northumbrian Danes, and seized the bones of the Northumbrian royal saint <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald</a> from <a href="Bardney%20Abbey">Bardney Abbey</a> in <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>. Oswald was <a href="Translation%20%28relic%29">translated</a> to <a href="St%20Oswald%27s%20Priory%2C%20Gloucester">a new Mercian minster</a> established by Æthelred and Æthelflæd in <a href="Gloucester">Gloucester</a> and the Danes were compelled to accept peace on Edward's terms. In the following year, the Northumbrian Danes retaliated by raiding Mercia, but on their way home they were met by a combined Mercian and West Saxon army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tettenhall">Battle of Tettenhall</a>, where the Vikings suffered a disastrous defeat. After that, the Northumbrian Danes never ventured south of the River <a href="Humber">Humber</a>, and Edward and his Mercian allies were able to concentrate on conquering the southern Danelaw in East Anglia and the <a href="Five%20Boroughs">Five Boroughs</a> of Viking east Mercia: <a href="Derby">Derby</a>, <a href="Leicester">Leicester</a>, <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Lincolnshire">Lincoln</a>, <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> and <a href="Stamford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Stamford</a>. In 911 Æthelred, Lord of the Mercians, died, and Edward took control of the Mercian lands around London and <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>. Æthelred was succeeded as ruler by his widow Æthelflæd as Lady of the Mercians, and she had probably been acting as ruler for several years as Æthelred seems to have been incapacitated in later life.

Edward and Æthelflæd then began the construction of fortresses to guard against Viking attacks and protect territory captured from them. In November 911, he constructed a fort on the north bank of the <a href="River%20Lea">River Lea</a> at <a href="Hertford">Hertford</a> to guard against attack by the Danes of <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a> and <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. In 912, he marched with his army to <a href="Maldon%2C%20Essex">Maldon</a> in Essex, and ordered the building of a fort at <a href="Witham">Witham</a> and a second fort at Hertford, which protected London from attack and encouraged many English living under Danish rule in Essex to submit to him. In 913 there was a pause in his activities, although Æthelflæd continued her fortress building in Mercia. In 914 a Viking army sailed from <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> and ravaged the <a href="Severn">Severn</a> estuary. It then attacked <a href="Ergyng">Ergyng</a> in south-east Wales (now <a href="Archenfield">Archenfield</a> in <a href="Herefordshire">Herefordshire</a>) and captured Bishop <a href="Cimeliauc">Cyfeilliog</a>. Edward ransomed him for the large sum of forty pounds of silver. The Vikings were defeated by the armies of Hereford and Gloucester, and gave hostages and oaths to keep the peace. Edward kept an army on the south side of the estuary in case the Vikings broke their promises, and he twice had to repel attacks. In the autumn the Vikings moved on to Ireland. The episode suggests that south-east Wales fell within the West Saxon sphere of power, unlike <a href="Brycheiniog">Brycheiniog</a> just to the north, where Mercia was dominant. In late 914 Edward built two forts at <a href="Buckingham">Buckingham</a>, and Earl Thurketil, the leader of the Danish army at Bedford submitted to him. The following year he occupied Bedford, and constructed another fortification on the south bank of the <a href="River%20Great%20Ouse">River Great Ouse</a> against a Viking one on the north bank. In 916 Edward returned to Essex and built a fort at Maldon to bolster the defence of Witham. He also helped Earl Thurketil and his followers to leave England, reducing the number of Viking armies in the Midlands.

The decisive year in the war was 917. In April Edward built a fort at <a href="Towcester">Towcester</a> as a defence against the Danes of <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a>, and another at an unidentified place called Wigingamere. The Danes launched unsuccessful attacks on Towcester, Bedford and Wigingamere, while Æthelflæd captured Derby, showing the value of the English defensive measures, which were aided by disunity and a lack of coordination among the Viking armies. The Danes had built their own fortress at <a href="Tempsford">Tempsford</a> in Bedfordshire, but at the end of the summer the English stormed it and killed the last Danish king of East Anglia. The English then took <a href="Colchester">Colchester</a>, although they did not try to hold it. The Danes retaliated by sending a large army to lay siege to Maldon, but the garrison held out until it was relieved and the retreating army was heavily defeated. Edward then returned to Towcester and reinforced its fort with a stone wall, and the Danes of nearby Northampton submitted to him. The armies of Cambridge and East Anglia also submitted, and by the end of the year the only Danish armies still holding out were those of four of the Five Boroughs, Leicester, Stamford, Nottingham, and Lincoln.

In early 918, Æthelflæd secured the submission of Leicester without a fight, and the Danes of Northumbrian York offered her their allegiance, probably for protection against <a href="Norwegians%23Viking%20Age">Norse</a> (Norwegian) Vikings who had invaded Northumbria from Ireland, but she died on 12 June before she could take up the proposal. The same offer is not known to have been made to Edward, and the Norse Vikings took York in 919. According to the main West Saxon version of the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", after Æthelflæd's death the Mercians submitted to Edward, but the Mercian version (the "Mercian Register") states that in December 918 her daughter Ælfwynn "was deprived of all authority in Mercia and taken into Wessex". Mercia may have made a bid for continued semi-independence which was suppressed by Edward, and it then came under his direct rule. Stamford had surrendered to Edward before Æthelflæd's death, and Nottingham did the same shortly afterwards. According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" for 918, "all the people who had settled in Mercia, both Danish and English, submitted to him". This would mean that he ruled all England south of the Humber, but it is not clear whether Lincoln was an exception, as coins of Viking York in the early 920s were probably minted at Lincoln. Some Danish <a href="earl">jarls</a> were allowed to keep their estates, although Edward probably also rewarded his supporters with land, and some he kept in his own hands. Coin evidence suggests that his authority was stronger in the East Midlands than in East Anglia. Three Welsh kings, <a href="Hywel%20Dda">Hywel Dda</a>, Clydog and <a href="Idwal%20Foel">Idwal Foel</a>, who had previously been subject to Æthelflæd, now gave their allegiance to Edward.
The principal currency in later Anglo-Saxon England was the <a href="Penny%20%28English%20coin%29">silver penny</a>, and some coins carried a stylised portrait of the king. Edward's coins had "EADVVEARD REX" on the <a href="obverse">obverse</a> and the name of the moneyer on the reverse. The places of issue were not shown in his reign, but they were in that of his son Æthelstan, allowing the location of many moneyers of Edward's reign to be established. There were mints in <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>, Chester, <a href="Chichester">Chichester</a>, Derby, <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a>, <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a>, London, Oxford, <a href="Shaftesbury">Shaftesbury</a>, <a href="Shrewsbury">Shrewsbury</a>, <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, <a href="Stafford">Stafford</a>, <a href="Wallingford%2C%20Oxfordshire">Wallingford</a>, <a href="Wareham%2C%20Dorset">Wareham</a>, Winchester and probably other towns. No coins were struck in the name of Æthelred or Æthelflæd, but from around 910 mints in English Mercia produced coins with an unusual decorative design on the reverse. This ceased before 920, and probably represents Æthelflæd's way of distinguishing her coinage from that of her brother. There was also a minor issue of coins in the name of Plegmund, Archbishop of Canterbury. There was a dramatic increase in the number of moneyers over Edward's reign, fewer than 25 in the south in the first ten years rising to 67 in the last ten years, around 5 in English Mercia rising to 23, plus 27 in the conquered Danelaw.

In 908, Plegmund conveyed the alms of the English king and people to the Pope, the first visit to Rome by an Archbishop of Canterbury for almost a century, and the journey may have been to seek papal approval for a proposed re-organisation of the West Saxon sees. When Edward came to the throne Wessex had two dioceses, <a href="Diocese%20of%20Winchester">Winchester</a>, held by <a href="Denewulf">Denewulf</a>, and <a href="Diocese%20of%20Sherborne">Sherborne</a>, held by Asser. In 908 Denewulf died and was replaced the following year by <a href="Frithestan">Frithestan</a>; soon afterwards Winchester was divided into two sees, with the creation of the <a href="diocese%20of%20Ramsbury">diocese of Ramsbury</a> covering Wiltshire and <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, while Winchester was left with <a href="Hampshire">Hampshire</a> and <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. Forged charters date the division to 909, but this may not be correct. Asser died in the same year, and at some date between 909 and 918 Sherborne was divided into three sees, <a href="Diocese%20of%20Crediton">Crediton</a> covering <a href="Devon">Devon</a> and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>, and <a href="diocese%20of%20Wells">Wells</a> covering Somerset, leaving Sherborne with Dorset. The effect of the changes was to strengthen the status of Canterbury compared with Winchester and Sherborne, but the division may have been related to a change in the secular functions of West Saxon bishops, to become agents of royal government in shires rather than provinces, assisting in defence and taking part in shire courts.

At the beginning of Edward's reign, his mother Ealhswith founded the abbey of St Mary for nuns, known as the <a href="Nunnaminster">Nunnaminster</a>, in Winchester. Edward's daughter <a href="Eadburh%20of%20Winchester">Eadburh</a> became a nun there, and she was venerated as a saint and the subject of a hagiography by <a href="Osbert%20of%20Clare">Osbert of Clare</a> in the twelfth century. In 901, Edward started building a major religious community for men, possibly in accordance with his father's wishes. The monastery was next to Winchester Cathedral, which became known as the <a href="Old%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">Old Minster</a> while Edward's foundation was called the <a href="New%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">New Minster</a>. It was much larger than the Old Minster, and was probably intended as a royal mausoleum. It acquired relics of the Breton <a href="Saint%20Judoc">Saint Judoc</a>, which probably arrived in England from <a href="Ponthieu">Ponthieu</a> in 901, and the body of one of Alfred's closest advisers, <a href="Grimbald">Grimbald</a>, who died in the same year and who was soon venerated as a saint. Edward's mother died in 902, and he buried her and Alfred there, moving his father's body from the Old Minster. Burials in the early 920s included Edward himself, his brother Æthelweard, and his son <a href="%C3%86lfweard%20of%20Wessex">Ælfweard</a>. On the other hand, when Æthelstan became king in 924, he did not show any favour to his father's foundation, probably because Winchester sided against him when the throne was disputed after Edward's death. The only other king buried at the New Minster was <a href="Eadwig">Eadwig</a> in 959.

Edward's decision not to expand the Old Minster, but rather to overshadow it with a much larger building, suggests animosity towards Bishop Denewulf, and this was compounded by forcing the Old Minster to cede both land for the new site, and an estate of 70 <a href="Hide%20%28unit%29">hides</a> at <a href="Beddington">Beddington</a> to provide an income for the New Minster. Edward was remembered by the New Minster as a benefactor, but at the Old Minster as "rex avidus" (greedy king). He may have built the new church because he did not think that the Old Minster was grand enough to be the royal mausoleum for kings of the Anglo-Saxons, not just the West Saxons like their predecessors. Alan Thacker comments:
<a href="Patrick%20Wormald">Patrick Wormald</a> observes: "The thought occurs that neither Alfred nor Edward was greatly beloved at Winchester Cathedral; and one reason for Edward's moving his father's body into the new family shrine next door was that he was surer of sincere prayers there."

The standard of Anglo-Saxon learning declined severely in the ninth century, particularly in Wessex, and Mercian scholars such as Plegmund played a major part in the revival of learning initiated by Alfred. Mercians were prominent at the courts of Alfred and Edward, and the Mercian dialect and scholarship commanded West Saxon respect. It is uncertain how far Alfred's programmes continued during his son's reign. English translations of works in Latin made during Alfred's reign continued to be copied, but few original works are known. The script known as Anglo-Saxon Square <a href="Carolingian%20minuscule">minuscule</a> reached maturity in the 930s, and its earliest phases date to Edward's reign. The main scholarly and scriptorial centres were the cathedral centres of Canterbury, Winchester and Worcester; monasteries did not make a significant contribution until Æthelstan's reign. Very little survives of the manuscript production of Edward's reign.

The <a href="Anglo-Saxon_art%23Textile_art">only surviving large scale embroideries</a> which were certainly made in Anglo-Saxon England date to Edward's reign. They are a <a href="Stole%20%28vestment%29">stole</a>, a maniple and a possible <a href="girdle">girdle</a> removed from the coffin of <a href="St%20Cuthbert">St Cuthbert</a> in <a href="Durham%20Cathedral">Durham Cathedral</a> in the nineteenth century. They were donated to the shrine by Æthelstan in 934, but inscriptions on the embroideries show that they were commissioned by Edward's second wife, Ælfflæd, as a gift to Frithestan, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a>. They probably did not reach their intended destination because Æthelstan was on bad terms with Winchester.

Almost all surviving charters from Edward's reign are later copies, and the only surviving original is not a charter of Edward himself, but a grant by Æthelred and Æthelflæd in 901. In the same year a meeting at Southampton was attended by his brother and sons, his household <a href="thegn">thegn</a>s and nearly all bishops, but no ealdormen. It was on this occasion that the king acquired land from the Bishop of Winchester for the foundation of the New Minster, Winchester. No charters survive for the period from 910 to the king's death in 924, much to the puzzlement and distress of historians. Charters were usually issued when the king made grants of land, and it is possible that Edward followed a policy of retaining property which came into his hands to help finance his campaigns against the Vikings. Charters rarely survive unless they concerned property which passed to the church and were preserved in their archives, and another possibility is that Edward was only making grants of property on terms which ensured that they returned to male members of the royal house; such charters would not be found in church archives.

Clause 3 of the law code called "I Edward" provides that people convincingly charged with perjury shall not be allowed to clear themselves by oath, but only by <a href="Trial%20by%20ordeal">ordeal</a>. This is the start of the continuous history in England of <a href="trial%20by%20ordeal">trial by ordeal</a>; it is probably mentioned in the laws of King <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine</a> (688 to 726), but not in later codes such as those of Alfred. The administrative and legal system in Edward's reign may have depended extensively on written records, almost none of which survive. Edward was one of the few Anglo-Saxon kings to issue laws about bookland. There was increasing confusion in the period as to what was really bookland; Edward urged prompt settlement in bookland and folkland disputes, and his legislation established that jurisdiction belonged to the king and his officers.

According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", there was a general submission of rulers in Britain to Edward in 920:
This passage was regarded as a straightforward report by most historians until the late twentieth century, and <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> observed that "each of the rulers named in this list had something definite to gain from an acknowledgement of Edward's overlordship". Since the 1980s this submission has been viewed with increasing scepticism, particularly as the passage in the "Chronicle" is the only evidence for it, unlike other submissions such as that one in 927 to Æthelstan, for which there is independent support from literary sources and coins. <a href="Alfred%20P.%20Smyth">Alfred P. Smyth</a> points out that Edward was not in a position to impose the same conditions on the Scots and the Northumbrians as he could on conquered Vikings, and argues that the "Chronicle" presented a treaty between kings as a submission to Wessex. Stafford observes that the rulers had met at <a href="Bakewell">Bakewell</a> on the border between Mercia and Northumbria, and that meetings on borders were generally considered to avoid any implication of submission by either side. Davidson points out that the wording "chosen as father and lord" applied to conquered army groups and burhs, not relations with other kings. In his view:

Edward continued Æthelflæd's policy of founding burhs in the north-west, at <a href="Thelwall">Thelwall</a> and <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a> in 919, and "Cledematha" (<a href="Rhuddlan">Rhuddlan</a>) at the mouth of the <a href="River%20Clwyd">River Clwyd</a> in North Wales in 921.

Nothing is known of his relations with the Mercians between 919 and the last year of his life, when he put down a Mercian and Welsh revolt at Chester. Mercia and the eastern Danelaw were organised into shires at an unknown date in the tenth century, ignoring traditional boundaries, and historians such as Sean Miller and David Griffiths suggest that Edward's imposition of direct control from 919 is a likely context for a change which ignored Mercian sensibilities. Resentment at the changes, at the imposition of rule by distant Wessex, and at fiscal demands by Edward's reeves, may have provoked the revolt at Chester. He died at the royal estate of Farndon, twelve miles south of Chester, on 24 July 924, shortly after putting down the revolt, and was buried in the New Minster, Winchester. In 1109, the New Minster was moved outside the city walls to become <a href="Hyde%20Abbey">Hyde Abbey</a>, and the following year the remains of Edward and his parents were translated to the new church.

According to William of Malmesbury, Edward was "much inferior to his father in the cultivation of letters", but "incomparably more glorious in the power of his rule". Other medieval chroniclers expressed similar views, and he was generally seen as inferior in book learning, but superior in military success. <a href="John%20of%20Worcester">John of Worcester</a> described him as "the most invincible King Edward the Elder". However, even as war leader he was only one of a succession of successful kings; his achievements were overshadowed because he did not have a famous victory like Alfred's at Edington and Æthelstan's at <a href="Battle%20of%20Brunanburh">Brunanburh</a>, and William qualified his praise of Edward by saying that "the chief prize of victory, in my judgment, is due to his father". Edward has also been overshadowed by chroniclers' admiration for his highly regarded sister, Æthelflæd.

A principal reason for the neglect of Edward is that very few primary sources for his reign survive, whereas there are many for Alfred. He was largely ignored by historians until the late twentieth century, but he is now highly regarded. He is described by Keynes as "far more than the bellicose bit between Alfred and Æthelstan", and according to Nick Higham: "Edward the Elder is perhaps the most neglected of English kings. He ruled an expanding realm for twenty-five years and arguably did as much as any other individual to construct a single, south-centred, Anglo-Saxon kingdom, yet posthumously his achievements have been all but forgotten." In 1999 a conference on his reign was held at the <a href="University%20of%20Manchester">University of Manchester</a>, and the papers given on this occasion were published as a book in 2001. Prior to this conference, no monographs had been published on Edward's reign, whereas his father has been the subject of numerous biographies and other studies.

In the view of F. T. Wainwright: "Without detracting from the achievements of Alfred, it is well to remember that it was Edward who reconquered the Danish Midlands and gave England nearly a century of respite from serious Danish attacks." Higham summarises Edward's legacy as follows:

Edward's <a href="cognomen">cognomen</a> 'the Elder' was first used in <a href="Wulfstan%20the%20Cantor">Wulfstan</a>'s "Life of St Æthelwold" at the end of the tenth century, to distinguish him from King <a href="Edward%20the%20Martyr">Edward the Martyr</a>.

Edward had about fourteen children from three marriages.

He first married <a href="Ecgwynn">Ecgwynn</a> around 893. Their children were:

In c. 900, Edward married <a href="%C3%86lffl%C3%A6d%20%28wife%20of%20Edward%20the%20Elder%29">Ælfflæd</a>, daughter of Ealdorman Æthelhelm, probably of <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a>. Their children were:

Beth Hamedrash Hagodol

Beth Hamedrash Hagodol (, "Great Study House") is an <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox Jewish</a> congregation that for over 120 years was located in a historic building at 60–64 Norfolk Street between <a href="Grand%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Grand</a> and <a href="Broome%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Broome</a> Streets in the <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a> neighborhood of <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. It was the <a href="Oldest%20synagogues%20in%20the%20United%20States">first</a> <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>an congregation founded in New York City and the oldest <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Russia">Russian Jewish</a> Orthodox congregation in the United States.

Founded in 1852 by Rabbi Abraham Ash as "Beth Hamedrash", the congregation split in 1859, with the rabbi and most of the members renaming their congregation "Beth Hamedrash Hagodol". The congregation's president and a small number of the members eventually formed the nucleus of "Kahal Adath Jeshurun", also known as the <a href="Eldridge%20Street%20Synagogue">Eldridge Street Synagogue</a>. Rabbi <a href="Jacob%20Joseph">Jacob Joseph</a>, the first and only <a href="Chief%20Rabbi">Chief Rabbi</a> of New York City, led the congregation from 1888 to 1902. Rabbi <a href="Ephraim%20Oshry">Ephraim Oshry</a>, one of the few European <a href="posek">Jewish legal decisors</a> to survive <a href="the%20Holocaust">the Holocaust</a>, led the congregation from 1952 to 2003.

The congregation's building, a <a href="Gothic%20Revival">Gothic Revival</a> structure built in 1850 as the Norfolk Street Baptist Church and purchased in 1885, was one of the largest synagogues on the Lower East Side. It was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> in 1999. In the late 20th century the congregation dwindled and was unable to maintain the building, which had been damaged by storms. Despite their obtaining funding and grants, the structure was critically endangered.

The synagogue was closed in 2007. The congregation, reduced to around 20 regularly attending members, was sharing facilities with a congregation on <a href="Henry%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Henry Street</a>. The <a href="Lower%20East%20Side%20Conservancy">Lower East Side Conservancy</a> was trying to raise an estimated $4.5 million for repairs of the building, with the intent of converting it to an educational center. In December the leadership of the synagogue under Rabbi Mendel Greenbaum filed a “hardship application” with the <a href="Landmarks%20Preservation%20Commission">Landmarks Preservation Commission</a> seeking permission to demolish the building to make way for a new residential development. This application was withdrawn in March 2013, but the group Friends of the Lower East Side described Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's status as "demolition by neglect".

The abandoned synagogue was "largely destroyed" by a "suspicious" three-alarm fire on May 14, 2017.

Beth Hamedrash Hagodol was founded by <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>an <a href="Jew">Jew</a>s in 1852 as Beth Hamedrash (literally "House of Study", but used colloquially in <a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a> as the term for a <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>). The founding <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>, Abraham Joseph Ash, was born in <a href="Siemiatycze">Siemiatycze</a> (then in <a href="Congress%20Poland">Congress Poland</a>) in 1813 or 1821. He immigrated to New York City in 1851 or 1852. The first Eastern European Orthodox rabbi to serve in the United States, Ash "rejected the <a href="Reform%20Judaism">reformist</a> tendencies of the German Jewish congregations" there. He soon organized a "<a href="minyan">minyan</a>" (prayer quorum) of like-minded Polish Jews, and by 1852 began conducting services. Though the membership consisted mostly of <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Poland">Polish Jews</a>, it also included "<a href="Lithuanian%20Jews">Lithuanians</a>, two <a href="German%20Jews">Germans</a>, and an <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20England">Englishman</a>." For the first six years of the congregation's existence, Ash was not paid for his work as rabbi and instead earned a living as a <a href="peddler">peddler</a>.

The congregation moved frequently in its early years: in 1852 it was located at 83 Bayard Street, then at Elm and <a href="Canal%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Canal</a>, and from 1853 to 1856 in a hall at <a href="Pearl%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Pearl</a> between <a href="Park%20Row%20%28Manhattan%29">Chatham</a> and <a href="Centre%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Centre</a> Streets. In 1856, with the assistance of the <a href="Philanthropy">philanthropist</a> <a href="Sampson%20Simson">Sampson Simson</a> and wealthy <a href="Sephardi%20Jews">Sephardi Jews</a> who sympathized with the traditionalism of the congregation's members, the congregation purchased a <a href="Religion%20in%20Wales">Welsh chapel</a> on <a href="Allen%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Allen Street</a>. The synagogue, which had "a good Hebrew library", was a place both of prayer and <a href="beth%20midrash">study</a>, included a rabbinic family court, and, according to historian and long-time member Judah David Eisenstein, "rapidly became the most important center for Orthodox Jewish guidance in the country."

Synagogue dues were collected by the "<a href="Gabbai">shamash</a>" (the equivalent of a <a href="sexton%20%28office%29">sexton</a> or <a href="Beadle%23Religious%20beadles">beadle</a>), who augmented his salary by working as a <a href="glazier">glazier</a> and running a small food concession stand in the <a href="Vestibule%20%28architecture%29">vestibule</a>. There mourners who came to recite "<a href="kaddish">kaddish</a>" could purchase a piece of <a href="sponge%20cake">sponge cake</a> and small glass of <a href="brandy">brandy</a> for ten cents (today $0).

Beth Hamedrash was the prototypical American synagogue for early <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20the%20United%20States%23Immigration%20of%20Central%20and%20Eastern%20European%20Jews">immigrant Eastern European Jews</a>, who began entering the United States in large numbers only in the 1870s. They found the synagogues of the German Jewish immigrants who preceded them to be unfamiliar, both religiously and culturally. Russian Jews in particular had been more excluded from Russian society than were German Jews from German society, for both linguistic and social reasons. Unlike German Jews, the Jews who founded Beth Hamedrash viewed both religion and the synagogue as central to their lives. They attempted to re-create in Beth Hamedrash the kind of synagogue they had belonged to in Europe.

In 1859, disagreement broke out between Ash and the synagogue's "parnas" (president) Joshua Rothstein over who had been responsible for procuring the Allen Street location, and escalated into a conflict "over the question of official authority and 'honor'". Members took sides in the dispute, which led to synagogue disturbances, a contested election, and eventually to Ash's taking Rothstein to a United States court to try to oust him as president of the congregation. After the court rejected Ash's arguments, a large majority of members left with Ash to form Beth Hamedrash Hagodol ("Great House of Study"), adding the word "Hagodol" ("Great") to the original name.

The followers of Rothstein stayed at the Allen Street location and retained the name "Beth Hamedrash" until the mid-1880s. With membership and financial resources both severely reduced, they were forced to merge with Congregation Holche Josher Wizaner; the combined congregation adopted the name "Kahal Adath Jeshurun", and built the <a href="Eldridge%20Street%20Synagogue">Eldridge Street Synagogue</a>.

According to Eisenstein, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol provided an atmosphere that was "socially religious", in which Jews "combine[d] piety with pleasure; they call[ed] their "<a href="synagogue">shule</a>" a "<a href="Shtiebel">shtibl</a>" or prayer-club room; they desire[d] to be on familiar terms with the Almighty and abhor[red] decorum; they want[ed] everyone present to join and chant the prayers; above all they scorn[ed] a regularly ordained <a href="Hazzan">cantor</a>." In contrast to the informality of the services, members scrupulously observed the <a href="kashrut">Jewish dietary laws</a>, and every member personally oversaw the baking of his "<a href="matzo">matzo</a>s" for use on <a href="Passover">Passover</a>.

The congregation initially moved to the top floor of a building at the corner of <a href="Grand%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Grand</a> and <a href="Forsyth%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Forsyth</a> Streets, and in 1865 moved again, to a former courthouse on Clinton Street. In 1872, the congregation built a synagogue at <a href="Ludlow%20Street">Ludlow</a> and <a href="Hester%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Hester</a> Streets. There the congregation's younger members gained greater control and introduced some minor innovations; for example, changing the title of "parnas" to president, and in 1877 hiring a professional cantor—Judah Oberman—for $500 (today $) per year, to bring greater formality and decorum to the services as well as to attract new members. While somewhat "Americanized", in general the congregation remained quite traditional. Men and women sat separately, the full service in the traditional <a href="siddur">prayer book</a> was followed, and the congregation still trained men for <a href="Semicha">rabbinic ordination</a>. Additionally, <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> and <a href="Mishna">Mishna</a> study groups, founded in the 1870s, were held both mornings and evenings.

Ash had only served as Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's rabbi intermittently during this time; during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> he had briefly been a successful manufacturer of <a href="hoop%20skirt">hoopskirt</a>s, before losing his money, and returning to the rabbinate. Congregants had a number of issues with him, including his outside business ventures and an alleged inclination towards <a href="Hasidic%20Judaism">Hasidism</a>. The more learned members of the congregation contested his scholarship. Ash resigned as rabbi in 1877, and in 1879, directors of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol proposed that a <a href="Chief%20Rabbi">Chief Rabbi</a> be hired for New York. A number of New York City synagogues formed the "United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations", and agreed to select the "<a href="Malbim">Malbim</a>" (Meïr Leibush ben Jehiel Michel Weiser) for the role. The appointment was announced in Philadelphia's "Jewish Record", but the "Malbim" never filled the position. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol re-hired Ash to fill the vacant role of congregational rabbi at a salary of $25 per month (or $300—today $—per year). The following year the congregation hired a new cantor, Simhe Samuelson, for $1,000 (today $) a year, over three times Ash's salary.

The congregation's building at 60-64 Norfolk Street, between <a href="Grand%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Grand Street</a> and Broome Street on the <a href="Lower%20East%20Side">Lower East Side</a>, had originally been the Norfolk Street <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> Church. Founded in 1841 when the Stanton Street Baptist Church congregation split, the members had first worshiped in an existing church building at Norfolk and Broome. In 1848 they officially incorporated and began construction of a new building, which was dedicated in January 1850.

Largely unchanged, the structure was designed in the <a href="Gothic%20Revival%20architecture">Gothic Revival</a> style by an unknown <a href="architect">architect</a>, with <a href="masonry">masonry</a>-bearing walls with timber <a href="Framing%20%28construction%29">framing</a> at the roof and floors, and <a href="brownstone">brownstone</a> <a href="Foundation%20%28engineering%29">foundation</a> walls and exterior door and window trim. The front facade (west, on Norfolk Street) is "<a href="stucco">stucco</a>ed and scored to simulate smooth-faced <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a>", though the other elevations are faced in brick. Window tracery was all in wood. Much of the original work remains on the side elevations. Characteristically Gothic exterior features include "vertical proportions, pointed arched window openings with <a href="Molding%20%28decorative%29">drip moldings</a>, three bay <a href="facade">facade</a> with towers". Gothic interior features include "ribbed <a href="Vault%20%28architecture%29">vaulting</a>" and a "tall and lofty rectangular <a href="nave">nave</a> and <a href="apse">apse</a>." Originally the window over the main door was a circular <a href="rose%20window">rose window</a>, and the two front towers had <a href="crenellation">crenellation</a>s in tracery, instead of the present plain tops. The square windows below are original, but the former <a href="quatrefoil">quatrefoil</a> wooden tracery is gone in many cases. The bandcourse of quatrefoil originally extended across the center section of the facade.

Even as the building was under construction, the ethnic makeup of the church's neighborhood was rapidly changing; native-born Baptists were displaced by <a href="Irish%20Americans%20in%20New%20York%20City">Irish</a> and <a href="German%20American%2319th%20century">German</a> immigrants. As members moved uptown, the congregation decided to follow and sold their building in 1860 to Alanson T. Biggs, a successful local merchant. The departing Baptist congregation founded the <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> Baptist church, then founded the <a href="Park%20Avenue%20%28Manhattan%29">Park Avenue</a> Church, and finally built the <a href="Riverside%20Church">Riverside Church</a>.

Biggs converted the church to one for <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>s, and in 1862, transferred ownership to the Alanson <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist Episcopal Church</a>. The Methodist congregation was successful for a time, with membership peaking at 572 members in 1873. It declined after that, and the church ran into financial difficulties. In 1878 the congregation transferred ownership to the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Church%20Extension%20and%20Missionary%20Society">New York City Church Extension and Missionary Society</a> of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

Founded in 1866, the Church Extension and Missionary Society's mission was "... to promote Churches, Missions, and Sunday-schools in the City of New York." It built or supported Methodist churches primarily in poor areas, or areas that were being developed, including one in the building that would later house the <a href="First%20Roumanian-American%20congregation">First Roumanian-American congregation</a>. Soon after its purchase of the Norfolk Street building, the Church Extension and Missionary Society discovered that the neighborhood had become mostly Jewish and German. By 1884, it realized "the church was too big and costly to maintain", and put it up for sale.

In 1885 Beth Hamedrash Hagodol purchased the building for $45,000 (today $), and made alterations and repairs at a cost of $10,000 (today $), but made no external modifications by the re-opening. Alterations to the interior were generally made to adapt it to synagogue use. These included the additions of an <a href="Ark%20%28synagogue%29">Ark</a> to hold the <a href="Torah">Torah</a> scrolls (replacing the original <a href="pulpit">pulpit</a>), an "<a href="Sanctuary%20lamp%23In%20Jewish%20tradition">eternal light</a>" in front of the ark, and a "<a href="Bema%23Judaism">bimah</a>" (a central elevated platform where the Torah scrolls are read). At some time a <a href="Mechitza">women's gallery</a> was added round three sides of the nave. Interior redecorations included sanctuary ceilings that were "painted a bright blue, studded with stars".

In addition to attracting new and wealthy members, the congregation intended the substantial building to garner prestige and respectability for the relatively new immigrant Jews from Eastern Europe, and to show that Jews on the Lower East Side could be just as "civilized" as the reform-minded Jews of uptown Manhattan. For this reason, a number of other Lower East Side congregations also purchased or built new buildings around this time. They also hired increasingly expensive cantors until, in 1886, Kahal Adath Jeshurun hired P. Minkowsy for the "then-staggering sum of five thousand dollars per annum" (today $). Beth Hamedrash Hagodol responded by recruiting from Europe the famous and highly paid cantor Israel Michaelowsky (or Michalovsky). By 1888 Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's members included "several bankers, lawyers, importers and wholesale merchants, besides a fair sprinkling of the American element."

Though the building had undergone previous alterations—for example, the Church Extension and Missionary Society had "removed deteriorated <a href="parapet">parapet</a>s from the towers" in 1880—it did not undergo significant renovations until the early 1890s. That year the rose window on the front of the building was removed, "possibly because it had Christian motifs", and replaced with a large arched window, still in keeping with the Gothic style. The work was undertaken by the architectural firm of (Ernest) Schneider & (Henry) Herter, German immigrants who had worked on a number of other synagogues, including the <a href="Park%20East%20Synagogue">Park East Synagogue</a>. In 1893 they fixed "serious structural problems", the consequence of neglected maintenance. The work included "stabiliz[ing] the front steps, add[ing] brick <a href="buttress">buttress</a>es to the sides of the church for lateral support, again in a Gothic style, and replac[ing] the original basement columns with six-inch cast iron columns." A later renovation replaced the wooden stairs from the main floor to the basement with iron ones.

Two <a href="Star%20of%20David">Stars of David</a> were added to the center of the facade. One is seen in the old photograph (above left), over a palmette ornament at the top of the window arch. The other, mounted above the top of the gable, remains visible in the modern photograph (top). The unusual cupola-like structure on legs seen above the gable in the old photograph, now gone, was also added by the synagogue, as was the square structure on which it sat. The panel with a large Hebrew inscription over the main doors was added in this period, before the older photograph. The decorations to the upper parts of the central section of the facade survived until at least 1974, as did the tracery to the square windows on the towers; this Gothic ornamentation was removed after it deteriorated.

Ash died in 1887, and the United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations (now called The Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations) began a search for a successor, to serve as rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol and as <a href="Chief%20Rabbi">Chief Rabbi</a> of New York City. This search was opposed by Rabbi <a href="Henry%20Pereira%20Mendes">Henry Pereira Mendes</a>, of <a href="Congregation%20Shearith%20Israel">Congregation Shearith Israel</a>. Mendes felt that the money and energy would be better spent on supporting the <a href="Jewish%20Theological%20Seminary%20of%20America">Jewish Theological Seminary of America</a> (JTSA), which he had co-founded with <a href="Sabato%20Morais">Sabato Morais</a> in 1886. In his view, training American-born rabbis at the Seminary would be a much more effective means of fighting the growing strength of American <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform Judaism</a>: these native English-speaking rabbis would appeal to the younger generation far more than imported, Yiddish-speaking ones.

The Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations rejected Morais's position, and offered the role to a number of "leading East European Orthodox rabbis", all of whom turned it down. They eventually narrowed the field to two candidates, Zvi Rabinovitch and <a href="Jacob%20Joseph">Jacob Joseph</a>. Although Rabinovitch received "massive support" from "leading east European rabbis", the congregation hired Jacob Joseph as the first—and what would turn out to be only—Chief Rabbi of New York City.

Born in <a href="Kra%C5%BEiai">Kroz, Lithuania</a>, Joseph had studied in the <a href="Volozhin%20yeshiva">Volozhin yeshiva</a> under <a href="Naftali%20Zvi%20Yehuda%20Berlin">Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin</a>; he was known there as Rav Yaakov Charif ("Rabbi Jacob Sharp") because of his sharp mind. He was one of the main disciples of <a href="Yisroel%20Salanter">Yisroel Salanter</a>, and in 1883 had been appointed the "<a href="maggid">maggid</a>" (preacher) of <a href="Vilnius">Vilna</a>. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol, the Eldridge Street Synagogue, and 13 other Lower East Side synagogues had raised $2,500 (today $) towards the creation of a European style "<a href="Kehilla%20%28modern%29">kehilla</a>" to oversee New York's Orthodox community, and had imported Joseph in an attempt to achieve that (ultimately unfulfilled) goal. Joseph's salary was to be the then-substantial $2,500 per year, "with an additional $1000 for rent, furnishings, and utilities". Though Joseph's appointment was, in part, intended to bring prestige to the downtown Orthodox congregations, his primary task as Chief Rabbi was to bring order and regulation to New York's chaotic kosher slaughtering industry.

Joseph arrived in New York on July 7, 1888, and later that month preached his inaugural Sabbath <a href="sermon">sermon</a> at Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. The speech attracted a huge crowd, with over 1,500 men crowded into the sanctuary, and thousands more outside. The police had to call extra reinforcements to control the throng, and to escort Joseph into the synagogue. Though he had been chosen, in part, for his "fabulous skills as an orator", his speaking style and sermons, which had been so beloved in Europe, did not impress New York audiences. According to <a href="Abraham%20Cahan">Abraham Cahan</a>, "[S]ome of the very people who drank in his words thirstily in Vilna left the synagogue in the middle of his sermon here."

In October 1888, Joseph made his first significant statement as Chief Rabbi. He issued new regulations for New York's Jewish poultry business, in an attempt to bring it into accordance with Jewish law. The funds for supporting the agency supervising adherence to these regulations were to be raised through an increase in the price of meat and chicken. The affected vendors and consumers, however, refused to pay this levy. They likened it to the "korobka", a tax on meat in Russia they despised, and "organized a mass meeting in January 1889 against 'the imported rabbi'". Joseph never succeeded in organizing the kosher meat business.

Joseph was also unable to stop those who came to hear him speak from <a href="Activities%20prohibited%20on%20Shabbat">desecrating the Sabbath</a>, and his Yiddish sermons had no impact on the younger generation. In addition, he had to contend with a number of obstacles: he had no administrative experience or training, local Orthodox rabbis (particularly Joshua Seigel) and Jews outside his congregation did not accept his authority, and non-Orthodox Jews and groups criticized him. These problems were exacerbated by a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> suffered in 1895, which partially incapacitated him, followed by a relapse in 1900 which left him bedridden.

In the late 19th century, other synagogues in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> often served a particular constituency, typically Jews from a single town in Russia, Poland, or Romania. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol prided itself in welcoming and assisting all Jews, regardless of origins. The synagogue's <a href="Passover">Passover</a> Relief Committee—dedicated to providing funds and food to poor Jews so that they could properly celebrate the holiday of Passover—stated "In dispensing money and matzos to the poor, all are recognized as the children of one Father, and no lines are drawn between natives of different countries." By the turn of the 20th century, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol was distributing approximately $800 (today $) a year to the poor for Passover supplies, compared to a total synagogue income of around $5,000 (today $). This was on top of its average $15 (today $) weekly contributions to the poor, and those of individual congregational members of around $2,000 (today $) per annum. By 1901, annual revenues were around $6,000 (today $), and the congregation had 150 members.

During Joseph's tenure, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol helped found the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America (the "<a href="Orthodox%20Union">Orthodox Union</a>"). In the spring of 1898, 50 lay officials from a number of Orthodox New York synagogues—including <a href="Congregation%20Ohab%20Zedek">Congregation Ohab Zedek</a>, the <a href="Eldridge%20Street%20Synagogue">Eldridge Street Synagogue</a>, Congregation Shearith Israel and Beth Hamedrash Hagodol—convened to create the organization. By the 1980s the Orthodox Union had over 1,000 member congregations.

Joseph served as the synagogue's rabbi from his arrival in the United States in 1888 until his death in 1902 at age 62. During this time, his family slipped into poverty, as he did not receive his salary, which had been based on the anticipated taxes on kosher meats and vendors, and on "matzos". After his death, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol secured the right to bury him in its cemetery by promising his widow $1,500 (today $) and a monthly $15 stipend; in turn, individuals offered the congregation large sums—$5,000 (today $) in one case—for the right to be buried near him. His funeral was attended by up to 100,000 mourners, "clouded by the guilt-driven attempt of New York's Orthodox Jews to honor him for the last time, as partial compensation for the way they treated him during his life."

Joseph was succeeded by Rabbi Shalom Elchanan Jaffe, a founder of the <a href="Union%20of%20Orthodox%20Rabbis">Union of Orthodox Rabbis</a> and a strong supporter of the <a href="Rabbi%20Isaac%20Elchanan%20Theological%20Seminary">Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary</a>. Jaffe, who was born near <a href="Vilnius">Vilna</a>, had, like Joseph, studied at the Volozhin yeshiva, and had received his rabbinic ordination from Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin and <a href="Yitzchak%20Elchanan%20Spektor">Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor</a>. The author of several books of religious commentary, Jaffe was an influential rabbi on the Lower East Side, in part because of his authority over <a href="Hechsher">kosher supervision</a> of New York's butcher stores and <a href="slaughterhouse">slaughterhouse</a>s. He was also a strong <a href="Anti-Zionism">anti-Zionist</a> and "rejoiced when <a href="Theodore%20Herzl">Herzl</a> died".

<a href="Harry%20Fischel">Harry Fischel</a> was the congregation's Vice President until 1902; there he first met and eventually attended the <a href="Bar%20and%20Bat%20Mitzvah">Bar Mitzvah</a> of his future son-in-law, <a href="Herbert%20S.%20Goldstein">Herbert S. Goldstein</a>. Goldstein, who was ordained by Jaffe at the JTSA, founded the Institutional Synagogue in <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>. He is the only person to have been president of the <a href="Orthodox%20Union">Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America</a>, the <a href="Rabbinical%20Council%20of%20America">Rabbinical Council of America</a> (first presidium), and the <a href="Synagogue%20Council%20of%20America">Synagogue Council of America</a>. It was in response to an April 1929 telegram from Goldstein, asking if <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> believed in God, that Einstein stated, "I believe in <a href="Baruch%20Spinoza">Spinoza</a>'s God, who reveals himself in the lawful harmony of the world, not in a God who concerns himself with the fate and actions of human beings."

Beth Hamedrash Hagodol had 175 member families by 1908, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $10,000 (today $). In 1909, the synagogue was the site of a mass meeting to protest the 20th <a href="Central%20Conference%20of%20American%20Rabbis">Central Conference of American Rabbis</a>, described as "the malicious misrepresentation of Judaism by the so-called reformed rabbis in conference in this city", and in 1913 the synagogue was the site of a "historic mass meeting" to raise funds for the first <a href="National%20Council%20of%20Young%20Israel">Young Israel</a> synagogue, at which <a href="Jacob%20Schiff">Jacob Schiff</a> was the guest speaker. Membership had fallen to 110 families by 1919.

Dr. Benjamin Fleischer, a noted <a href="orator">orator</a>, was elected rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol in September 1924. While serving as Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's rabbi he published his 1938 philosophical work "Revaluation. Miscellaneous essays, lectures and discourses on Jewish religious philosophy, ethics and history" and his 1941 military history "From Dan To Megiddo". In May 1939, he and two other rabbis (and a fourth rabbi as secretary) formed the first permanent "<a href="beth%20din">beth din</a>" (court of Jewish law) in the U.S.

In the early-to-mid-20th century the congregation's financial footing was still not sound; though the Norfolk Street building had been purchased in 1885 for $45,000 (and $10,000 in alterations and repairs), in 1921 it still owed $40,000 (today $) on the mortgage. Additional costs were incurred by work done on the building; two years earlier, architect George Dress had rearranged the toilet facilities, in 1934 architect Philip Bardes designed a small brick extension at the building's south-east corner, and in the 1930s or 1940s the walls and four of the five <a href="spandrel">spandrel</a>s in the sanctuary interior were painted with colorful "Eastern European-inspired" pictures and murals of <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> and "<a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a> landscapes and <a href="Tanakh">Biblical</a> scenes". At the end of December 1946, then-president Abraham Greenwald stated that unless $35,000 (today $) were immediately raised for the repair of the building, it would have to be demolished.

<a href="Ephraim%20Oshry">Ephraim Oshry</a>, noted <a href="Torah">Torah</a> scholar and religious leader in the <a href="Kaunas%20Ghetto">Kovno Ghetto</a>, and one of the few European <a href="posek">Jewish legal decisors</a> to survive <a href="The%20Holocaust">The Holocaust</a>, became the synagogue's rabbi in 1952, a post he retained for over 50 years. During the Holocaust the <a href="Nazism">Nazis</a> had made him the custodian of a warehouse that stored Jewish books intended for an exhibit of "artifacts of the extinct Jewish race". He used the books to help him write "<a href="responsa">responsa</a>", answering questions asked of him regarding how Jews could live their lives in accordance with <a href="halakha">Jewish law</a> under the extreme conditions imposed by the Nazis. He also ran "secret nightly worship services", and helped Jews bake "matzos" for Passover, under threat of death if discovered. After the war he founded a <a href="yeshiva">yeshiva</a> for Jewish orphans in Italy, and then another religious school in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, before moving to New York to take up the position of rabbi at Beth Hamedrash Hagodol. There, his Sunday afternoon lectures were so popular that the entire 1,200-seat sanctuary was filled, and the overflow had to sit on the stairs. While rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol, he founded another yeshiva in <a href="Monsey%2C%20New%20York">Monsey, New York</a> for gifted <a href="high%20school">high school</a> aged boys.

The congregation's building was again threatened with demolition in 1967, but Oshry, possibly the first Lower East Side rabbi to recognize the value of landmark designation, was successful in having it designated a <a href="New%20York%20City%20landmark">New York City landmark</a>, thus saving it. At that time the congregation claimed 1,400 members.

In 1974, the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Landmarks%20Preservation%20Commission">New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission</a> applied to have the building added to the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, and considered significant at the <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a> level; on the application the building's condition was described as "excellent". The case was reviewed on June 19, 1974, and the site was deemed ineligible. The building was repainted and repaired in 1977, but in subsequent years deteriorated and suffered damage.

In the summer of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story window at the front of the building, and the window's wooden frame was rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window remained unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the <a href="High%20Holidays">High Holidays</a>. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.

The congregation raised $40,000 in 2000 for emergency repairs, and was awarded a $230,000 grant by the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Office%20of%20Parks%2C%20Recreation%20and%20Historic%20Preservation">New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation</a> for restoration work, including roof repair, but had not been able to raise the matching funds required to receive the grant. On December 6, 2001, a fire and subsequent fire-fighting efforts severely damaged the roof, ceiling, mural paintings and decorative plasterwork.

The <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Historic%20Preservation">National Trust for Historic Preservation</a> designated the building an endangered historic site in 2003, the only synagogue on the list. It still retained a number of significant architectural features, including "the ornate ark and pulpit, central "bimah" (reader's platform) with etched glass lamps, cantilevered balconies, Gothic vaulted ceiling, and colorful wall paintings"; the lighting included "converted <a href="Gas%20lighting">gas fixtures</a>". Features retained from the original construction included Gothic Revival style woodwork and cast-iron railing that follows the lot line, and the original wooden <a href="pew">pew</a>s. That same year Oshry died. His successor – designated by Oshry himself – was his son-in-law, Rabbi Mendl Greenbaum.

By 2006, $1 million of an estimated required $3.5 million had been raised for repairs to the structure. In 2007, Greenbaum made the decision to shut the synagogue down, as its membership had dwindled to around 15. The building was mostly closed to the public as its damaged interior was considered a hazard for visitors. The synagogue, "the home of the oldest Orthodox congregation continuously housed in a single location in New York" sat "padlocked and empty" with holes in the roof and plaster falling from the ceiling. In 2011, the Buildings Department issued a vacate order.

Reportedly, the <a href="Lower%20East%20Side%20Conservancy">Lower East Side Conservancy</a> was trying to raise an estimate $4.5 million for repairs, with the intent of turning the building into an educational center. It was granted $215,000 by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Education">United States Department of Education</a> and was promised an equal amount by the <a href="Lower%20Manhattan%20Development%20Corporation">Lower Manhattan Development Corporation</a>. Several years earlier the Conservancy had also been promised a total of $980,000 from New York State, the City Council, <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York%20City">Mayor</a> <a href="Michael%20Bloomberg">Bloomberg</a>, and the Manhattan <a href="Borough%20President">Borough President</a>'s office, but had yet to receive most of the city funds. The group was also trying to raise $400,000 from private donors for the first phase of the renovation, which would secure the structure and roof. Led by Greenbaum, Beth Hamedrash Hagodol was down to around 20 regularly attending members, and was sharing facilities with a congregation on <a href="Henry%20Street%20%28Manhattan%29">Henry Street</a>.

By the end of 2012 at least a million dollars in grants for repairs to the building had gone unused and were rescinded. In December 2012 the leadership of the synagogue under Greenbaum filed a “hardship application” with the <a href="Landmarks%20Preservation%20Commission">Landmarks Preservation Commission</a> seeking permission to demolish the building to make way for a new residential development. In place of the synagogue, Greenbaum envisioned a 45,000 square foot condo building with room for a small synagogue on the ground floor, and possibly a "<a href="kollel">kollel</a>". This application was withdrawn—at least temporarily—in March 2013, but the group "Friends of the Lower East Side" described Beth Hamedrash Hagodol's status as "demolition by neglect".

On May 14, 2017, shortly after 7 p.m., a <a href="three-alarm%20fire">three-alarm fire</a> broke out in the unused synagogue after what an eyewitness called a "big explosion". The fire was brought under control at around midnight by approximately 150 firefighters – who, during the fire, allowed Rabbi Yehuda Oshry, the son of Ephraim Oshry, to rescue the <a href="Torah">Torah scrolls</a> – but not before it "largely destroyed" the structure. Although still under investigation as of Monday May 15, the fire was said to seem "suspicious" due to surveillance video that showed three young people running from the area just before the fire broke out. The fire brought down the ceiling and walls of the synagogue, creating a pile of rubble. On May 17, three days after the fire, a 14-year-old boy was arrested and charged with setting the fire; the boy's two companions were questioned and released, although they are considered to be witnesses. The Fire Department's investigation into how the fire was started was being held up by the need to install supports in order to safely enter the building. By mid-June, the city's Legal Department was still investigating, and prosecutors had not charged the boy who had been arrested.

In the aftermath of the fire, the synagogue took steps for the possible demolition of the building. The city's <a href="New%20York%20City%20Department%20of%20Buildings">Department of Buildings</a> had determined that the remains of the building was unstable, but would not approve an emergency demolition, so a board member filed an application with the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Landmark%20Preservation%20Commission">New York City Landmark Preservation Commission</a> (LPC) for a general demolition permit, which did not specify how much of the structure was planned to be razed; that will depend on a determination of "structural findings". The synagogue also provided materials to Community Board 3, with a request that their application be heard by an advisory panel. Prior to the fire, Rabbi Mendel Greenbaum had been in discussion with groups such as the Chinese-American Planning Council and the Gotham Organization about selling the building's <a href="air%20rights">air rights</a> in connection with the potential development of a neighboring parcel, to help pay for the possible renovation and preservation of the synagogue. The LPC responded on July 11 with a permit for removal of unsafe parts of the building, but required that other parts be evaluated for possible preservation. The Commission's engineers will monitor the demolition.

1994 Fairchild Air Force Base B-52 crash

On Friday, 24 June 1994, a <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) <a href="Boeing%20B-52%20Stratofortress">Boeing B-52 Stratofortress</a> crashed at <a href="Fairchild%20Air%20Force%20Base">Fairchild Air Force Base</a>, <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington</a>, <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, after its pilot, <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant Colonel</a> Arthur "Bud" Holland, maneuvered the bomber beyond its operational limits and lost control. The B-52 <a href="Stall%20%28flight%29">stalled</a>, fell to the ground and exploded, killing Holland and the three other <a href="Field%20officer%23United%20States">field-grade</a> <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">officers</a> on board the aircraft. In addition, one person on the ground suffered injuries during the accident, but survived. The crash was captured on video and was shown repeatedly on news broadcasts throughout the world.

The subsequent investigation concluded that the crash was attributable primarily to three factors: Holland's personality and behavior; USAF leaders' delayed or inadequate reactions to earlier incidents involving Holland; and the sequence of events during the aircraft's final flight.

The crash is now used in military and civilian aviation environments as a <a href="case%20study">case study</a> in teaching <a href="crew%20resource%20management">crew resource management</a>. It is also often used by the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">U.S. Armed Forces</a> during aviation safety training as an example of the importance of complying with safety regulations and correcting the behavior of anyone who violates safety procedures.

At 07:30 local time (<a href="Pacific%20Time%20Zone">PDT</a>) on 24 June 1994, a USAF B-52H bomber crew stationed at Fairchild Air Force Base prepared to practice an aircraft demonstration flight for an air show which was due to take place the following day. The crew consisted of <a href="Aviator">pilots</a> Lt. Col. Arthur "Bud" Holland Lt. Col. Mark McGeehan (38), <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> Robert Wolff (46), and <a href="weapon%20systems%20officer">weapon systems officer</a>/radar navigator Lt. Col. Ken Huston (41). Holland was the designated <a href="Pilot%20in%20command">aircraft commander</a> for the flight, with McGeehan as the <a href="First%20Officer%20%28civil%20aviation%29">co-pilot</a> and Wolff as a safety observer. Holland was the chief of the <a href="92d%20Air%20Refueling%20Wing">92nd Bomb Wing</a>'s Standardization and Evaluation branch, McGeehan was the commander of the 325th Bomb Squadron, Wolff was the vice commander of the 92nd Bomb Wing, and Huston was the 325th Bomb Squadron's operations officer.

The mission plan for the flight called for a demanding series of low-altitude passes, 60° <a href="banked%20turn%23Banked%20turn%20in%20aeronautics">banked turns</a>, a steep climb, and a <a href="touch-and-go%20landing">touch-and-go landing</a> on Fairchild's Runway 23. The flight was also Wolff's "fini flight"a common tradition in which a retiring USAF aircrew member is met at the airfield by relatives, friends, and coworkers, shortly after landing on his or her final flight, and doused with water. Accordingly, Wolff's wife and many of his close friends were at the airfield to watch the flight and participate in the post-flight ceremony. McGeehan's wife and his two youngest sons were watching the flight from the backyard of McGeehan's living quarters, which were located nearby.

The B-52 aircraft, <a href="callsign">callsign</a> "Czar 52", took off at 13:58 and completed most of the mission's elements without incident. Upon preparing to execute the touch-and-go on Runway 23 at the end of the practice profile, the aircraft was instructed to <a href="go%20around">go around</a> because a <a href="KC-135">KC-135</a> aircraft was on the runway, having just landed. Maintaining an altitude of about 250 feet (75 m) <a href="above%20ground%20level">above ground level</a> (AGL), Holland radioed the <a href="control%20tower">control tower</a> and requested permission to execute a 360° left turn, which was immediately granted by the tower controller.

The B-52 then began the 360° left turn around the tower starting from about the midfield point of the runway. Located just behind the tower was an area of restricted airspace, reportedly because of a <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s storage facility. Apparently to avoid flying through the restricted airspace, Holland flew the aircraft in an extremely tight, steeply banked turn while maintaining the low, AGL altitude. Approximately three-quarters of the way around the turn, at 14:16, the aircraft banked past 90°, descended rapidly, clipped power lines and hit the ground, exploding and killing the four crew members. McGeehan was sitting in an ejection seat, but according to the medical statement, he had only "partially ejected at the time of impact"; it does not state whether he had managed to clear the aircraft. Huston was also sitting in an ejection seat; the medical statement indicated that he had not initiated the ejection sequence. Wolff's seat was not ejection-capable. One airman was injured on the ground observing.

The USAF immediately convened a safety investigation board under the direction of the USAF's Chief of Safety, <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a> Orin L. Godsey. The board released the report of its investigation into the crash on 10 August 1994. A final evaluation of the safety investigation was released on 31 January 1995. An accident investigation board, called an "AFR 110-14 Investigation," released a separate report in 1995. Unlike the USAF safety investigation, which was released only to <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">U.S. Department of Defense</a> personnel, the AFR 110-14 report was released to the general public.

The AFR 110-14 investigation identified several factors which contributed to the crash, including the actual crash sequence, the personality and earlier behavior of Bud Holland, previous supervision and lack of corrective action exercised by USAF officers over Bud Holland, mission planning and execution, and other environmental and human factors.

The investigation found that as the B-52 entered its final turn sequence around the tower, its <a href="airspeed%20indicator">airspeed indicator</a> (ASI) was showing . Although Holland increased the engine power after starting the turn, his input came too late to maintain the aircraft's <a href="airspeed">airspeed</a>, as the B-52 <a href="turbofan">turbofan</a> engines take up to eight seconds to <a href="Throttle%20response">respond to throttle commands</a>. The ASI was available to all four aircrew members, but they allowed the aircraft's airspeed to continue decreasing. Eight seconds before impact, the airspeed had dropped to and the aircraft's bank angle had increased beyond 60°. This was the point at which Holland or McGeehan applied full right <a href="Spoiler%20%28aeronautics%29">spoiler</a>, right <a href="rudder">rudder</a>, and nose-up <a href="Elevator%20%28aircraft%29">elevator</a>; however, due to the reduction in airspeed the aircraft entered a <a href="Stall%20%28flight%29%23Accelerated%20and%20turning%20flight%20stall">turning flight stall</a> (also called an "accelerated stall"), which is a stall that occurs at a higher airspeed than the design stall speed – which itself always refers to straight and level flight – because of the fact that the aircraft is turning. Due to the bank angle of at least 60°, the stall speed for the aircraft at that moment was . Hence, as it was flying 2 knots below the stall speed, the aircraft stalled, with insufficient altitude to recover before striking the ground.
The accident board stated that Colonel Holland's macho, daredevil personality significantly influenced the crash sequence. USAF personnel testified that Holland had developed a reputation as an aggressive pilot who often broke flight-safety and other rules. The rule-breaking included flying below minimum-clearance altitudes and exceeding bank-angle limitations and climb rates.

An earlier incident occurred in 1991 when a piloted by Holland performed a circle above a softball game in which Holland's daughter was participating. Beginning at 2,500 feet (760 m) AGL, Holland's aircraft executed the circle at 65° of bank. In a maneuver described by one witness as a "death spiral," the nose of the aircraft continued to drop and the bank angle increased to 80°. After losing 1,000 feet (300 m) of altitude, Holland was able to regain control of the aircraft.

On 19 May 1991, Holland was the command pilot of the demonstration flight at the Fairchild air show. During the demonstration, Holland's aircraft violated several safety regulations; he exceeded bank and pitch limits, flew directly over the air show spectators, and possibly violated altitude restrictions. The base and <a href="Wing%20%28air%20force%20unit%29">wing</a> commander, Colonel Arne Weinman, along with his staff, observed the demonstration, but apparently took no action.

On 12 July 1991, Holland commanded a for a <a href="Flypast">"flyover"</a> during a change-of-command ceremony for the <a href="325th%20Bomb%20Squadron">325th Bomb Squadron</a> at Fairchild. During both the practice and the actual flyover, Holland's aircraft flew at altitudes below 100 feet (30 m) – well below the established minimum altitude – flew steeply banked turns in excess of 45°, exceeded pitch-angle limits, and executed a <a href="wingover">wingover</a>. Although not specifically prohibited, the wingover was not recommended because it could damage the aircraft. After witnessing the flyover, Colonel Weinman and his deputy commander for operations (DO), Colonel Julich, orally reprimanded Holland, but took no formal action.

At the Fairchild air show on 17 May 1992, Holland was again the command pilot of the aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's aircraft again violated various safety regulations, including several low-altitude steep turns in excess of 45° of bank and a high-pitch-angle climb, estimated at over 60° nose high which Holland finished with a wingover maneuver. The new wing commander, Colonel Michael G. Ruotsala, apparently took no action. One week later, the new DO, Colonel Capotosti, on his own initiative warned Holland that if he violated any more safety regulations, Capotosti would ground him (remove him from flying status). Capotosti did not document his warning to Holland or take any other kind of formal action.

On 14 and 15 April 1993, Holland was the mission commander of a two-ship training mission to a bombing range near <a href="Guam">Guam</a> in the Pacific Ocean. During the mission, Holland flew his closer to the other than regulations allowed. Holland also asked his navigator to videotape the bombs falling from the aircraft from inside the <a href="bomb%20bay">bomb bay</a>, also against regulations. Holland's navigator later brought the video to the attention of three Fairchild USAF officers. The first, Lieutenant Colonel Bullock, the current <a href="325th%20Bomb%20Squadron">325th Bomb Squadron</a> commander, did nothing about it and may have even tried to use the videotape as leverage to coerce the navigator into accepting a position as mission scheduler for the wing. The second, the deputy operations group commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harper, told the crew member to conceal the evidence. The third, the DO, allegedly responded to reports of the video by stating, "Okay, I don't want to know anything about that video—I don't care."

At the Fairchild air show on 8 August 1993, Holland once again commanded the demonstration flight. As before, the demonstration profile included bank angles of greater than 45°, low-altitude passes, and another high pitch climbing maneuver, this time in excess of 80° nose high. The climb was so steep that fuel flowed out through the vent holes from the aircraft's wing tanks. The new wing commander, Brigadier General James M. Richards, and the new DO, Colonel William E. Pellerin, both witnessed the demonstration, but neither took any action.

On 10 March 1994, Holland commanded a single-aircraft training mission to the <a href="Yakima%20Bombing%20Range">Yakima Bombing Range</a>, to provide an authorized photographer an opportunity to document the aircraft as it dropped training munitions. The minimum aircraft altitude permitted for that area was 500 feet (150 m) AGL; during the mission, Holland's aircraft was filmed crossing one ridgeline about 30 feet (10 m) above the ground. Fearing for their safety, the photography crew ceased filming and took cover as Holland's aircraft again passed low over the ground, this time estimated as clearing the ridgeline by only three feet (1 m). The co-pilot on Holland's aircraft testified that he grabbed the controls to prevent Holland from flying the aircraft into the ridge while the aircraft's other two aircrew members repeatedly screamed at Holland: "Climb! Climb!" Holland responded by laughing and calling one of the crew members "a pussy".

After that mission, the crew decided that they would never again fly with Holland and reported the incident to the bomb squadron leadership. The USAF squadron commander, Lieutenant Colonel Mark McGeehan, reported the incident to Pellerin and recommended that Holland be removed from flying duty. Pellerin consulted with Holland and gave him an oral reprimand and warning not to repeat the behavior, but refused to take him off flying duty. Pellerin also did not document the incident or the reprimand, nor did he notify his superiors, who remained unaware of the incident. McGeehan then decided that in order to protect his aircrews, he (McGeehan) would be the co-pilot on any future missions in which Holland was the command pilot. Evidence suggests that after this incident, "considerable animosity" existed between Holland and McGeehan.
In preparation for the 1994 Fairchild air show, Holland was again selected as the command pilot for the demonstration flight. On 15 June 1994, Holland briefed the new wing commander, Colonel William Brooks, on the proposed flight plan. Holland's demonstration profile violated numerous regulations, including steep bank angles, low-altitude passes, and steep pitch attitudes. Brooks ordered Holland not to exceed 45° bank angle or 25° pitch attitude during the demonstration. During the first practice session, on 17 June, Holland repeatedly violated these orders. Brooks witnessed this, but took no action. Pellerin flew with Holland on that flight and reported to Brooks that, "the profile looks good to him; looks very safe, well within parameters." The next practice flight on 24 June ended with the fatal crash.

The demonstration profile designed by Holland included a 360° turn around Fairchild's control tower, a maneuver which he had not attempted in previous air show demonstrations. During the final flight, Holland performed a series of 60° banked turns and a 68° pitch climb in violation of Brooks' orders. There is no evidence to suggest that either McGeehan or Wolff attempted to intervene as Holland carried out these dangerous maneuvers.

Pellerin was originally scheduled to fly in this mission, as he had done on the 17 June flight, but he was unavailable for the 24 June flight and Wolff was selected as the replacement aircrew member. Due to the short notice of his assignment to the mission, Wolff did not participate in the pre-flight briefing and boarded the aircraft after the engines were started. He was therefore unaware of the planned mission profile and had no opportunity to raise any objections before take-off.

All of the four aircrew involved in the crash had only limited flying time in the months before the crash. It would appear that none of them had noticed that the aircraft had stalled until shortly before impact, as indicated by a failure to apply standard recovery techniques to the aircraft once it entered the stall. The investigation reported that even if the proper stall recovery techniques had been applied, it was unlikely that the accident could have been prevented as the aircraft was already flying too low to be recovered.

Four days before the accident, on 20 June, an emotionally disturbed ex-USAF serviceman named <a href="Dean%20Mellberg">Dean Mellberg</a> had entered Fairchild's hospital, fatally shooting five people and wounding many more before being killed by a <a href="Air%20Force%20Security%20Forces">security policeman</a>. The crime was a major distraction for personnel stationed at Fairchild for some time afterwards.

The accident investigation concluded that the crash was primarily attributable to Holland's personality and behavior, USAF leaders' inadequate reactions to the previous incidents involving Holland, and the sequence of events and aircrew response during the final flight of the aircraft. Holland's disregard for procedures governing the safe operation of the B-52 aircraft that he commanded and the absence of firm and consistent corrective action by his superior officers allowed Holland to believe that he could conduct his flight in an unsafe manner, culminating with the slow, steeply banked, 360° turn around the control tower.

The other environmental factors involved, including the addition of a new maneuver (the 360° turn around the tower), inadequate pre-flight involvement of Colonel Wolff, and the distractions from the <a href="Fairchild%20Air%20Force%20Base%231994%20shooting%20incident">base shooting</a> four days prior, combined with Holland's unsafe and risk-taking piloting behavior to produce conditions favorable for the crash to occur. The final factor, according to the USAF investigation report, was the wind and its effect on the maneuvers required to achieve the intended flightpath in relation to the ground.

On 19 May 1995, Pellerin pleaded guilty at a USAF <a href="court-martial">court-martial</a> proceeding to two counts of <a href="dereliction%20of%20duty">dereliction of duty</a> for his actions, or lack thereof, that contributed to the crash. He was sentenced to forfeit $1,500 of salary a month for five months and received a written reprimand. The USAF did not reveal whether any other officer involved in the chain of events leading to the crash received any type of administrative or disciplinary action. Critics of USAF's safety record stated that this crash was an example of a pattern of problems related to enforcement of safety procedures within USAF.

Although the accident investigation found that procedures and policies were supposedly already in place to prevent such a crash from occurring again, the fact that this crash occurred showed that in at least one instance, the existing safety policies and their enforcement had been grievously inadequate. To re-emphasize the importance of adherence to existing safety policies and correcting the actions of anyone violating them at any time, the USAF quickly distributed the findings of the accident investigation throughout the service. These measures failed to prevent – sixteen years later – the occurrence in almost identical circumstances of another accident, when a <a href="2010%20Alaska%20C-17%20crash">C-17 transport aircraft crashed</a> shortly after taking off from Elmendorf Air Force Base, Alaska, on an aerial-display practice flight.

Today, the Fairchild crash is used in both military- and civilian-aviation environments, as a training aid in teaching <a href="crew%20resource%20management">crew resource management</a> and to show the importance of enforcing safety regulations.

Several years after his death, Lt. Col. McGeehan was recognized with an award by the Lou Holtz/Upper Ohio Valley Hall of Fame in <a href="East%20Liverpool%2C%20Ohio">East Liverpool, Ohio</a>, for his lifetime of service. The citation included the following:
Footage of the Fairchild crash was used in the making of the 2015 film "<a href="Project%20Almanac">Project Almanac</a>", depicting an airline accident, which sparked public anger among relatives of Wolff and McGeehan. After an initial claim by <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> that the video in question was of a <a href="FedEx%20Express%20Flight%2080">2009 Tokyo crash</a>, producer <a href="Michael%20Bay">Michael Bay</a> issued an apology to the families, and the footage was removed from the film's theatrical release and associated trailers at Bay's request.

George Washington (inventor)

George Constant Louis Washington (May 20, 1871 – March 29, 1946) was a <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>-born American <a href="inventor">inventor</a> and businessman. He is best remembered for his invention of an early <a href="instant%20coffee">instant coffee</a> process and for the company he founded to <a href="mass%20production">mass-produce</a> it, the G. Washington Coffee Company.

An <a href="emigration">emigrant</a> from his native Belgium, he arrived in the New York area in 1897 and dabbled in several technical fields before hitting upon instant coffee manufacture during a sojourn in <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a> in 1906 or 1907. He began selling his coffee in 1909 and founded a company to manufacture it in 1910. Based in New York and <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, his company prospered and became an important military supplier during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The company's products were also advertised in New York newspapers and on the radio. The success of his company made Washington wealthy, and he lived in a mansion in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> and then moved to a country estate in New Jersey in 1927. In that same year, he lost a dispute with the tax authorities. Washington was married and had three children.

Washington's company was sold to <a href="American%20Home%20Products">American Home Products</a> in 1943, shortly before his death. Though the coffee brand was discontinued by 1961, Washington's name is still used today in the product G. Washington's Seasoning & Broth.

George Washington was born in <a href="Kortrijk">Kortrijk</a>, Belgium to Jean Guillaume Washington (John William Washington) of England and Marie Louise Tant of Belgium, on May 20, 1871. Following then-current <a href="nationality%20law">nationality law</a>, which considered fatherhood primary, Washington was a British subject until he was naturalized as an American in May 1918. At least six siblings in the family also settled in different parts of the United States and Central America. A number of accounts claim a relation to U.S. President <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, but this is not clearly explained.

Washington came to reside in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> and also attained a degree in chemistry at the <a href="University%20of%20Bonn">University of Bonn</a> in Germany. In December 1895, Washington married Angeline Céline Virginie (later, just "Lina") Van Nieuwenhuyse (born 1876), also from Belgium. The US Census of 1900 records that Lina, like her husband, had English and Belgian ancestry (a Belgian father and an English mother). The Washingtons' arrival in the United States on a ship from <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a>, Belgium, on October 6, 1896, was recorded at <a href="Ellis%20Island">Ellis Island</a>, though the 1900 US Census states that they emigrated to the United States in 1897. The Washingtons settled in the New York area, where they had three children: Louisa Washington (born May 1897), Irene Washington (born May 1898), and George Washington Jr. (born August 1899).

After arriving in the New York area, Washington founded a company producing kerosene <a href="gas%20mantle">gas mantle</a>s. At this time, they lived in <a href="New%20Brighton%2C%20Staten%20Island">New Brighton</a> on <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a>, but his company, George Washington Lighting Company, was based in nearby <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City</a>. This business was abandoned with the maturation of <a href="incandescent%20light%20bulb">incandescent light bulb</a> technology. Washington also had a camera company for a time. By the time of the <a href="1900%20US%20Census">1900 US Census</a>, Washington, recorded in the census as an inventor, was 29 years old and living in a rented house in Brooklyn with his 23-year-old wife, their three young children, his younger sister (age 25), three servants, and a child of two of the servants.

Washington tried his hand at cattle <a href="ranch">ranch</a>ing in <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a> in 1906 or 1907 while, in the meantime, developed his instant coffee process. Washington returned to New York City after only a period of about a year in Guatemala, and then began pursuing the main part of his career in coffee manufacture. His father remained in Guatemala and died there in 1912.

After his coffee business was established in 1910, Washington resided at a <a href="Park%20Slope">Park Slope</a> mansion, occupying half of a <a href="city%20block">city block</a>, at 47 Prospect Park West in Brooklyn, and also at an 18-bedroom country home, later known as "Washington Lodge", on a 40-acre waterfront estate at 287 South Country Road in Brookhaven, New York, near <a href="Bellport%2C%20New%20York">Bellport</a> in <a href="Suffolk%20County%2C%20New%20York">Suffolk County</a>, which included the largest concrete <a href="swimming%20pool">swimming pool</a> in New York at the time. Two attempted sales of the property, one in May 1926 for $150,000 and another in 1927, fell through. In 1938, Washington's younger sister, Mrs. Kenneth Merkel, along with her husband and son, moved to the estate on South Country Road. George Washington continued to own his estate until January 1943 when it was sold to Nathan Edelstein. The Washington Lodge was then operated as a hotel and restaurant, and large wedding receptions were held there. Washington Lodge was sold to Murray Wunderlich in 1950 and after 1952 was operated as a children's camp. In 1959, there was an attempt to have the estate rezoned so that it could again be used for a hotel. The Washington Lodge was sold to the Catholic <a href="Marist%20Brothers">Marist Brothers</a> of the Schools as a summer retreat in 1960, and beginning in September 1970 was leased to the Bay Community School during the school year. Recently, the Washington Lodge estate was divided, and there have been conservation projects by local nonprofits and Bellport resident <a href="Isabella%20Rossellini">Isabella Rossellini</a>. The "Washington Lodge" building there still stands, though its future use is uncertain.

With his company's relocation to New Jersey, following the purchase of land there in 1927, he moved to the former estate of Governor <a href="Franklin%20Murphy%20%28governor%29">Franklin Murphy</a> at "Franklin Farms" in <a href="Mendham%20Borough%2C%20New%20Jersey">Mendham</a>.
Washington was a lover of exotic animals, as well as gardening. He maintained extensive <a href="menagerie">menagerie</a>s on his country properties, first at Bellport, and later at Mendham. On Long Island, it is reported that he was often seen with a bird or monkey on his shoulder. At both his menageries, Washington specialized in rare birds, but such animals as <a href="deer">deer</a>, <a href="sheep">sheep</a>, <a href="goat">goat</a>s, and <a href="antelope">antelope</a> are also recorded at Bellport, and deer, <a href="llama">llama</a>s, and <a href="zebra">zebra</a>s are recorded among the hundreds of animals in the larger space at Mendham. Socially, he was an active member of the <a href="Lotos%20Club">Lotos Club</a>, a literary <a href="gentlemen%27s%20club%20%28traditional%29">gentlemen's club</a> in New York City.

Washington's name was briefly put forward for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201920">1920 presidential election</a> in <a href="South%20Dakota">South Dakota</a>'s preference primary for the "American Party", although papers were filed too late to be valid. There is no indication, however, that the nomination was serious. George Washington would not have been eligible for that office, in any case, as he was foreign-born. There have been several "American Party"s in history—it is unclear if the nomination was a particular satire on any so-named movement at the time.

George Washington held over two dozen <a href="patent">patent</a>s, in the fields of <a href="kerosene%20lamp">hydrocarbon lamps</a>, <a href="camera">camera</a>s, and <a href="food%20processing">food processing</a>. He was not the first to invent an instant coffee process, David Strang in New Zealand had the first patent in 1890 (Number 3518) for instant or soluble coffee and was sold under the name Strangs Coffee, another was chemist <a href="Satori%20Kato">Satori Kato</a>'s work was a precursor, among others, but Washington's invention was the first effort that led to large scale commercial manufacture. There is some suggestion that he was inspired by seeing dried powder on the edge of a silver <a href="coffee%20pot">coffee pot</a> while in Guatemala. Federico Lehnhoff Wyld, a German-Guatemalan doctor, along with Eduardo T. Cabarrus, also developed an instant coffee process about this time, which he later marketed in Europe; as Wyld was Washington's personal physician, there is some suggestion that their discoveries were not independent.

Washington's product was first marketed as Red E Coffee (a pun on "ready") in 1909, and the G. Washington Coffee Refining Company was founded in 1910. Washington's first production plant was at 147 41st Street in Brooklyn's <a href="Bush%20Terminal">Bush Terminal</a> industrial complex. The company later moved operations to New Jersey, acquiring the land for the new plant at 45 East Hanover Avenue in <a href="Morris%20Plains%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morris Plains</a> in 1927.

Advertising for the company's product often emphasized its supposed convenience, modernity, and purity. It was claimed to be better for digestion, and even that the "pure" coffee did not have the wakefulness effect of coffee from ground beans (a direct effect of <a href="caffeine">caffeine</a> content, present in both forms). After <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> ended, the American military's use of the coffee became another selling point. A different avenue for promotion came when the company sponsored "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes" radio series on NBC and its <a href="Blue%20Network">Blue Network</a> from 1930 to 1935, which started with <a href="Dr.%20Watson">Dr. Watson</a> welcoming listeners to his recollections told by "a blazing fire and a cup of G Washington brewing." Other radio sponsorships were for "<a href="O.%20Henry">O'Henry</a> Stories" (1932, NBC Blue), "<a href="Professor%20Quiz">Professor Quiz</a>" (1936, CBS), "<a href="Uncle%20Jim%27s%20Question%20Bee">Uncle Jim's Question Bee</a>" (1936–39, NBC Blue), and "Surprise Party" (1946–47, CBS).

But the early instant coffee was also often considered of poor quality, of disagreeable taste, and little more than a novelty product.

Washington experienced some <a href="corporate%20tax">tax</a> trouble with <a href="Federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal authorities</a>, concerning the financial relationship between himself and his company. In November 1918, he contracted with the company for the use of his <a href="trade%20secret">trade secret</a>s in the manufacture of the coffee, and a month later gave a four-fifths stake in this to his immediate family. The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family members' income, and the case went first to the Board of Tax Appeals, and then to the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Court of Appeals</a>, which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two-to-one decision. A petition to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a> was not accepted.

Washington's son, <a href="George%20Washington%2C%20Jr.">George Washington, Jr.</a>, served for a time as treasurer of his father's company, and, like his father, dabbled in invention, patenting a widely used <a href="photoengraving">photoengraving</a> process for newspapers that was introduced by <a href="Fairchild%20Camera%20and%20Instrument">Fairchild Camera and Instrument</a> in 1948.

Washington's at-that-time unique product saw major use as <a href="combat%20ration">combat ration</a>s in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Coffee consumption on the battlefield was seen as valuable since it gave soldiers a caffeine boost. E.F. Holbrook, the head of the coffee section of the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">U.S. War Department</a> at the time, also considered it an important aid in recovery from <a href="sulfur%20mustard">mustard gas</a>. It was employed by the <a href="Canadian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Canadian Expeditionary Force</a> from 1914 until the <a href="American%20Expeditionary%20Force">American Expeditionary Force</a> entered the war in 1917, and all production was <a href="war%20economy">shifted toward American military use</a>. New, smaller producers also sprung up to meet the incredible level of demand from the Army, which in the final period of the war was six times the national supply.

The instant coffee achieved some popularity with the soldiers, who <a href="military%20slang">nicknamed it</a> a "cup of George." As the prime attraction was the caffeine boost, rather than the flavor, it was sometimes drunk cold.

American emergency rations in World War I consisted of a quarter <a href="ounce">ounce</a> (7 <a href="gram">gram</a>s) packet of double-strength instant coffee, packed one per man in containers with multiple types of foods meant for twenty-four men. Instant coffee was also used in reserve rations and <a href="trench%20warfare">trench</a> rations. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the <a href="Military%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. military</a> again relied on Washington, but this time on an equal footing with the other major instant coffee brands that had emerged in the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>, most notably <a href="Nescaf%C3%A9">Nescafé</a>, as well as the new companies formed to meet a renewed military demand.

The G. Washington Coffee Refining Company was purchased by <a href="American%20Home%20Products">American Home Products</a> in 1943, and George Washington retired. The purchase of the company, which was mostly held by the family, was in exchange for 29,860 <a href="share%20%28finance%29">shares</a> (approx. $1.7 million) of American Home Products <a href="stock">stock</a>, at a time when American Home Products was in a period of intense buying, purchasing 34 companies in eight years. Clarence Mark, general manager of "G. Washington", succeeded Washington in running the merged unit.

In Washington's final years, he sold the "Franklin Farms" property, and lived in a home on New Vernon Road in Mendham.

He died three years after his company was sold, on March 29, 1946 in <a href="Mendham%20Township%2C%20New%20Jersey">Mendham, New Jersey</a>, after an illness, at the age of 74. His funeral was held three days later.

G. Washington coffee was discontinued as a brand by 1961, when Washington's New Jersey plant was sold to Tenco, by then a division of <a href="The%20Coca-Cola%20Company">The Coca-Cola Company</a>. The last remnant of the brand survives in G. Washington's Seasoning & Broth, a sideline developed in 1938. This brand was sold by American Home Products in 2000, and, after passing through a couple of intermediaries, has been run by Homestat Farm, Ltd. since 2001.

Polish culture during World War II

Polish culture during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> was suppressed by the <a href="Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29">occupying powers</a> of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, both of whom were hostile to <a href="Poland">Poland</a>'s <a href="Poles">people</a> and <a href="Polish%20culture">cultural heritage</a>. Policies aimed at <a href="cultural%20genocide">cultural genocide</a> resulted in the deaths of thousands of scholars and artists, and the theft and destruction of innumerable cultural artifacts. The "maltreatment of the Poles was one of many ways in which the Nazi and Soviet regimes had grown to resemble one another", wrote British historian <a href="Niall%20Ferguson">Niall Ferguson</a>.

The occupiers looted and destroyed much of Poland's cultural and historical heritage, while persecuting and murdering members of the Polish <a href="intelligentsia">cultural elite</a>. Most <a href="education%20in%20Poland">Polish schools</a> were closed, and those that remained open saw their <a href="Curriculum">curricula</a> altered significantly.

Nevertheless, underground organizations and individuals – in particular the <a href="Polish%20Underground%20State">Polish Underground State</a> – saved much of Poland's most valuable cultural treasures, and worked to salvage as many cultural institutions and artifacts as possible. The <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> and wealthy individuals contributed to the survival of some artists and their works. Despite severe retribution by the Nazis and Soviets, Polish underground cultural activities, including publications, concerts, live theater, education, and academic research, continued throughout the war.

In 1795 Poland ceased to exist as a <a href="sovereign">sovereign</a> nation and throughout the 19th century <a href="Partitions%20of%20Poland">remained partitioned</a> by degrees between Prussian, Austrian and Russian empires. Not until the end of World War I was <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">independence restored</a> and the nation reunited, although the drawing of boundary lines was, of necessity, a <a href="Polish%20Corridor">contentious issue</a>. Independent Poland lasted for only 21 years before it was again attacked and divided among foreign powers.

On 1 September 1939, <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20Poland">Germany invaded Poland</a>, initiating <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> in Europe, and on 17 September, pursuant to the <a href="Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop%20Pact">Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</a>, <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Poland%20%281939%29">Poland was invaded by the Soviet Union</a>. Subsequently, Poland was <a href="Partitions%20of%20Poland%23%26quot%3BFourth%20Partition%26quot%3B">partitioned again</a> – between these two powers – and remained under <a href="Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29">occupation</a> for most of the war. By 1 October, Germany and the Soviet Union had completely overrun Poland, although the Polish government never formally surrendered, and the <a href="Polish%20Underground%20State">Polish Underground State</a>, subordinate to the <a href="Polish%20government-in-exile">Polish government-in-exile</a>, was soon formed. On 8 October, Nazi Germany <a href="Polish%20areas%20annexed%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">annexed the western areas of pre-war Poland</a> and, in the remainder of the occupied area, established the <a href="General%20Government">General Government</a>. The Soviet Union had to temporarily give up the territorial gains it made in 1939 due to the <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">German invasion of the Soviet Union</a>, but <a href="Territories%20of%20Poland%20annexed%20by%20the%20Soviet%20Union">permanently re-annexed</a> much of this territory after <a href="Lvov%E2%80%93Sandomierz%20Offensive">winning it back in mid-1944</a>. Over the course of the war, Poland lost over 20% of its pre-war population amid an occupation that marked the end of the <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Second Polish Republic</a>.

Germany's policy toward the Polish nation and its culture evolved during the course of the war. Many German officials and military officers were initially not given any clear guidelines on the treatment of Polish cultural institutions, but this quickly changed. Immediately following the invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Nazi German government implemented the first stages (the "small plan") of "<a href="Generalplan%20Ost">Generalplan Ost</a>". The basic policy was outlined by the Berlin <a href="Office%20of%20Racial%20Policy">Office of Racial Policy</a> in a document titled "Concerning the Treatment of the Inhabitants of the Former Polish Territories, from a Racial-Political Standpoint". <a href="Slavs">Slavic people</a> living east of the pre-war German border were to be <a href="Germanized">Germanized</a>, <a href="slavery">enslaved</a> or eradicated, depending on whether they lived in the territories directly annexed into the German state or in the <a href="General%20Government">General Government</a>.

Much of the German policy on Polish culture was formulated during a meeting between the governor of the General Government, <a href="Hans%20Frank">Hans Frank</a>, and Nazi Minister of Propaganda <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>, at <a href="%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">Łódź</a> on 31 October 1939. Goebbels declared that "The Polish nation is not worthy to be called a cultured nation". He and Frank agreed that opportunities for the Poles to experience their culture should be severely restricted: no theaters, cinemas or cabarets; no access to radio or press; and no education. Frank suggested that the Poles should periodically be shown films highlighting the achievements of the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a> and should eventually be addressed only by <a href="megaphone">megaphone</a>. During the following weeks Polish schools beyond middle vocational levels were closed, as were theaters and many other cultural institutions. The only <a href="Polish%20language">Polish-language</a> newspaper published in occupied Poland was also closed, and the arrests of Polish intellectuals began.

In March 1940, all cultural activities came under the control of the General Government's Department of People's Education and Propaganda ("Abteilung für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda"), whose name was changed a year later to the "Chief Propaganda Department" ("Hauptabteilung Propaganda"). Further directives issued in the spring and early summer reflected policies that had been outlined by Frank and Goebbels during the previous autumn. One of the Department's earliest decrees prohibited the organization of all but the most "primitive" of cultural activities without the Department's prior approval. Spectacles of "low quality", including those of an <a href="erotic">erotic</a> or <a href="pornographic">pornographic</a> nature, were however an exception—those were to be popularized to appease the population and to show the world the "real" Polish culture as well as to create the impression that Germany was not preventing Poles from expressing themselves. German propaganda specialists invited critics from neutral countries to specially organized "Polish" performances that were specifically designed to be boring or pornographic, and presented them as typical Polish cultural activities. Polish-German cooperation in cultural matters, such as joint public performances, was strictly prohibited. Meanwhile, a compulsory registration scheme for writers and artists was introduced in August 1940. Then, in October, the printing of new Polish-language books was prohibited; existing titles were censored, and often confiscated and withdrawn.

In 1941, German policy evolved further, calling for the complete destruction of the <a href="Poles">Polish people</a>, whom the Nazis regarded as "subhumans" ("<a href="Untermensch">Untermensch</a>en"). Within ten to twenty years, the Polish territories under German occupation were to be entirely cleared of ethnic Poles and settled by German <a href="colonialism">colonists</a>.
The policy was relaxed somewhat in the final years of occupation (1943–44), in view of German military defeats and the approaching <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28WWII%29">Eastern Front</a>. The Germans hoped that a more lenient cultural policy would lessen unrest and weaken the Polish Resistance. Poles were allowed back into those museums that now supported German propaganda and indoctrination, such as the newly created <a href="Chopin">Chopin</a> museum, which emphasized the composer's invented German roots. Restrictions on education, theater and music performances were eased.

Given that the <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Second Polish Republic</a> was a <a href="Historical%20demographics%20of%20Poland%23Second%20Polish%20Republic%20%281918%E2%80%931939%29">multicultural state</a>, German policies and propaganda also sought to create and encourage conflicts between ethnic groups, fueling tension between Poles and Jews, and between Poles and Ukrainians. In <a href="%C5%81%C3%B3d%C5%BA">Łódź</a>, the Germans forced Jews to help destroy a monument to a Polish hero, <a href="Tadeusz%20Ko%C5%9Bciuszko">Tadeusz Kościuszko</a>, and filmed them committing the act. Soon afterward, the Germans set fire to a Jewish <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a> and filmed Polish bystanders, portraying them in propaganda releases as a "vengeful mob." This divisive policy was reflected in the Germans' decision to destroy Polish education, while at the same time, showing relative tolerance toward the Ukrainian school system. As the <a href="Gauleiter">high-ranking Nazi official</a> <a href="Erich%20Koch">Erich Koch</a> explained, "We must do everything possible so that when a Pole meets a Ukrainian, he will be willing to kill the Ukrainian and conversely, the Ukrainian will be willing to kill the Pole."

In 1939, as the occupation regime was being established, the Nazis confiscated Polish state property and much private property. Countless art objects were <a href="Nazi%20plunder%23Poland">looted</a> and taken to Germany, in line with a plan that had been drawn up well in advance of the invasion. The looting was supervised by experts of the "<a href="SS">SS</a>"-"<a href="Ahnenerbe">Ahnenerbe</a>", "<a href="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a>" units, who were responsible for art, and by experts of "<a href="Haupttreuhandstelle%20Ost">Haupttreuhandstelle Ost</a>", who were responsible for more mundane objects. Notable items plundered by the Nazis included the <a href="Altar%20of%20Veit%20Stoss">Altar of Veit Stoss</a> and paintings by <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>, <a href="Leonardo%20da%20Vinci">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, <a href="Canaletto">Canaletto</a> and <a href="Bacciarelli">Bacciarelli</a>. Most of the important art pieces had been "secured" by the Nazis within six months of September 1939; by the end of 1942, German officials estimated that "over 90%" of the art previously in Poland was in their possession. Some art was shipped to German museums, such as the planned "<a href="F%C3%BChrermuseum">Führermuseum</a>" in <a href="Linz">Linz</a>, while other art became the private property of Nazi officials. Over 516,000 individual art pieces were taken, including 2,800 paintings by European painters; 11,000 works by Polish painters; 1,400 sculptures, 75,000 manuscripts, 25,000 maps, and 90,000 books (including over 20,000 printed before 1800); as well as hundreds of thousands of other objects of artistic and historic value. Even exotic animals were taken from the <a href="zoo">zoo</a>s.

Many places of learning and culture—universities, schools, libraries, museums, theaters and cinemas—were either closed or designated as ""<a href="Nur%20f%C3%BCr%20Deutsche">Nur für Deutsche</a>"" (For Germans Only). Twenty-five museums and a host of other institutions were destroyed during the war. According to one estimate, by war's end 43% of the infrastructure of Poland's educational and research institutions and 14% of its museums had been destroyed. According to another, only 105 of pre-war Poland's 175 museums survived the war, and just 33 of these institutions were able to reopen. Of pre-war Poland's 603 scientific institutions, about half were totally destroyed, and only a few survived the war relatively intact.
Many university professors, as well as teachers, lawyers, artists, writers, priests and other members of the Polish <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a> were arrested and executed, or transported to <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">concentration camps</a>, during operations such as "<a href="German%20AB-Aktion%20operation%20in%20Poland">AB-Aktion</a>". This particular campaign resulted in the infamous "<a href="Sonderaktion%20Krakau">Sonderaktion Krakau</a>" and the <a href="massacre%20of%20Lvov%20professors">massacre of Lwów professors</a>. During World War II Poland lost 39% to 45% of its physicians and dentists, 26% to 57% of its lawyers, 15% to 30% of its teachers, 30% to 40% of its scientists and university professors, and 18% to 28% of its clergy. The Jewish intelligentsia was exterminated altogether. The reasoning behind this policy was clearly articulated by a Nazi "<a href="gauleiter">gauleiter</a>": "In my district, [any Pole who] shows signs of intelligence will be shot."

As part of their program to suppress Polish culture, the German Nazis attempted to destroy <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> in Poland, with a particular emphasis on the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a>. In some parts of occupied Poland, Poles were restricted, or even forbidden, from attending religious services. At the same time, church property was confiscated, prohibitions were placed on using the Polish language in religious services, organizations affiliated with the Catholic Church were abolished, and it was forbidden to perform certain religious songs—or to read passages of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>—in public. The worst conditions were found in the <a href="Reichsgau%20Wartheland">Reichsgau Wartheland</a>, which the Nazis treated as a laboratory for their anti-religious policies. Polish clergy and religious leaders figured prominently among portions of the intelligentsia that were targeted for extermination.

To forestall the rise of a new generation of educated Poles, German officials decreed that the schooling of Polish children would be limited to a few years of elementary education. <a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a> <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> wrote, in a memorandum of May 1940: "The sole purpose of this schooling is to teach them simple arithmetic, nothing above the number 500; how to write one's name; and the doctrine that it is divine law to obey the Germans ... I do not regard a knowledge of reading as desirable." <a href="Hans%20Frank">Hans Frank</a> echoed him: "The Poles do not need universities or secondary schools; the Polish lands are to be converted into an intellectual desert." The situation was particularly dire in the former Polish territories beyond the <a href="General%20Government">General Government</a>, which <a href="Polish%20areas%20annexed%20by%20Nazi%20Germany">had been annexed to the Third Reich</a>. The specific policy varied from territory to territory, but in general, there was no Polish-language education at all. German policy constituted a crash-Germanization of the populace. Polish teachers were dismissed, and some were invited to attend "orientation" meetings with the new administration, where they were either summarily arrested or executed on the spot. Some Polish schoolchildren were sent to German schools, while others were sent to special schools where they spent most of their time as unpaid laborers, usually on German-run farms; speaking Polish brought severe punishment. It was expected that Polish children <a href="child%20labor">would begin to work</a> once they finished their primary education at age 12 to 15. In the eastern territories not included in the General Government ("<a href="Bezirk%20Bialystok">Bezirk Bialystok</a>", "<a href="Reichskommissariat%20Ostland">Reichskommissariat Ostland</a>" and "<a href="Reichskommissariat%20Ukraine">Reichskommissariat Ukraine</a>") many primary schools were closed, and most education was conducted in non-Polish languages such as Ukrainian, Belorussian, and Lithuanian. In the "Bezirk Bialystok" region, for example, 86% of the schools that had existed before the war were closed down during the first two years of German occupation, and by the end of the following year that figure had increased to 93%.
The state of Polish primary schools was somewhat better in the "<a href="General%20Government">General Government</a>", though by the end of 1940, only 30% of prewar schools were operational, and only 28% of prewar Polish children attended them. A German police <a href="memorandum">memorandum</a> of August 1943 described the situation as follows:
In the "General Government", the remaining schools were subjugated to the German educational system, and the number and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a <a href="vocational%20school">vocational school</a> remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes in the final two years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was no money for heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational <a href="curriculum">curriculum</a> was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and teachers, and the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.

The Germans were especially active in the destruction of <a href="Jewish%20culture">Jewish culture</a> in Poland; nearly all of the wooden <a href="synagogue">synagogue</a>s there were destroyed. Moreover, the sale of <a href="Jewish%20literature">Jewish literature</a> was banned throughout Poland.

<a href="Polish%20literature">Polish literature</a> faced a similar fate in territories annexed by Germany, where the sale of Polish books was forbidden. The public destruction of Polish books was not limited to those seized from libraries, but also included those books that were confiscated from private homes. The last Polish book titles not already proscribed were withdrawn in 1943; even Polish prayer books were confiscated. Soon after the occupation began, most libraries were closed; in Kraków, about 80% of the libraries were closed immediately, while the remainder saw their collections decimated by censors. The occupying powers destroyed Polish book collections, including the <a href="Sejm">Sejm</a> and <a href="Senate%20of%20Poland">Senate</a> Library, the Przedziecki Estate Library, the <a href="Zamoyski%20family">Zamoyski</a> Estate Library, the Central Military Library, and the <a href="Polish%20Museum%2C%20Rapperswil%23Repatriation">Rapperswil Collection</a>. In 1941, the last remaining Polish public library in the German-occupied territories was closed in <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>. During the war, Warsaw libraries lost about a million volumes, or 30% of their collections. More than 80% of these losses were the direct result of purges rather than wartime conflict. Overall, it is estimated that about 10 million volumes from state-owned libraries and institutions perished during the war.

<a href="Polish%20flag">Polish flag</a>s and <a href="symbols%20of%20Poland">other symbols</a> were confiscated. The war on the Polish language included the tearing down of signs in Polish and the banning of Polish speech in public places. Persons who spoke Polish in the streets were often insulted and even physically assaulted. The Germanization of place names prevailed. Many treasures of Polish culture – including memorials, plaques and monuments to national heroes (e.g., Kraków's <a href="Adam%20Mickiewicz%20Monument%2C%20Krak%C3%B3w">Adam Mickiewicz monument</a>) – were destroyed. In <a href="Toru%C5%84">Toruń</a>, all Polish monuments and plaques were torn down. Dozens of monuments were destroyed throughout Poland. The Nazis <a href="planned%20destruction%20of%20Warsaw">planned to level entire cities</a>.

The Germans prohibited publication of any regular Polish-language book, literary study or scholarly paper. In 1940, several German-controlled printing houses began operating in occupied Poland, publishing items such as Polish-German dictionaries and antisemitic and anticommunist novels.

<a href="Censorship">Censorship</a> at first targeted books that were considered to be "serious", including scientific and educational texts and texts that were thought to promote Polish patriotism; only fiction that was free of anti-German overtones was permitted. Banned literature included maps, atlases and <a href="English%20language">English</a>- and <a href="French%20language">French-language</a> publications, including dictionaries. Several non-public indexes of prohibited books were created, and over 1,500 Polish writers were declared "dangerous to the German state and culture". The index of <a href="List%20of%20authors%20banned%20during%20the%20Third%20Reich">banned authors</a> included such Polish authors as <a href="Adam%20Mickiewicz">Adam Mickiewicz</a>, <a href="Juliusz%20S%C5%82owacki">Juliusz Słowacki</a>, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Wyspia%C5%84ski">Stanisław Wyspiański</a>, <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20Prus">Bolesław Prus</a>, <a href="Stefan%20%C5%BBeromski">Stefan Żeromski</a>, <a href="J%C3%B3zef%20Ignacy%20Kraszewski">Józef Ignacy Kraszewski</a>, <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Reymont">Władysław Reymont</a>, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Wyspia%C5%84ski">Stanisław Wyspiański</a>, <a href="Julian%20Tuwim">Julian Tuwim</a>, <a href="Kornel%20Makuszy%C5%84ski">Kornel Makuszyński</a>, <a href="Leopold%20Staff">Leopold Staff</a>, <a href="Eliza%20Orzeszkowa">Eliza Orzeszkowa</a> and <a href="Maria%20Konopnicka">Maria Konopnicka</a>. Mere possession of such books was illegal and punishable by imprisonment. Door-to-door sale of books was banned, and bookstores—which required a license to operate—were either emptied out or closed.

Poles were forbidden, under penalty of death, to own <a href="radio%20set">radios</a>. The press was reduced from over 2,000 publications to a few dozen, all <a href="censorship">censored</a> by the Germans. All pre-war newspapers were closed, and the few that were published during the occupation were new creations under the total control of the Germans. Such a thorough destruction of the press was unprecedented in contemporary history. The only officially available reading matter was the <a href="propaganda">propaganda</a> press that was disseminated by the German occupation administration. Cinemas, now under the control of the German propaganda machine, saw their programming dominated by Nazi German movies, which were preceded by propaganda <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a>s. The few Polish films permitted to be shown (about 20% of the total programming) were edited to eliminate references to Polish national symbols as well as Jewish actors and producers. Several propaganda films were shot in Polish, although no Polish films were shown after 1943. As all profits from Polish cinemas were officially directed toward German war production, attendance was discouraged by the Polish underground; a famous underground slogan declared: ""Tylko świnie siedzą w kinie"" ("Only pigs attend the movies"). A similar situation faced theaters, which were forbidden by the Germans to produce "serious" spectacles. Indeed, a number of propaganda pieces were created for theater stages. Hence, theatrical productions were also boycotted by the underground. In addition, actors were discouraged from performing in them and warned that they would be labeled as collaborators if they failed to comply. Ironically, restrictions on cultural performances were eased in Jewish <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a>s, given that the Germans wished to distract ghetto inhabitants and prevent them from grasping their <a href="Holocaust%20in%20Poland">eventual fate</a>.

Music was the least restricted of cultural activities, probably because Hans Frank regarded himself as a fan of serious music. In time, he ordered the creation of the Orchestra and Symphony of the General Government in its capital, <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>. Numerous musical performances were permitted in cafes and churches, and the Polish underground chose to boycott only the propagandist <a href="opera">opera</a>s. Visual artists, including painters and sculptors, were compelled to register with the German government; but their work was generally tolerated by the underground, unless it conveyed propagandist themes. Shuttered museums were replaced by occasional art exhibitions that frequently conveyed propagandist themes.

The development of <a href="Nazi%20propaganda">Nazi propaganda</a> in occupied Poland can be divided into two main phases. Initial efforts were directed towards creating a negative image of pre-war Poland, and later efforts were aimed at fostering <a href="anti-Soviet">anti-Soviet</a>, <a href="antisemitic">antisemitic</a>, and pro-German attitudes.

After the <a href="Soviet%20invasion%20of%20Poland">Soviet invasion of Poland</a> (beginning 17 September 1939) that followed the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland%20%281939%29">German invasion</a> that had marked the start of World War II (beginning 1 September 1939), the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> <a href="Polish%20areas%20annexed%20by%20the%20Soviet%20Union">annexed the eastern parts</a> (""<a href="Kresy">Kresy</a>"") of the <a href="Second%20Polish%20Republic">Second Polish Republic</a>, comprising and a population of 13.299 million. Hitler and Stalin shared the goal of obliterating Poland's political and cultural life, so that Poland would, according to historian Niall Ferguson, "cease to exist not merely as a place, but also as an idea".
The Soviet authorities regarded service to the prewar Polish state as a "crime against revolution" and "counter-revolutionary activity" and arrested many members of the Polish <a href="intelligentsia">intelligentsia</a>, politicians, civil servants and academics, as well as ordinary persons suspected of posing a threat to Soviet rule. More than a million Polish citizens <a href="Sybirak">were deported to Siberia</a>, many to "<a href="Gulag">Gulag</a>" concentration camps, for years or decades. Others died, including over 20,000 military officers who perished in the <a href="Katyn%20massacre">Katyn massacre</a>s.

The Soviets quickly <a href="Sovietization">Sovietized</a> the annexed lands, introducing compulsory <a href="collectivization">collectivization</a>. They proceeded to confiscate, <a href="nationalized">nationalize</a> and redistribute private and state-owned Polish property. In the process, they banned political parties and public associations and imprisoned or executed their leaders as "enemies of the people". In line with <a href="Persecution%20of%20Christians%20in%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet anti-religious policy</a>, churches and religious organizations were persecuted. On 10 February 1940, the NKVD unleashed a campaign of terror against "anti-Soviet" elements in occupied Poland. The Soviets' targets included persons who often traveled abroad, persons involved in overseas correspondence, <a href="Esperanto">Esperantists</a>, <a href="philatelists">philatelists</a>, <a href="Red%20Cross">Red Cross</a> workers, refugees, smugglers, priests and members of religious congregations, the nobility, landowners, wealthy merchants, bankers, industrialists, and hotel and restaurant owners. Stalin, like Hitler, worked to eliminate Polish society.

The Soviet authorities sought to remove all trace of the Polish history of the area now under their control. The name "Poland" was banned. Polish monuments were torn down. All institutions of the dismantled Polish state, including the <a href="Lviv%20University">Lwów University</a>, were closed, then reopened, mostly with new Russian directors. Soviet Communist ideology became paramount in all teaching. Polish literature and language studies were dissolved by the Soviet authorities, and the Polish language was replaced with Russian or Ukrainian. Polish-language books were burned even in the primary schools. Polish teachers were not allowed in the schools, and many were arrested. Classes were held in Belorussian, Lithuanian and Ukrainian, with a new pro-Soviet <a href="curriculum">curriculum</a>. As Polish-Canadian historian <a href="Piotr%20Wr%C3%B3bel">Piotr Wróbel</a> noted, citing British historians <a href="M.%20R.%20D.%20Foot">M. R. D. Foot</a> and <a href="I.%20C.%20B.%20Dear">I. C. B. Dear</a>, majority of scholars believe that "In the Soviet occupation zone, conditions were only marginally less harsh than under the Germans." In September 1939, many Polish Jews had fled east; after some months of living under Soviet rule, some of them wanted to return to the German zone of occupied Poland.
All publications and media were subjected to <a href="censorship">censorship</a>. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals who were willing to cooperate. Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a> and <a href="Vilnius">Wilno</a> were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime in a positive light and vilified the former Polish government.

The Soviet propaganda-motivated support for Polish-language cultural activities, however, clashed with the official policy of <a href="Russification">Russification</a>. The Soviets at first intended to phase out the Polish language and so banned Polish from schools, street signs, and other aspects of life. This policy was, however, reversed at times—first before the elections in October 1939; and later, after the German conquest of <a href="France">France</a>. In November 1940, the Poles of Lwów observed the 85th anniversary of <a href="Adam%20Mickiewicz">Adam Mickiewicz</a>'s death. Soon, however, Stalin decided to re-implement the Russification policies. He reversed his decision again, however, when a need arose for Polish-language pro-Soviet propaganda following the <a href="German%20invasion%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">German invasion of the Soviet Union</a>; as a result Stalin permitted the creation of <a href="Polish%20forces%20in%20the%20East">Polish forces in the East</a> and later decided to create a Communist <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20Poland">People's Republic of Poland</a>.

Many Polish writers collaborated with the Soviets, writing pro-Soviet propaganda. They included <a href="Jerzy%20Borejsza">Jerzy Borejsza</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20Boy-%C5%BBele%C5%84ski">Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński</a>, <a href="Kazimierz%20Brandys">Kazimierz Brandys</a>, <a href="Janina%20Broniewska">Janina Broniewska</a>, <a href="Jan%20Brzoza">Jan Brzoza</a>, <a href="Teodor%20Bujnicki">Teodor Bujnicki</a>, <a href="Leon%20Chwistek">Leon Chwistek</a>, <a href="Zuzanna%20Ginczanka">Zuzanna Ginczanka</a>, <a href="Halina%20G%C3%B3rska">Halina Górska</a>, <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Jastrun">Mieczysław Jastrun</a>, <a href="Stefan%20J%C4%99drychowski">Stefan Jędrychowski</a>, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Jerzy%20Lec">Stanisław Jerzy Lec</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20%C5%81opalewski">Tadeusz Łopalewski</a>, <a href="Juliusz%20Kleiner">Juliusz Kleiner</a>, <a href="Jan%20Kott">Jan Kott</a>, <a href="Jalu%20Kurek">Jalu Kurek</a>, <a href="Karol%20Kuryluk">Karol Kuryluk</a>, <a href="Leopold%20Lewin">Leopold Lewin</a>, <a href="Anatol%20Miku%C5%82ko">Anatol Mikułko</a>, <a href="Jerzy%20Pa%C5%84ski">Jerzy Pański</a>, <a href="Leon%20Pasternak">Leon Pasternak</a>, <a href="Julian%20Przybo%C5%9B">Julian Przyboś</a>, <a href="Jerzy%20Putrament">Jerzy Putrament</a>, <a href="Jerzy%20Rawicz">Jerzy Rawicz</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Rudnicki">Adolf Rudnicki</a>, <a href="W%C5%82odzimierz%20S%C5%82obodnik">Włodzimierz Słobodnik</a>, <a href="W%C5%82odzimierz%20Sokorski">Włodzimierz Sokorski</a>, <a href="El%C5%BCbieta%20Szempli%C5%84ska">Elżbieta Szemplińska</a>, <a href="Anatol%20Stern">Anatol Stern</a>, <a href="Julian%20Stryjkowski">Julian Stryjkowski</a>, <a href="Lucjan%20Szenwald">Lucjan Szenwald</a>, <a href="Leopold%20Tyrmand">Leopold Tyrmand</a>, <a href="Wanda%20Wasilewska">Wanda Wasilewska</a>, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Wasilewski">Stanisław Wasilewski</a>, <a href="Adam%20Wa%C5%BCyk">Adam Ważyk</a>, <a href="Aleksander%20Weintraub">Aleksander Weintraub</a> and <a href="Bruno%20Winawer">Bruno Winawer</a>.

Other Polish writers, however, rejected the Soviet persuasions and instead published underground: <a href="Jadwiga%20Czechowicz%C3%B3wna">Jadwiga Czechowiczówna</a>, <a href="Jerzy%20Hordy%C5%84ski">Jerzy Hordyński</a>, <a href="Jadwiga%20Gamska-%C5%81empicka">Jadwiga Gamska-Łempicka</a>, <a href="Herminia%20Naglerowa">Herminia Naglerowa</a>, <a href="Beata%20Oberty%C5%84ska">Beata Obertyńska</a>, <a href="Ostap%20Ortwin">Ostap Ortwin</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20Peiper">Tadeusz Peiper</a>, <a href="Teodor%20Parnicki">Teodor Parnicki</a>, <a href="Juliusz%20Petry">Juliusz Petry</a>. Some writers, such as <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Broniewski">Władysław Broniewski</a>, after collaborating with the Soviets for a few months, joined the anti-Soviet opposition. Similarly, <a href="Aleksander%20Wat">Aleksander Wat</a>, initially sympathetic to communism, was arrested by the Soviet <a href="NKVD">NKVD</a> <a href="secret%20police">secret police</a> and exiled to <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>.

<a href="Polish%20culture">Polish culture</a> persisted in <a href="Education%20in%20Poland%20during%20World%20War%20II">underground education</a>, publications, even theater. The <a href="Polish%20Underground%20State">Polish Underground State</a> created a Department of Education and Culture (under <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Lorentz">Stanisław Lorentz</a>) which, along with a Department of Labor and Social Welfare (under <a href="Jan%20Stanis%C5%82aw%20Jankowski">Jan Stanisław Jankowski</a> and, later, <a href="Stefan%20Mateja">Stefan Mateja</a>) and a Department for Elimination of the Effects of War (under <a href="Antoni%20Olszewski">Antoni Olszewski</a> and <a href="Bronis%C5%82aw%20Domos%C5%82awski">Bronisław Domosławski</a>), became underground patrons of Polish culture. These Departments oversaw efforts to save from looting and destruction works of art in state and private collections (most notably, the giant paintings by <a href="Jan%20Matejko">Jan Matejko</a> that were concealed throughout the war). They compiled reports on looted and destroyed works and provided artists and scholars with means to continue their work and their publications and to support their families. Thus, they sponsored the <a href="underground%20publications">underground publication</a> ("<a href="bibu%C5%82a">bibuła</a>") of works by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and <a href="Arkady%20Fiedler">Arkady Fiedler</a> and of 10,000 copies of a Polish primary-school <a href="Alphabet%20book">primer</a> and commissioned artists to create resistance artwork (which was then disseminated by <a href="Operation%20N">Operation N</a> and like activities). Also occasionally sponsored were secret art exhibitions, theater performances and concerts.

Other important patrons of Polish culture included the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church%20in%20Poland">Roman Catholic Church</a> and Polish aristocrats, who likewise supported artists and safeguarded Polish heritage (notable patrons included Cardinal <a href="Adam%20Stefan%20Sapieha">Adam Stefan Sapieha</a> and a former politician, <a href="Janusz%20Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82%20%281880-1967%29">Janusz Radziwiłł</a>). Some private publishers, including <a href="Stefan%20Kamie%C5%84ski">Stefan Kamieński</a>, <a href="Zbigniew%20Mitzner">Zbigniew Mitzner</a> and the <a href="Ossolineum">Ossolineum</a> publishing house, paid writers for books that would be delivered after the war.

In response to the German closure and censorship of Polish schools, resistance among teachers led almost immediately to the creation of <a href="Education%20in%20Poland%20during%20World%20War%20II">large-scale underground educational activities</a>. Most notably, the <a href="Secret%20Teaching%20Organization">Secret Teaching Organization</a> ("Tajna Organizacja Nauczycielska, TON") was created as early as in October 1939. Other organizations were created locally; after 1940 they were increasingly subordinated and coordinated by the TON, working closely with the Underground's State Department of Culture and Education, which was created in autumn 1941 and headed by <a href="Czes%C5%82aw%20Wycech">Czesław Wycech</a>, creator of the TON. Classes were either held under the cover of officially permitted activities or in private homes and other venues. By 1942, about 1,500,000 students took part in underground primary education; in 1944, its secondary school system covered 100,000 people, and university level courses were attended by about 10,000 students (for comparison, the pre-war enrollment at Polish universities was about 30,000 for the 1938/1939 year). More than 90,000 secondary-school pupils attended underground classes held by nearly 6,000 teachers between 1943 and 1944 in four districts of the <a href="General%20Government">General Government</a> (centered on the cities of <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>, <a href="Radom">Radom</a> and <a href="Lublin">Lublin</a>). Overall, in that period in the General Government, one of every three children was receiving some sort of education from the underground organizations; the number rose to about 70% for children old enough to attend secondary school. It is estimated that in some rural areas, the educational coverage was actually improved (most likely as courses were being organized in some cases by teachers escaped or deported from the cities). Compared to pre-war classes, the absence of <a href="Polish%20Jewish">Polish Jewish</a> students was notable, as they were confined by the Nazi Germans to <a href="ghettos">ghettos</a>; there was, however, underground Jewish education in the ghettos, often organized with support from Polish organizations like TON. Students at the underground schools were often also members of the Polish resistance.

In <a href="Warsaw">Warsaw</a>, there were over 70 underground schools, with 2,000 teachers and 21,000  students. Underground <a href="Warsaw%20University">Warsaw University</a> educated 3,700 students, issuing 64 masters and 7 doctoral degrees. <a href="Warsaw%20Politechnic">Warsaw Politechnic</a> under occupation educated 3,000 students, issuing 186 engineering degrees, 18 doctoral ones and 16 <a href="habilitation">habilitation</a>s. <a href="Jagiellonian%20University">Jagiellonian University</a> issued 468 masters and 62 doctoral degrees, employed over 100 professors and teachers, and served more than 1,000 students per year. Throughout Poland, many other universities and institutions of higher education (of music, theater, arts, and others) continued their classes throughout the war.
Even some academic research was carried out (for example, by <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Tatarkiewicz">Władysław Tatarkiewicz</a>, a leading Polish philosopher, and <a href="Zenon%20Klemensiewicz">Zenon Klemensiewicz</a>, a linguist). Nearly 1,000 Polish scientists received funds from the Underground State, enabling them to continue their research.

The German attitude to underground education varied depending on whether it took place in the General Government or the annexed territories. The Germans had almost certainly realized the full scale of the Polish underground education system by about 1943, but lacked the manpower to put an end to it, probably prioritizing resources to dealing with the armed resistance. For the most part, closing underground schools and colleges in the General Government was not a top priority for the Germans. In 1943 a German report on education admitted that control of what was being taught in schools, particularly rural ones, was difficult, due to lack of manpower, transportation, and the activities of the Polish resistance. Some schools semi-openly taught unauthorized subjects in defiance of the German authorities. <a href="Hans%20Frank">Hans Frank</a> noted in 1944 that although Polish teachers were a "mortal enemy" of the German states, they could not all be disposed of immediately. It was perceived as a much more serious issue in the annexed territories, as it hindered the process of Germanization; involvement in the underground education in those territories was much more likely to result in a sentence to a <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>.

There were over 1,000 underground newspapers; among the most important were the "<a href="Biuletyn%20Informacyjny">Biuletyn Informacyjny</a>" of <a href="Armia%20Krajowa">Armia Krajowa</a> and "<a href="Rzeczpospolita%20%28underground%20newspaper%29">Rzeczpospolita</a>" of the <a href="Government%20Delegation%20for%20Poland">Government Delegation for Poland</a>. In addition to publication of news (from intercepted Western radio transmissions), there were hundreds of underground publications dedicated to politics, economics, education, and literature (for example, "<a href="Sztuka%20i%20Nar%C3%B3d">Sztuka i Naród</a>"). The highest recorded publication volume was an issue of "Biuletyn Informacyjny" printed in 43,000 copies; average volume of larger publication was 1,000–5,000 copies. The Polish underground also published booklets and leaflets from imaginary <a href="German%20resistance">anti-Nazi German organizations</a> aimed at spreading disinformation and lowering morale among the Germans. Books were also sometimes printed. Other items were also printed, such as patriotic posters or fake German administration posters, ordering the Germans to evacuate Poland or telling Poles to register household cats.

The two largest underground publishers were the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Information%20and%20Propaganda">Bureau of Information and Propaganda</a> of Armia Krajowa and the Government Delegation for Poland. <a href="Tajne%20Wojskowe%20Zak%C5%82ady%20Wydawnicze">Tajne Wojskowe Zakłady Wydawnicze</a> (Secret Military Publishing House) of <a href="Jerzy%20Rutkowski%20%28activist%29">Jerzy Rutkowski</a> (subordinated to the Armia Krajowa) was probably the largest underground publisher in the world. In addition to Polish titles, Armia Krajowa also printed false German newspapers designed to decrease morale of the occupying German forces (as part of <a href="Action%20N">Action N</a>). The majority of Polish underground presses were located in occupied Warsaw; until the <a href="Warsaw%20Uprising">Warsaw Uprising</a> in the summer of 1944 the Germans found over 16 underground printing presses (whose crews were usually executed or sent to concentration camps). The second largest center for Polish underground publishing was <a href="Krak%C3%B3w">Kraków</a>. There, writers and editors faced similar dangers: for example, almost the entire editorial staff of the underground satirical paper "<a href="Na%20Ucho">Na Ucho</a>" was arrested, and its chief editors were executed in Kraków on 27 May 1944. ("Na Ucho" was the longest published Polish underground paper devoted to <a href="satire">satire</a>; 20 issues were published starting in October 1943.) The underground press was supported by a large number of activists; in addition to the crews manning the printing presses, scores of underground couriers distributed the publications. According to some statistics, these couriers were among the underground members most frequently arrested by the Germans.

Under German occupation, the professions of Polish journalists and writers were virtually eliminated, as they had little opportunity to publish their work. The Underground State's Department of Culture sponsored various initiatives and individuals, enabling them to continue their work and aiding in their publication. Novels and anthologies were published by underground presses; over 1,000 works were published underground over the course of the war. Literary discussions were held, and prominent writers of the period working in Poland included, among others, <a href="Krzysztof%20Kamil%20Baczy%C5%84ski">Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński</a>, <a href="Leslaw%20Bartelski">Leslaw Bartelski</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20Borowski">Tadeusz Borowski</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20Boy-%C5%BBele%C5%84ski">Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński</a>, <a href="Maria%20D%C4%85browska">Maria Dąbrowska</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20Gajcy">Tadeusz Gajcy</a>, <a href="Zuzanna%20Ginczanka">Zuzanna Ginczanka</a>, <a href="Jaros%C5%82aw%20Iwaszkiewicz">Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz</a>, future <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> winner <a href="Czes%C5%82aw%20Mi%C5%82osz">Czesław Miłosz</a>, <a href="Zofia%20Na%C5%82kowska">Zofia Nałkowska</a>, <a href="Jan%20Parandowski">Jan Parandowski</a>, <a href="Leopold%20Staff">Leopold Staff</a>, <a href="Kazimierz%20Wyka">Kazimierz Wyka</a>, and <a href="Jerzy%20Zawieyski">Jerzy Zawieyski</a>. Writers wrote about the difficult conditions in the <a href="prisoner%20of%20war%20camp">prisoner-of-war camps</a> (<a href="Konstanty%20Ildefons%20Ga%C5%82czy%C5%84ski">Konstanty Ildefons Gałczyński</a>, <a href="Stefan%20Flukowski">Stefan Flukowski</a>, <a href="Leon%20Kruczkowski">Leon Kruczkowski</a>, <a href="Andrzej%20Nowicki%20%28writer%29">Andrzej Nowicki</a> and <a href="Marian%20Piecha%C5%82a">Marian Piechała</a>), the <a href="ghetto">ghetto</a>s, and even from inside the <a href="concentration%20camp">concentration camp</a>s (<a href="Jan%20Maria%20Gisges">Jan Maria Gisges</a>, <a href="Halina%20Go%C5%82czowa">Halina Gołczowa</a>, <a href="Zofia%20G%C3%B3rska">Zofia Górska (Romanowiczowa)</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20Ho%C5%82uj">Tadeusz Hołuj</a>, <a href="Kazimierz%20Andrzej%20Jaworski">Kazimierz Andrzej Jaworski</a> and <a href="Marian%20Kubicki">Marian Kubicki</a>). Many writers did not survive the war, among them Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński, <a href="Wac%C5%82aw%20Berent">Wacław Berent</a>, Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński, Tadeusz Gajcy, Zuzanna Ginczanka, <a href="Juliusz%20Kaden-Bandrowski">Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski</a>, <a href="Stefan%20Kiedrzy%C5%84ski">Stefan Kiedrzyński</a>, <a href="Janusz%20Korczak">Janusz Korczak</a>, <a href="Halina%20Krahelska">Halina Krahelska</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20Hollender">Tadeusz Hollender</a>, <a href="Witold%20Hulewicz">Witold Hulewicz</a>, <a href="Ferdynand%20Antoni%20Ossendowski">Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski</a>, <a href="W%C5%82odzimierz%20Pietrzak">Włodzimierz Pietrzak</a>, <a href="Leon%20Pomirowski">Leon Pomirowski</a>, <a href="Kazimierz%20Przerwa-Tetmajer">Kazimierz Przerwa-Tetmajer</a> and <a href="Bruno%20Schulz">Bruno Schulz</a>.

With the censorship of Polish theater (and the virtual end of the Polish radio and film industry), underground theaters were created, primarily in Warsaw and Kraków, with shows presented in various underground venues. Beginning in 1940 the theaters were coordinated by the Secret Theatrical Council. Four large companies and more than 40 smaller groups were active throughout the war, even in the Gestapo's <a href="Pawiak">Pawiak</a> prison in Warsaw and in <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a>; underground acting schools were also created. Underground actors, many of whom officially worked mundane jobs, included <a href="Karol%20Adwentowicz">Karol Adwentowicz</a>, <a href="El%C5%BCbieta%20Barszczewska">Elżbieta Barszczewska</a>, <a href="Henryk%20Borowski">Henryk Borowski</a>, <a href="Wojciech%20Brydzi%C5%84ski">Wojciech Brydziński</a>, <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Ha%C5%84cza">Władysław Hańcza</a>, <a href="Stefan%20Jaracz">Stefan Jaracz</a>, <a href="Tadeusz%20Kantor">Tadeusz Kantor</a>, <a href="Mieczys%C5%82aw%20Kotlarczyk">Mieczysław Kotlarczyk</a>, <a href="Bohdan%20Korzeniowski">Bohdan Korzeniowski</a>, <a href="Jan%20Kreczmar">Jan Kreczmar</a>, <a href="Adam%20Mularczyk">Adam Mularczyk</a>, <a href="Andrzej%20Pronaszko">Andrzej Pronaszko</a>, <a href="Leon%20Schiller">Leon Schiller</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Szyfman">Arnold Szyfman</a>, <a href="Stanis%C5%82awa%20Umi%C5%84ska">Stanisława Umińska</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Wierci%C5%84ski">Edmund Wierciński</a>, <a href="Maria%20Wierci%C5%84ska">Maria Wiercińska</a>, Karol Wojtyła (who later became <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a>), <a href="Marian%20Wyrzykowski">Marian Wyrzykowski</a>, <a href="Jerzy%20Zawieyski">Jerzy Zawieyski</a> and others. Theater was also active in the Jewish ghettos and in the camps for Polish <a href="war%20prisoners">war prisoners</a>.

Polish music, including orchestras, also went underground. Top Polish musicians and directors (<a href="Adam%20Didur">Adam Didur</a>, <a href="Zbigniew%20Drzewiecki">Zbigniew Drzewiecki</a>, <a href="Jan%20Ekier">Jan Ekier</a>, <a href="Barbara%20Kostrzewska">Barbara Kostrzewska</a>, <a href="Zygmunt%20Latoszewski">Zygmunt Latoszewski</a>, <a href="Jerzy%20Lefeld">Jerzy Lefeld</a>, <a href="Witold%20Lutos%C5%82awski">Witold Lutosławski</a>, <a href="Andrzej%20Panufnik">Andrzej Panufnik</a>, <a href="Piotr%20Perkowski">Piotr Perkowski</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Rudnicki">Edmund Rudnicki</a>, <a href="Eugenia%20Umi%C5%84ska">Eugenia Umińska</a>, <a href="Jerzy%20Waldorff">Jerzy Waldorff</a>, <a href="Kazimierz%20Wi%C5%82komirski">Kazimierz Wiłkomirski</a>, <a href="Maria%20Wi%C5%82komirska">Maria Wiłkomirska</a>, <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20Woytowicz">Bolesław Woytowicz</a>, <a href="Mira%20Zimi%C5%84ska">Mira Zimińska</a>) performed in restaurants, cafes, and private homes, with the most daring <a href="sung%20poetry">singing patriotic ballads</a> on the streets while evading German patrols. <a href="Polish%20national%20songs">Patriotic songs</a> were written, such as "<a href="Siekiera%2C%20motyka">Siekiera, motyka</a>", the most popular song of occupied Warsaw. Patriotic <a href="puppet%20shows">puppet shows</a> were staged. Jewish musicians (e.g. <a href="W%C5%82adys%C5%82aw%20Szpilman">Władysław Szpilman</a>) and artists likewise performed in ghettos and even in concentration camps. Although many of them died, some survived abroad, like <a href="Alexandre%20Tansman">Alexandre Tansman</a> in the United States, and <a href="Eddie%20Rosner">Eddie Rosner</a> and <a href="Henryk%20Wars">Henryk Wars</a> in the Soviet Union.

Visual arts were practiced underground as well. Cafes, restaurants and private homes were turned into galleries or museums; some were closed, with their owners, staff and patrons harassed, arrested or even executed. Polish underground artists included <a href="Eryk%20Lipi%C5%84ski">Eryk Lipiński</a>, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Miedza-Tomaszewski">Stanisław Miedza-Tomaszewski</a>, <a href="Stanis%C5%82aw%20Ostoja-Chrostowski">Stanisław Ostoja-Chrostowski</a>, and <a href="Konstanty%20Maria%20Sopo%C4%87ko">Konstanty Maria Sopoćko</a>. Some artists worked directly for the Underground State, <a href="forgery">forging</a> money and documents, and creating anti-Nazi art (satirical <a href="poster">poster</a>s and <a href="caricature">caricature</a>s) or Polish patriotic symbols (for example <a href="kotwica">kotwica</a>). These works were reprinted on underground presses, and those intended for public display were plastered to walls or painted on them as <a href="graffiti">graffiti</a>. Many of these activities were coordinated under the <a href="Action%20N">Action N</a> Operation of Armia Krajowa's <a href="Bureau%20of%20Information%20and%20Propaganda">Bureau of Information and Propaganda</a>. In 1944 three giant (6 m, or 20 ft) puppets, caricatures of Hitler and <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a>, were successfully displayed in public places in Warsaw. Some artists recorded life and death in occupied Poland; despite German bans on Poles using cameras, photographs and even films were taken. Although it was impossible to operate an underground radio station, underground auditions were recorded and introduced into German radios or loudspeaker systems. Underground postage stamps were designed and issued. Since the Germans also banned Polish sport activities, underground sport clubs were created; underground <a href="Association%20football">football</a> matches and even tournaments were organized in Warsaw, Kraków and Poznań, although these were usually dispersed by the Germans. All of these activities were supported by the Underground State's Department of Culture.

<a href="Warsaw%20Uprising%23Life%20behind%20the%20lines">During the Warsaw Uprising</a> (August–October 1944), people in Polish-controlled territory endeavored to recreate the former day-to-day life of their free country. Cultural life was vibrant among both soldiers and the civilian population, with theaters, cinemas, post offices, newspapers and similar activities available. The 10th Underground Tournament of Poetry was held during the Uprising, with prizes being weaponry (most of the Polish poets of the younger generation were also members of the resistance). Headed by <a href="Antoni%20Bohdziewicz">Antoni Bohdziewicz</a>, the <a href="Home%20Army">Home Army</a>'s Bureau of Information and Propaganda even created three <a href="newsreel">newsreel</a>s and over of film documenting the struggle.
<a href="Eugeniusz%20Lokajski">Eugeniusz Lokajski</a> took some 1,000 photographs before he died; <a href="Sylwester%20Braun">Sylwester Braun</a> some 3,000, of which 1,500 survive; <a href="Jerzy%20Tomaszewski%20%28photographer%29">Jerzy Tomaszewski</a> some 1,000, of which 600 survived.

Polish artists also worked abroad, outside of <a href="occupied%20Europe">occupied Europe</a>. <a href="Arkady%20Fiedler">Arkady Fiedler</a>, based in Britain with the <a href="Polish%20Armed%20Forces%20in%20the%20West">Polish Armed Forces in the West</a> wrote about the <a href="No.%20303%20Polish%20Fighter%20Squadron">303 Polish Fighter Squadron</a>. <a href="Melchior%20Wa%C5%84kowicz">Melchior Wańkowicz</a> wrote about the Polish contribution to <a href="Battle%20of%20Monte%20Cassino">the capture of Monte Cassino</a> in Italy. Other writers working abroad included <a href="Jan%20Lecho%C5%84">Jan Lechoń</a>, <a href="Antoni%20S%C5%82onimski">Antoni Słonimski</a>, <a href="Kazimierz%20Wierzy%C5%84ski">Kazimierz Wierzyński</a> and <a href="Julian%20Tuwim">Julian Tuwim</a>. There were artists who performed for the <a href="Polish%20forces%20in%20the%20West">Polish forces in the West</a> as well as for the <a href="Polish%20forces%20in%20the%20East">Polish forces in the East</a>. Among musicians who performed for the <a href="Polish%20II%20Corps">Polish II Corps</a> in a "Polska Parada" cabaret were <a href="Henryk%20Wars">Henryk Wars</a> and <a href="Irena%20Anders">Irena Anders</a>. The most famous song of the soldiers fighting under the <a href="Allies%20%28WWII%29">Allies</a> was the "<a href="Czerwone%20maki%20na%20Monte%20Cassino">Czerwone maki na Monte Cassino</a>" (The Red Poppies on Monte Cassino), composed by <a href="Feliks%20Konarski">Feliks Konarski</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Schultz">Alfred Schultz</a> in 1944. There were also Polish theaters in exile in both the East and the West. Several Polish painters, mostly soldiers of the Polish II Corps, kept working throughout the war, including <a href="Tadeusz%20Piotr%20Potworowski">Tadeusz Piotr Potworowski</a>, <a href="Adam%20Kossowski">Adam Kossowski</a>, <a href="Marian%20Kratochwil">Marian Kratochwil</a>, <a href="Boles%C5%82aw%20Leitgeber">Bolesław Leitgeber</a> and <a href="Stefan%20Knapp">Stefan Knapp</a>.

The wartime attempts to destroy Polish culture may have strengthened it instead. <a href="Norman%20Davies">Norman Davies</a> wrote in "<a href="God%27s%20Playground">God's Playground</a>": "In 1945, as a prize for untold sacrifices, the attachment of the survivors to their native culture was stronger than ever before." Similarly, close-knit underground classes, from primary schools to universities, were renowned for their high quality, due in large part to the lower ratio of students to teachers. The resulting culture was, however, different from the <a href="culture%20of%20interwar%20Poland">culture of interwar Poland</a> for a number of reasons. The <a href="Holocaust%20in%20Poland">destruction of Poland's Jewish community</a>, <a href="territorial%20changes%20of%20Poland%20after%20World%20War%20II">Poland's postwar territorial changes</a>, and <a href="Human%20migration%23World%20War%20II">postwar migrations</a> left Poland without its historic ethnic minorities. The multicultural nation was no more.

The experience of World War II placed its stamp on a <a href="generation">generation</a> of Polish artists that became known as the "<a href="Generation%20of%20Columbuses">Generation of Columbuses</a>". The term denotes an entire generation of Poles, born soon after Poland regained independence in 1918, whose adolescence was marked by World War II. In their art, they "discovered a new Poland"–one forever changed by the atrocities of World War II and the ensuing <a href="history%20of%20Poland%20%281945-1989%29">creation of a communist Poland</a>.
Over the years, nearly three-quarters of the Polish people have emphasized the importance of World War II to the Polish national identity. Many Polish works of art created since the war have centered on events of the war. Books by <a href="Tadeusz%20Borowski">Tadeusz Borowski</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Rudnicki">Adolf Rudnicki</a>, <a href="Henryk%20Grynberg">Henryk Grynberg</a>, <a href="Miron%20Bia%C5%82oszewski">Miron Białoszewski</a>, <a href="Hanna%20Krall">Hanna Krall</a> and others; films, including those by <a href="Andrzej%20Wajda">Andrzej Wajda</a> ("<a href="A%20Generation">A Generation</a>", "<a href="Kana%C5%82%20%28film%29">Kanał</a>", "<a href="Ashes%20and%20Diamonds%20%28film%29">Ashes and Diamonds</a>", "<a href="Lotna">Lotna</a>", "<a href="A%20Love%20in%20Germany">A Love in Germany</a>", "<a href="Korczak%20%28film%29">Korczak</a>", "<a href="Katy%C5%84%20%28film%29">Katyń</a>"); TV series ("<a href="Czterej%20pancerni%20i%20pies">Four Tank Men and a Dog</a>" and "<a href="Stawka%20wi%C4%99ksza%20ni%C5%BC%20%C5%BCycie">Stakes Larger than Life</a>"); music ("<a href="Powstanie%20Warszawskie%20%28album%29">Powstanie Warszawskie</a>"); and even <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a>s–all of these diverse works have reflected those times. Polish historian <a href="Tomasz%20Szarota">Tomasz Szarota</a> wrote in 1996:

Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games

"Mario & Sonic" on the Wii and DS is a collection of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. Players <a href="Player%20character">assume the role</a> of a Nintendo or Sega character, using the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a> to mimic sports actions such as swinging a <a href="Paddle%20tennis">paddle</a>. The DS version uses the <a href="Stylus%20%28computing%29">stylus</a> and button controls. Both games follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. Sega adopted the IOC's mission of promoting <a href="sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a> and interest young people in the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympics</a> by using its characters; following this theme, Nintendo allowed Sega to include <a href="Mario">Mario</a> with <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, created by Sega as a <a href="mascot">mascot</a> to rival Mario in the early 1990s.

Critics praised the multiplayer interaction of the Wii game and variety of events of both versions, but criticized the Wii version for its complexity and its DS counterpart for not offering the same interaction between players. The Wii game was awarded the "Best Wii game of 2007" at the <a href="Games%20Convention">Games Convention</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>. "Mario & Sonic" sold over 10 million units and started a series of related sport video games to coincide with upcoming Olympic events.

"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games" is a collection of twenty-four events based on the Olympic Games. On the Wii, the events consist of using the motion sensor capabilities of the Wii Remote and <a href="Wii%20Remote%23Nunchuk">Nunchuk</a> attachment to control the actions of the on-screen character. The player moves the remote in a manner similar to the method the separate games are played in real life; for example, swinging the Wii Remote to replicate <a href="hammer%20throw">hammer throw</a> or pulling back the remote and tilting the Nunchuk like a <a href="Bow%20%28weapon%29">bow</a> and <a href="arrow">arrow</a>. While the Nunchuk is required for <a href="archery">archery</a>, it is optional for most of the events. There are also events that are more physically demanding, such as the five running events which require rapid drumming of the controller. Some aspects of the gameplay are computer controlled. For example, in table tennis the player movement is controlled by the Wii, while the swinging of the racket is controlled by the player. The DS game is the same in design, but due to lack of motion controls, its events are much less physically demanding than those on the Wii. For example, instead of drumming the controller, players have to quickly stroke the touchscreen.

"Mario & Sonic" brings together the two title characters and fourteen more from both franchises to participate in environments based on the official venues of the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>. These environments are stylized to fit the futuristic and cartoon-like art styles of the "Sonic" and "Mario" franchises respectively. Each playable character has his or her own statistics which can serve as an advantage or disadvantage depending on the event. The characters are divided into four categories: all-around, speed, power, and skill. The Wii version has additional in-game characters taken from the console's <a href="Wii%20Menu%23Mii%20Channel">Mii Channel</a>, which allows the user to create a Mii, a customized avatar, that can be imported into games that support the feature. Both games have <a href="Non-player%20character">non-playable characters</a> who serve as <a href="referee">referee</a>s for particular events.

Both versions of "Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games" have three similar modes of gameplay: Circuit mode, Single Match, and Mission mode. Circuit mode is where players compete for the highest overall score in a pre-determined series of events or design their own circuit. In the Single Match, players can choose to compete in each event individually. Mission mode is a single-player option where each of the competitors has six character-specific missions to complete, although the characters' statistics are not as balanced as in the main game, making missions more difficult. The Wii version's Circuit and Single Match can have an additional one to three players competing simultaneously while its DS counterpart has an extra option dedicated to multiplayer called Versus Play. Versus supports up to four people to use the wireless capabilities of the Nintendo DS to play events. <a href="Nintendo%20DS%23Download%20Play">DS Download Play</a> is possible for those without an individual copy of the game, however the number of sports available is limited to six events and circuit mode is not available.

Both versions feature a gallery mode where brief facts about the Olympics can be found. There are five categories of Olympics-related trivia organized by history and athletes, with corresponding <a href="minigame">minigame</a>s that will unlock the answer to trivia questions once completed. Classic music from both series is available in the gallery once all levels in a category are cleared. The two versions also have leaderboards that uses the <a href="Nintendo%20Wi-Fi%20Connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a> to display the best times and scores in each event.

"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games" features authentic Olympic events for the single match and circuit modes. The events closely follow rules and regulations of the specific sports. The types of Wii events are classified as <a href="Track%20and%20field%20athletics">athletics</a>, <a href="gymnastics">gymnastics</a>, <a href="shooting">shooting</a>, <a href="archery">archery</a>, <a href="rowing%20%28sport%29">rowing</a>, <a href="List%20of%20water%20sports">aquatics</a>, <a href="fencing">fencing</a>, and <a href="table%20tennis">table tennis</a>. Similar events have varying gameplay aspects; for example, getting a starting boost in the is more important than in the longer races, since the initial short burst of greater speed would play less of a role in winning the longer distance runs. In relay events, such as the <a href="4%20x%20100%20metres%20relay">relay</a> and aquatics relay, players can assemble teams comprising any four characters.

Besides these regular events, there are alternate versions of Olympic events called "Dream Events". Unlike the regular events, the gameplay in Dream Events is exaggerated. Taking place in locations and using objects from older games of the "Mario" and "Sonic" series, Dream Events allow players to use the special abilities of characters and display dramatic moments in slow motion.

Although the Wii and DS versions of the game feature mostly the same events, each version has events that are not found in the other. The relay races and <a href="rowing%20%28sport%29">rowing</a> are exclusive to the Wii version. In contrast, the DS version has cycling and five Dream Events—<a href="canoeing">canoeing</a>, <a href="boxing">boxing</a>, <a href="basketball">basketball</a>, long jump, and skeet shooting—not featured on the Wii version.

After <a href="Sega">Sega</a> transited from hardware to <a href="Video%20game%20developer%23Types">third-party development</a> in 2001, <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and Sega developed a closer relationship and worked together on "<a href="F-Zero%20GX">F-Zero GX</a>"—the first significant video game collaboration between the two. The idea for a crossover game between Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog and Nintendo's Mario characters had been casually discussed between the two companies; the mascots' creators <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a> and <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, respectively, had their private discussions revealed in 2005. Sonic the Hedgehog is the protagonist of the video game series released by Sega in order to provide the company with a mascot to rival Nintendo's flagship character Mario in the early 1990s. Despite the discussions, the idea was not acted on as it lacked a setting that would give the game "an exclamation mark". The idea of an Olympic setting for the mascots originated after Sega was awarded the Beijing 2008 Olympic license approximately a year later. The developer adopted the IOC's mission to promote a sporting spirit and wanted to interest young people in the Olympics with its newly acquired license. The corporation decided to base the sports game around its characters that "young people love and are very iconic" instead of creating a more realistic simulation. Sega then requested Nintendo for permission to include Mario in the game, setting up the first matchup between their mascots. Nintendo approved and partnered with Sega <a href="in-house">in-house</a> to add another layer of quality control to the development. Both companies felt that the competitive sportsmanship of the Olympic Games provided an ideal choice as a setting for the once-rival mascots.

"Mario & Sonic" was officially announced with a joint press release by Sega and Nintendo on March 28, 2007 and premiered at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3 2007</a>. In another showing of the collaboration between the two companies, the game was predominantly developed by the <a href="Sega%20Sports%20R%26amp%3BD">Sega Sports R&D Department</a> of Sega Japan under the supervision of Shigeru Miyamoto. He served as senior producer. Sega's Osamu Ohashi and Nintendo's Hiroshi Sato served as producers, Eigo Kasahara as director, and Teruhiko Nakagawa as composer. <a href="Racjin">Racjin</a> and according to gaming site <a href="IGN">IGN</a>, <a href="TOSE">TOSE</a>, a developer known to avoid crediting itself in its works, helped to develop "Mario & Sonic". The game is officially licensed by the IOC through exclusive licensee ISM and is the first official video game of the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympics">2008 Summer Olympic Games</a>. The president of Sega Europe stated that they originally planned a number of events, including <a href="judo">judo</a>, to fully epitomize the Olympics. However, the figure for the final product was reduced and judo was omitted. The development of the game was swifter than planned; in October 2007, Sega announced that "Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games" scheduled release date for the Wii has been advanced by two weeks and the game had <a href="Software%20release%20life%20cycle">gone gold</a>.<ref name="gold/events"></ref> It was released in 2007 in North America on November 6, in Japan on November 22, in Australia and in Europe on November 23, and in Korea on May 29, 2008. The DS version followed in 2008 in Japan on January 17, in North America on January 22, in Australia on February 7, in Europe on February 8, and in South Korea on June 26. Both versions were published by Nintendo for Japan (where it is known as ) and by Sega for North America, Europe and all other regions.

"Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games" was a commercial success; in the first few months after its release, the game was on four separate occasions the top-selling game in the United Kingdom all-formats chart. It accumulated seven weeks as the number-one seller, including the first two weeks after its release. The Wii version sold a half-million units in the UK during those seven weeks. By June 2008, both Wii and DS versions reached combined sales of 1.2 million copies in the UK, prompting Sega to create plans on re-marketing the game there. The game went on to sell over two million units combined in the country. According to the <a href="NPD%20Group">NPD Group</a>, the Wii game was one of the top-ten best-sellers for the month of December 2007 in the United States, selling 613,000 units. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research analyst <a href="Jesse%20Divnich">Jesse Divnich</a> argued the game is a fitting example of brand awareness' role in determining Wii game sales. The Wii is an exception to the correlation that higher quality games lead to better sales as seen on the <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> and Sony's <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>. Divnich added "To the casual and social gamer, it didn't matter that the game received sub-70 <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> scores," the recognizable "Mario" and "Sonic" brand names participating in a recognizable action, "The Olympic Games," contributed to the game's US sales.

As of December 28, 2008, 594,157 units of the Wii version and as of December 27, 2009, 383,655 copies of the Nintendo DS version has been sold in Japan. The Nintendo DS version is the twenty-seventh best-selling game of Japan for 2008. In the same year for Australia, it is the eighth best-selling game while the Wii version is number four. In July 2008, Simon Jeffrey, president of Sega of America, announced that Sega has sold approximately 10 million units worldwide combined of "Mario & Sonic" and showed interest in again collaborating with Nintendo to produce another game featuring the two companies' mascots. The game is listed in the "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records%20Gamer%27s%20Edition">Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition</a> 2010" book as the "Best-selling gaming character cross-over" with 7.09 million on Wii and 4.22 million copies on DS sold.

Although the Wii version of "Mario and Sonic" was awarded the "Best Wii game of 2007" at the <a href="Games%20Convention">Games Convention</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, it received mixed reactions from game critics; the DS version had a similar reception. A common complaint was that Sega and Nintendo failed to set the first matchup between their mascots in the genre that made them famous—<a href="platform%20game">platform game</a>s. Instead, the two companies threw Mario and Sonic into an Olympic-themed <a href="Party%20game%23Party%20video%20games">party video game</a>, a move which Tae Kim of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" criticized as "a marketing tool" to popularize the XXIX Olympic Games. Although the Wii version of the game was praised for being an entertaining multiplayer experience, it was criticized for shallow gameplay and complex rules and instructions. <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> concluded that "Mario & Sonic's" lack of "polish and simplicity" leaves the improbable grouping of mascots as its main attraction when compared to other party video games released for the platform.

<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Aaron Thomas rated the Wii version's motion control scheme as "uninteresting and occasionally frustrating". <a href="X-Play">X-Play</a>'s <a href="Morgan%20Webb">Morgan Webb</a> agreed, calling the controls "non-intuitive" and commenting that the minigames required players to "wave their Wiimotes frantically while pressing several buttons at the same time". <a href="Dan%20Hsu">Dan Hsu</a> of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" mentioned that the controls were complicated for a game that should be a "pure pick-up-and-play party game". Tae Kim said the events were "short and fairly shallow" and mostly required players to move the "Wii Remote and Nunchuks in specific ways—rapidly up and down for running events, for example". Mark Bozon of IGN called "Mario & Sonic" a success due to the entertainment value derived from the slight variety of competitions offered in the game. However, he and several other critics felt that events within the same classification were similar; Bozon noted that diversity was lacking as "five or six [events felt] nearly identical", and Thomas found the gameplay of several events to be overly similar to one another despite the reviewer praising the game for its number of events. Both reviewers favored the more complex objectives found in the fantasy events of the game, which shared attributes with that of the <a href="List%20of%20Mario%20games%20by%20genre%23Sports%20series">Mario sport games</a> and archery.

On the Nintendo DS, "Mario & Sonic" was regarded as virtually the same game in design as its Wii counterpart; however, opinions on its control scheme varied greatly. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Gerald Villoria thought the tradeoffs between both versions made them equally enjoyable. Andrew Fitch of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> assured readers in his review that the less physically demanding gameplay of the DS version made the game accessible for extended periods of time. Fitch further stated that in nearly "every case, events [were] far more enjoyable on the DS" due to the requirement of the human body's finer <a href="motor%20skill">motor skill</a> abilities to control the characters. However, <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Ellie Gibson noted that the lack of physical demand reduced the players' engrossment with the game. Craig Harris of IGN had a similar opinion, stating, "Rapidly drumming the controllers is far more challenging than quickly stroking the touchscreen." Harris felt the DS version lost some relevance to its marginally superior Wii counterpart since had a similar design and released almost three months afterwards.

Most publications agreed that the Wii counterpart of "Mario & Sonic" had clean textures and well-done animations; N-Europe's Iun Hockley thought that each character was pleasingly <a href="rendering%20%28computer%20graphics%29">rendered</a>, and Thomas added that the graphics were "crisp and colorful". Mark Bozon preferred the remixed Nintendo and Sega music and thought the general Olympic-related music "[could] be a bit generic". <a href="GameDaily">GameDaily</a>'s Robert Workman called the background music "mostly forgettable". Echoing this sentiment for the DS version, Emily Balistrieri of "GamePro" thought "most of the music [wasn't] too interesting". Compared to the Wii version, the DS version's visuals are of the same style and its graphics are nearly on the same level. Due to the inability to compete against other players online, Harris regarded "Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games" limited use of the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection on the DS as a "missed opportunity". Many reviewers, including Gibson and Pro-G's James Orry, found the uploading of best times and scores to be a cumbersome process. Although the home console version also has online rankings, it lacks direct competition between players. Disappointed with the aforementioned aspect, Bozon rationalized that the leaderboards "certainly [made] sense for a game like this".

"Sonic at the Olympic Games" is a Sonic-themed sports game for <a href="mobile%20phone">mobile phone</a>s released in June 2008. Developed by AirPlay and published by Sega, the game features five events based on the Olympic Games starring Sonic, Tails, Knuckles and Amy. Players control one character from a <a href="2D%20computer%20graphics">two-dimensional</a> prospective through one-button commands. The commercial success of "Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games" started a series of "Mario & Sonic" sport video games to coincide with upcoming <a href="Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Summer</a> and <a href="Winter%20Olympic%20Games">Winter Olympic Games</a>. Sean Ratcliffe, vice president of marketing at Sega of America said, "I think the key factor that decides the ongoing building of this franchise is basically success. Is the game successful? Are consumers happy with it?"

United States v. Kagama

United States v. Kagama, 118 U.S. 375 (1886), was a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> case that upheld the constitutionality of the <a href="Major%20Crimes%20Act">Major Crimes Act of 1885</a>. This Congressional act gave the federal courts jurisdiction in certain cases of Indian-on-Indian crimes, even if the crimes were committed on an Indian reservation. Kagama, a <a href="Yurok%20people">Yurok</a> <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native American</a> (Indian) accused of murder, was selected as a test case by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a> to test the constitutionality of the Act.

The importance of the ruling in this case was that it tested the constitutionality of the Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. <a href="Plenary%20power">Plenary power</a> over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the <a href="Commerce%20Clause">Commerce Clause of the Constitution</a>, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed Congress to pass the <a href="Dawes%20Act">Dawes Act</a> the following year. The case has been criticized by legal scholars as drawing on powers that are not granted to Congress by the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>. It remains <a href="wikt%3Agood%20law">good law</a>, despite that criticism.

In 1881, a <a href="Brul%C3%A9">Brulé Lakota Sioux</a> named <a href="Crow%20Dog">Crow Dog</a> killed his government-installed chief. Crow Dog was detained and tried for murder. However, he contended that the United States held no <a href="Federal%20jurisdiction%20%28United%20States%29">jurisdiction</a> on the <a href="Indian%20reservation">reservation</a>. The Supreme Court agreed, confirming Crow Dog's assertion that they lacked jurisdiction because the crime occurred in Indian country between two Indians. In the opinion issued by <a href="Associate%20Justice%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Justice</a> <a href="Stanley%20Matthews%20%28lawyer%29">Stanley Matthews</a> for the Supreme Court in "<a href="Ex%20parte%20Crow%20Dog">Ex parte Crow Dog</a>" in 1883, the Court implied that if Congress intended to exert legislative authority over these tribes they must pass an explicit law granting jurisdiction to the federal courts over Indian-on-Indian crime in Indian country, and then the Court would confirm its constitutionality.

In response, <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> debated the need and importance of teaching Indians regard for the rule of law. Further, it was argued that if an Indian committed a crime he could be tried under the laws of the United States. Congress ultimately passed an addendum to the <a href="Indian%20Appropriations%20Act">Indian Appropriations Act of March 3, 1885</a>, more commonly known as the <a href="Major%20Crimes%20Act">Major Crimes Act</a>, claiming exclusive jurisdiction of the federal government to prosecute Indians for seven major crimes anywhere in the nation, if the land is in Indian country, including Indian reservations. The seven original crimes included in the 1885 act (the list is now 15 crimes) were murder, manslaughter, rape, assault with intent to kill, arson, burglary, and larceny.

<a href="hupa">The Hoopa</a> Valley Reservation was created by executive order in 1864. At the time the reservation was formed, three unique bands of Indian tribes lived on different parts of the <a href="Klamath%20River">Klamath River</a>, each with its own language. The Yurok lived on the Lower Klamath, the <a href="Karuk">Karuk</a> occupied the Upper Klamath and the Hupa lived at the confluence of the Trinity and Klamath Rivers in <a href="Humboldt%20County%2C%20California">Humboldt County, California</a>. The reservation was supposed to be a home for other tribes within the region.

The tribes living along the river had long-established rules for property rights and ownership, including how property was to be passed down from one generation to the next. In some cases, families owned lands that were located a substantial distance from their "home" village.

In charge of the reservation was the <a href="Indian%20agent">Indian agent</a>, <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Major</a> Charles Porter, who by commanding the local military <a href="garrison">garrison</a> (<a href="Fort%20Gaston">Fort Gaston</a>) on the reservation was charged with the "de facto" responsibility for the people on the reservation. Without legal authority and against government policy, Porter allotted small parcels of land to the local Indian people, thus upsetting an age-old property rights system among families in the Klamath River Valley. On several occasions, Agent Porter had been called out to Kagama and Iyouse's homes to mediate their property dispute. Shortly before the murder, Kagama requested title to the land upon which he built his home.

On June 24, 1885, three months after the Major Crimes Act was passed, Kagama and his son Mahawaha went to Iyouse's house, where an argument ensued that resulted in the death by <a href="stabbing">stabbing</a> of Iyouse. Mahawaha reportedly held Iyouse's wife while Kagama stabbed Iyouse. Agent Porter moved quickly to detain both Kagama and Mahawaha on murder charges. He informed both federal and state authorities. The local <a href="district%20attorney">district attorney</a> declined to prosecute, citing a policy of not prosecuting crimes between Indians. The <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20for%20the%20Northern%20District%20of%20California">U.S. Attorney for Northern California</a> forcefully prosecuted the case. On October 18, 1885, both Kagama and Mahawaha were taken to <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> for trial, after having been <a href="Indictment">indicted</a> for murder. The indictment charged that the crime occurred on the reservation, even though it was later determined at the trial to have occurred outside the reservation boundaries to the north.

Because the crime supposedly occurred on the Hoopa Valley Reservation, the U.S. Attorney and the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Bureau of Indian Affairs</a> (BIA) fully supported the jurisdictional shift to the federal government and were immediately prepared to prosecute the case in federal courts. Challenges to the <a href="subject%20matter%20jurisdiction">subject matter jurisdiction</a> were heard before the <a href="United%20States%20circuit%20court">circuit court</a> in early October 1885. Circuit Judge Lorenzo Sawyer and District Court Judge George Sabin heard the challenge but disagreed on the law. The case received a "<a href="certificate%20of%20division">certificate of division</a>" resulting in the case being forwarded to the Supreme Court later in October.

Since this case challenged the authority of the federal courts to try Indian-on-Indian crime, this case was heard as an <a href="interlocutory%20appeal">interlocutory appeal</a>, meaning that the Supreme Court would have to decide the constitutionality of the claimed jurisdiction before Kagama could be tried for the killing of Iyouse in federal court.

Kagama was represented by 27-year-old Joseph D. Redding. The United States was represented by <a href="George%20A.%20Jenks">George A. Jenks</a>, who was an Assistant <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Secretary of the Interior</a>. Arguments were heard before the Supreme Court on May 2, 1886, only five months after the circuit court delivered a split opinion on the matter of jurisdiction.

Jenks urged the court to look to its earlier ruling in "Crow Dog", where the Court commented in "<a href="Dictum">dicta</a>" that Congress possessed the authority to regulate all commerce with Indian tribes, because of the <a href="Commerce%20Clause">Indian Commerce Clause</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">Constitution</a>. In his listing of precedents, he cited numerous laws passed by Congress regulating Indian commerce; he did not cite any other case law that supported Congress' authority over internal Indian matters, because there was none. Further, Jenks incorporated aspects of the political debate in Congress when the act was passed citing that the U.S. should be able to enforce its laws within its borders, regardless of treaty rights. The prosecution argued that Congress had the absolute authority to regulate Indians and their affairs.

Joseph Redding defended his clients vigorously. His argument was three-fold. First he argued that in one hundred years of Indian policy, Congress had never prosecuted Indian-on-Indian crime. Further, the indictment as stated contained no element of commerce and was therefore outside the purview of Congress to legislate such a law. Finally, he argued that such a profound shift in Indian policy should not be enacted in a law whose heading and body were wholly inconsistent with the intent of the Major Crimes Act. In effect, he argued that such a law governing a people should be debated in full sight of the American public and on its own merits. Redding argued that Congress could not assert power over sovereign people who, when making treaties to cede land, reserved certain rights to themselves. He did not raise the issue that the tribes already did have a system of law that dealt with crimes against another person.

In a unanimous decision issued at the end of May 1886, and authored by Justice <a href="Samuel%20Freeman%20Miller">Samuel Freeman Miller</a>, the Supreme Court ruled that the Major Crimes Act was constitutional, and, therefore, the case was within the jurisdiction of the federal courts. Miller dismissed the argument that the Act was proper under the Indian Commerce Clause, noting that the case did not present a commerce issue. He held instead that it was necessary since Indians were wards of the United States. Justice Miller was known for writing opinions that supported federal power over state's rights. This ruling meant that the federal <a href="United%20States%20circuit%20court">circuit court's</a> indictment would stand and the case would proceed to trial back in Northern California.

The opinion drew heavily on the language of the Solicitor General's brief, which by today's standards would be considered by many as racially charged. The language in Miller's opinion is infamous for its description of Indian tribes as weak, degraded and dependent on the federal government for support. He adopts language from "<a href="Cherokee%20Nation%20v.%20Georgia">Cherokee Nation v. Georgia</a>" describing each tribe as a "ward" and in a state of "pupilage."

Miller, having dismissed the Indian Commerce Clause as a source of authority, did not cite another constitutional source of the power. In effect, this decision contended that the U.S. government had supreme authority to enforce laws within its borders, but did not mention where this power was outlined in the Constitution. From the time the crime occurred to the Supreme Court decision, eleven months had passed.

The trial was held in San Francisco in September 1886. The prosecution called four witnesses, including Iyouse's wife and a witness to the murder named "Charlie". The defense called one witness, John B. Treadwell. Treadwell testified that the murder was outside the boundaries of the reservation. Based on Treadwell's position within the <a href="General%20Land%20Office">General Land Office</a>, the judge believed him and ordered a <a href="directed%20verdict">directed verdict</a> of not guilty.

Humboldt County Sheriff T. M. Brown stated that he would not arrest Kagama for a crime against another Indian. Brown stated that in his 26 years of law enforcement in the area, the state had never prosecuted an Indian for Indian-on-Indian crime. Brown also said that Kagama was trustworthy and industrious, while the victim was a "treacherous" blackmailer who had already killed several men. The sheriff believed that Kagama did not have any option but to kill the victim.

"Kagama" was the case that articulated Congress' <a href="plenary%20power">plenary power</a> over the Native American tribes in the late 19th century. It reaffirmed Congress' power to pass legislation, including the <a href="Dawes%20Act">Dawes Act</a>, that would take away many of the liberties that Native Americans had been able to hold on to up until that point. 19th and early 20th century U.S. lawmakers viewed the American Indians as inferior people who would benefit from being assimilated into the Euro-American culture. The laws that followed the "Kagama" ruling were attempts to destroy the Native American cultural differences and force these tribes to share the Euro-American culture viewed by these lawmakers to be the superior culture.

The decision has been widely criticized by legal scholars. David E. Wilkins noted that if the Indian Commerce Clause or <a href="Taxing%20and%20Spending%20Clause">Taxation Clause</a> did not contain the authority, and the tribes had not granted it by treaty or consent, then the Major Crimes Act would be unconstitutional and the Court should have declared it void. Phillip P. Frickey describes the "Kagama" decision as "a whirlwind of circular reasoning", with the Court justifying congressional power due to the tribe's weakness, which it also noted was due to the tribes dealing with the U.S. government. Frickey felt the decision was an embarrassment to constitutional theory, to logic, and to humanity. Robert N. Clinton stated that "<nowiki>[t]</nowiki>his remarkable decision obviously invoked rhetoric of colonial expansion, rather than the rhetoric of American constitutional discourse." Daniel L. Rotenberg said that "Kagama" was "one more item on the long litany of injustices to the American Indian." In addition to the law professors, various other authors in <a href="law%20reviews">law reviews</a> have also been critical of the decision. Warren Stapleton, in the <a href="Arizona%20State%20University">Arizona State University</a> law journal, has stated that the decision was incorrect and that the Major Crimes Act is in fact unconstitutional. In a Comment, the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> Law Review noted that "the Court promulgated what can be called the 'it-must-be-somewhere' doctrine ..."

"Kagama" remains <a href="good%20law">good law</a>, being cited in support of the plenary power doctrine as recently as 2004 in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Lara">United States v.

Brabham BT19

The Brabham BT19 is a <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> racing car designed by <a href="Ron%20Tauranac">Ron Tauranac</a> for the British <a href="Brabham">Brabham</a> team. The BT19 competed in the and Formula One World Championships and was used by Australian driver <a href="Jack%20Brabham">Jack Brabham</a> to win his third <a href="List%20of%20Formula%20One%20World%20Drivers%27%20Champions">World Championship</a> in 1966. The BT19, which Brabham referred to as his "Old Nail", was the first car bearing its driver's name to win a World Championship race.

The car was initially conceived in 1965 for a 1.5-litre (92-cubic inch) <a href="Coventry%20Climax">Coventry Climax</a> engine, but never raced in this form. For the 1966 Formula One season the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Internationale%20de%20l%27Automobile">Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile</a> (FIA) doubled the limit on engine capacity to 3 litres (183 cu in). Australian company <a href="Repco">Repco</a> developed a new <a href="V8%20engine">V8 engine</a> for Brabham's use in 1966, but a disagreement between Brabham and Tauranac over the latter's role in the racing team left no time to develop a new car to handle it. Instead, the existing BT19 chassis was modified for the job.

Only one BT19 was built. It was bought by Repco in 2004 and put on display in the <a href="National%20Sports%20Museum">National Sports Museum</a> in Melbourne, Australia, in 2008. It is often demonstrated at motorsport events.

The BT19 was created by Australian designer <a href="Ron%20Tauranac">Ron Tauranac</a> for the Brabham Racing Organisation (BRO) to use in the <a href="1965%20Formula%20One%20season">1965 season</a> of the <a href="Formula%20One">Formula One</a> motor racing World Championship. The BT19, and its contemporary the <a href="Lotus%2039">Lotus 39</a>, were built to use the new FWMW <a href="flat-16">flat-16</a> engine from <a href="Coventry%20Climax">Coventry Climax</a>. Only one example of the BT19 design was built, and it never raced in its original form. Climax abandoned the FWMW's development before the end of 1965, their existing FWMV <a href="V8%20engine">V8 engine</a>s proving powerful enough to propel <a href="Jim%20Clark">Jim Clark</a>'s <a href="Lotus%2033">Lotus 33</a> to seven wins and the drivers' championship.

For 1966, the engine capacity limit in Formula One was doubled from 1.5 litres (92 cu in) to 3 litres (183 cu in). It was not feasible to enlarge existing 1.5-litre engines to take full advantage of the higher limit and Climax chose not to develop a new 3-litre motor, leaving many teams without a viable engine for 1966.

The new 3-litre engines under development by competing team Ferrari had 12 <a href="cylinder%20%28engine%29">cylinders</a>. <a href="Jack%20Brabham">Jack Brabham</a>, owner and lead driver of BRO, took a different approach to the problem of obtaining a suitable engine. He persuaded Australian company <a href="Repco">Repco</a> to develop a new 3-litre eight-cylinder engine for him, largely based on available components; the engine would produce less power than Ferrari's, but would be lighter, easier to fix and more fuel efficient.

<a href="Brabham">Brabham</a> cars were designed and built by Motor Racing Developments Ltd. (MRD), which was jointly owned by Tauranac and Jack Brabham and built cars for customers in several racing series. The Formula One racing team, BRO, was a separate company wholly owned by Jack Brabham. It bought its cars from MRD but Tauranac had little connection with the race team between 1962 and 1965.

At the end of the 1965 season Tauranac was losing interest in this arrangement, reasoning that "it was just a matter of a lot of effort for no real interest because I didn't get to go racing very much" and "I might as well get on with my main line business, which was selling production cars." Although Brabham investigated using <a href="chassis">chassis</a> from other manufacturers, the two men eventually agreed that Tauranac would have a greater interest in the Formula One team, which MRD eventually took over completely from BRO. This agreement was not reached until November 1965. Repco delivered the first example of the new engine to the team's headquarters in the United Kingdom in late 1965, just weeks before the first Formula One race to the new regulations, the non-championship <a href="1966%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">South African Grand Prix</a> on 1 January 1966. Rather than build a new car in the limited time available, BRO pressed chassis number F1-1-1965, the sole and unused BT19, into service.

Tauranac built the BT19 around a <a href="mild%20steel">mild steel</a> <a href="spaceframe">spaceframe</a> chassis similar to those used in his previous Brabham designs. The use of a spaceframe was considered a conservative design decision; by 1966, most of Brabham's competitors were using the theoretically lighter and stiffer <a href="monocoque">monocoque</a> design, introduced to Formula One by Lotus during the <a href="1962%20Formula%20One%20season">1962 season</a>. Tauranac believed that contemporary monocoques were not usefully stiffer than a well-designed spaceframe and were harder to repair and maintain. The latter was a particular concern for Brabham, which was the largest manufacturer of customer single-seater racing cars in the world at the time. The company's reputation rested in part on BRO – effectively the official 'works' team – using the same technology as its customers, for whom ease of repair was a significant consideration. One mildly novel feature was the use of oval-section, rather than round, tubing around the cockpit, where the driver sits. In a spaceframe or monocoque racing car, the cockpit is effectively a hole in the structure, weakening it considerably. For a given <a href="Cross%20section%20%28geometry%29">cross sectional</a> area, oval tubing is stiffer in one direction than round tubing. Tauranac happened to have a supply of oval tubing and used it to stiffen the cockpit area. The car weighed around 1250 <a href="Pound%20%28mass%29">pounds</a> (567 <a href="kg">kg</a>), around over the minimum weight limit for the formula, although it was still one of the lightest cars in the 1966 field. The race starting weight of a 1966 Brabham-Repco with driver and fuel was estimated to be around , about less than the more powerful rival <a href="Cooper%20T81">Cooper T81</a>-<a href="Maserati">Maserati</a>s.

The bodywork of the BT19 is <a href="glass-reinforced%20plastic">glass-reinforced plastic</a>, finished in Brabham's usual racing colours of green with gold trimming around the nose. Although the science of <a href="aerodynamics">aerodynamics</a> would not greatly affect Formula One racing until the <a href="1968%20Formula%20One%20season">1968 season</a>, Tauranac had been making use of the <a href="Motor%20Industry%20Research%20Association">Motor Industry Research Association</a> <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a> since 1963 to refine the shape of his cars. Brabham has attributed the car's "swept-down nose and the upswept rear lip of the engine cowl" to Tauranac's "attention to aerodynamic detail". During the 1967 season, the car appeared with small winglets on the nose, to further reduce <a href="lift%20%28physics%29">lift</a> acting at the front of the car.

Against the trend set by the <a href="Lotus%2021">Lotus 21</a> in 1961, the BT19's <a href="Suspension%20%28vehicle%29">suspension</a>, which controls the relative motion of the chassis and the wheels, is outboard all round. That is, the bulky springs and <a href="shock%20absorber">dampers</a> are mounted in the space between the wheels and the bodywork, where they interfere with the airflow and increase unwanted aerodynamic <a href="drag%20%28physics%29">drag</a>. Tauranac persisted with this apparently conservative approach based on wind tunnel tests he had carried out in the early 1960s, which indicated that a more complicated inboard design, with the springs and dampers concealed under the bodywork, would provide only a 2% improvement in drag. He judged the extra time needed to set up an inboard design at the racetrack to outweigh this small improvement. At the front the suspension consists of unequal length, non-parallel <a href="double%20wishbone%20suspension">double wishbones</a>. The front uprights, the solid components upon which the wheels and brakes are mounted, were modified from the <a href="Alford%20%26amp%3B%20Alder">Alford & Alder</a> units used on the British <a href="Triumph%20Herald">Triumph Herald</a> <a href="sedan%20%28car%29">saloon</a>. The rear suspension is formed by a single top link, a reversed lower wishbone and two <a href="radius%20rod">radius rod</a>s locating cast magnesium alloy uprights. Wheels were initially 13 inches (330 mm) in diameter, but soon upgraded to at the rear, and later still 15 in at the front as well. These increases enabled the use of larger, more powerful brakes. Steel <a href="disc%20brakes">disc brakes</a> are used on all four wheels and were of diameter for the smaller wheels and for the larger ones. The car ran on treaded <a href="Goodyear%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Goodyear</a> tyres throughout its racing career.

The BT19 continued Tauranac's reputation for producing cars that handled well. Brabham has since commented that it "was beautifully balanced and I loved its readiness to <a href="Drifting%20%28motorsport%29">drift</a> through fast curves." Brabham referred to the car as his "Old Nail"; Ron Tauranac has explained this as being "because it was two years old, great to drive and had no vices."

Repco racing engines were designed by the leading motorcycle engine designer, <a href="Phil%20Irving">Phil Irving</a>, and built by a small team at a Repco subsidiary, Repco-Brabham engines Pty Ltd, in <a href="Maidstone%2C%20Victoria">Maidstone</a>, Australia. Repco's 620 series engine is a <a href="normally%20aspirated">normally aspirated</a> unit with eight cylinders in a 'V' configuration. It uses American <a href="engine%20block">engine block</a>s obtained from <a href="Oldsmobile">Oldsmobile</a>'s <a href="aluminium%20alloy">aluminium alloy</a> <a href="Buick%20V8%20engine%23215">215</a> engine. Oldsmobile's 215 engine, used in the <a href="Oldsmobile%20F-85">F-85</a> Cutlass <a href="compact%20car">compact car</a> between 1961 and 1963, was abandoned by <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> after production problems. Repco fitted their own <a href="cast%20iron">cast iron</a> <a href="Cylinder%20%28engine%29%23Cylinder%20sleeving">cylinder liners</a> into the Oldsmobile blocks, which were also stiffened with two Repco <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a> alloy castings and feature Repco-designed <a href="cylinder%20heads">cylinder heads</a> with chain-driven <a href="single%20overhead%20camshaft">single overhead camshaft</a>s. The internals of the unit consist of a bespoke Laystall <a href="crankshaft">crankshaft</a>, <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a> or <a href="Daimler%20Company">Daimler</a> <a href="connecting%20rod">connecting rod</a>s and specially cast <a href="piston">piston</a>s. The cylinder head design means that the engine's <a href="exhaust%20pipe">exhaust pipe</a>s exit on the outer side of the block, and therefore pass through the spaceframe before tucking inside the rear suspension, a layout which complicated Tauranac's design work considerably. The engine is <a href="water-cooled">water-cooled</a>, with oil and water radiators mounted in the nose.

The 620 engine was light for its time, weighing around , compared to for the Maserati <a href="V12%20engine">V12</a>, but in 3 litre Formula One form only produced around 300 <a href="brake%20horsepower">brake horsepower</a> (220 kW) at under 8000 <a href="revolutions%20per%20minute">revolutions per minute</a> (rpm), compared to 330–360 bhp (250–270 kW) produced by the <a href="Scuderia%20Ferrari">Ferrari</a> and Maserati V12s. However, it produced high levels of <a href="torque">torque</a> over a wide range of engine speeds from 3500 rpm up to peak torque of 233 <a href="Pound-foot%20%28torque%29">pound feet</a> (316 <a href="Newton%20metre">N·m</a>) at 6500 rpm. Installed in the lightweight BT19 chassis, it was also relatively fuel efficient; on the car's debut Brabham reported that the BT19 achieved 7 <a href="miles%20per%20gallon">miles per gallon</a> (40 L/100 km), against figures of around 4 mpg (70 L/100 km) for its "more exotic rivals". This meant that it could start a Grand Prix with only 35 <a href="Imperial%20%28UK%29%20gallon%23Volume">gallons</a> (160 L) of fuel on board, compared to around 55 gallons (250 L) for the Cooper T81-Maseratis. The engine had one further advantage over bespoke racing engines: parts were cheap. For example, the engine blocks were available for <a href="Pound%20Sterling">GB£</a>11 each and the connecting rods cost £7 each.

The 740 series unit used in the three races for which the car was entered in 1967 has a different, lighter, Repco-designed engine block. It also has redesigned cylinder heads which, among other improvements, mean that its exhausts are mounted centrally and do not pass through the spaceframe or rear suspension, unlike those of the 620 series. It produced a maximum of .

The BT19 was initially fitted with a <a href="Hewland">Hewland</a> HD (Heavy Duty) gearbox, originally designed for use with less powerful 2-litre engines. The greater power of the 3-litre Repco engine was more than the gearbox could reliably transmit when accelerating at full power from rest, with the result that Brabham normally made very gentle starts to avoid gearbox breakages. The HD was later replaced with the sturdier DG (Different Gearbox) design, produced at the request of both Brabham and <a href="Dan%20Gurney">Dan Gurney</a>'s <a href="Anglo%20American%20Racers">Anglo American Racers</a> team. It later became a popular choice for other constructors.

Although regarded by its designer as a "lash-up", BT19 had a very successful Formula One racing career, almost entirely in the hands of Jack Brabham. BT19 was entered in several non-championship Formula One races before the beginning of the 1966 world championship season. At the non-championship <a href="1966%20South%20African%20Grand%20Prix">South African Grand Prix</a> at <a href="East%20London%2C%20South%20Africa">East London</a> on 1 January, BT19 was the only new 3-litre car present. It recorded the fastest time in the qualifying session before the race – therefore taking <a href="pole%20position">pole position</a> for the start of the race – and led the majority of the event before the <a href="fuel%20injection">fuel injection</a> pump seized. Similar problems stopped the car on the second lap of the Syracuse Grand Prix in Sicily, but at the <a href="International%20Trophy">International Trophy</a> at the <a href="Silverstone%20circuit">Silverstone circuit</a>, Brabham set pole position, a new lap record, and led the whole race to win ahead of 1964 champion <a href="John%20Surtees">John Surtees</a> in a 3-litre works Ferrari.

The 1966 world championship season opened with the <a href="1966%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>. Brabham was affected by a cold, and qualified poorly before retiring when the BT19's gearbox failed. Surtees led the race in his Ferrari before his differential failed on lap 15; the race was won by <a href="Jackie%20Stewart">Jackie Stewart</a> in a 2-litre <a href="BRM%20P261">BRM P261</a>. At the following <a href="1966%20Belgian%20Grand%20Prix">Belgian Grand Prix</a> at the <a href="Circuit%20de%20Spa-Francorchamps">Spa circuit</a>, Brabham survived an enormous 135 miles per hour (215 km/h) slide in the rain on the first lap. The shower eliminated half the field, including Stewart, who would miss the next race with his injuries. The BT19, using Goodyear tyres that were not suited to the conditions, came home fourth of five classified finishers. Surtees won the race for Ferrari, the last before he quit the Italian team.

At the <a href="1966%20French%20Grand%20Prix">French Grand Prix</a>, held at the high speed <a href="Reims-Gueux">Reims-Gueux</a> circuit, Brabham followed race leader <a href="Lorenzo%20Bandini">Lorenzo Bandini</a> closely from the start of the race, using the <a href="Drafting%20%28racing%29">slipstream</a> of Bandini's more powerful Ferrari to tow him to up to faster down the straights than the BT19 could manage on its own. This allowed Brabham to consolidate his lead over Ferrari's second driver, Formula One novice <a href="Mike%20Parkes">Mike Parkes</a>. After 12 laps Bandini pulled away from Brabham, eventually by over 30 seconds, but when the Italian car was delayed by a broken throttle cable on lap 32, Brabham cruised to the finish to win from Parkes and become the first man to win a Formula One World Championship race in one of his own cars.

Although the first <a href="Brabham%20BT20">Brabham BT20</a>, the definitive 1966 car, had been available at Reims, Brabham continued with the BT19 and used it to win the next three championship races. Ferrari, competitive in all three championship races to that point, were not present for the <a href="1966%20British%20Grand%20Prix">British Grand Prix</a>. The race was held on the tight and twisting <a href="Brands%20Hatch">Brands Hatch</a> circuit, the track made slippery by oil leaking from other cars and by drizzle. Brabham set pole and led the entire race. At the next championship round, the <a href="1966%20Dutch%20Grand%20Prix">Dutch Grand Prix</a>, Brabham reported the low speed <a href="Zandvoort">Zandvoort</a> circuit to be "even more oily and treacherous than Brands." Brabham won the race after <a href="Jim%20Clark">Jim Clark</a>'s less powerful 2 litre <a href="Lotus%2033">Lotus 33</a>-Climax, which had passed Brabham for the lead mid-race, was delayed by overheating problems. The <a href="1966%20German%20Grand%20Prix">German Grand Prix</a> was held at the <a href="N%C3%BCrburgring">Nürburgring</a> Nordschleife, which Brabham described as "Brands Hatch on steroids". On the opening lap Brabham took the lead from Surtees, now driving a Cooper-Maserati. Brabham won after a race-long fight with the Englishman in the rain. With four wins and more finishes than any of his championship rivals, Brabham had a 22-point lead in the drivers championship and could only be caught in the championship by Surtees or Stewart if one of them won all three of the remaining races.

Jack Brabham used BT19 again at the <a href="1966%20Italian%20Grand%20Prix">Italian Grand Prix</a> at <a href="Autodromo%20Nazionale%20Monza">Monza</a>, another high speed circuit. A second BT20 was completed at the Italian track and Brabham tried it in practice for the race, but decided to race his "Old Nail", which he felt was fitted with a stronger engine. As at Reims, Brabham successfully slipstreamed the race leaders early on, but an oil leakage stopped the car after 8 laps. Neither Surtees nor Stewart finished the race and Brabham clinched his third world championship.

Brabham used the BT19 once more that season to take pole position and victory at the non-championship <a href="Oulton%20Park%20Gold%20Cup">Oulton Park Gold Cup</a>, before using a new BT20 for the final two races of the championship season. The BT19 was used again at three of the first four championship races in the <a href="1967%20Formula%20One%20season">1967 Formula One season</a>, debuting the new Repco 740 engine at the <a href="1967%20Monaco%20Grand%20Prix">Monaco Grand Prix</a>, where it took pole position, and finishing second at the <a href="1967%20Dutch%20Grand%20Prix">Dutch Grand Prix</a>.

Commenting on the reasons for the unexpected competitiveness of the 1966 Brabham-Repcos in Formula One, motorsport historian Doug Nye has suggested that they "could score on weight over the more powerful Ferrari, BRM, Cooper-Maserati, Eagle-Weslake and Honda in their undeveloped forms, and on sheer 'grunt' over such interim stop-gap cars as the nimble 2-litre Climax and BRM V8-engined Lotus 33s and BRMs."

BT19 also competed in the final two races of the 1965/66 <a href="Tasman%20Series">Tasman Series</a> in Australia, which was run to the pre-1961 Formula One regulations, including an engine capacity limit of 2.5 litres. Tasman racing was the original purpose of the Repco engine and Brabham's involvement was supposed to promote the 2.5-litre version. Frank Hallam, head of the Repco-Brabham organisation responsible for building the Repco engines, has said that the smaller version "never put out the power per litre that the 3 litre engine produced", which itself was not a powerful unit. Fitted with the 2.5-litre engine BT19 recorded one retirement and a third place in the series.

The BT19 was not raced in serious competition after 1967. Brabham retired and moved back to Australia at the end of 1970. He retained ownership of the car until 1976, when it passed into the hands of Repco and was <a href="car%20restoration">restored</a> by the Repco Engine Parts Group. In 1986, Automotive Components Ltd. (ACL) was formed by the <a href="management%20buyout">management buyout</a> of Engine Parts Group, which included the transfer of the BT19 to the new company. Since its restoration, the car has frequently been demonstrated at events, including the <a href="1978%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1978 Australian Grand Prix</a> at Sandown where Brabham was involved in a spirited demonstration with <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20Fangio">Juan Manuel Fangio</a> driving his <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20W196">Mercedes-Benz W196</a>. Brabham and the car also appeared at the first <a href="Australian%20Grand%20Prix">Australian Grands Prix</a> to be held on the <a href="Adelaide%20Street%20Circuit">Adelaide</a> (<a href="1985%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1985</a>) and <a href="Melbourne%20Grand%20Prix%20Circuit">Melbourne</a> (<a href="1996%20Australian%20Grand%20Prix">1996</a>) street circuits. It also appeared at the 2004 <a href="Goodwood%20Revival">Goodwood Revival</a> meeting in the United Kingdom. ACL sold the car back to Repco in 2004. In 2008 the car was installed in the Australian National Sports Museum at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>, on loan from Repco.

In 2002, at the inaugural <a href="Speed%20on%20Tweed">Speed on Tweed</a> historic meeting at <a href="Murwillumbah">Murwillumbah</a>, Brabham, then 76, commented: "It's been a wonderful car over the years and it's been very well looked after and it's a pleasure to come and drive it. Coming to Murwillumbah was a really good excuse to get back in the car and drive it again and I'm afraid that's something I'll never ever get tired of."

Nights: Journey of Dreams

Nights: Journey of Dreams, stylised NiGHTS: Journey of Dreams, is an <a href="action%20game">action</a> video game developed by <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a> and published by <a href="Sega">Sega</a> for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>. The sequel to the 1996 <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> title "<a href="Nights%20into%20Dreams">Nights into Dreams</a>", it was released in Japan and North America in December 2007, and in Australia and Europe the following month. The story follows two children, Will and Helen, who enter a <a href="Dream%20world%20%28plot%20device%29">dream world</a> called Nightopia. When their nightmares come to life, they enlist the help of <a href="Nights%20%28character%29">Nights</a>, an exiled "Nightmaren", as they journey through Nightopia to stop the evil ruler Wizeman from escaping into the real world.

As with its predecessor, gameplay is centred around Nights flying through the dreams of the two children. The main objective of the game is to fly through rings while gathering enough keys to proceed to the next level. Development of "Journey of Dreams" began shortly after the release of "<a href="Shadow%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28video%20game%29">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>" in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a>. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new <a href="game%20mechanics">mechanics</a> and features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of <a href="London">London</a>.

The game received mixed reviews. Critics praised the game's colourful visuals, <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss battles</a> and special effects, but most cited its poor controls, camera, aesthetics and general gameplay as major flaws. Despite the mixed reception, Iizuka said that he would be interested in making a third "Nights" game, should Sega commission one.

Every night, all human dreams are played out in Nightopia and Nightmare, the two parts of the <a href="dream%20world%20%28plot%20device%29">dream world</a>. In Nightopia, distinct aspects of dreamers' personalities are represented by luminous coloured spheres known as "Ideya". The evil ruler of Nightmare, Wizeman the Wicked, is stealing this dream energy from sleeping visitors to gather power and take control of Nightopia and eventually the real world. To achieve this, he creates "Nightmaren"—<a href="jester">jester</a>-like beings who can fly—including Jackle, Clawz, Gulpo, Gillwing and Puffy, and many minor maren. He also creates two "Level One" Nightmaren: <a href="Nights%20%28character%29">Nights</a> and Reala. Nights rebels against Wizeman's plans, and is imprisoned inside an Ideya palace, a <a href="gazebo">gazebo</a>-like container for dreamers' Ideya.

William Taylor and Helen Cartwright are two children who live in the city of Bellbridge (a fictionalised version of London). Will is an aspiring <a href="association%20football">football</a> player, Helen a prodigy <a href="violin">violin</a>ist. Over the years, both have grown apart from their respective parents; Helen has chosen to spend more time with her friends rather than practising the violin with her mother, a choice which has begun to fill her with guilt, while Will's father is transferred to another city for work and leaves his son by himself. Both children suffer nightmares and come under attack by the Nightmaren, who chase them into the world of Nightopia. There, the two children meet and free Nights, who has the ability to merge with the children, allowing them to share Nights' body and fly through the skies. Learning that Wizeman is plotting to take over the dream world and consequently enter the real world, the children and Nights resolve to stop Wizeman, but face resistance from the Nightmaren he commands, particularly Nights' sibling, Reala.

Though different, the children's stories share similar structures. The story reaches its climax as a stairway appears at the Dream Gate and Helen and Nights ascend, only to be trapped by Wizeman and pulled into darkness. Will arrives too late and dives in after them, arriving in the night skies above Bellbridge, where he finds that he has the ability to fly without Nights or their Ideya. He rescues Helen, and the two attempt to save Nights, who has been imprisoned at the top of Bellbridge's clock tower. Reala arrives to stop their efforts and accepts Nights' challenge to battle. After defeating Reala, the trio prepare to face Wizeman. Both Will and Helen defeat Wizeman, who is subsequently destroyed. Since Wizeman kept all of his creations alive, Nights vanishes in a white light, bowing as if it were the end of a performance, and the children wake up and cry. That evening, Helen plays her violin for her mother in a crowded hall, while Will celebrates with his father after winning a football game. He then loses the ball and goes after it, only to come upon Helen playing her violin. The lights suffer a temporary blackout, and when they turn back on, Helen sees Will extending a friendly hand to her. Recognising each other from their adventures in Nightopia, the two reach for each other as it begins to snow. The final scene is of either child sleeping in their rooms at home as the camera pulls back towards Bellbridge's clock tower, atop which Nights is seen to be alive and peacefully watching over the city.

"Nights: Journey of Dreams" is split into seven <a href="level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>. The levels are distributed equally between the two children characters: three are unique to Will, three to Helen, and both share a final <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a> stage. Gameplay is centred around controlling <a href="Nights%20%28character%29">Nights</a>' flight along a predetermined route through each level, resembling that of a 2D <a href="platform%20game">platformer</a> or a <a href="racing%20game">racing game</a>. In each level, players initially control Will or Helen but will later on assume control of Nights. The player may collect various <a href="pick-up%20%28gaming%29">pick-ups</a> while exploring the level on foot, but will be pursued by "Awakers" which will awaken the player-character and end the game, should three of them come into contact at once. The main objective of the game is to fly through rings and capture bird-like Nightmaren, who possess keys that unlock a series of cages. There are three cages in each level, and all must be unlocked within a set time before the player can proceed. Each collision with an enemy subtracts five seconds from the time remaining, and if the time runs out, the game will end prematurely. While flying, Nights can use a boost to travel faster, but the boost meter is slowly depleted while doing this. If it is fully depleted, the player will no longer be able to use boosts.

The game features items and traps which will either help or impede the player's progress. Collecting blue chips scattered around the levels will increase the player's <a href="score%20%28game%29">score</a>; time chips will extend the player's time and slow "Awakers" (if collected on foot). Flying through gold rings will replenish the player's boost meter, spiked rings will harm the player if flown through, and green rings will never disappear (unlike ordinary gold rings). The gameplay also involves the use of "persona masks", which will transform Nights into a different entity, thus granting new abilities to the player. There are three personas: transforming into a dolphin allows the player to swim underwater, a rocket speeds up Nights' flight, and a dragon will increase resistance to wind. Bosses are encountered twice in each level—an easier version early in a level, and a more difficult one at the end.

The <a href="artificial%20life">artificial life</a> system feature from its predecessor returns in "Journey of Dreams", known as "My Dream". This feature revolves around the player raising entities called Nightopians and keeping track of their moods. "My Dreams" connects with the <a href="Wii">Wii</a>'s <a href="Wii%20Channel%23Forecast%20Channel">Forecast Channel</a>, which will change the weather conditions in the player's "My Dream" world according to real-world forecasts. Cosmetic changes are visible every month, for example in February Nightopians hold a giant dragon for the <a href="Chinese%20New%20Year">Chinese New Year</a>, whereas in December they are dressed as Father Christmas. Players may visit other players' "My Dreams" through the <a href="Nintendo%20Wi-Fi%20Connection">Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection</a>. In order to increase the population in a "My Dream", Nightopians must be captured in the game's story mode. If there are more Nightopians than Nightmarens in the player's "My Dream", then the environment will look more like Nightopia and if there are more Nightmarens the landscape will change accordingly.

"Journey of Dreams" features four different control options: the <a href="Wii%20remote">Wii remote</a> as a standalone controller, the Wii remote in combination with the <a href="Wii%20Nunchuk">Nunchuk</a>, the <a href="Classic%20Controller">Classic Controller</a>, and the <a href="GameCube%20controller">GameCube controller</a>. If the Wii remote is used by itself, Nights' flight is controlled by pointing it at the screen. Additionally, the game offers two <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> modes: "Battle Mode" and "Speed Mode", the latter of which is playable only online via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. "Battle Mode" allows two <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">local players</a> to battle each other by using a <a href="Split%20screen%20%28computer%20graphics%29">splitscreen</a>, and "Speed Mode" revolves around players competing in races against online opponents.

A sequel to "Nights into Dreams" with the working title "Air Nights" was originally outlined for the <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> and subsequently developed for the <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a> with motion control being a central element of gameplay. In an August 1999 interview, <a href="Yuji%20Naka">Yuji Naka</a> confirmed that a sequel was in development, but by December 2000 the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel after the Dreamcast's discontinuation, but later noted in 2003 that he would be interested in using the licence of "Nights into Dreams" to reinforce Sega's identity as a video game developer. Around the same time, "Nights into Dreams" designer <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a> said "as long as I'm with Sega, I will create "Nights" again" in an interview concerning "<a href="Sonic%20Heroes">Sonic Heroes</a>". Discussion concerning a new game in the series had increased in frequency by 2006. Rumours regarding a Wii version continued to appear when a list of upcoming games was published by Japanese developer <a href="G.rev">G.rev</a>, which included an unspecified "Nights" title. Before the development of "Journey of Dreams", Naka confirmed in retrospective interviews that he had intended to base the next "Nights" game around a unique motion controller.

"Nights: Journey of Dreams" was first conceptualised in November 2005 after the release of <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a>'s "<a href="Shadow%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28video%20game%29">Shadow the Hedgehog</a>". Game design was primarily prepared by Iizuka and took around six months to reach the development process. Iizuka wanted to ensure that the next "Nights" game would stay faithful to the original, and felt the need to keep the game's concept fundamentally the same while incorporating a variety of new <a href="game%20mechanics">mechanics</a>. Despite the cancellation of "Air Nights", Iizuka stressed that he had always wanted to make a sequel and asserted that Sega's exit from hardware manufacturing had no effect on the delay. Iizuka felt that it was the appropriate time to release a "Nights" game—he felt that the industry was dominated by violence and was keen to release a more family-friendly title. The team realised that Nintendo's upcoming Wii was marketed as a family-orientated console, and factored in its online features and user-friendly design.

The team wanted "Journey of Dreams" to revolve around a dramatic storyline in the hope that the player would find it more engaging and intuitive, as Iizuka thought the original "Nights into Dreams" was not user-friendly. Originally, the game had a full free-roaming 3D flight system, but Iizuka thought it was too complex and "not as fun" as the core flight element featured in the original game. Iizuka thought the most difficult challenge of the development process was keeping the game's flight mechanics fun while building upon elements of the original game. To recreate the experience, the team tested a variety of controller schemes which included the Wii remote and <a href="Nunchuk%20controller">Nunchuk</a>, the GameCube controller, and the Classic Controller—the latter two left for players who preferred using a traditional controller configuration. Initially, the game used the Wii remote by having the player point it at the screen, but the team discovered that its motion sensors would not pick up small movements, so Iizuka created an alternative hybrid motion-pointer system, which he believed would retain the game's fun-to-fly experience. In a retrospective interview, Iizuka said that the entire game was created from scratch and used a new <a href="game%20engine">engine</a> specifically designed for the Wii.

Sonic Team decided to give all characters in the game voices as Iizuka believed that full dialogue helps add depth to both the story and gameplay. With Nights already designed as an <a href="androgynous">androgynous</a> character, the team wanted to leave impressions regarding gender up to the player, despite Nights having a female voice in the game. The team designed the "Nights" franchise to have a distinctly British style, in contrast to <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, which was designed to be more American. Thus, Bellbridge—the game's main setting—closely resembles London, and all of the game's characters have English accents. The development team consisted of 26 members of Sonic Team in the United States, while all sound work and <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a> was developed in Japan.

Tomoko Sasaki reprised her role of lead composer from the original "Nights into Dreams", and was rejoined by Sonic Team veterans Naofumi Hataya and Fumie Kumatani. Additionally, series newcomers <a href="Tomoya%20Ohtani">Tomoya Ohtani</a>, Teruhiko Nakagawa, and Tatsuyuki Maeda each contributed a few musical pieces. The game's sound effects were created primarily by <a href="Jun%20Senoue">Jun Senoue</a>, better known for his musical compositions in the "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" series. According to Iizuka, the team understood that they could not compose the same style of music featured in the original game, owing to the technical revamp of "Journey of Dreams". Sasaki elaborated that the original Saturn version used the console's internal <a href="music%20sequencer">music sequencer</a>, which allowed them more control over changing the game's music as the player progressed through the game, whereas the Wii version only played the recorded music directly. Despite the limitations, both Sasaki and Hataya were able to produce a better quality soundtrack by using a wider range of instruments than what was used in the previous game. In addition, Sasaki asked an employee from <a href="Marvelous%20Entertainment%23Delfi%20Sound%20Inc.">Delfi Sound Inc.</a> to record an orchestral piece for the game. Since the team were aware that the game's characters would have more dialogue than the original game, they requested that the orchestra perform a dramatic arrangement in order to put more emphasis on the game's storyline.

To make the development process as smooth as possible, Hataya tried to work in the same environment as Sasaki so that they could exchange data more efficiently. The main tools and software used during development were <a href="Digital%20Performer">Digital Performer</a> and <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a>, which, according to Hataya, were the standard tools used in music production. In order to stress that the atmosphere of "Journey of Dreams" was centred around surrealism and dreams themselves, Sasaki discarded tying the game's music down to a single genre and took the approach of not having a clear musical policy. Sasaki also ensured that each theme included the exhilaration of "flying in the air", as it was a core element of gameplay. Hataya echoed that the music of the game was produced by focusing on being able to empathise with the feeling of flying, as well as to exemplify the game's atmosphere and characters. Since the team were aware that "Journey of Dreams" had a greater sense of adventure than the original, the team knew that they could incorporate a larger variety of music into it so that players would enjoy a wider range of emotions. In addition to composing the music itself, Hataya took the responsibility of re-arranging Sasaki's music in different ways so that the theme matched the in-game situation. Hataya said that he and Sasaki produced around 70 percent of the game's music between them; the rest was produced by Sega's sound team.

"Nights: Journey Of Dreams: Original Soundtrack" was released on 26 January 2008 exclusively in Japan and contains three separate CDs with all of the music featured on the Wii version. An unofficial two-CD tribute album, "Nights: Lucid Dreaming", was released by <a href="OverClocked%20ReMix">OverClocked ReMix</a> in 2011. There are 25 tracks in total, with arrangements of the game's original soundtrack in a variety of styles. In January 2017, over 50 songs from the game and its predecessor, "Nights into Dreams", became available to download on <a href="Spotify">Spotify</a>.

"Nights: Journey of Dreams" received mixed reviews. it holds an aggregate score of 69% at <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, based on an average of 47 reviews.

Many critics praised the game's colourful visuals and special effects. Chris Scullion from the "<a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Official Nintendo Magazine</a>" thought the game design had all the speed and charm of the original, and enjoyed its "lush" atmosphere and landscapes. Kevin VanOrd of <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> also appreciated the game's artistic design, visual "dreaminess" and elegance, and Gerald Villoria of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> liked the game's colourful and vibrant levels. <a href="Nintendo%20Life">Nintendo Life</a>'s Anthony Dickens praised the general visual style of the game, noting that its boss battles in particular "ooze" with bright and exotic colours. Despite the general praise of the game's colourful palette, some critics viewed the aesthetics unfavourably. GameZone's Louis Bedigan felt that "Nights: Journey of Dreams" lacked the "eye-popping effects" of other contemporaries such as "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>" (2007) and "<a href="Twilight%20Princess">Twilight Princess</a>" (2006), and Dickens opined that the game's cutscenes were more akin to <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a> titles. Tom Bramwell from <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> felt that the environments looked like they were from 1996, despite the attempts made to distract the player from the game's simple premise. Paul Govan of "<a href="GamesTM">GamesTM</a>" found that the game engine struggled to match the cutscene's visual fluidity with its actual gameplay, and expressed disappointment that Wii owners would be unfazed by its graphical prowess, unlike Sega Saturn owners at the time of the original "Nights into Dreams" release. Dickens thought the game was graphically rushed by Sega, and speculated that it was "cobbled together quickly" by artists who had focused too much on designing the game's introduction sequence. Adam Rosenberg from <a href="UGO%20Networks">UGO Networks</a> found the graphics to be a disappointment, saying that its environments were "drab" considering it was based on the dreams of twelve-year-old children, and also noticed frame rate issues. Likewise, two reviewers from "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>", Shane Bettenhausen and Sam Kennedy, thought the 3D was "amateurish" and suffered from basic issues including uneven graphics and unskippable cutscenes.

Some reviewers criticised various aspects of gameplay, in particular the lack of <a href="checkpoint%20%28video%20gaming%29">checkpoints</a>. Scullion noted how the game retained its "old school" feeling despite being aimed at a new audience, and disliked its "die, retry" style of gameplay, which he considered old-fashioned. Mark Bozon from <a href="IGN">IGN</a> similarly criticised the game's tendencies to make the player restart an entire level upon death, calling it "a momentum killer", and Rosenberg said the automatic restarts were the game's "worst offender". Most reviewers praised the eccentricity and fun-factor of the boss battles; VanOrd believed they were enjoyable and memorable, and <a href="Jeuxvideo.com">Jeuxvideo.com</a>'s reviewer liked the bosses' appearances and originality, but found defeating them more than once in each world repetitive. In contrast, Bramwell thought that the game's boss characters channelled a mix between <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a> and <a href="CBeebies">CBeebies</a>, and Bozon felt that boss battles did not blend well with the main story since they were in self-contained arenas.

Reviewers disliked the game's control scheme, many stating that the use of the Wii remote was awkward and difficult to master. Bozon condemned the lack of refined flight control and noted that it was easier to use either the Classic Controller or the GameCube controller. Similarly, Scullion said that out of the three control schemes, the Wii remote was the least accurate option. VanOrd also criticized the poorly implemented use of the Wii remote, and Rosenberg thought its controls were overly responsive and unpolished; both reviewers recommended using the Classic Controller's analogue stick as an alternative. Dickens recognised that the original "Nights into Dreams" was one of the first games to benefit from an analogue stick, and was therefore surprised at how the sequel had a "control scheme crisis": multiple control schemes might add confusion for new players. Govan suggested that the reason why the game featured alternative control schemes was that Sonic Team wanted to emulate the original Saturn controls. In contrast, the reviewer from Jeuxvideo.com found little fault with any of the game's control schemes, and Bedigan labelled them as "excellent". Both reviewers, however, agreed that the Wii remote's motion controls did not work well with the game.

In 2010, Iizuka expressed his interest in making a third "Nights" game if Sega were to commission one.

John Adams

John Adams (October 30, 1735 – July 4, 1826) was an American statesman, attorney, diplomat, writer, and <a href="Founding%20Fathers%20of%20the%20United%20States">Founding Father</a> who served as the second <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a> from 1797 to 1801. Before his <a href="Presidency%20of%20John%20Adams">presidency</a> he was a leader of the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> that achieved independence from <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a>, and also served as the first <a href="vice%20president%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president of the United States</a>. Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20%281789%E2%80%931849%29">early American history</a> including his wife and adviser, <a href="Abigail%20Adams">Abigail</a>, and his letters and other papers are an important source of historical information about the era.

A lawyer and political activist prior to the revolution, Adams was devoted to the <a href="right%20to%20counsel">right to counsel</a> and <a href="presumption%20of%20innocence">presumption of innocence</a>. He defied anti-British sentiment and successfully defended British soldiers against murder charges arising from the <a href="Boston%20Massacre">Boston Massacre</a>. Adams was a <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Massachusetts</a> delegate to the <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> and became a principal leader of the Revolution. He assisted in drafting the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> in 1776 and was its foremost advocate in Congress. As a diplomat in Europe, he helped negotiate the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">peace treaty with Great Britain</a> and secured vital governmental loans. Adams was the primary author of the <a href="Massachusetts%20Constitution">Massachusetts Constitution</a> in 1780, which influenced the United States' own <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">constitution</a>, as did his earlier "<a href="Thoughts%20on%20Government">Thoughts on Government</a>".

Adams was elected to two terms as vice president under President <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> and was elected as the United States' second president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201796">1796</a>. During his single term, Adams encountered fierce criticism from the <a href="Jeffersonian%20Republicans">Jeffersonian Republicans</a> and from some in his own <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalist Party</a>, led by his rival <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>. Adams signed the controversial <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a> and built up the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Navy">Navy</a> in the undeclared "<a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a>" with <a href="French%20First%20Republic">France</a>. The main accomplishment of his presidency was a <a href="Convention%20of%201800">peaceful resolution</a> of this conflict in the face of public anger and Hamilton's opposition. During his term, he became the first president to reside in the executive mansion now known as the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>.

In his bid for <a href="1800%20United%20States%20presidential%20election">reelection</a>, opposition from Federalists and accusations of despotism from Republicans led to Adams's loss to his former friend <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, and he retired to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed his friendship with Jefferson by initiating a correspondence that lasted fourteen years. He and his wife generated a family of politicians, diplomats, and historians now referred to as the <a href="Adams%20political%20family">Adams political family</a>, which includes their son <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>, the sixth president of the United States. John Adams died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, hours after Jefferson's death. Surveys of historians and scholars have <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">favorably ranked his administration</a>.

John Adams was born on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735, <a href="Old%20Style%20and%20New%20Style%20dates">Old Style</a>, <a href="Julian%20calendar">Julian calendar</a>) to <a href="John%20Adams%20Sr.">John Adams Sr.</a> and <a href="Susanna%20Boylston">Susanna Boylston</a>. He had two younger brothers, Peter and Elihu. Adams was <a href="John%20Adams%20Birthplace">born on the family farm</a> in <a href="Braintree%2C%20Massachusetts">Braintree, Massachusetts</a>. His mother was from a leading medical family of present-day <a href="Brookline%2C%20Massachusetts">Brookline, Massachusetts</a>. His father was a <a href="deacon">deacon</a> in the <a href="Congregationalism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Congregational Church</a>, a farmer, a <a href="cordwainer">cordwainer</a>, and a lieutenant in the <a href="Massachusetts%20National%20Guard">militia</a>. John Sr. served as a <a href="Board%20of%20selectmen">selectman</a> (town councilman) and supervised the building of schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship. Adams's great-grandfather <a href="Henry%20Adams%20%28Braintree%29">Henry Adams</a> emigrated to Massachusetts from <a href="Braintree%2C%20Essex">Braintree, Essex</a>, England around 1638.

Though raised in modest surroundings, Adams felt pressured to live up to his heritage. His was a family of <a href="Puritans">Puritans</a>, who profoundly affected their region's culture, laws, and traditions. By the time of John Adams's birth, Puritan tenets such as <a href="predestination">predestination</a> had waned and many of their severe practices moderated, but Adams still "considered them bearers of freedom, a cause that still had a holy urgency." Adams recalled that his parents "held every Species of <a href="Libertine">Libertinage</a> in ... Contempt and horror," and detailed "pictures of disgrace, or baseness and of Ruin" resulting from any debauchery. Adams later noted that "As a child I enjoyed perhaps the greatest of blessings that can be bestowed upon men – that of a mother who was anxious and capable to form the characters of her children."

Adams, as the eldest child, was compelled to obtain a formal education. This began at age six at a <a href="dame%20school">dame school</a> for boys and girls, conducted at a teacher's home, and was centred upon "<a href="The%20New%20England%20Primer">The New England Primer</a>". Shortly thereafter, Adams attended Braintree Latin School under Joseph Cleverly, where studies included <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, rhetoric, logic, and arithmetic. Adams's early education included incidents of <a href="truancy">truancy</a>, a dislike for his master, and a desire to become a farmer. All discussion on the matter ended with his father's command that he remain in school: "You shall comply with my desires." Deacon Adams hired a new schoolmaster named Joseph Marsh, and his son responded positively.

At age sixteen, Adams entered <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a> in 1751, studying under <a href="Joseph%20Mayhew">Joseph Mayhew</a>. As an adult, Adams was a keen scholar, studying the works of ancient writers such as <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>, <a href="Plato">Plato</a>, <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a>, and <a href="Tacitus">Tacitus</a> in their original languages. Though his father expected him to be a minister, after his 1755 graduation with an <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">A.B. degree</a>, he taught school temporarily in <a href="Worcester%2C%20Massachusetts">Worcester</a>, while pondering his permanent vocation. In the next four years, he began to seek prestige, craving "Honour or Reputation" and "more from [his] fellows", and was determined to be "a great Man." He decided to become a lawyer to further those ends, writing his father that he found among lawyers "noble and gallant achievements" but, among the clergy, the "pretended sanctity of some absolute dunces." His aspirations conflicted with his Puritanism, though, prompting reservations about his self-described "trumpery" and failure to share the "happiness of [his] fellow men."

As the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> began in 1754, Adams, aged nineteen, began to struggle with his responsibility in the conflict as many of his contemporaries joined the war for money. Adams later said, "I longed more ardently to be a Soldier than I ever did to be a Lawyer," recognizing that he was the first of his family to "[degenerate] from the virtues of the house so far as not to have been an officer in the militia."

In 1756, Adams began <a href="reading%20law">reading law</a> under James Putnam, a leading lawyer in Worcester. In 1758, he earned an <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">A.M.</a> from Harvard, and was soon admitted to the bar, having completed his studies under Putnam. He developed an early habit of writing about events and impressions of men in his diary; this included <a href="James%20Otis%20Jr.">James Otis Jr.</a>'s 1761 legal argument challenging the legality of British <a href="Writ%20of%20assistance">Writs of Assistance</a>, allowing the British to search a home without notice or reason. Otis's argument inspired Adams to the cause of the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">American colonies</a>.

In 1763, Adams forged into various aspects of political theory by publishing seven essays in Boston newspapers. He offered them anonymously, under the <a href="nom%20de%20plume">nom de plume</a> "Humphrey Ploughjogger", and in them ridiculed the selfish thirst for power he perceived among the Massachusetts colonial elite. Adams was initially less well known than his older cousin <a href="Samuel%20Adams">Samuel Adams</a>, but his influence emerged from his work as a constitutional lawyer, his analysis of history, and his dedication to <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a>. Adams often found his irascible nature a constraint in his political career.

In the late 1750s, Adams fell in love with Hannah Quincy; while they were alone, he was poised to propose but was interrupted by friends, and the moment was lost. In 1759, he met 15-year-old <a href="Abigail%20Adams">Abigail Smith</a> through his friend Richard Cranch, who was courting Abigail's older sister. Adams initially was not impressed with Abigail and her two sisters, writing that they were not "fond, nor frank, nor candid." In time they grew close and were married on October 25, 1764, despite the opposition of Abigail's haughty mother. They shared a love of books and kindred personalities that proved honest in their praise and criticism of each other. After his father's death in 1761, Adams had inherited a farm and <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams%20Birthplace">a house</a> where they lived until 1783. John and Abigail had six children: <a href="Abigail%20Adams%20Smith">Abigail</a> "Nabby" in 1765, future president <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> in 1767, Susanna in 1768, <a href="Charles%20Adams%20%281770%E2%80%931800%29">Charles</a> in 1770, <a href="Thomas%20Boylston%20Adams%20%281772%E2%80%931832%29">Thomas</a> in 1772, and Elizabeth in 1777. Susanna died when she was one year old, while Elizabeth was stillborn. All three of his sons became lawyers; Charles and Thomas were unsuccessful, became alcoholics, and died young, while John Quincy excelled and launched a career in politics. Adams's writings are devoid of his feelings about the sons' fates.

Adams rose to prominence leading widespread opposition to the <a href="Stamp%20Act%201765">Stamp Act of 1765</a>. The Act was imposed by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">British Parliament</a> without consulting the American legislatures. It required payment of a direct tax by the colonies for stamped documents, and was designed to pay for the costs of Britain's war with France. Power of enforcement was given to British <a href="vice%20admiralty%20court">vice admiralty court</a>s, rather than <a href="common%20law">common law</a> courts. These Admiralty courts acted without juries and were greatly disliked. The Act was despised for both its monetary cost and implementation without colonial consent, and encountered violent resistance, preventing its enforcement. Adams authored the "<a href="Braintree%20Instructions">Braintree Instructions</a>" in 1765, in the form of a letter sent to the representatives of Braintree in the Massachusetts legislature. In it, he explained that the Act should be opposed since it denied two fundamental rights guaranteed to all Englishmen (and which all free men deserved): rights to be taxed only by consent and to be tried by a jury of one's peers. The instructions were a succinct and forthright defense of colonial rights and liberties, and served as a model for other towns' instructions.

Adams also reprised his pen name "Humphrey Ploughjogger" in opposition to the Stamp Act in August of that year. Included were four articles to the "<a href="Boston%20Gazette">Boston Gazette</a>". The articles were republished in "The London Chronicle" in 1768 as "True Sentiments of America", also known as "A Dissertation on the Canon and Feudal Law". He also spoke in December before the governor and council, pronouncing the Stamp Act invalid in the absence of Massachusetts representation at Parliament. He noted that many protests were sparked by a popular sermon of Boston minister <a href="Jonathan%20Mayhew">Jonathan Mayhew</a>, invoking <a href="Epistle%20to%20the%20Romans">Romans 13</a> to justify insurrection. While Adams took a strong stand against the Act in writing, he rebuffed attempts by Samuel Adams, a leader in the popular protest movements, to involve him in mob actions and public demonstrations. In 1766, a town meeting of Braintree elected Adams as a selectman.

With the repeal of the Stamp Act in early 1766, tensions with Britain temporarily eased. Putting politics aside, Adams moved his family to Boston in April 1768 to focus on his law practice. The family rented a clapboard house on <a href="Brattle%20Street%20%28Boston%29">Brattle Street</a> that was known locally as the "White House". He, Abigail, and the children lived there for a year, then moved to Cold Lane; still, later, they moved again to a larger house in Brattle Square in the center of the city. With the death of <a href="Jeremiah%20Gridley">Jeremiah Gridley</a> and mental collapse of Otis, Adams became Boston's most prominent lawyer.

Britain's passage of the <a href="Townshend%20Acts">Townshend Acts</a> in 1767 revived tensions, and an increase in mob violence led the British to dispatch more troops to the colonies. On March 5, 1770, when a lone British sentry was accosted by a mob of citizens, eight of his fellow <a href="29th%20%28Worcestershire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">soldiers</a> reinforced him, and the crowd around them grew to several hundred. The soldiers were struck with snowballs, ice, and stones, and in the chaos the soldiers opened fire, killing five civilians, bringing about the infamous <a href="Boston%20Massacre">Boston Massacre</a>. The accused soldiers were arrested on charges of murder. When no other attorneys would come to their defense, Adams was impelled to do so despite the risk to his reputation – he believed no person should be denied the right to counsel and a fair trial. The trials were delayed so that passions could cool.

The week-long trial of the commander, Captain <a href="Thomas%20Preston%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Thomas Preston</a>, began on October 24 and ended in his acquittal, because it was impossible to prove that he had ordered his soldiers to fire. The remaining soldiers were tried in December when Adams made his legendary argument regarding jury decisions: "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." He added, "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in this world that they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever." Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two, who had fired directly into the crowd, were convicted of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.

According to biographer <a href="John%20E.%20Ferling">John E. Ferling</a>, during <a href="Voir%20dire">jury selection</a> Adams "expertly exercised his right to challenge individual jurors and contrived what amounted to a packed jury. Not only were several jurors closely tied through business arrangements to the British army, but five ultimately became Loyalist exiles." While Adams's defence was helped by a weak prosecution, he also "performed brilliantly." Ferling surmises that Adams may have been encouraged to take the case in exchange for political office; one of Boston's seats opened three months later in the Massachusetts legislature, and Adams was the town's first choice to fill the vacancy.

The prosperity of his law practice increased from this exposure, as did the demands on his time. In 1771, Adams moved his family to Braintree but kept his office in Boston. He noted on the day of the family's move, "Now my family is away, I feel no Inclination at all, no Temptation, to be any where but at my Office. I am in it by 6 in the Morning – I am in it at 9 at night. ... In the Evening, I can be alone at my Office, and no where else." After some time in the capital, he became disenchanted with the rural and "vulgar" Braintree as a home for his family – in August 1772, he moved them back to Boston. He purchased a large brick house on <a href="Court%20Street%20%28Boston%29">Queen Street</a>, not far from his office. In 1774, Adams and Abigail returned the family to the farm due to the increasingly unstable situation in Boston, and Braintree remained their permanent Massachusetts home.

Adams, who had been among the more conservative of the Founders, persistently held that while British actions against the colonies had been wrong and misguided, open insurrection was unwarranted and peaceful petition with the ultimate view of the remaining part of Great Britain was a better alternative. His ideas began to change around 1772, as the British Crown assumed payment of the salaries of Governor <a href="Thomas%20Hutchinson%20%28governor%29">Thomas Hutchinson</a> and his judges instead of the Massachusetts legislature. Adams wrote in the "Gazette" that these measures would destroy judicial independence and place the colonial government in closer subjugation to the Crown. After discontent among members of the legislature, Hutchinson delivered a speech warning that Parliament's powers over the colonies were absolute and that any resistance was illegal. Subsequently, John Adams, Samuel, and <a href="Joseph%20Hawley%20%28Massachusetts%29">Joseph Hawley</a> drafted a resolution adopted by the House of Representatives threatening independence as an alternative to tyranny. The resolution argued that the colonists had never been under the sovereignty of Parliament. Their original charter, as well as their allegiance, was exclusive to the King.

The <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">Boston Tea Party</a>, a historic demonstration against the British <a href="East%20India%20Company">East India Company</a>'s tea monopoly over American merchants, took place on December 16, 1773. The British schooner "Dartmouth", loaded with tea to be traded subject to the new <a href="Tea%20Act">Tea Act</a>, had previously dropped anchor in Boston harbor. By 9:00 PM, the work of the protesters was done – they had demolished 342 chests of tea worth about ten thousand pounds, the 1992 equivalent of about $1 million. The "Dartmouth" owners briefly retained Adams as legal counsel regarding their liability for the destroyed shipment. Adams himself applauded the destruction of the tea, calling it the "grandest Event" in the history of the colonial protest movement, and writing in his diary that the dutied tea's destruction was an "absolutely and indispensably" necessary action.

In 1774, at the instigation of Samuel Adams, the <a href="First%20Continental%20Congress">First Continental Congress</a> was convened in response to the <a href="Intolerable%20Acts">Intolerable Acts</a>, a series of deeply unpopular measures intended to punish Massachusetts, centralize authority in Britain, and prevent rebellion in other colonies. Four delegates were chosen by the Massachusetts legislature, including Adams, who agreed to attend, despite an emotional plea from his friend <a href="Jonathan%20Sewall">Jonathan Sewall</a> not to.

Shortly after he arrived in Philadelphia, Adams was placed on the 23-member Grand Committee tasked with drafting a letter of grievances to <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a>. The members of the committee soon split into conservative and radical factions. Although the Massachusetts delegation was largely passive, Adams criticized conservatives such as <a href="Joseph%20Galloway">Joseph Galloway</a>, <a href="James%20Duane">James Duane</a>, and <a href="Peter%20Oliver%20%28loyalist%29">Peter Oliver</a> who advocated a conciliatory policy towards the British or felt that the colonies had a duty to remain loyal to Britain, although his views at the time did align with those of conservative <a href="John%20Dickinson%20%28Pennsylvania%20and%20Delaware%29">John Dickinson</a>. Adams sought the repeal of objectionable policies, but at this early stage he continued to see benefits for maintaining America's status as a British colony. He renewed his push for the right to a jury trial. He complained of what he considered the pretentiousness of the other delegates, writing to Abigail, "I believe if it was moved and seconded that We should come to a Resolution that Three and two make five We should be entertained with Logick and Rhetorick, Law, History, Politicks and Mathematicks, concerning the Subject for two whole Days, and then We should pass the Resolution unanimously in the Affirmative." Adams ultimately helped engineer a compromise between the conservatives and the radicals. The Congress disbanded in October after sending the final petition to the King and showing its displeasure with the Intolerable Acts by endorsing the <a href="Suffolk%20Resolves">Suffolk Resolves</a>.

Adams's absence from home was hard on Abigail, who was left alone to care for the family. She still encouraged her husband in his task, writing: "You cannot be, I know, nor do I wish to see you an inactive Spectator, but if the Sword be drawn I bid adieu to all domestick felicity, and look forward to that Country where there is neither wars nor rumors of War in a firm belief that thro the mercy of its King we shall both rejoice there together."

News of the opening hostilities with the British at the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a> made Adams hope that independence would soon become a reality. Three days after the battle, he rode into a militia camp and, while reflecting positively on the high spirits of the men, was distressed by their poor condition and lack of discipline. A month later, Adams returned to Philadelphia for the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> as the leader of the Massachusetts delegation. He moved cautiously at first, noting that the Congress was divided between <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Loyalists</a>, those favoring independence, and those hesitant to take any position. He became convinced that Congress was moving in the proper direction – away from Great Britain. Publicly, Adams supported "reconciliation if practicable," but privately agreed with <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>'s confidential observation that independence was inevitable.

In June 1775, with a view of promoting union among the colonies against Great Britain, he nominated <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> of Virginia as commander-in-chief of the <a href="Continental%20Army">army</a> then assembled around Boston. He praised Washington's "skill and experience" as well as his "excellent universal character." Adams opposed various attempts, including the <a href="Olive%20Branch%20Petition">Olive Branch Petition</a>, aimed at trying to find peace between the colonies and Great Britain. Invoking the already-long list of British actions against the colonies, he wrote, "In my opinion Powder and Artillery are the most efficacious, Sure, and infallibly conciliatory Measures We can adopt." After his failure to prevent the petition from being enacted, he wrote a private letter derisively referring to Dickinson as a "piddling genius." The letter was intercepted and published in Loyalist newspapers. The well-respected Dickinson refused to greet Adams and he was for a time largely ostracized. Ferling writes, "By the fall of 1775 no one in Congress labored more ardently than Adams to hasten the day when America would be separate from Great Britain." In October 1775, Adams was appointed the chief judge of the Massachusetts Superior Court, but he never served, and resigned in February 1777. In response to queries from other delegates, Adams wrote the 1776 pamphlet "<a href="Thoughts%20on%20Government">Thoughts on Government</a>", which laid out an influential framework for republican constitutions.

Throughout the first half of 1776, Adams grew increasingly impatient with what he perceived to be the slow pace of declaring independence. He kept busy on the floor of the Congress, helping push through a plan to outfit armed ships to launch raids on enemy vessels. Later in the year, he drafted the first set of regulations to govern the provisional navy. Adams drafted the preamble to the <a href="Lee%20resolution">Lee resolution</a> of colleague <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Lee">Richard Henry Lee</a>. He developed a rapport with Delegate <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> of Virginia, who had been slower to support independence but by early 1776 agreed that it was necessary. On June 7, 1776, Adams seconded the resolution, which stated, "These colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent states."

Prior to independence being declared, Adams organized and selected a <a href="Committee%20of%20Five">Committee of Five</a> charged with drafting a Declaration of Independence. He chose himself, Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, <a href="Robert%20R.%20Livingston%20%28chancellor%29">Robert R. Livingston</a> and <a href="Roger%20Sherman">Roger Sherman</a>. Jefferson thought Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the Committee to choose Jefferson. Adams recorded his exchange with Jefferson on the question: Jefferson asked, "Why will you not? You ought to do it." To which Adams responded, "I will not – reasons enough." Jefferson replied, "What can be your reasons?" And Adams responded, "Reason first, you are a Virginian, and a Virginian ought to appear at the head of this business. Reason second, I am obnoxious, suspected, and unpopular. You are very much otherwise. Reason third, you can write ten times better than I can." "Well," said Jefferson, "if you are decided, I will do as well as I can." The Committee left no minutes, and the drafting process itself remains uncertain. Accounts written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, although frequently cited, are often contradictory. Although the first draft was written primarily by Jefferson, Adams assumed a major role in its completion. On July 1, the resolution was debated in Congress. It was expected to pass, but opponents such as Dickinson made a strong effort to oppose it anyhow. Jefferson, a poor debater, remained silent while Adams argued for its adoption. Many years later, Jefferson hailed Adams as "the pillar of [the Declaration's] support on the floor of Congress, [its] ablest advocate and defender against the multifarious assaults it encountered." After editing <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">the document</a> further, Congress approved it on July 2. Twelve colonies voted in the affirmative, while New York abstained. Dickinson was absent. On July 3, Adams wrote to Abigail that "yesterday was decided the greatest question which was ever debated in America, and a greater perhaps never was nor will be decided among men." He predicted that "[t]he second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America," and would be commemorated annually with great festivities.

In June, Adams became head of the <a href="Board%20of%20War%20and%20Ordnance">Board of War and Ordnance</a>, charged with keeping an accurate record of the officers in the army and their ranks, the disposition of troops throughout the colonies, and ammunition. He sat on ninety committees, chairing twenty-five, an unmatched workload among the congressmen. As <a href="Benjamin%20Rush">Benjamin Rush</a> reported, he was acknowledged "to be the first man in the House." He was referred to as a "one man war department," working up to eighteen-hour days and mastering the details of raising, equipping and fielding an army under civilian control. He authored the "Plan of Treaties," laying out the Congress's requirements for a treaty with France. As chairman of the Board, Adams functioned as a "de facto" Secretary of War. He kept extensive correspondences with a wide range of <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> officers concerning supplies, munitions, and tactics. Adams emphasized to them the role of discipline in keeping an army orderly. He was worn out by the rigor of his duties and longed to return home. His finances were unsteady, and the money that he received as a delegate failed even to cover his own necessary expenses. However, the crisis caused by the defeat of the American soldiers kept him at his post.

After defeating the Continental Army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Long%20Island">Battle of Long Island</a> on August 27, British Admiral <a href="Richard%20Howe%2C%201st%20Earl%20Howe">Richard Howe</a> determined that a strategic advantage was at hand, and requested that Congress send representatives to negotiate peace. A delegation consisting of Adams, Franklin, and <a href="Edward%20Rutledge">Edward Rutledge</a>, met with Howe at the <a href="Staten%20Island%20Peace%20Conference">Staten Island Peace Conference</a> on September 11. Howe's authority was premised on the states' submission, so the parties found no common ground. When Lord Howe stated he could only view the American delegates as British subjects, Adams replied, "Your lordship may consider me in what light you please, ... except that of a British subject." Adams learned many years later that his name was on a list of people specifically excluded from Howe's pardon-granting authority. Adams was unimpressed with Howe and predicted American success. He was able to return home to Braintree in October before leaving in January of 1777 to resume his duties in Congress.

Before the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776, Adams advocated in Congress that independence was necessary to establish trade, and conversely, trade was essential for the attainment of independence; he specifically urged negotiation of a commercial treaty with <a href="Early%20modern%20France">France</a>. He was then appointed, along with Franklin, Dickinson, <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison%20V">Benjamin Harrison</a> of Virginia and Robert Morris of Pennsylvania, "to prepare a plan of treaties to be proposed to foreign powers." While Jefferson was laboring over the Declaration of Independence, Adams worked on the <a href="Model%20Treaty">Model Treaty</a>. The Model Treaty authorized a commercial agreement with France but contained no provisions for formal recognition or military assistance. There were provisions for what constituted French territory. The treaty adhered to the provision that "<a href="freedom%20of%20navigation">free ships make free goods</a>," allowing neutral nations to trade reciprocally while exempting an agreed upon list of contraband. By late 1777, America's finances were in tatters, and that September a British army had <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">defeated</a> General Washington and captured Philadelphia. More Americans came to determine that mere commercial ties between the U.S. and France would not be enough, and that military assistance would be needed to end the war. The defeat of the British at <a href="Battles%20of%20Saratoga">Saratoga</a> was expected to help induce France to agree to an alliance.

In November, Adams learned that he was to be named commissioner to France, replacing <a href="Silas%20Deane">Silas Deane</a> and joining Franklin and <a href="Arthur%20Lee%20%28diplomat%29">Arthur Lee</a> in Paris to negotiate an alliance with the hesitant French. <a href="James%20Lovell%20%28Continental%20Congress%29">James Lovell</a> invoked Adams's "inflexible integrity" and the need to have a youthful man who could counterbalance Franklin's advanced age. On November 27, Adams accepted, wasting no time. He wrote to Lovell that he "should have wanted no motives or arguments" for his acceptance if he "could be sure that the public would be benefited by it." Abigail was left in Massachusetts to manage their home, but it was agreed that 10-year-old John Quincy would go with Adams, for the experience was "of inestimable value" to his maturation. On February 17, Adams set sail aboard the <a href="frigate">frigate</a> "<a href="USS%20Boston%20%281777%29">Boston</a>", commanded by Captain <a href="Samuel%20Tucker">Samuel Tucker</a>. The trip was stormy and treacherous. Lightning injured 19 sailors and killed one. The ship was pursued by several British vessels, with Adams taking up arms to help capture one. A cannon malfunction killed one of the crew and injured five others. On April 1, the "Boston" arrived in Spain, where Adams learned that France had agreed to an <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alliance%20%281778%29">alliance</a> with the United States on February 6. Shortly after, they arrived in France. Adams was annoyed by the other two commissioners: Lee, whom he thought paranoid and cynical, and the popular and influential Franklin, whom he found lethargic and overly deferential and accommodating to the French. He assumed a less visible role but helped manage the delegation's finances and record-keeping. Frustrated by the perceived lack of commitment on the part of the French, Adams wrote a letter to French foreign minister <a href="Charles%20Gravier%2C%20comte%20de%20Vergennes">Vergennes</a> in December, arguing for French naval support in North America. Franklin toned down the letter, but Vergennes still ignored it. In September 1778, Congress increased Franklin's powers by naming him <a href="minister%20plenipotentiary">minister plenipotentiary</a> to France while Lee was sent to Spain. Adams received no instructions. Frustrated by the apparent slight, he departed France with John Quincy on March 8, 1779. On August 2, they arrived in Braintree.
In late 1779, Adams was appointed as the sole minister charged with negotiations to establish a commercial treaty with Britain and end the war. Following the conclusion of the Massachusetts constitutional convention, he departed for France in November aboard the French frigate "Sensible" – accompanied by John Quincy and 9-year-old son Charles. Constant disagreement between Lee and Franklin eventually resulted in Adams assuming the role of tie-breaker in almost all votes on commission business. He increased his usefulness by mastering the French language. Lee was eventually recalled. Adams closely supervised his sons' education while writing to Abigail about once every ten days.

In contrast to Franklin, Adams viewed the Franco-American alliance pessimistically. The French, he believed, were involved for their own self-interest, and he grew frustrated by what he saw as their sluggishness in providing substantial aid to the Revolution. The French, Adams wrote, meant to keep their hands "above our chin to prevent us from drowning, but not to lift our heads out of water." In March 1780, Congress, trying to curb inflation, voted to devalue the dollar. Vergennes summoned Adams for a meeting. In a letter sent in June, he insisted that any fluctuation of the dollar value without an exception for French merchants was unacceptable and requested that Adams write to Congress asking it to "retrace its steps." Adams bluntly defended the decision, not only claiming that the French merchants were doing better than Vergennes implied but voicing other grievances he had with the French. The alliance had been made over two years before. During that period, an army under the <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Donatien%20de%20Vimeur%2C%20comte%20de%20Rochambeau">comte de Rochambeau</a> had been sent to assist Washington, but it had yet to do anything of significance and America was expecting French warships. These were needed, Adams wrote, to contain the British armies in the port cities and contend with the powerful British Navy. However, the French Navy had been sent not to the United States but to the West Indies to protect French interests there. France, Adams believed, needed to commit itself more fully to the alliance. Vergennes responded that he would deal only with Franklin, who sent a letter back to Congress critical of Adams. Adams then left France of his own accord.

In mid-1780, Adams traveled to the <a href="Dutch%20Republic">Dutch Republic</a>. One of the few other existing republics at the time, Adams thought it might be sympathetic to the American cause. Securing a Dutch loan could increase American independence from France and pressure Britain into peace. At first, Adams had no official status, but in July he was formally given permission to negotiate for a loan and took up residence in <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> in August. Adams was originally optimistic and greatly enjoyed the city, but soon became disappointed. The Dutch, fearing British retaliation, refused to meet Adams. Before he had arrived, the British found out about secret aid the Dutch had sent to the Americans, the British authorized reprisals against their ships, which only increased their apprehension. Word had also reached Europe of American battlefield defeats. After five months of not meeting with a single Dutch official, Adams in early 1781 pronounced Amsterdam "the capital of the reign of <a href="Mammon">Mammon</a>." He was finally invited to present his credentials as ambassador to the Dutch government at <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> on April 19, 1781, but they did not promise any assistance. In the meantime, Adams thwarted an attempt by neutral European powers to mediate the war without consulting the United States. In July, Adams consented to the departure of both of his sons; John Quincy went with Adams's secretary <a href="Francis%20Dana">Francis Dana</a> to <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> as a <a href="French%20language">French</a> interpreter, in an effort to seek recognition from <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, and a homesick Charles returned home with Adams's friend <a href="Benjamin%20Waterhouse">Benjamin Waterhouse</a>. In August, shortly after being removed from his position of sole head of peace treaty negotiations, Adams fell seriously ill in "a major nervous breakdown." That November, he learned that American and French troops had decisively defeated the British at <a href="Siege%20of%20Yorktown">Yorktown</a>. The victory was in large part due to the assistance of the French Navy, which vindicated Adams's stand for increased naval assistance.

News of the American triumph at Yorktown convulsed Europe. In January 1782, after recovering, Adams arrived at The Hague to demand that the <a href="States%20General%20of%20the%20Netherlands">States General of the Netherlands</a> answer his petitions. His efforts stalled, and he took his cause to the people, successfully capitalizing on popular pro-American sentiment to push the States General towards recognizing the U.S. Several provinces began recognizing American independence. On April 19, the States General in The Hague formally recognized American independence and acknowledged Adams as ambassador. On June 11, with the aid of the Dutch <a href="Patriottentijd">"Patriotten"</a> leader <a href="Joan%20van%20der%20Capellen%20tot%20den%20Pol">Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol</a>, Adams negotiated a loan of five million guilders. In October, he negotiated with the Dutch a treaty of amity and commerce. The house that Adams bought during this stay in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a> became the first American embassy on foreign soil.

After negotiating the loan with the Dutch, Adams was re-appointed as the American commissioner to negotiate the war-ending treaty, the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a>. Vergennes still disapproved of Adams, so Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, <a href="John%20Jay">John Jay</a>, and <a href="Henry%20Laurens">Henry Laurens</a> were appointed to collaborate with Adams, although Jefferson did not go to Europe and Laurens was posted to the Dutch Republic.

In the final negotiations, securing fishing rights off <a href="Newfoundland">Newfoundland</a> and <a href="Cape%20Breton%20Island">Cape Breton Island</a> proved both very important and very difficult. In response to very strict restrictions proposed by the British, Adams insisted that not only should American fishermen be allowed to travel as close to shore as desired, but that they should be allowed to cure their fish on the shores of Newfoundland. This, and other statements prompted Vergennes to secretly inform the British that France did not feel compelled to "sustain [these] pretentious ambitions." Overruling Franklin and distrustful of Vergennes, Jay and Adams decided not to consult with France, instead of dealing directly with the British. During these negotiations, Adams mentioned to the British that his proposed fishing terms were more generous than those offered by France in 1778, and that accepting would foster goodwill between Britain and the United States while putting pressure on France. Britain agreed, and the two sides worked out other provisions afterward. Vergennes was angered when he learned from Franklin of the American duplicity, but did not demand renegotiation, and was supposedly surprised at how much the Americans could extract. The independent negotiations allowed the French to plead innocence to their Spanish allies, whose demands for <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> might have caused significant problems. On September 3, 1783, the treaty was signed and American independence was recognized.

Adams was appointed the first <a href="List%20of%20ambassadors%20of%20the%20United%20States%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">American ambassador to Great Britain</a> in 1785. When a counterpart assumed that Adams had family in England, Adams replied, "Neither my father or mother, grandfather or grandmother, great grandfather or great grandmother, nor any other relation that I know of, or care a farthing for, has been in England these one hundred and fifty years; so that you see I have not one drop of blood in my veins but what is American."
After arriving in London from Paris, Adams had his first audience with <a href="King%20George%20III">King George III</a> on June 1, which he meticulously recorded in a letter to Foreign Minister Jay the next day. The pair's exchange was respectful; Adams promised to do all that he could to restore friendship and cordiality "between People who, tho Seperated [sic] by an Ocean and under different Governments have the Same Language, a Similar Religion and kindred Blood," and the King agreed to "receive with Pleasure, the Assurances of the friendly Dispositions of the United States." The King added that although "he had been the last to consent" to American independence, he wanted Adams to know that he had always done what he thought was right. Towards its end, he startled Adams by commenting that "There is an Opinion, among Some People, that you are not the most attached of all Your Countrymen, to the manners of France." Adams replied, "That Opinion sir, is not mistaken, I must avow to your Majesty, I have no Attachments but to my own Country." To this King George responded, "An honest Man will never have any other."

Adams was joined by Abigail while in London. Suffering the hostility of the King's courtiers, they escaped when they could by seeking out <a href="Richard%20Price">Richard Price</a>, minister of <a href="Newington%20Green%20Unitarian%20Church">Newington Green Unitarian Church</a> and instigator of the <a href="Revolution%20Controversy">debate over the Revolution</a> within Britain. Adams corresponded with his sons John Quincy and Charles, both of whom were at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard</a>, cautioning the former against the "smell of the midnight lamp" while admonishing the latter to devote sufficient time to study. Jefferson visited Adams in 1786 while serving as Minister to France; the two toured the countryside and saw many British historical sites. While in London, he briefly met his old friend Jonathan Sewall, but the two discovered that they had grown too far apart to renew their friendship. Adams considered Sewall one of the war's casualties, and Sewall critiqued him as an ambassador:

Adams's tenure in Britain was complicated by both countries failing to follow their treaty obligations. The American states had been delinquent in paying debts owed to British merchants, and in response, the British refused to vacate forts in the northwest as promised. Adams's attempts to resolve this dispute failed, and he was often frustrated by a lack of news of progress from home. The news he received of tumult at home, such as <a href="Shays%27%20Rebellion">Shays' Rebellion</a>, heightened his anxiety. He then asked Jay to be relieved; in 1788, he took his leave of George III, who engaged Adams in polite and formal conversation, promising to uphold his end of the treaty once America did the same. Adams then went to <a href="The%20Hague">The Hague</a> to take formal leave of his ambassadorship there and to secure refinancing from the Dutch, allowing the United States to meet obligations on earlier loans.

On June 17, Adams arrived back in Massachusetts to a triumphant welcome. He returned to farming life in the months after. The nation's first <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201789">presidential election</a> was soon to take place. Because George Washington was widely expected to win the presidency, many felt that the vice presidency should go to a northerner. Although he made no public comments on the matter, Adams was the primary contender. Each state's <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">presidential electors</a> gathered on February 4, 1789, to cast their . The person with the most votes would be president and the second would become vice president. Adams received 34 <a href="United%20States%20Electoral%20College">electoral college</a> votes in the election, second place behind George Washington, who garnered 69 votes. As a result, Washington became the nation's <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">first president</a>, and Adams became its first <a href="List%20of%20Vice%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a>. Adams finished well ahead of all others except Washington, but was still offended by Washington receiving more than twice as many votes. To Benjamin Rush, he wrote, "Is not my election to this office, in the dark and scurvy manner in which it was done, a curse rather than a blessing?" Unbeknownst to Adams, <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> convinced many electors to not vote for him, under the pretext of not embarrassing Washington, to be absolutely sure that Adams did not win.

Although his term was scheduled to start on March 4, 1789, Adams did not become Vice President of the United States, until April 21, because <a href="1st%20United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> could not initially achieve a <a href="quorum">quorum</a>.

The sole constitutionally prescribed responsibility of the vice president is to preside over the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a>, where he can cast a tie-breaking vote. Early in his term, Adams became deeply involved in a lengthy Senate controversy over the official titles for the president and executive officers of the new government. Although the House agreed that the president should be addressed simply as "George Washington, President of the United States", the Senate debated the issue at some length. Adams favored the adoption of the style of "Highness" (as well as the title of "Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties") for the president. Some senators favored a variant of "Highness" or the lesser "Excellency"." <a href="Anti-Federalism">Anti-federalists</a> in the Senate objected to the monarchical sound of them all; Jefferson described them as "superlatively ridiculous." The Senate emphasized simplicity and republicanism, and many argued that these "distinctions," as Adams called them, violated the Constitution's <a href="Title%20of%20Nobility%20Clause">prohibition on titles of nobility</a>. Adams argued that the distinctions were necessary because the highest office of the United States must be marked with "dignity and splendor" to command respect. He was widely derided for his combative nature and stubbornness, especially as he actively debated and lectured the senators. "For forty minutes he harangued us from the chair," wrote Senator <a href="William%20Maclay%20%28Pennsylvania%20senator%29">William Maclay</a> of Pennsylvania. Maclay became Adams's fiercest opponent and repeatedly expressed personal contempt for him in both public and private. He likened Adams to "a monkey just put into breeches." <a href="Ralph%20Izard">Ralph Izard</a> suggested that Adams be referred to by the title "His Rotundity," a joke which soon became popular. On May 14, the Senate decided that the title of "<a href="Mr.%20President%20%28title%29">Mr. President</a>" would be used. Privately, Adams conceded that his vice presidency had begun poorly and that perhaps he had been out of the country too long to know the sentiment of the people. Washington quietly expressed his displeasure with the fuss and rarely consulted Adams.
As vice president, Adams largely sided with the Washington administration and the emerging <a href="Federalist%20Party">Federalist Party</a>. He supported Washington's policies against opposition from anti-Federalists and <a href="Democratic-Republican%20Party">Republicans</a>. He cast 31 <a href="List%20of%20tie-breaking%20votes%20cast%20by%20vice%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">tie-breaking votes</a>, all in support of the administration, and more than any other vice president. In 1790, Jefferson, <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>, and Hamilton struck a <a href="Compromise%20of%201790">bargain</a> guaranteeing Republican support for Hamilton's <a href="Funding%20Act%20of%201790">debt assumption plan</a> in exchange for the capital being temporarily moved from New York to <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, and then to a permanent site on the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> to placate Southerners. In the Senate, Adams cast a tie-breaking nay vote against a last-minute motion to keep the capital in New York. In another instance, he voted against a bill sponsored by Maclay that would have required Senate consent for the removal of executive branch officials who had been confirmed by the Senate.

Adams played a minor role in politics as vice president. He attended few <a href="Presidency%20of%20George%20Washington%23Cabinet">cabinet</a> meetings, and the president sought his counsel infrequently. While Adams brought energy and dedication to the office, by mid-1789 he had already found it "not quite adapted to my character ... too inactive, and mechanical." He wrote, "My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man ... or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived." Adams's behavior made him a target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, he grew accustomed to assuming a marginal role, and rarely intervened in debate. Adams never questioned Washington's courage or patriotism, but Washington did join Franklin and others as the object of Adams's ire or envy. "The History of our Revolution will be one continued lie," Adams declared. "... The essence of the whole will be that Dr. Franklin's <a href="Lightning%20rod%23America">electrical Rod</a> smote the Earth and out sprung General Washington. That Franklin electrified him with his Rod – and henceforth these two conducted all the Policy, Negotiations, Legislatures and War." Adams won reelection with little difficulty in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201792">1792</a> with 77 votes. His strongest challenger, <a href="George%20Clinton%20%28vice%20president%29">George Clinton</a>, had 50.

On July 14, 1789, the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> began. Republicans were jubilant. Adams at first expressed cautious optimism, but soon began denouncing the revolutionaries as barbarous and tyrannical. Washington eventually consulted Adams more often, but not until near the end of his administration, by which point Hamilton, Jefferson, and <a href="Edmund%20Randolph">Edmund Randolph</a> had all resigned. The British had been raiding American trading vessels, and John Jay was sent to London to negotiate an end to hostilities. When he returned with a <a href="Jay%20Treaty">peace treaty</a> on terms unfavorable to the United States, Adams urged Washington to sign it to prevent war. Washington chose to do so, igniting protests and riots. He was accused of surrendering American honor to a tyrannical monarchy and of turning his back on the French Republic. John Adams predicted in a letter to Abigail that ratification would deeply divide the nation.

The election of 1796 was the first contested American presidential election. Twice, George Washington had been elected to office unanimously but, during his <a href="presidency%20of%20George%20Washington">presidency</a>, deep philosophical differences between the two leading figures in the administration – Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson – had caused a rift, leading to the founding of the Federalist Party and Republican parties. When Washington announced that he would not be a candidate for a third term, an intense <a href="Partisan%20%28political%29">partisan</a> struggle for control of Congress and the presidency began.

Like the previous two presidential elections, no candidates were put forward for voters to choose between in 1796. The Constitution provided for the selection of electors who would then choose a president. In seven states voters chose the presidential electors. In the remaining nine states, they were chosen by the state's legislature. The clear Republican favorite was Jefferson. Adams was the Federalist frontrunner. The Republicans held a <a href="congressional%20nominating%20caucus">congressional nominating caucus</a> and named Jefferson and <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a> as their presidential choices. Jefferson at first declined the nomination, but he agreed to run a few weeks later. Federalist members of Congress held an informal nominating caucus and named Adams and <a href="Thomas%20Pinckney">Thomas Pinckney</a> as their candidates. The campaign was, for the most part, confined to newspaper attacks, pamphlets, and political rallies; of the four contenders, only Burr actively campaigned. The practice of not campaigning for office would remain for many decades. Adams stated that he wanted to stay out of what he called the "silly and wicked game" of electioneering.

As the campaign progressed, fears grew among Hamilton and his supporters that Adams was too vain, opinionated, unpredictable and stubborn to follow their directions. Indeed, Adams felt largely left out of Washington's administration and did not consider himself a strong member of the Federalist Party. He had remarked that Hamilton's economic program, centered around banks, would "swindle" the poor and unleash the "gangrene of avarice." Desiring "a more pliant president than Adams," Hamilton maneuvered to tip the election to Pinckney. He coerced South Carolina Federalist electors, pledged to vote for "<a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a>" Pinckney, to scatter their second votes among candidates other than Adams. Hamilton's scheme was undone when several <a href="New%20England">New England</a> state electors heard of it and agreed not to vote for Pinckney. Adams wrote shortly after the election that Hamilton was a "proud Spirited, conceited, aspiring Mortal always pretending to Morality, with as debauched Morals as old Franklin who is more his Model than any one I know." Throughout his life, Adams made highly critical statements about Hamilton. He made derogatory references to his womanizing, real or alleged, and slurred him as the "<a href="Creole%20peoples">Creole</a> bastard."

In the end, Adams won the presidency by a narrow margin, receiving 71 electoral votes to 68 for Jefferson, who became the vice president; Pinckney finished in third with 59 votes, and Burr came in fourth with 30. The balance of the Electoral College votes were dispersed among nine other candidates. This is the only election to date in which a president and vice president were elected from opposing tickets.

Adams was <a href="Inauguration%20of%20John%20Adams">sworn into office</a> as the nation's second president on March 4, 1797, by <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="Oliver%20Ellsworth">Oliver Ellsworth</a>. As president, he followed Washington's lead in using the presidency to exemplify republican values and <a href="civic%20virtue">civic virtue</a>, and his service was free of scandal. Adams spent much of his term at his Massachusetts home <a href="Peacefield">Peacefield</a>, preferring the quietness of domestic life to business at the capital. He ignored the political patronage and office seekers which other office holders utilized.

Historians debate his decision to retain the members of Washington's cabinet in light of the cabinet's loyalty to Hamilton. The "Hamiltonians who surround him," Jefferson soon remarked, "are only a little less hostile to him than to me." Although aware of Hamilton's influence, Adams was convinced that their retention ensured a smoother succession. Adams maintained the economic programs of Hamilton, who regularly consulted with key cabinet members, especially the powerful Treasury Secretary, <a href="Oliver%20Wolcott%20Jr.">Oliver Wolcott Jr.</a> Adams was in other respects quite independent of his cabinet, often making decisions despite opposition from it. Hamilton had grown accustomed to being regularly consulted by Washington. Shortly after Adams was inaugurated, Hamilton sent him a detailed letter filled with policy suggestions for the new administration. Adams dismissively ignored it.

Historian <a href="Joseph%20Ellis">Joseph Ellis</a> writes that "[t]he Adams presidency was destined to be dominated by a single question of American policy to an extent seldom if ever encountered by any succeeding occupant of the office." That question was whether to make war with France or find peace. In Europe, <a href="French%20Revolutionary%20Wars">Britain and France were at war</a> as a result of the French Revolution. Hamilton and the Federalists favored the British monarchy against what they perceived to be the political and anti-religious radicalism of the French Revolution, while Jefferson and the Republicans, with their firm opposition to monarchy, strongly supported France. The French had supported Jefferson for president and became even more belligerent at his loss. When Adams entered office, he decided to continue Washington's policy of staying out of the war. Because of the Jay Treaty, the French saw America as Britain's junior partner and began seizing American merchant ships that were trading with the British. Most Americans were still pro-French due to France's assistance during the Revolution, the perceived humiliation of the Jay Treaty, and their desire to support a republic against the British monarchy, and would not tolerate war with France.

On May 16, 1797, Adams gave a speech to the House and Senate in which he called for increasing defense capabilities in case of war with France. He announced that he would send a peace commission to France but simultaneously called for a military buildup to counter any potential French threat. The speech was well received by the Federalists. Adams was depicted as an eagle holding an olive branch in one talon and the "emblems of defense" in the other. The Republicans were outraged, for Adams had not only failed to express support for the cause of the French Republic but appeared to be calling for war against it.

Sentiments changed with the <a href="XYZ%20Affair">XYZ Affair</a>. The peace commission that Adams appointed consisted of <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a>, <a href="Charles%20Cotesworth%20Pinckney">Charles Cotesworth Pinckney</a> and <a href="Elbridge%20Gerry">Elbridge Gerry</a>. Jefferson met four times with Joseph Letombe, the French consul in Philadelphia. Letombe wrote to Paris stating that Jefferson had told him that it was in France's best interest to treat the American ministers civilly but "then drag out the negotiations at length" to arrive at most favorable solution. According to Letombe, Jefferson called Adams "vain, suspicious, and stubborn." When the envoys arrived in October, they were kept waiting for several days, and then granted only a 15-minute meeting with French Foreign Minister <a href="Charles%20Maurice%20de%20Talleyrand-P%C3%A9rigord">Talleyrand</a>. The diplomats were then met by three of Talleyrand's agents. The French emissaries (later code-named, X, Y, and Z) refused to conduct negotiations unless the United States paid enormous bribes, one to Talleyrand personally, and another to the Republic of France. Supposedly this was to make up for offenses given to France by Adams in his speech. The Americans refused to negotiate on such terms. Marshall and Pinckney returned home, while Gerry remained.

News of the disastrous peace mission arrived in the form of a memorandum from Marshall on March 4, 1798. Adams, not wanting to incite violent impulses among the populace, announced that the mission had failed without providing details. He also sent a message to Congress asking for a renewal of the nation's defenses. The Republicans frustrated the president's defense measures. Suspecting that he might be hiding material favorable to France, the House, with the support of Federalists who had heard rumors of what was contained in the messages and were happy to assist the Republicans, voted overwhelmingly to demand that Adams release the papers. Once they were released, the Republicans, according to Abigail, were "struck dumb." <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Bache%20%28journalist%29">Benjamin Franklin Bache</a>, editor of the "<a href="Philadelphia%20Aurora">Philadelphia Aurora</a>," blamed Adams's aggression as the cause of the disaster. Among the general public, the effects were very different. The affair substantially weakened popular American support of France. Adams reached the height of his popularity as many in the country called for full-scale war against the French.

Despite the XYZ Affair, Republican opposition persisted. Federalists accused the French and their associated immigrants of provoking civil unrest. In an attempt to quell the outcry, the Federalists introduced, and the Congress passed, a series of laws collectively referred to as the <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>, which were signed by Adams in June 1798. Congress specifically passed four measures – the <a href="Naturalization%20Act%20of%201798">Naturalization Act</a>, the Alien Friends Act, the Alien Enemies Act and the Sedition Act. All came within a period of two weeks, in what Jefferson called an "unguarded passion." The Alien Friends Act, Alien Enemies Act, and Naturalization Acts targeted immigrants, specifically French, by giving the president greater deportation authority and increasing citizenship requirements. The Sedition Act made it a crime to publish "false, scandalous, and malicious writing" against the government or its officials. Adams had not promoted any of these acts, but was urged to sign them by his wife and cabinet. He eventually agreed and signed the bills into law.
The administration initiated fourteen or more indictments under the Sedition Act, as well as suits against five of the six most prominent Republican newspapers. The majority of the legal actions began in 1798 and 1799, and went to trial on the eve of the 1800 presidential election. Other historians have cited evidence that the Alien and Sedition Acts were rarely enforced, namely: 1) only 10 convictions under the Sedition Act have been identified; 2) Adams never signed a deportation order; and 3) the sources of expressed furor over the acts were Republicans. The Acts allowed for prosecution of many who opposed the Federalists. Congressman <a href="Matthew%20Lyon">Matthew Lyon</a> of Vermont was sentenced to four months in jail for criticizing the president. Adams resisted Pickering's attempts to deport aliens, although many left on their own, largely in response to the hostile environment. Republicans were outraged. Jefferson, disgusted by the acts, wrote nothing publicly but partnered with Madison to secretly draft the <a href="Kentucky%20and%20Virginia%20Resolutions">Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions</a>. Jefferson, writing for Kentucky, wrote that states had the "natural right" to <a href="Nullification%20%28U.S.%20Constitution%29">nullify</a> any acts they deemed unconstitutional. Writing to Madison, he speculated that as a last resort the states might have to "sever ourselves from the union we so much value." Federalists reacted bitterly to the resolutions, which were to have far more lasting implications for the country than the Alien and Sedition Acts. Still, the acts Adams signed into law energized and unified the Republican Party while doing little to unite the Federalists.

In May 1798, a French privateer captured a merchant vessel off of the New York Harbor. An increase in attacks on sea marked the beginning of the undeclared naval war known as the <a href="Quasi-War">Quasi-War</a>. Adams knew that America would be unable to win a major conflict, both because of its internal divisions and because France at the time was dominating the fight in most of Europe. He pursued a strategy whereby America harassed French ships in an effort sufficient to stem the French assaults on American interests. In May, shortly after the attack in New York, Congress created a separate Navy Department. The prospect of a French invasion of the U.S. mainland led for calls to build up the army. Hamilton and other "High Federalists" were particularly adamant that a large army be called up, in spite of a common fear, particularly among Republicans, that large standing armies were subversive to liberty. In May, a "provisional" army of 10,000 soldiers was authorized by Congress. In July, Congress created twelve infantry regiments and provided for six cavalry companies. These numbers exceeded Adams's requests but fell short of Hamilton's.

Adams was pressured by Federalists to appoint Hamilton, who had served as Washington's aide-de-camp during the Revolution, to command the army. Distrustful of Hamilton and fearing a plot to subvert his administration, Adams appointed Washington to command the army without consulting him. Washington was surprised, and as a condition of his acceptance demanded that he be permitted to appoint his own subordinates. He wished to have <a href="Henry%20Knox">Henry Knox</a> as second-in-command, followed by Hamilton, and then Charles Pinckney. On June 2, Hamilton wrote to Washington stating that he would not serve unless he was made Inspector General and second-in-command. Washington conceded that Hamilton, despite holding a rank lower than that of Knox and Pinckney, had, by serving on his staff, more opportunity to comprehend the whole military scene, and should therefore outrank them. Adams sent Secretary of War McHenry to <a href="Mount%20Vernon">Mount Vernon</a> to convince Washington to accept the post. McHenry put forth his opinion that Washington would not serve unless permitted to choose his own officers. Adams had intended to appoint Republicans Burr and <a href="Frederick%20Muhlenberg">Frederick Muhlenberg</a> to make the army appear bipartisan. Washington's list consisted entirely of Federalists. Adams relented and agreed to submit to the Senate the names of Hamilton, Pinckney, and Knox, in that order, although final decisions of rank would be reserved to Adams. Knox refused to serve under these conditions. Adams firmly intended to give to Hamilton the lowest possible rank, while Washington and many other Federalists wrongly insisted that the order in which the names had been submitted to the Senate must determine seniority. On September 21, Adams received a letter from McHenry relaying a statement from Washington threatening to resign if Hamilton were not made second-in-command. Adams knew of the backlash that he would receive from Federalists should he continue his course, and he was forced to capitulate despite bitter resentment against many of his fellow Federalists. The severe illness of Abigail, whom Adams was feared was near death, exacerbated his suffering and frustration.
It quickly became apparent that due to Washington's advanced age, Hamilton was the army's "de facto" commander. He exerted effective control over the War Department, taking over supplies for the army. Meanwhile, Adams built up the Navy, adding <a href="six%20original%20United%20States%20frigates">six fast, powerful frigates</a>, most notably the <a href="USS%20Constitution">USS "Constitution"</a>.

The Quasi-War continued, but there was a noticeable decline in war fever beginning in the fall once news arrived of the French defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Nile">Battle of the Nile</a>, which many Americans hoped would make them more disposed to negotiate. In October, Adams heard from Gerry in Paris that the French wanted to make peace and would properly receive an American delegation. That December in his address to Congress, Adams relayed these statements while expressing the need to maintain adequate defenses. The speech angered both Federalists, including Hamilton, many of whom had wanted a request for a declaration of war, and Republicans. Hamilton secretly promoted a plan, already rejected by Adams, in which American and British troops would combine to seize <a href="Spanish%20Florida">Spanish Florida</a> and <a href="Louisiana%20%28New%20Spain%29">Louisiana</a>, ostensibly to deter a possible French invasion. Hamilton's critics, including Abigail, saw in his military buildups the signs of an aspiring military dictator.

On February 18, 1799, Adams surprised many by nominating diplomat <a href="William%20Vans%20Murray">William Vans Murray</a> on a peace mission to France. The decision was made without consulting his cabinet or even Abigail, who nonetheless upon hearing of it described it as a "master stroke." To placate Republicans, he nominated <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a> and Ellsworth to accompany Murray and the Senate immediately approved them on March 3. Henry declined the nomination and Adams chose <a href="William%20Richardson%20Davie">William Richardson Davie</a> to replace him. Hamilton strongly criticized the decision, as did Adams's cabinet members, who maintained frequent communication with him. Adams again questioned the loyalty of those men but did not remove them. To the annoyance of many, Adams spent a full seven months–March to September–of 1799 in Peacefield, finally returning to Trenton, where the government had set up temporary quarters due to the <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a> epidemic, after a letter arrived from Talleyrand confirming Gerry's statement that American ministers would be received. Adams then decided to send the commissioners to France. Adams arrived back in Trenton on October 10. Shortly after, Hamilton, in a breach of military protocol, arrived uninvited at the city to speak with the president, urging him not to send the peace commissioners but instead to ally with Britain, which he viewed to be the stronger party, to restore the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbons</a> to France. "I heard him with perfect good humor, though never in my life did I hear a man talk more like a fool," Adams said. He regarded Hamilton's idea as chimerical and far-fetched. On November 15, the commissioners set sail for Paris.

To pay for the military buildup of the Quasi-War, Adams and his Federalist allies enacted the <a href="direct%20tax">Direct Tax</a> of 1798. Direct taxation by the federal government was widely unpopular, and the government's revenue under Washington had mostly come from <a href="excise%20tax">excise tax</a>es and <a href="Tariffs%20in%20United%20States%20history">tariffs</a>. Though Washington had maintained a balanced budget with the help of a growing economy, increased military expenditures threatened to cause major budget deficits, and the Federalists developed a taxation plan to meet the need for increased government revenue. The Direct Tax of 1798 instituted a <a href="progressive%20tax">progressive</a> <a href="land%20value%20tax">land value tax</a> of up to 1% of the value of a property. Taxpayers in eastern Pennsylvania resisted federal tax collectors, and in March 1799 the bloodless Fries's Rebellion broke out. Led by Revolutionary War veteran <a href="John%20Fries">John Fries</a>, rural German-speaking farmers protested what they saw as a threat to their liberties. They intimidated tax collectors, who often found themselves unable to go about their business. The disturbance was quickly ended with Hamilton leading the army to restore peace.

Fries and two other leaders were arrested, found guilty of treason, and sentenced to hang. They appealed to Adams requesting a pardon. The cabinet unanimously advised Adams to refuse, but he instead granted the pardon, using as justification the argument that the men had instigated a mere riot as opposed to a rebellion. In his pamphlet attacking Adams before the election, Hamilton wrote that "it was impossible to commit a greater error."

On May 5, 1800, Adams's frustrations with the Hamilton wing of the party exploded during a meeting with McHenry, a Hamilton loyalist who was universally regarded, even by Hamilton, as an inept Secretary of War. Adams accused him of subservience to Hamilton and declared that he would rather serve as Jefferson's vice president or minister at The Hague than be beholden to Hamilton for the presidency. McHenry offered to resign at once, and Adams accepted. On May 10, he asked Pickering to resign. Pickering refused and was summarily dismissed. Adams named John Marshall as Secretary of State and <a href="Samuel%20Dexter">Samuel Dexter</a> as Secretary of War. In 1799, <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> took over as head of the French government in the <a href="Coup%20of%2018%20Brumaire">Coup of 18 Brumaire</a> and declared the French Revolution over. News of this event increased Adams's desire to disband the provisional army, which, with Washington now dead, was commanded only by Hamilton. His moves to end the army after the departures of McHenry and Pickering were met with little opposition. Rather than allow Adams to receive the credit, Federalists joined with Republicans in voting to disband the army in mid-1800.

Napoleon, realizing that the conflict was pointless, signaled his readiness for friendly relations. By the <a href="Convention%20of%201800">Convention of 1800</a>, the two sides agreed to return any captured ships and to allow for the peaceful transfer of non-military goods to an enemy of the nation. On January 23, 1801, the Senate voted 16–14 in favor of the treaty, four votes short of the necessary two thirds. Some Federalists, including Hamilton, urged that the Senate vote in favor of the treaty with reservations. A new proposal was then drawn up demanding that the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Alliance%20%281778%29">Treaty of Alliance of 1778</a> be superseded and that France pay for its damages to American property. On February 3, the treaty with the reservations passed 22–9 and was signed by Adams. Adams proudly avoided war, but deeply split his party in the process. Historian <a href="Ron%20Chernow">Ron Chernow</a> writes that "the threat of Jacobinism" was the one thing that united the Federalist Party, and that Adams's elimination of it unwittingly contributed to the party's demise. News of the peace treaty did not arrive in the United States until after the election, too late to sway the results.

Adams's leadership on naval defense has sometimes led him to be called the "father of the <a href="American%20Navy">American Navy</a>." In July 1798, he signed into law <a href="An%20Act%20for%20the%20relief%20of%20sick%20and%20disabled%20seamen">An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen</a>, which authorized the establishment of a government-operated marine hospital service. In 1800, he signed the law establishing the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>.

Adams made his first official visit to the nation's new <a href="seat%20of%20government">seat of government</a> in early June 1800. Amid the "raw and unfinished" cityscape, the president found the public buildings "in a much greater forwardness of completion than expected." He moved into the nearly completed <a href="White%20House">President's Mansion</a> (later known as the White House) on November 1. Abigail arrived a few weeks later. Upon arriving, Adams wrote to her, "Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof." The Senate of the <a href="6th%20United%20States%20Congress">7th Congress</a> met for the first time in the new <a href="United%20States%20Capitol">Congress House</a> (later known as the Capitol building) on November 17, 1800. On November 22, Adams delivered his fourth <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address">State of the Union Address</a> to a joint session of Congress in the <a href="Old%20Supreme%20Court%20Chamber">Old Supreme Court Chamber</a>. This would be the last annual message any president would personally deliver to Congress for the next 113 years.

With the Federalist Party deeply split over his negotiations with France, and the opposition Republican Party enraged over the Alien and Sedition Acts and the expansion of the military, Adams faced a daunting reelection campaign in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201800">1800</a>. The Federalist congressmen caucused in the spring of 1800 and nominated Adams and <a href="Charles%20Cotesworth%20Pinckney">Charles Cotesworth Pinckney</a>. The Republicans nominated Jefferson and Burr, their candidates in the previous election.

The campaign was bitter and characterized by malicious insults by partisan presses on both sides. Federalists claimed that the Republicans were the enemies of "all who love order, peace, virtue, and religion." They were said to be libertines and dangerous radicals who favored states' rights over the Union and would instigate anarchy and civil war. Jefferson's rumored <a href="Sally%20Hemmings">affairs</a> with slaves were used against him. Republicans in turn accused Federalists of subverting republican principles through punitive federal laws and of favoring Britain and the other coalition countries in their war with France to promote aristocratic, anti-republican values. Jefferson was portrayed as an apostle of liberty and man of the people, while Adams was labelled a monarchist. He was accused of insanity and marital infidelity. <a href="James%20T.%20Callender">James T. Callender</a>, a Republican propagandist secretly financed by Jefferson, degraded Adams's character and accused him of attempting to make war with France. Callender was arrested and jailed under the Sedition Act, which only further inflamed Republican passions.

Opposition from the Federalist Party was at times equally intense. Some, including Pickering, accused Adams of colluding with Jefferson so that he would end up either president or vice president. Hamilton was hard at work, attempting to sabotage the president's reelection. Planning an indictment of Adams's character, he requested and received private documents from both the ousted cabinet secretaries and Wolcott. The letter was intended for only a few Federalist electors. Upon seeing a draft, several Federalists urged Hamilton not to send it. Wolcott wrote that "the poor old man" could do himself in without Hamilton's assistance. Hamilton did not heed their advice. On October 24, he sent a pamphlet strongly attacking Adams's policies and character. Hamilton denounced the "precipitate nomination" of Murray, the pardoning of Fries, and the firing of Pickering. He included a fair share of personal insults, vilifying the president's "disgusting egotism" and "ungovernable temper." Adams, he concluded, was "emotionally unstable, given to impulsive and irrational decisions, unable to coexist with his closest advisers, and generally unfit to be president." Strangely, it ended by saying that the electors should support Adams and Pinckney equally. Thanks to Burr, who had covertly obtained a copy, the pamphlet became public knowledge and was distributed throughout the country by Republicans, who rejoiced in what it contained. The pamphlet destroyed the Federalist Party, ended Hamilton's political career, and helped ensure Adams's already-likely defeat.

When the electoral votes were counted, Adams finished in third place with 65 votes, and Pinckney came in fourth with 64 votes. Jefferson and Burr tied for first place with 73 votes each. Because of the tie, the election devolved upon the House of Representatives, with each state having one vote and a supermajority required for victory. On February 17, 1801 – on the 36th ballot – Jefferson was elected by a vote of 10 to 4 (two states abstained). It is noteworthy that Hamilton's scheme, although it made the Federalists appear divided and therefore helped Jefferson win, failed in its overall attempt to woo Federalist electors away from Adams.

To compound the agony of his defeat, Adams's son Charles, a long-time alcoholic, died on November 30. Anxious to rejoin Abigail, who had already left for Massachusetts, Adams departed the White House in the predawn hours of March 4, 1801, and did not attend <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Thomas%20Jefferson">Jefferson's inauguration</a>. Since him, only three out-going presidents (having served a full term) have not attended their successors' inaugurations. The complications arising out of the 1796 and 1800 elections prompted Congress and the states to refine the process whereby the Electoral College elects a president and a vice president through the <a href="Twelfth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">12th Amendment</a>, which became a part of the Constitution in 1804.

Adams appointed two <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> associate justices during his term in office: <a href="Bushrod%20Washington">Bushrod Washington</a>, the nephew of American founding father and President George Washington, and <a href="Alfred%20Moore">Alfred Moore</a>. After the retirement of Ellsworth due to ill health in 1800, it fell to Adams to appoint the Court's fourth Chief Justice. At the time, it was not yet certain whether Jefferson or Burr would win the election. Regardless, Adams believed that the choice should be someone "in the full vigor of middle age" who could counter what might be a long line of successive Republican presidents. Adams chose his Secretary of State John Marshall. He, along with Stoddert, was one of Adams's few trusted cabinet members, and was among the first to greet him when he arrived at the White House. Adams signed his commission on January 31 and the Senate approved it immediately. Marshall's long tenure left a lasting influence on the Court. He maintained a carefully reasoned nationalistic interpretation of the Constitution and established the judicial branch as the equal of the executive and legislative branches.

After the Federalists lost control of both houses of Congress along with the White House in the election of 1800, the <a href="lame-duck%20session">lame-duck session</a> of the 6th Congress in February 1801 approved a judiciary act, commonly known as the <a href="Midnight%20Judges%20Act">Midnight Judges Act</a>, which created a set of federal appeals courts between the district courts and the Supreme Court. Adams filled the vacancies created in this statute by appointing a series of judges, whom his opponents called the "Midnight Judges," just days before his term expired. Most of these judges lost their posts when the <a href="7th%20United%20States%20Congress">7th Congress</a>, with a solid Republican majority, approved the <a href="Judiciary%20Act%20of%201802">Judiciary Act of 1802</a>, abolishing the newly created courts.

Adams resumed farming at Peacefield in the town of Quincy and began work on an autobiography. The work had numerous gaps and was eventually abandoned and left unedited. Most of Adams's attention was focused on farm work. His frugal lifestyle and presidential salary had left him with a considerable fortune by 1801. In 1803, the bank holding his cash reserves of about $13,000 collapsed. John Quincy resolved the crisis by buying his properties in Weymouth and Quincy, including Peacefield, for $12,800. During the first four years of retirement, Adams made little effort to contact others, but eventually resumed contact with old acquaintances such as <a href="Benjamin%20Waterhouse">Benjamin Waterhouse</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Rush">Benjamin Rush</a>.

Adams generally stayed quiet on public matters. He did not publicly denounce Jefferson's actions as president, believing that "instead of opposing Systematically any Administration, running down their Characters and opposing all their Measures right or wrong, We ought to Support every Administration as far as We can in Justice." When a disgruntled James Callender, angry at not being appointed to an office, turned on the president by revealing the <a href="Sally%20Hemings">Sally Hemings</a> affair, Adams said nothing. John Quincy was elected to the Senate in 1803. Shortly thereafter, both he and his father crossed party lines to support Jefferson's <a href="Louisiana%20Purchase">Louisiana Purchase</a>. The only major political incident involving Adams during the Jefferson years was a dispute with <a href="Mercy%20Otis%20Warren">Mercy Otis Warren</a> in 1806. Warren, an old friend, had attacked Adams in a pamphlet for his "partiality for monarchy" and "pride of talents and much ambition." A tempestuous correspondence ensued. In time, their friendship healed. Adams did privately criticize the president over his <a href="Embargo%20Act%20of%201807">Embargo Act</a>, despite the fact that John Quincy voted for it. John Quincy resigned from the Senate in 1808 after the Federalist-controlled State Senate refused to nominate him for a second term. After the Federalists denounced John Quincy as no longer being of their party, Adams wrote to him that he himself had long since "abdicated and disclaimed the name and character and attributes of that sect."

After Jefferson's retirement from public life in 1809, Adams became more vocal. He published a three-year marathon of letters in the "<a href="Boston%20Patriot%20%28newspaper%29">Boston Patriot</a>" newspaper, refuting line-by-line Hamilton's 1800 pamphlet. The initial piece was written shortly after his return from Peacefield and "had gathered dust for eight years." Adams had decided to shelve it over fears that it could negatively impact John Quincy should he ever seek office. Although Hamilton had died in 1804 in <a href="Burr%E2%80%93Hamilton%20duel">a duel with Aaron Burr</a>, Adams felt the need to vindicate his character against his charges. With his son having broken from the Federalist Party and joined the Republicans, he felt he could safely do so without threatening his political career. Adams supported the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>. Having worried over the rise of sectionalism, he celebrated the growth of a "national character" that accompanied it.

Daughter <a href="Abigail%20Adams%20Smith">Abigail ("Nabby")</a> was married to <a href="Congressman">Representative</a> <a href="William%20Stephens%20Smith">William Stephens Smith</a>, but she returned to her parents' home after the failure of the marriage; she died of <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a> in 1813.

In early 1801, Adams sent Thomas Jefferson a brief note after returning to Quincy wishing him a happy and prosperous presidency. Jefferson failed to respond, and they did not speak again for nearly 12 years. In 1804, Abigail, unbeknownst to her husband, wrote to Jefferson to express her condolences upon the death of his daughter <a href="Mary%20Jefferson%20Eppes">Polly</a>, who had stayed with the Adamses in London in 1787. This initiated a brief correspondence between the two which quickly descended into political rancor. Jefferson terminated it by not replying to Abigail's fourth letter. Aside from that, by 1812 there had been no communication between Peacefield and Monticello since Adams left office.

In early 1812, Adams reconciled with Jefferson. The previous year had been tragic for Adams; his brother-in-law and friend Richard Cranch had died along with his widow Mary, and Nabby had been diagnosed with breast cancer. These events mellowed Adams and caused him to soften his outlook. Their mutual friend Benjamin Rush, a fellow signer of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> who had been corresponding with both, encouraged them to reach out to each other. On New Year's Day, Adams sent a brief, friendly note to Jefferson to accompany the delivery of "two pieces of homespun," a two-volume collection of lectures on rhetoric by John Quincy Adams. Jefferson replied immediately with a cordial letter, and the two men revived their friendship, which they sustained by mail. The correspondence that they resumed in 1812 lasted the rest of their lives, and has been hailed as among their great legacies of American literature. Their letters represent an insight into both the period and the minds of the two revolutionary leaders and presidents. The missives lasted fourteen years, and consisted of 158 letters – 109 from Adams and 49 from Jefferson.

Early on, Adams repeatedly tried to turn the correspondence to a discussion of their actions in the political arena. Jefferson refused to oblige him, saying that "nothing new can be added by you or me to what has been said by others and will be said in every age." Adams made one more attempt, writing that "You and I ought not to die before we have explained ourselves to each other." Still, Jefferson declined to engage Adams in this sort of discussion. Adams accepted this, and the correspondence turned to other matters, particularly philosophy and their daily habits.

As the two grew older, the letters became fewer and farther between. There was also important information that each man kept to himself. Jefferson said nothing about his construction of a new house, domestic turmoil, slave ownership, or poor financial situation, while Adams did not mention the troublesome behavior of his son Thomas, who had failed as a lawyer and become an alcoholic, resorting afterwards to living primarily as a caretaker at Peacefield.

Abigail died of <a href="typhoid">typhoid</a> on October 28, 1818. The year 1824 was filled with excitement in America, featuring a <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201824">four way presidential contest</a> which included John Quincy. The <a href="Marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Marquis de Lafayette</a> toured the country and met briefly with Adams, who greatly enjoyed the visit. Adams was delighted by the election of John Quincy to the presidency. The results became official in February 1825 after a deadlock was decided in the House of Representatives. He did remark, "No man who ever held the office of President would congratulate a friend on obtaining it."

Less than a month before his death, Adams issued a statement about the destiny of the United States, which historian <a href="Joy%20Hakim">Joy Hakim</a> characterized as a warning for his fellow citizens: "My best wishes, in the joys, and festivities, and the solemn services of that day on which will be completed the fiftieth year from its birth, of the independence of the United States: a memorable epoch in the annals of the human race, destined in future history to form the brightest or the blackest page, according to the use or the abuse of those political institutions by which they shall, in time to come, be shaped by the human mind."

On July 4, 1826, the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, Adams died at his home in Quincy at approximately 6:20 PM. At age 90, Adams was the <a href="List%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States%20by%20age">longest-lived US president</a> until <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> surpassed that age in 2001. Adams's crypt lies at <a href="United%20First%20Parish%20Church">United First Parish Church</a> in Quincy, Massachusetts, with his wife Abigail and son John Quincy Adams. At the time of his death, John Quincy Adams was serving as U.S. president. When Adams died, his last words included an acknowledgement of his longtime friend and rival: "Thomas Jefferson survives." Adams was unaware that Jefferson had died several hours before.

During the First Continental Congress, Adams was sometimes solicited for his views on government. While recognizing its importance, Adams had privately criticized <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>'s 1776 pamphlet "<a href="Common%20Sense%20%28pamphlet%29">Common Sense</a>", which attacked all forms of monarchy, even constitutional monarchy of the sort advocated by <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a>. It supported a unicameral legislature and a weak executive elected by the legislature. According to Adams, the author had "a better hand at pulling down than building." He believed that the views expressed in the pamphlet were "so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work." What Paine advocated was a radical democracy with the views of the majority neither checked nor counterbalanced. This was incompatible with the system of checks and balances that conservatives like Adams would implement. Some delegates urged Adams to commit his views to paper. He did so in separate letters to these colleagues. So impressed was Richard Henry Lee that, with Adams's consent, he had the most comprehensive letter printed. Published anonymously in April 1776, it was titled "<a href="Thoughts%20on%20Government">Thoughts on Government</a>" and styled as "a Letter from a Gentleman to his Friend." Many historians agree that none of Adams's other compositions rivaled the enduring influence of this pamphlet.

Adams advised that the form of government should be chosen to attain the desired ends – the happiness and virtue of the greatest number of people. He wrote that, "There is no good government but what is <a href="Republicanism%20in%20the%20United%20States">republican</a>. That the only valuable part of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British constitution</a> is so because the very definition of a republic is an empire of laws, and not of men." The treatise defended <a href="bicameralism">bicameralism</a>, for "a single assembly is liable to all the vices, follies and frailties of an individual." Adams suggested that there should be a <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a> between the <a href="executive%20%28government%29">executive</a>, the <a href="judicial">judicial</a> and the <a href="legislative">legislative</a> branches, and further recommended that if a continental government were to be formed then it "should sacredly be confined" to certain <a href="enumerated%20powers">enumerated powers</a>. "Thoughts on Government" was referenced in every state-constitution writing hall. Adams used the letter to attack opponents of independence. He claimed that <a href="John%20Dickinson">John Dickinson</a>'s fear of republicanism was responsible for his refusal to support independence, and wrote that opposition from Southern planters was rooted in fear that their aristocratic slaveholding status would be endangered by it.

After returning from his first mission to France in 1779, Adams was elected to the <a href="Massachusetts%20Constitutional%20Convention%20of%201779%E2%80%931780">Massachusetts Constitutional Convention</a> with the purpose of establishing a new constitution for Massachusetts. He served on a committee of three, also including Samuel Adams and <a href="James%20Bowdoin">James Bowdoin</a>, to draft the constitution. The task of writing it fell primarily to John Adams. The resulting <a href="Constitution%20of%20Massachusetts">Constitution of Massachusetts</a> was approved in 1780. It was the first constitution written by a special committee, then ratified by the people; and was the first to feature a bicameral legislature. Included were a distinct executive – though restrained by an executive council – with a qualified (two-thirds) veto, and an independent judicial branch. The judges were given lifetime appointments, allowed to "hold their offices during good behavior."

The Constitution affirmed the "duty" of the individual to worship the "Supreme Being," and that he had the right to do so without molestation "in the manner most agreeable to the dictates of his own conscience." It established a system of public education that would provide free schooling for three years to the children of all citizens. Adams was a strong believer in good education as one of the pillars of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>. He believed that people "in a State of Ignorance" were more easily enslaved while those "enlightened with knowledge" would be better able to protect their liberties. Adams became one of the founders of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1780.

Adams's preoccupation with political and governmental affairs – which caused considerable separation from his wife and children – had a distinct familial context, which he articulated in 1780: "I must study Politicks and War that my sons may have the liberty to study Mathematicks and Philosophy. My sons ought to study Geography, natural History, Naval Architecture, navigation, Commerce and Agriculture, in order to give their children a right to study Painting, Poetry, Musick, Architecture, Statuary, Tapestry, and Porcelaine."

While in London, Adams learned of a <a href="Constitutional%20Convention%20%28United%20States%29">convention</a> being planned to amend the <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>. In January 1787, he published a work entitled "A Defence of the Constitutions of Government of the United States". The pamphlet repudiated the views of <a href="Anne%20Robert%20Jacques%20Turgot%2C%20Baron%20de%20Laune">Turgot</a> and other European writers as to the viciousness of state government frameworks. He suggested that "the rich, the well-born and the able" should be set apart from other men in a senate – that would prevent them from dominating the lower house. Adams's "Defence" is described as an articulation of the theory of <a href="mixed%20government">mixed government</a>. Adams contended that social classes exist in every political society, and that a good government must accept that reality. For centuries, dating back to <a href="Aristotle">Aristotle</a>, a mixed regime balancing monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy – that is, the king, the nobles, and the people – was required to preserve order and liberty.

Historian <a href="Gordon%20S.%20Wood">Gordon S. Wood</a> has maintained that Adams's political philosophy had become irrelevant by the time the Federal Constitution was ratified. By then, American political thought, transformed by more than a decade of vigorous debate as well as formative experiential pressures, had abandoned the classical perception of politics as a mirror of social estates. Americans' new understanding of <a href="popular%20sovereignty">popular sovereignty</a> was that the citizenry were the sole possessors of power in the nation. Representatives in the government enjoyed mere portions of the people's power and only for a limited time. Adams was thought to have overlooked this evolution and revealed his continued attachment to the older version of politics. Yet Wood was accused of ignoring Adams's peculiar definition of the term "republic," and his support for a constitution ratified by the people.

On <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a>, Adams wrote that, "Power must be opposed to power, and interest to interest." This sentiment was later echoed by James Madison's statement that, "[a]mbition must be made to counteract ambition," in <a href="Federalist%20No.%2051">Federalist No. 51</a>, explaining the separation of powers established under the new Constitution. Adams believed that human beings were naturally desirous of furthering their own ambitions, and a single democratically elected house, if left unchecked, would be subject to this error, and therefore needed to be checked by an upper house and an executive. He wrote that a strong executive would defend the people's liberties against "aristocrats" attempting to take it away. On the government's role in education Adams stated that, "The whole people must take upon themselves the education of the whole people and be willing to bear the expenses of it. There should not be a district of one mile square, without a school in it, not founded by a charitable individual, but maintained at the public expense of the people themselves."

Adams first saw the new <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> in late 1787. To Jefferson, he wrote that he read it "with great satisfaction." Adams expressed regret that the president would be unable to make appointments without <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> approval and over the absence of a <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a>. "Should not such a thing have preceded the model?" he asked.

Adams never owned a <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slave</a> and declined on principle to use slave labor, saying, "I have, through my whole life, held the practice of slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived for many years in times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap." Before the war, he occasionally represented slaves in suits for their freedom. Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated Southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence. He spoke out in 1777 against a bill to emancipate slaves in Massachusetts, saying that the issue was presently too divisive, and so the legislation should "sleep for a time." He also was against use of black soldiers in the Revolution due to opposition from Southerners. Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts about 1780, when it was forbidden by implication in the Declaration of Rights that John Adams wrote into the Massachusetts Constitution. Abigail Adams vocally opposed slavery.

Throughout his lifetime Adams expressed controversial and shifting views regarding the virtues of monarchical and hereditary political institutions. At times he conveyed substantial support for these approaches, suggesting for example that "hereditary monarchy or aristocracy" are the "only institutions that can possibly preserve the laws and liberties of the people." Yet at other times he distanced himself from such ideas, calling himself "a mortal and irreconcilable enemy to Monarchy" and "no friend to hereditary limited monarchy in America." Such denials did not assuage his critics, and Adams was often accused of being a monarchist. Historian <a href="Clinton%20Rossiter">Clinton Rossiter</a> portrays Adams not as a monarchist but a revolutionary conservative who sought to balance republicanism with the stability of monarchy to create "ordered liberty." His 1790 "Discourses on Davila" published in the "Gazette of the United States" warned once again of the dangers of unbridled democracy.
Many of these attacks are considered to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that he was planning to "crown himself king" and "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne." Peter Shaw has argued that: "[T]he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) ... Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch ... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life." In contrast to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson:

According to Luke Mayville, Adams synthesized two strands of thought: <a href="political%20science">practical study</a> of past and present governments, and <a href="Scottish%20Enlightenment">Scottish Enlightenment</a> thinking concerning individual desires expressed in politics. Adams conclusion was that the great danger was that an <a href="oligarchy">oligarchy</a> of the wealthy would take hold to the detriment of equality. To counter that danger, the power of the wealthy needed to be channeled by institutions, and checked by a strong executive.

Adams was raised a <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregationalist</a>, since his ancestors were Puritans. According to biographer <a href="David%20McCullough">David McCullough</a>, "as his family and friends knew, Adams was both a devout Christian, and an independent thinker, and he saw no conflict in that." In a letter to Rush, Adams credited religion with the success of his ancestors since their migration to the New World. He believed that regular church service was beneficial to man's moral sense. Everett (1966) concludes that "Adams strove for a religion based on a common sense sort of reasonableness" and maintained that religion must change and evolve toward perfection. Fielding (1940) argues that Adams's beliefs synthesized Puritan, <a href="deism">deist</a>, and <a href="humanism">humanist</a> concepts. Adams at one point said that Christianity had originally been <a href="revelation">revelatory</a>, but was being misinterpreted in the service of superstition, fraud, and unscrupulous power.

Frazer (2004) notes that while he shared many perspectives with deists and often used deistic terminology, "Adams clearly was not a deist. Deism rejected any and all supernatural activity and intervention by God; consequently, deists did not believe in miracles or God's providence. ... Adams did believe in miracles, providence, and, to a certain extent, the Bible as revelation." Frazer argues that Adams's "theistic rationalism, like that of the other Founders, was a sort of middle ground between Protestantism and deism." In 1796, Adams denounced <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>'s deistic criticisms of Christianity in "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Reason">The Age of Reason</a>", saying, "The Christian religion is, above all the religions that ever prevailed or existed in ancient or modern times, the religion of wisdom, virtue, equity and humanity, let the Blackguard Paine say what he will."

But historian <a href="Gordon%20S.%20Wood">Gordon S. Wood</a> (2017) writes, "Although both Jefferson and Adams denied the miracles of the Bible and the divinity of Christ, Adams always retained a respect for the religiosity of people that Jefferson never had; in fact, Jefferson tended in private company to mock religious feelings."

In his retirement years, Adams moved away from some of the Puritan sentiments of his youth and closer to more mainstream Enlightenment religious ideals. He blamed institutional Christianity for causing much suffering but continued to be an active Christian while maintaining that religion was necessary for society. He became a <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a>, rejecting the divinity of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>. David L. Holmes argues that Adams, while adopting central tenets of the Unitarian creed, accepted Jesus as the redeemer of humanity and the biblical accounts of <a href="Miracles%20of%20Jesus">his miracles</a> as true.

Franklin summed up what many thought of Adams when he said, "He means well for his country, is always an honest man, often a wise one, but sometimes, and in some things, absolutely out of his senses." Adams came to be seen as someone with a long, distinguished, and spotless career in public service, and a man of great patriotism and integrity, but whose vanity, stubbornness, and cantankerousness often got him into unnecessary trouble. Adams strongly felt that he would be forgotten and underappreciated by history. These feelings often manifested themselves through envy and verbal attacks on other Founders.

Historian George Herring argues that Adams was the most independent-minded of the Founders. Though he formally aligned with the Federalists, he was somewhat a party unto himself, at times disagreeing with the Federalists as much as he did the Republicans. He was often described as "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as he admitted in his old age: "[As President] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and groaned, and sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." Stubbornness was seen as one of his defining traits, a fact for which Adams made no apology. "Thanks to God that he gave me stubbornness when I know I am right," he wrote. His resolve to advance peace with France while maintaining a posture of defense reduced his popularity and contributed to his defeat for reelection. Most historians applaud him for avoiding an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is almost always condemned.

According to Ferling, Adams's political philosophy fell "out of step" with the way that the country was heading. The country tended further away from Adams's emphasis on order and the rule of law and towards the Jeffersonian vision of liberty and weak central government. In the years following his retirement from public life, as first <a href="Jeffersonian%20democracy">Jeffersonianism</a> and then <a href="Jacksonian%20democracy">Jacksonian democracy</a> grew to dominate American politics, Adams was largely forgotten. When his name was mentioned, it was typically not in a favorable way. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201840">1840 presidential election</a>, <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> candidate <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> was attacked by <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> on the false allegation that he had once been a supporter of John Adams. Adams was eventually subject to criticism from <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a> advocates. <a href="Edward%20A.%20Pollard">Edward A. Pollard</a>, a strong supporter of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a> during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, singled out Adams, writing:

In the 21st century, Adams remains less well known than many of America's other Founding Fathers. McCullough argued that "[t]he problem with Adams is that most Americans know nothing about him." Todd Leopold of <a href="CNN">CNN</a> wrote in 2001 that Adams is "remembered as that guy who served a single term as president between Washington and Jefferson, and as a short, vain, somewhat rotund man whose stature seems to have been dwarfed by his lanky colleagues." He has always been seen, Ferling says, as "honest and dedicated", but despite his lengthy career in public service, Adams is still overshadowed by the dramatic military and political achievements and strong personalities of his contemporaries. Gilbert Chinard, in his 1933 biography of Adams, described the man as "staunch, honest stubborn and somewhat narrow." In his two-volume 1962 biography, Page Smith lauds Adams for his fight against radicals such as Thomas Paine, whose promised reforms portended anarchy and misery. Ferling, in his 1992 biography, writes that "Adams was his own worst enemy." He criticizes him for his "pettiness ... jealousy, and vanity", and faults him for his frequent separations from his wife and children. He praises Adams for his willingness to acknowledge his deficiencies and for striving to overcome them. In 1995, Peter Shaw published "The Character of John Adams". Ferling believes that the man who emerges is one "perpetually at war with himself", whose desire for fame and recognition leads to charges of vanity.

In 2001, David McCullough published a biography of the president entitled "<a href="John%20Adams%20%28book%29">John Adams</a>". McCullough lauds Adams for consistency and honesty, "plays down or explains away" his more controversial actions, such as the dispute over presidential titles and the predawn flight from the White House, and criticizes his friend and rival, Jefferson. The book sold very well and was very favorably received and, along with the Ferling biography, contributed to a rapid resurgence in Adams's reputation. In 2008, a <a href="John%20Adams%20%28miniseries%29">miniseries</a> was released based on the McCullough biography, featuring <a href="Paul%20Giamatti">Paul Giamatti</a> as Adams.

Adams is commemorated as the namesake of various counties, buildings, and other items. One example is the <a href="John%20Adams%20Building">John Adams Building</a> of the Library of Congress, an institution whose existence Adams had signed into law. Unlike many other Founders, Adams does not have a monument dedicated to him in Washington, D.C. According to McCullough, "Popular symbolism has not been very generous toward Adams. There is no memorial, no statue ... in his honor in our nation's capital, and to me that is absolutely inexcusable. It's long past time when we should recognize what he did, and who he was."

Lê Quang Tung

Colonel Lê Quang Tung (13 June 1919 – 1 November 1963) was the commander of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam%20Special%20Forces">Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces</a> under the command of <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a>. Nhu was the brother of <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>'s president, <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>. A former servant of the Ngô family, Tung's military background was in security and counterespionage.

During the 1950s, Tung was a high-ranking official in Nhu's <a href="Personalist%20Labor%20Revolutionary%20Party">Cần Lao</a>, a secret political apparatus which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power, <a href="extortion">extorting</a> money from wealthy businessmen. In 1960, Tung was promoted directly to the rank of <a href="colonel">colonel</a> and became the commander of the special forces. His period at the helm of South Vietnam's elite troops was noted mostly for his work in repressing <a href="dissident">dissident</a>s, rather than fighting the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a> <a href="insurgency">insurgents</a>. His best-known attack was the <a href="X%C3%A1%20L%E1%BB%A3i%20Pagoda%20raids">raid on Xá Lợi pagoda</a> on 21 August 1963, in which hundreds died or disappeared.

Tung's main military programme was a scheme in which <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> personnel attempted to infiltrate <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> in order to engage in intelligence gathering and <a href="sabotage">sabotage</a>. The program was ineffective; the vast majority of infiltrators were killed or captured. Tung was also reported to be planning an <a href="assassination">assassination</a> attempt on <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge%2C%20Jr.">Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20South%20Vietnam">United States Ambassador to South Vietnam</a>.

Following the pagoda raids, the United States terminated funding to Tung's men because they were used as a political tool rather than against the <a href="communist">communist</a>s. Along with Diệm and Nhu, Tung was assassinated during the <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">November 1963 coup</a>. Nhu and Tung had been preparing a fake coup and counter-coup in order to give a false demonstration of the regime's strength. However, the pair were unaware that General <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20%C4%90%C3%ADnh">Tôn Thất Đính</a>, who was planning the phony operation, was involved in the real coup plot. Đính tricked Tung into sending his men into the countryside, leaving the regime in <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> without the protection of the special forces. This led to the easy overthrow of the regime.

Tung was born in June 13, 1919 in <a href="Provinces%20of%20Vietnam%23Regions">central Vietnam</a>, which was then the <a href="protectorate">protectorate</a> of <a href="Annam%20%28French%20protectorate%29">Annam</a> in <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a>. The former servant of the Ngô family was devoutly <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a>, short and bespectacled. Tung had a military background almost entirely in security and <a href="counterespionage">counterespionage</a>, which was an unusual basis for leading the special forces. Tung had first served the French as a security officer in <a href="Central%20Vietnam">Central Vietnam</a>. He then worked for Diệm as a <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in the military security service in Central Vietnam. As a high-ranking official in Nhu's <a href="Personalist%20Labor%20Revolutionary%20Party">Cần Lao</a>, the secret Catholic political apparatus which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power, Tung raised party funds by extorting money from wealthy businessmen. Tung was primarily known among colleagues for his unwavering loyalty to Diệm. In 1960, he was promoted straight to the rank of colonel and placed in charge of the special forces. The <a href="Central%20Intelligence%20Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) regarded Tung as the third most powerful man in South Vietnam behind Diệm and Nhu, thereby ranking him as South Vietnam's most powerful military officer.

Tung had been trained by the CIA in the United States. A Diệm loyalist, he led a force of 1,840 men, which operated under the direction of Nhu rather than the army command. He did not conduct operations against the communist <a href="Vi%E1%BB%87t%20C%E1%BB%99ng">Việt Cộng</a> insurgents, but used his forces mainly in Saigon to repress opponents of the Diệm regime. Tung's most notable attacks occurred during the <a href="Buddhist%20crisis">Buddhist crisis</a> of 1963. During this period, the Buddhist majority engaged in mass protests against the pro-Catholic policies of the Diệm regime.

On 21 August 1963, Tung's men, acting on Nhu's orders, <a href="X%C3%A1%20L%E1%BB%A3i%20Pagoda%20raids">raided the Xá Lợi Pagoda</a>, Saigon's main Buddhist temple. The attacks were replicated across the nation, leaving a death toll estimated to be in the hundreds. The pagodas suffered extensive damage and a further 1,400 <a href="bhikkhu">monks</a> and <a href="Bhikkhuni">nuns</a> were arrested. The attacks occurred after Nhu had tricked a group of <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Army of the Republic of Vietnam</a> (ARVN) generals into agreeing to declare <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a>. He knew the generals were plotting and hoped to exploit martial law to overthrow his brother, but outmanoeuvred them by sending Tung's special forces into the pagodas disguised as regular ARVN soldiers. As a result, South Vietnam's Buddhist majority initially thought the regular army had attacked the monks, damaging its generals' credibility among the populace as potential leaders of the country. Following the attacks, U.S. officials threatened to withhold aid to the special forces unless they were used to fight communists rather than attacking political or religious dissidents.

Another notable religious attack was perpetrated by Tung's men in 1963. A hugely oversized <a href="carp">carp</a> was found swimming in a small pond near the central city of <a href="Da%20Nang">Đà Nẵng</a>. Local Buddhists began to believe that the fish was a <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> of one of <a href="Gautama%20Buddha">Gautama Buddha</a>'s disciples. As more people made pilgrimages to the pond, so disquiet grew among the district chief and his subordinates, who answered to <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20C%E1%BA%A9n">Ngô Đình Cẩn</a>, another younger brother of Diệm. The officials <a href="land%20mine">mined</a> the pond, but the fish survived. They raked the pond with machine gun fire, but the carp again escaped death. To deal with the tenacious fish, they called in Tung's special forces. Tung's men <a href="hand%20grenade">grenaded</a> the pond, finally killing the carp. The killing backfired, because it generated more publicity – many newspapers across the world ran stories about the miraculous fish. ARVN helicopters began landing at the site, with paratroopers filling their bottles with water that they believed to be magical.

Tung also headed a group run by the CIA, in which ARVN personnel of northern origin infiltrated <a href="North%20Vietnam">North Vietnam</a>, posing as locals. The objective was to gather intelligence and sabotage communist infrastructure and communications facilities. The recruits were trained in bases at <a href="Nha%20Trang">Nha Trang</a>, Đà Nẵng, and sometimes offshore in <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a> and <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>. Around eighty groups of operatives, each numbering six or seven men, were deployed in 1963. They entered the north via parachute drops or <a href="sampan">sampan</a> journeys at night, but nearly all were captured or killed. The captives were frequently used in communist propaganda broadcasts. Tung was criticised for his management of the operations.

At Nhu's request, Tung was reported to have been planning an operation under the cover of a government-organised student demonstration outside the <a href="US%20Embassy%2C%20Saigon">US Embassy, Saigon</a>. In this plan, Tung's men would assassinate ambassador <a href="Henry%20Cabot%20Lodge%2C%20Jr.">Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.</a> and other key officials among the confusion. Another target was the Buddhist leader <a href="Th%C3%ADch%20Tr%C3%AD%20Quang">Thích Trí Quang</a>, who had been given asylum in the embassy after being targeted in the pagoda raids. According to the plan, Tung's men would then burn down the embassy.

Following the pagoda raids, the U.S. began exploring the possibility of replacing Diệm. Cable 243 informed the US embassy to look for alternative leadership if Diệm did not remove Nhu. In September, the Krulak–Mendenhall mission was despatched to South Vietnam to analyse the domestic situation and the war against the communists. One of the resulting suggestions was to terminate funding of the special forces as an expression of disapproval of Tung and Nhu's actions. Another was to run covert campaigns to discredit Tung. The Krulak–Mendenhall mission ended in a stalemate, so the <a href="Kennedy%20administration">Kennedy administration</a> followed up with the McNamara–Taylor mission. The second expedition resulted in the suspension of funding for the special forces until they were placed under the command of the army's Joint General Staff (JGS) and sent into battle.

The McNamara–Taylor mission's report noted that one of the reasons for sending Tung's men into the field was because they "are a continuing support for Diệm". The Americans were aware that removing the special forces from Saigon would increase the chances that a coup would succeed, thereby encouraging the army to overthrow the president. Diệm and Nhu were undeterred by the suspension of aid, keeping Tung and his men in the capital. In private talks with US officials, Diệm insisted that the army was responsible for the pagoda attacks and that Tung's men were already under the control of the JGS.

By September, Diệm and Nhu knew that a group of generals were planning a coup. Nhu ordered Tung and <a href="T%C3%B4n%20Th%E1%BA%A5t%20%C4%90%C3%ADnh">Tôn Thất Đính</a> — a loyalist general who commanded the ARVN <a href="III%20Corps%20%28South%20Vietnam%29">III Corps</a> which encompassed the <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a> region — to plan a fake coup against the government. One objective was to trick anti-government dissidents into joining the false uprising so that they could be identified and eliminated. Another aim was to provide a public relations stunt that would give a false impression of the strength of the regime.

Codenamed <a href="Operation%20Bravo">Operation Bravo</a>, the first stage of the scheme involved some of Tung's loyalist soldiers, disguised as insurgents, faking a coup. Tung would then announce the formation of a "revolutionary government" consisting of opposition activists, while Diệm and Nhu pretended to be on the run. During the orchestrated chaos of the first coup, the disguised loyalists would riot and in the ensuing mayhem, kill the leading coup plotters, such as Generals <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a>, <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%C3%B4n">Trần Văn Đôn</a>, <a href="L%C3%AA%20V%C4%83n%20Kim">Lê Văn Kim</a> and junior officers that were helping them. Tung's men and some of Nhu's underworld connections were also to kill some figures who were assisting the conspirators, such as the titular but relatively powerless Vice President <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Ng%E1%BB%8Dc%20Th%C6%A1">Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ</a>, CIA agent <a href="Lucien%20Conein">Lucien Conein</a>, who was on assignment in Vietnam as a military adviser, and Ambassador Lodge. These would then be blamed on "neutralist and pro-communist elements". This was to be followed by a fake "counter-coup", whereupon Tung's special forces, having left Saigon on the pretext of fighting communists, as well as Đính's forces would triumphantly re-enter Saigon to reaffirm the Diệm regime. Nhu would then exploit the scare to round up dissidents.

However, Nhu and Tung were unaware that Đính was part of the real coup plot. The III Corps commander told Tung that the counter-coup needed to employ an overwhelming amount of force. He said that tanks were required "because armour is dangerous". In an attempt to outwit Tung, Đính said that fresh troops were needed, opining: 

The loyalists were unaware that Đính's real intention was to engulf Saigon with his rebel divisions and lock Tung's loyalists in the countryside where they could not defend the president. Tung and the palace agreed to send all four Saigon-based special forces companies out of the capital of Saigon on 29 October 1963.
On 1 November 1963, Tung was summoned by the coup organisers to the Joint General Staff headquarters at <a href="T%C3%A2n%20S%C6%A1n%20Nh%E1%BB%A9t%20Air%20Base">Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base</a>, on the pretext of a routine officers' lunch meeting. At 13:30, General <a href="Tr%E1%BA%A7n%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%C3%B4n">Trần Văn Đôn</a> announced that a coup was taking place. Most of the officers rose to applaud, but Tung did not. He was taken away by <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Nhung">Nguyễn Văn Nhung</a>, the bodyguard of General <a href="D%C6%B0%C6%A1ng%20V%C4%83n%20Minh">Dương Văn Minh</a>. As he was led away, Tung shouted "Remember who gave you your stars!"

During the early stages of the coup, the rebels forced Tung to order his men to surrender. This meant that only the Presidential Guard was left to defend <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh%20City%20Museum">Gia Long Palace</a>. At 16:45, Tung was forced at gunpoint to talk to Diệm on the phone, telling the president that he had told his men to surrender. Minh ordered Nhung to execute the Diệm loyalist. Tung had failed to convince the president to surrender and still commanded the loyalty of his men. The other generals had little sympathy, since the special forces commander had disguised his men in army uniforms and framed the generals for the pagoda raids. The generals were aware of the threat Tung posed; they had discussed his elimination during their planning, having contemplated waging an offensive against his special forces.

At nightfall he was taken with Major , his brother and deputy, hands tied, into a jeep and driven to edge of the air base. Forced to kneel over two freshly dug holes, the brothers were shot into their graves and buried. The coup was successful, and on the following morning, Diệm and Nhu were captured and executed.

Craig Kieswetter

Craig Kieswetter (born 28 November 1987) is an English professional <a href="golf">golf</a>er and former <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who appeared in 71 matches for the <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England cricket team</a> between 2010 and 2013. Born and raised in South Africa, Kieswetter moved to England to complete his education, and began playing <a href="county%20cricket">county cricket</a> for <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> in 2007. Three years later, he made his international debut in a <a href="One%20Day%20International">One Day International</a> (ODI) against <a href="Bangladesh%20national%20cricket%20team">Bangladesh</a>. A <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29">batsman</a>, he was considered a one-day specialist, and all his international appearances came in ODIs or <a href="Twenty20%20International">Twenty20 International</a>s.

Kieswetter played junior cricket for <a href="Western%20Province%20cricket%20team%20%28South%20Africa%29">Western Province</a> until the age of 18, but lack of opportunity led him to seek an alternative route in England. He studied at <a href="Millfield">Millfield</a>, where he was noticed by Somerset. The county's lack of a strong wicket-keeper gave Kieswetter his opportunity, and he made his debut for the team early in the 2007 season. Through his Scottish mother, he qualified to play county cricket, and his performances soon generated discussion about his potential to play for England. Around this time, the captain of <a href="South%20Africa%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a>, <a href="Graeme%20Smith">Graeme Smith</a>, invited him to return to play in South Africa but Kieswetter preferred to qualify for England.

In early 2010, Kieswetter achieved his target; some strong performances for the <a href="England%20Lions%20cricket%20team">England Lions</a>, especially in a match against the senior England team, won him a place in the squad to face Bangladesh. His selection, along with the presence of other South African-born players in the England team, was criticised; some commentators suggested there should be fewer foreign-born players in the team. Kieswetter scored his only international <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> in his third match, and a couple of months later he was the <a href="man%20of%20the%20match">man of the match</a> in the <a href="2010%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20%20Final">final</a> when England won the <a href="2010%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20">2010 ICC World Twenty20</a>. After a promising start for England, he was dropped owing to his inconsistency before the end of 2010. He returned to the team the following year, but his place was insecure, and in 2013 he was replaced by <a href="Jos%20Buttler">Jos Buttler</a>, his teammate at Somerset.

Kieswetter's career was cut short owing to an injury sustained while batting for Somerset in July 2014: a ball penetrated the gap between his <a href="cricket%20helmet">helmet</a>'s grille and visor and struck him in the face, damaging his vision. There was initially some hope of a full recovery and he was named in a provisional England squad for the <a href="2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2015 Cricket World Cup</a>, but he continued to experience difficulties with his vision. As a result of these problems, in June 2015, aged 27, he announced his retirement from professional cricket. In 2017, he became a professional golfer.

Kieswetter was born in <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> to an <a href="Afrikaner">Afrikaner</a> father, Wayne, and <a href="Scotland">Scottish</a> mother, Belinda. He studied at <a href="Diocesan%20College">Diocesan College</a> in <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, and played cricket for <a href="Western%20Province%20cricket%20team%20%28South%20Africa%29">Western Province</a> junior teams between the ages of 13 and 18. Kieswetter was disappointed when he was asked to play club cricket for two or three seasons before returning to play for the senior team; he never received an explanation and decided instead to pursue a cricket career in England, where he moved at the age of 18. He studied for his <a href="A-levels">A-levels</a> for a year at <a href="Millfield">Millfield</a>, where <a href="Mark%20Davis%20%28English%20cricketer%29">Mark Davis</a>, a former <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a> bowler, spotted him. He was quickly signed by Somerset. At the <a href="2006%20U/19%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2006 Under-19s World Cup</a> in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, he represented <a href="South%20African%20U-19%20cricket%20team">South Africa</a> and won a <a href="Man%20of%20the%20Match">Man of the Match</a> award in a game against the <a href="United%20States%20national%20cricket%20team">United States</a> for his <a href="innings">innings</a> of 80 off 66 <a href="Delivery%20%28cricket%29">balls</a>.

Kieswetter made his first appearance for Somerset's <a href="Reserve%20team">second team</a> in May 2006, taking over from <a href="Sam%20Spurway">Sam Spurway</a> as wicket-keeper midway through a match when the latter was injured. He scored 94 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> in his first innings of that match against <a href="Glamorgan%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Glamorgan</a>, and by the end of the season he had scored at an <a href="Batting%20average%20%28cricket%29">average</a> of over 40. His performances were so strong that Somerset chose to release Spurway at the start of the <a href="2007%20English%20cricket%20season">2007 season</a>, and named Kieswetter alongside <a href="Carl%20Gazzard">Carl Gazzard</a> as their two wicket-keepers. In early April that year, he made his one-day debut for Somerset against Glamorgan; he made 69 not out off 58 balls and took a catch described as "world class" by Somerset's director of cricket, <a href="Brian%20Rose%20%28cricketer%29">Brian Rose</a>. He made his <a href="First-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut the following month, keeping wicket while <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a> made 801 for 8 <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declared</a> and scored 63 in the Somerset reply.

Kieswetter continued to perform well during 2007 and 2008, and was awarded the <a href="NBC%20Denis%20Compton%20Award">NBC Denis Compton Award</a>, as the "most promising young player", for Somerset in both seasons, scoring several fifties in first-class and one-day cricket. Against Glamorgan, he scored 93 while batting at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">number eight</a>. Kieswetter came in after two wickets had been lost in an <a href="Over%20%28cricket%29">over</a>, with the score at 250 for 6. His innings, which included a <a href="Partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> of 130 with <a href="Andrew%20Caddick">Andrew Caddick</a>, helped Somerset to reach 402 and eventually win the match. Towards the end of the 2008 season, during a 40-over match against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a>, Kieswetter scored his first century for Somerset, scoring from , and sharing a competition-record 302-run partnership with <a href="Marcus%20Trescothick">Marcus Trescothick</a>.

In 2009, Kieswetter passed 1,000 first-class runs in a season for the only time during his career. Early in the year, he scored an unbeaten 150 in a high-scoring <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Draw">draw</a> against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>, his maiden first-class century. A few weeks later, he scored against <a href="Durham%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Durham</a> to help his county <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23draw">avoid defeat</a>. In his report for "<a href="ESPNcricinfo">ESPNcricinfo</a>", Andrew McGlashan described Kieswetter as "another likely South African to make the transition to England colours". Kieswetter scored two further first-class centuries during the year, both at <a href="County%20Ground%2C%20Taunton">Taunton</a>, against <a href="Sussex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Sussex</a> and <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a>; he averaged just under 60 for his 1,242 first-class runs in the season. In one-day cricket, Kieswetter opened the batting alongside Trescothick, and averaged 65.83, scoring an unbeaten 138 off 131 balls against Warwickshire. In the quarter-final of the <a href="2009%20Friends%20Provident%20Trophy">2009 Friends Provident Trophy</a>, Kieswetter scored his second one-day century of the season, but Somerset were defeated by six wickets. His in the <a href="2009%20Twenty20%20Cup">2009 Twenty20 Cup</a> helped Somerset reach the <a href="2009%20Twenty20%20Cup%20Final">final</a> of that competition, where they were again beaten by Sussex. He was awarded his <a href="Cricket%20cap">county cap</a> during the final game of the 2009 County Championship against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>.

Following his strong performances for Somerset, Kieswetter was part of the England Performance Programme squad that spent eight weeks of the English winter training in <a href="Loughborough">Loughborough</a> and <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a>. The South African national cricket captain, <a href="Graeme%20Smith">Graeme Smith</a>, said that he wanted Kieswetter to return to play cricket in South Africa; rather than directly inviting him to play for the <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South Africa national cricket team</a>, he stated that "the challenge is to get him back into our franchise system first, but he is certainly someone we have seen and would like to get back into the system". Kieswetter repeated his desire to play international cricket for England.

In 2010, Kieswetter qualified to play for England on the basis of having a British passport, via his Scottish mother, and his residency in England. Under the rules for international cricket, he had to wait until four years after his last appearance for South Africa, which was on 16 February 2006 during the Under-19s World Cup. In January 2010, he was named as part of the <a href="England%20Lions%20cricket%20team">England Lions</a> squad to tour the <a href="United%20Arab%20Emirates">United Arab Emirates</a> for a series against <a href="Pakistan%20A%20cricket%20team">Pakistan A</a>. The England head coach, <a href="Andy%20Flower">Andy Flower</a>, described Kieswetter's performances during that tour as "a really good start", and described the Twenty20 warm-up match between the England Lions and the England senior team that followed the tour as "a chance for him to impress". During that match, which was played on the day that he qualified for England, Kieswetter scored to help the Lions beat the senior team.
After England's drawn <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20against%20Pakistan%20in%20the%20UAE%20in%202009%E2%80%9310">T20I series</a> with <a href="Pakistan%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a> in mid-February 2010, Kieswetter was added to the senior England squad for the ODI series against <a href="Bangladesh%20national%20cricket%20team">Bangladesh</a>. He was immediately included in the team, playing as a specialist batsman alongside wicket-keeper <a href="Matt%20Prior">Matt Prior</a>, in the first warm-up match on 23 February against the Bangladesh Cricket Board XI. He scored 143, his career-best one-day score, from 123 balls. That score, and his performances for the England Lions, led to Kieswetter's selection for the first ODI against Bangladesh on 28 February. Opening the innings alongside captain <a href="Alastair%20Cook">Alastair Cook</a>, Kieswetter struggled in his first over; he made in an innings described by "ESPNcricinfo"s Andrew Miller as "tinged with nerves" and "chancy". In the next match, two days later, Kieswetter misplayed his first ball and was nearly <a href="Dismissal%20%28cricket%29">dismissed</a>; he was then caught off a similar mishit from the next ball bowled. In the third match, he scored his first international century – which helped England to 284 for five and a 45-run victory. England won the series 3–0. In contrast to the "hard-hitting batting" which <a href="Geoff%20Miller">Geoff Miller</a>, the England selector, had cited as one of the reasons for his inclusion, Kieswetter's century was patiently built after a nervous start.

When the England squad was announced for the <a href="2010%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20">2010 ICC World Twenty20</a>, Kieswetter was named as the only wicket-keeper in the squad, replacing Prior. Kieswetter opened the innings with <a href="Michael%20Lumb%20%28cricketer%29">Michael Lumb</a> throughout the tournament, and "ESPNcricinfo"s Andrew McGlashan identified their performances as one of the reasons that England reached <a href="2010%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20%20Final">the final</a>. During the final, Kieswetter was England's top-scorer, hitting from , and was named as the man of the match as England won their first ICC global title. During the tournament, Kieswetter scored , the fourth-most of any player, at an average of 31.71 and a <a href="strike%20rate">strike rate</a> of 116.84.

After returning to England, Kieswetter's form dipped, and he scored 121 runs from eight ODIs against Australia and Bangladesh. As a result, when England played five ODIs against Pakistan in September, Kieswetter was omitted and Worcestershire's <a href="Steven%20Davies">Steven Davies</a> was preferred, although Kieswetter was included in the T20I squad. Kieswetter opened the innings alongside Davies, who was playing as wicket-keeper, in the two T20Is, but only made scores of six and sixteen. Although named in the T20I squad for the tour of Australia, he was not selected to play, and instead took part in the England Performance Programme XI tour, before joining up with the England Lions to take part in the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20Regional%20Four%20Day%20Competition">Regional Four Day Competition</a> in the West Indies. During the competition, Kieswetter scored two centuries, against the <a href="Leeward%20Islands%20cricket%20team">Leeward Islands</a> and the <a href="Combined%20Campuses%20and%20Colleges%20cricket%20team">Combined Campuses and Colleges</a>.
Kieswetter began the <a href="2011%20English%20cricket%20season">2011 season</a> strongly for Somerset, scoring in his first four one-day matches, including two centuries. Another century, in the <a href="2011%20County%20Championship">County Championship</a> prompted Jeremy James of "ESPNcricinfo" to ask "whether Craig Kieswetter will regain his place in England's one-day side before <a href="Jos%20Buttler">Jos Buttler</a> assumes it ahead of him". His form earned him a recall to England's one-day squads for the series against Sri Lanka, Geoff Miller saying "[Kieswetter] will offer some real fire power with the bat along with his ability with the gloves". In his first match back for England, the Twenty20 match, Kieswetter only scored four runs, but he was England's top-scorer in the first ODI match, with , and was described as "England's most impressive batsman". He struck another half-century in the fourth match of the series: he scored 72 not out as England won by ten wickets. A week later, playing for Somerset against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, he scored , the highest innings of his first-class career, as part of a 290-run partnership with <a href="James%20Hildreth">James Hildreth</a>.

Kieswetter remained England wicket-keeper for the <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%202011">T20I and ODI matches against India</a> late in the season. In the T20I, Buttler, his fellow Somerset wicket-keeper, made his debut, albeit as a specialist batsman; <a href="Jonny%20Bairstow">Jonny Bairstow</a>, the <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> wicket-keeper, made his debut in the final ODI in a similar role. In that series, Kieswetter struggled against the <a href="Seam%20bowling">moving ball</a> in English conditions but was praised for his attacking batting, including from in the second match. Based on the number of appearances that he made for England, Kieswetter was awarded an incremental contract by the <a href="England%20and%20Wales%20Cricket%20Board">England and Wales Cricket Board</a> (ECB) in September 2011. During England's subsequent 5–0 ODI series loss in India, described by the "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>"s Stephen Brenkley as "a tour too far for England", Kieswetter was the only England batsman to maintain a strike rate above 100. He scored one half-century during the tour, and was included in the England Lions squad that toured Sri Lanka three months later.

Playing for the Lions, Kieswetter moved into the middle-order, rather than opening the batting; this was intended to prepare him for a similar switch with the senior England team to allow <a href="Kevin%20Pietersen">Kevin Pietersen</a> to open. He scored a century and a half-century to help England win the series 3–2, though he was outperformed by Buttler. In early 2012, playing against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates, Kieswetter only batted twice in the ODI series, and was praised for his 43-run contribution in the fourth match, though George Dobell of "ESPNcricinfo" identified his wicket-keeping as "still not as polished as he would like". Although Kieswetter dropped down the order in ODIs, he retained his place opening the batting in T20Is. In contrast to the 2010 World Twenty20, when the England players were told to attack bat selflessly, in 2012 the team was instructed to avoid losing early wickets, and Kieswetter struggled to adapt his game to score low-risk singles and rotate the strike. During the <a href="2012%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20">2012 ICC World Twenty20</a>, he lost his place in England's T20I team after a match against New Zealand in which he scored four runs from fourteen balls. That was his final international Twenty20 match. In his 25 games, he scored at an average of 21.91 and a strike rate of 111.91.

Despite his struggles in international cricket, Kieswetter had a successful season with Somerset in 2012; he scored 848 first-class runs at an average of just over 60, including a century against Warwickshire and one for the Lions against Australia A. The following year, he retained his place in the ODI team for the tour of India, although "ESPNcricinfo"s Alex Winter suggested that it might be due to "England's desire to protect the workload of their players ahead of back-to-back <a href="The%20Ashes">Ashes series</a>." Winter's colleague, Dobell, described the England ODI wicket-keeper position as one of England's key areas requiring resolution, citing both Bairstow and Buttler as candidates to take over, as well as the possibility of Matt Prior, the England Test wicket-keeper, reclaiming the role. Kieswetter played the first three ODIs of the series, scoring 24 not out, 18 and 0 before he was dropped and replaced by Buttler. Dobell described Kieswetter as "perhaps... a little unfortunate", but cited his inability to adjust his game and the number of balls he blocked as the reasons for his removal. He played , scoring at an average of 30.11.

The competition between Kieswetter and Buttler for England's one-day wicket-keeping role also caused conflict at Somerset for the 2013 season: both players wanted to fulfil the role for the county. Kieswetter began the season as the wicket-keeper in the County Championship, but broke his thumb during the third match of the season, which kept him out of action for six weeks. Kieswetter had a particularly strong Twenty20 season, finishing as the leading run-scorer in the <a href="2013%20Friends%20Life%20t20">2013 Friends Life t20</a> with , including five half-centuries. His teammate, <a href="Peter%20Trego">Peter Trego</a>, praised Kieswetter's ability to build big innings in Twenty20 cricket, and Kieswetter himself said that he "tried to be a bit more of a responsible player, rather than just power blazing." He scored a late-season century against Warwickshire in the County Championship, but in a season in which Somerset struggled against <a href="Promotion%20and%20relegation">relegation</a>, he scored a relatively modest 606 first-class runs at an average of 31.89. At the end of the season, Buttler, whose contract with Somerset had expired, announced that he was joining Lancashire, leaving Kieswetter as the clear first-choice wicket-keeper at Somerset.

Kieswetter signed with the <a href="Brisbane%20Heat">Brisbane Heat</a> for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Big%20Bash%20League%20season">2013–14 Big Bash League</a>. During the tournament, he scored from eight matches including two half-centuries. He entered the <a href="List%20of%202014%20Indian%20Premier%20League%20personnel%20changes">2014 Indian Premier League auction</a>, but remained unsold. He was called up as a late replacement for the injured <a href="Luke%20Wright">Luke Wright</a> for England's squad in the <a href="2014%20ICC%20World%20Twenty20">2014 ICC World Twenty20</a>, but was not selected to play. He began the 2014 season positively for Somerset, particularly in the Twenty20 competition, in which he scored six half-centuries in ten innings, averaging just under 50.

On 12 July 2014, Kieswetter suffered a broken nose and fractured cheek bone while batting for Somerset against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a> in a County Championship match. The bowler, <a href="David%20Willey%20%28cricketer%29">David Willey</a>, delivered a <a href="Bouncer%20%28cricket%29">bouncer</a> which went through the gap between the grille and the visor on Kieswetter's <a href="Cricket%20helmet">helmet</a> and struck him in the face. The injuries were initially described by Somerset's chairman, Andy Nash, as "serious but non-career threatening". He underwent facial surgery, and suffered from double vision for a while after. He returned to the Somerset side before the end of the 2014 season and scored a half-century in his first match back, against <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a>, though he admitted that his vision was still not fully recovered. Kieswetter signed for the South African franchise <a href="Warriors%20%28cricket%20team%29">Warriors</a> as their overseas player to play in the <a href="Ram%20Slam%20T20%20Challenge">Ram Slam T20 Challenge</a> for the 2014–15 season. He played all ten matches for the Warriors, scoring at an average of 22.11, including two half-centuries.

On 10 December 2014, despite having been named in England's 30-man provisional <a href="2015%20Cricket%20World%20Cup">2015 Cricket World Cup</a> squad, Kieswetter revealed that he was still suffering vision problems. He announced that he would not play in the 2015 season and would seek further treatment. The following June, he announced his retirement from professional cricket, saying that, although he was still capable of playing, he could not play to the standard he wanted: "In the end I just thought, there are too many mediocre players in county cricket – and good luck to them – but I don't want to be another one." He found batting in floodlit conditions particularly difficult, and described the vision in his right eye as being "only at 80 or 85 percent". He finished his career with similar statistics in first-class and one-day cricket; in both he averaged just under 40 and had scored eleven centuries. In Twenty20 cricket, his highest score was 89 not out, and he averaged just over 30. In an interview with "ESPNcricinfo" shortly after his retirement, Kieswetter said that he would be interested in working in the media, perhaps as part of a commentary team for Twenty20 matches.

Although rare, the injury to Kieswetter was followed by another high-profile case, when <a href="Phillip%20Hughes">Phillip Hughes</a> died after being struck on the head by a cricket ball while batting. These incidents led the ECB to make the wearing of helmets mandatory for professional cricketers in England from the start of the 2016 season, and banned them from wearing helmets with adjustable grilles, specifying that the gap between the grille and the cap should be no more than .

Kieswetter's confident and attacking batting style was compared to that of Kevin Pietersen, another England batsman of South African origin. Although Kieswetter favoured the <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23O">off-side</a>, he was also strong behind <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23S">square</a> on both sides, and stood with a typical South African stance, his bat held high. He played with what "Wisden" described as an "attractive, uncomplicated front-foot technique". He began his career playing in front of his stumps, but once bowlers had worked out his technique, he moved his batting stance to outside the leg stump to give himself more space to drive the ball. This move had some success on flat <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">subcontinental</a> <a href="Pitch%20%28cricket%29">pitches</a>, but was less effective in England, where the ball tended to change direction more. Kieswetter admitted that the change had not worked, saying that "I wasn’t really moving my feet. I was staying leg-side and playing with my hands. My technique just wasn’t strong enough to cope." After being dropped by England, Kieswetter worked on his batting, which had been described by <a href="Steve%20James%20%28cricketer%29">Steve James</a> as a "frenzy at the crease, as manic as a teenager on a night out". He moved back in front of his stumps, and maintained a calmer mentality, aiming to construct an innings.

He was generally more highly regarded for his batting than his wicket-keeping, often drawing criticism for the quality of his <a href="Glossary%20of%20cricket%20terms%23G">glovework</a>. Despite this, he was at times considered to be a better wicket-keeper than two of his rivals for England; Bairstow and Buttler. Nonetheless, playing in an era when international teams did not play specialist wicket-keepers, Kieswetter's selection was based primarily upon his batting ability, rather than his keeping ability. For a couple of matches during 2012, he was used as an <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a> bowler by Somerset, collecting three wickets.

Somerset experimented with Kieswetter throughout the order, trying to find the most effective place for him. He began as a middle-order batsman, but by the end of the 2007 season, although he remained in the middle-order in first-class cricket, Kieswetter regularly found himself opening the batting alongside Marcus Trescothick in one-day cricket, a role he would also take up in opening six matches of the 2009 Twenty20 Cup, although he later dropped back into the middle order to improve the balance of the side. On his international call-up, England chose to use Kieswetter as an opening batsman. He was selected "because of his proven ability to pierce the field in the <a href="Powerplay%20%28cricket%29">Powerplay overs</a>, particularly with his booming drives up and over the covers." He later moved down the order for England to accommodate Kevin Pietersen as opener.

After Kieswetter's retirement from cricket, his father suggested that he take a break and play some golf. He had done so during his youth in South Africa, playing in provincial tournaments. After some lessons with <a href="David%20Leadbetter%20%28golf%20instructor%29">David Leadbetter</a>, who suggested that he try to become a professional golfer, Kieswetter began to enter amateur tournaments. After performing well in those events, he set himself a target of becoming a professional, and playing regularly on the <a href="European%20Tour">European Tour</a>. In late 2016, he took part in a couple of <a href="PGA%20EuroPro%20Tour">PGA EuroPro Tour</a> tournaments and one on the <a href="MENA%20Golf%20Tour">MENA Golf Tour</a>. In early 2017, he turned professional and in March played in the MENA Golf Tour <a href="qualifying%20school">qualifying school</a> in Morocco, finishing tied for 31st place and earning a card for the <a href="2017%20MENA%20Golf%20Tour">2017 season</a>. He played regularly on the Tour during 2017 and in September won his biggest prize of the season, winning US$360 in the Dubai Creek Open after finishing tied for 38th place.

Michael Brown Okinawa assault incident

On November 2, 2002, <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">Major</a> Michael Brown attempted an <a href="indecent%20assault">indecent assault</a> on a <a href="Filipino%20people">Filipina</a> <a href="bartender">bartender</a> in <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>, <a href="Japan">Japan</a>. The bartender accused Brown of attempting to <a href="rape">rape</a> her and of throwing her cell phone into a nearby river; Brown denied the rape charges. The victim later recanted and attempted to withdraw the accusation, though prosecutors presented evidence that she had received a cash payment just before doing so.

The case received extensive attention in the <a href="Japanese%20media">Japanese media</a>, especially in Okinawa, and the crime sparked a <a href="public%20debate">public debate</a> over the <a href="United%20States%20Forces%20Japan">U.S. military presence in Japan</a>, the privileges of <a href="extraterritoriality">extraterritoriality</a>, as well as the <a href="Right%20to%20a%20fair%20trial">fair-trial</a> practices of <a href="Criminal%20justice%20system%20of%20Japan">Japanese legal system</a> and the <a href="Police%20system%20of%20Japan">Japanese police</a>. The case involved the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Mutual%20Cooperation%20and%20Security%20Between%20the%20United%20States%20and%20Japan">Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan</a> and the <a href="U.S.%E2%80%93Japan%20Status%20of%20Forces%20Agreement">U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement</a> (SOFA).

On July 8, 2004, after a 19-month trial, Brown was convicted by a Japanese court of attempted indecent assault and destruction of private property and received a one-year <a href="Suspended%20sentence">suspended</a> <a href="prison%20sentence">prison sentence</a>. As a result of this incident and others involving crimes committed by <a href="Military%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. military personnel</a> in Japan, both countries entered into negotiations aimed at modifying the SOFA in July 2003; ultimately, no changes were made to the agreement. In 2005, Brown was arrested and charged with a separate <a href="kidnapping">kidnapping</a> in the United States. He was demoted and involuntarily retired from the military in 2006 and at his trial in 2009 entered an <a href="Alford%20plea">Alford plea</a>, receiving <a href="probation">probation</a> on the felony conviction.

Early in the morning of November 2, 2002, a female employee of the <a href="Camp%20Courtney">Camp Courtney</a> <a href="Mess">officers' club</a> on Okinawa drove up to the Courtney main gate and reported to base security personnel that a Marine Corps major had just attempted to <a href="sexual%20assault">sexually assault</a> her in her car on a deserted road near the back gate of the base. She identified the Marine as Major Michael Brown and stated that during the assault the major threw her mobile phone into the nearby <a href="Tengan%20River">Tengan River</a>. The woman, later identified with the initials V.N., who was 40 years old, and originally from the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, and was married to a Japanese citizen of Okinawan descent. She reported that she had picked up Brown in her car about 1:30 a.m. after the officers' club closed and that he directed her to the deserted road behind the base and after parking, Brown tried to <a href="rape">rape</a> her and then threw her mobile phone into the river when she tried to call the police. The Camp Courtney security personnel called the Japanese <a href="National%20Police%20Agency%20%28Japan%29">National Police Agency</a> (NPA). Japanese officers came and took V. N.'s report.

Michael Brown was at the time 39 years old, was married, had two small children, and was a 19-year Marine veteran assigned to the command element of the <a href="III%20Marine%20Expeditionary%20Force">III Marine Expeditionary Force</a> at Camp Courtney on his second tour on Okinawa. Brown voluntarily underwent several hours of questioning at the JNP station in <a href="Gushikawa%2C%20Okinawa">Gushikawa</a>. He told Japanese police investigators that V. N. had propositioned him for sex and that, when he refused, a physical altercation ensued. During the altercation, Brown said, V. N. took his wallet and Brown grabbed her mobile phone, which he, "out of frustration", proceeded to toss into the nearby river. Brown stated that V. N. drove away but returned a few minutes later and gave his wallet back to him. Both Brown's and V. N.'s accounts agreed that V. N. had originally picked up Brown in her car after meeting him for the first time at the base officers' club that evening. Both stated that V. N. had agreed to give Brown, who was <a href="Drunkenness">intoxicated</a>, a ride home.

On December 3, 2002, the JNP issued a <a href="Warrant%20%28law%29">warrant</a> for Brown's arrest. The Japanese government asked that Brown be turned over to Japanese authorities immediately. Although the U.S.–Japan Status of Forces Agreement stated that service members would only be turned over to Japanese law enforcement if formally <a href="Indictment">indicted</a>, the U.S. had agreed to give "sympathetic consideration" for serious crimes in response to the <a href="1995%20Okinawan%20rape%20incident">1995 Okinawan rape incident</a>, in which a <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> sailor and two Marines raped a 12-year-old Okinawan girl.

The United States, in this case, decided not to turn Brown over to the Japanese authorities before he was formally indicted and restricted Brown to base on Camp Courtney. On December 9, the JNP filed formal charges against Brown and, on December 19, he was formally indicted on charges of attempted rape and destruction of private property. The next day, Brown, escorted by U.S. Marine Corps <a href="military%20police">military police</a>, was turned over to the custody of Japanese police at the <a href="Naha%2C%20Okinawa">Naha</a> detention center. When asked why they had waited ten days after the formal charges to indict Brown, Japanese Deputy Chief Prosecutor Junichi Okumura stated that they wanted to give Brown a chance to apologize (called "jidan" in Japanese) to the victim. Since that apparently did not occur and V. N. still expressed a desire to press charges, the Japanese authorities went ahead with the indictment.

On December 25, Naha District Court judge denied <a href="bail">bail</a> for Brown because, "there was concern that he [Brown] might try to destroy evidence or intimidate witnesses if he was set free." Ikeda also said that she was concerned over the seriousness of the charges and the large discrepancy between the statements of Brown and V. N.. Brown was represented at the hearing by a local <a href="Attorney%20at%20law%20%28Japan%29">Japanese defense attorney</a>, . Akamine reported that Brown's family in the United States had begun "jidan" negotiations with the victim. At this time, Brown's brother also launched a website to protest Brown's detention and to complain about what he perceived to be unfair treatment of Brown by the Japanese courts. Brown later reported that Japanese prison officials "admonished" him over the launching of the protest website by his family.

On January 9, 2003, bail was denied for Brown by the same judge for a second time. Brown then appealed the bail decision to a three-judge panel of the Naha court who upheld the denial of bail on January 16. The Naha court scheduled Brown's trial to begin on March 13, but later changed the date to May 26 because of delays incurred by legal motions filed by Brown's attorneys. The trial was expected to last for some time because, under the procedures of the Japanese justice system, trial hearings are usually only conducted for one or two days a month.

On January 24, Brown hired two new defense attorneys, Michael Griffith and Toshimitsu Takaesu. Griffith was a <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> attorney who had previously represented Marines in Okinawa. Takaesu was a former Okinawa chief prosecutor. Both were described as "outspoken critics of Japan's legal system". The first week of March, another attorney hired by Brown filed a <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a> petition with the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20District%20of%20Columbia">United States District Court for the District of Columbia</a> claiming that the legality of Brown's incarceration was open to question due to what Brown claimed was the inherent unfairness of the Japanese judicial system. The U.S. court dismissed the motion on March 12, citing jurisdictional issues.

Throughout the trial, Brown wrote numerous public missives about what he felt was the unfairness and corruption of the Japanese justice system and accusing the local Okinawan government of pursuing a political agenda in the prosecution of his case. Brown's letters were posted on his family's website and informally distributed throughout Okinawa's U.S. military population. Brown and his family also wrote many letters to U.S. politicians and government officials complaining of Brown's treatment by Japanese authorities and actively encouraged other U.S. military members and U.S. citizens to do the same.

On March 13, an Okinawan newspaper reported that the JNP had matched <a href="DNA">DNA</a> taken from saliva on the victim's upper body with DNA in a blood sample obtained from Brown during the investigation. Brown was again denied bail on March 17. Takaesu blamed the anonymous report about the DNA evidence in the newspaper as the reason for the bail denial and criticized the Naha District Prosecutor's Office for not including the DNA evidence in the evidence list submitted before the trial was scheduled to begin. In reply, Junichi Okumura, a Naha District deputy chief prosecutor stated, "Here in Japan, unlike the United States, there is no problem if evidence is submitted later". Brown was granted a ¥10 million bail (approximately <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>100,000, c.2003) by the Naha court on May 13 but he was restricted to Camp Courtney for the duration of the trial.

Brown's family hired Gene Warfield, an American ex-<a href="United%20States%20Army%20Special%20Forces">special forces</a> soldier who had lived in Okinawa for 17 years, as a consultant to assist them in "looking into the allegations levied against Michael [Brown]". On the evening of May 7, as Warfield, his Japanese wife, and daughter arrived at a restaurant on Okinawa, a man attacked Warfield with a knife, injuring him slightly. Warfield described the man's attack as "professional". The JNP investigated, but no arrests were made.

Brown's trial began in Naha on May 26 with <a href="testimony">testimony</a> from V. N.. Over the next three days of testimony, V. N. repeatedly stated that Brown was innocent and that she wanted to withdraw her complaint. She said that any contact between her and Brown on the night in question was consensual and that she allowed Brown to fondle and kiss her breasts. At that point, V. N. said, she began to resist and Brown became angry. V. N. testified that when she threatened to call police, Brown threw her cell phone into the [Tengan] river. Angry at the loss of her cell phone, V. N. stated that she then embellished the story when she told it to the guards at the Courtney main gate. V. N. further claimed that she had been <a href="coerce">coerce</a>d by police, prosecutors and her employer, a local agency that provides temporary workers for USMC bases on Okinawa, to file the charges. She said that once the charges were filed, Japanese <a href="prosecutor">prosecutor</a>s told her she could only withdraw the charges in court. One of the Naha judges then asked V. N. why she was not angry at Brown to which V. N. replied, "Because he didn't attempt to rape me. Before, I was angry at him for throwing away my cell phone. But not now."

The next trial hearing took place on June 4. At the hearing, Takaesu stated that Brown had arranged with the Camp Courtney officers' club manager to have sex with V. N., but that V. N. resisted Brown's advances after driving him to the secluded road off base. The Naha prosecutor said during the hearing that V. N. had insisted on pressing charges.

The next court session was on July 1. At this session, Satoshi Kawamitsu, an attorney for the employment agency that V. N. worked for, testified that he had tried to arrange a "<a href="jidan">jidan</a>" <a href="Settlement%20%28litigation%29">settlement</a> between Brown and V. N. in December 2002, but V. N. had insisted on pressing charges. He stated that he informed her that once the charges were filed, she would not be able to withdraw them until the trial began.

At the next court session on July 15, prosecutors submitted evidence that V. N. had received 13,500<a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a> from an unknown source just before she <a href="recant">recant</a>ed the charges during the May court session. The prosecution submitted the <a href="evidence">evidence</a> in an attempt to show that V. N.'s original statements and desire to press the <a href="Criminal%20charge">charges</a> were valid, and later attempts to recant were in <a href="bad%20faith">bad faith</a>. Brown then took the stand but refused to answer questions as to why his initial statements to <a href="Japanese%20police">Japanese police</a> were different from what Takaesu later stated in court had actually happened on the night in question. The prosecutor asked Brown, "Your original statement that she made sexual advances was false?" Brown replied, "I am not going to answer that." When asked why he would not answer, Brown replied, "Because I want the opportunity for this court to see publicly the type of corruption and distortion of evidence by the police and the prosecutor." Takaesu later said that another reason for Brown's refusal to answer most of the questions was because his answers could be used by the USMC in separate <a href="Uniform%20Code%20of%20Military%20Justice">military justice</a> actions against Brown.

During a later court session on September 9, Takaesu attempted to submit <a href="medical%20evidence">medical evidence</a> that Brown had suffered a <a href="back%20injury">back injury</a> in 1999 and had a <a href="steel%20collar">steel collar</a> and <a href="Spinal%20cord%20injury">bolts</a> inserted around his <a href="Vertebral%20column">spine</a>. According to Brown, these injuries made it impossible to for him to assault V. N. as described in the police report. The Naha court panel of three judges agreed to issue a decision as to whether the evidence was submissable at a later date.

During another trial session later in September, the Naha court decided to accept V. N.'s <a href="pre-trial">pre-trial</a> statements and accusations of Brown along with her later attempts to recant. Brown <a href="appeal">appeal</a>ed this decision to the Fukuoka High Court's Naha branch, which dismissed the appeal. Japan's supreme court upheld the Fukuoka court's dismissal of the appeal in late November 2003. In October 2003, Brown requested that the three Naha court judges assigned to the trial <a href="Judicial%20disqualification">disqualify</a> themselves, stating that they were "prejudiced against him". The Naha court judges declined to do so, and the trial was set to resume in January 2004.

The trial resumed on January 16, 2004, when the Naha court accepted the evidence of Brown's spinal and <a href="Neck%20pain">neck injuries</a>. Takaesu testified that it would have been physically impossible for Brown to commit a violent <a href="sexual%20assault">sexual assault</a> on V. N.. When Takaesu called for the clothing V. N. wore the night of the alleged assault to be entered as evidence, the prosecutor, Tsuyoshi Satake, refused to present it. During a hearing in March, Brown admitted that he had lied to Japanese police about what had happened on the night in question. Brown stated that he and V. N. had engaged in some "heavy petting" in her car and that she objected when he began to take it "too far". After Brown said that he <a href="insult">insult</a>ed her, she threatened to call the police and he grabbed her cell phone and threw it in the river.

On April 24, Takeshi Oda, representing the prosecution, made his closing arguments, describing the alleged crime as "vicious and atrocious", and calling for a three-year prison sentence for Brown. Oda added that the alleged crime had affected the local community, stating, "There's a feeling of <a href="anxiety">anxiety</a> among the residents because of this incident." During the same hearing, Takaesu submitted as evidence a letter Brown wrote to V. N. apologizing for using bad language with her and giving her ¥8,000 (about 75 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>, c.2004) to replace her cell phone.

Following a 19-month trial, on July 8, 2004, Brown was convicted by the Naha District Court of "attempting an indecent act" and "<a href="destruction%20of%20property">destruction of property</a>" but was acquitted of the rape charge. The court gave Brown a one-year prison sentence, suspended for three years, and <a href="Fine%20%28penalty%29">fined</a> him 1,400 <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>. Chief Judge Nobuyuki Yokota said Brown was given a <a href="Criminal%20sentencing%20in%20the%20United%20States">light sentence</a> because the 21-year Marine <a href="veteran">veteran</a> had no prior <a href="criminal%20record">criminal record</a>. Citing the victim's stated unwillingness to punish Brown, the prosecution declined to appeal the verdict. Brown appealed the verdict to <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Japan">Japan's supreme court</a>, which dismissed the appeal in July 2004. Brown was <a href="Permanent%20Change%20of%20Station">permanently transferred</a> by the U.S. military to <a href="Marine%20Corps%20Base%20Quantico">Marine Corps Base Quantico</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> in August 2004.

The issue of violent crime, especially rape and murder, committed by U.S. servicemembers on Japanese citizens in Okinawa has often strained relations between the U.S., Japan, and the local Okinawan government. The U.S. has argued that "extraterritoriality" or "extrality" (meaning the right of a foreigner charged with a crime to be turned over for trial to his own diplomatic representatives in accordance with his national law) granted its military members under the SOFA is necessary to afford them the same rights that exist under the U.S. criminal justice system. Since the SOFA also exempts most U.S. military members from Japanese visa and passport laws, past incidents occurred in which U.S. military members charged with crimes by Japanese authorities on Okinawa were transferred back to the U.S. without facing prosecution in Japanese courts. In cases where the charged servicemember remained in Japan, Japanese authorities often did not have access to question or interrogate the U.S. servicemember, making it difficult for Japanese prosecutors to prepare a case for indictment.

The issue became central to the demand by many Okinawans and other Japanese citizens for the significant reduction and eventual elimination of U.S. military forces stationed in Okinawa. In the opinion of many Japanese citizens living in Okinawa, the U.S. used the SOFA to shield U.S. servicemembers who committed crimes against Japanese citizens from the <a href="Criminal%20justice%20system%20of%20Japan">Japanese criminal justice system</a>. The September 4, 1995, widely reported <a href="1995%20Okinawa%20rape%20incident">rape of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen</a> caused the U.S. and Japan to revise the SOFA, stating that in the future, the U.S. would give "sympathetic consideration" to the hand-over of U.S. servicemembers accused of violent crimes such as rape or murder to Japanese authorities before indictment. To many in Okinawa, the incident involving Brown appeared to fall under this new provision in the SOFA. After the initial allegations involving Brown were publicized and before charges had even been filed, Okinawa Governor Keiichi Inamine publicly stated, "This is a heinous crime trampling on female human rights. Moreover, this is a crime committed by a marine corps major, a person who should be in a leadership position."

Japan had requested that the U.S. hand over suspects before indictment in three previous cases to which the U.S. had complied. On December 3, 2002, Japan's national government asked that Brown be transferred to Japanese police officials for confinement, but in this case the United States declined to do until an indictment was handed down. The U.S. embassy stated, "The government of the United States has concluded that the circumstances of this case as presented by the government of Japan do not warrant departure from the standard practice as agreed between the United States and Japan." On December 10, 2002, the <a href="Okinawa%20Prefectural%20Assembly">Okinawa Prefectural Assembly</a> unanimously adopted a resolution calling on the United States to immediately transfer Brown to Japanese authorities and called on the Japanese national government to again demand Brown's immediate hand-over. The resolution condemned the United States' refusal to hand over Brown, calling it, "in defiance of our country's judicial setup and in disregard of its sovereignty" and "intolerable". Keiichi Inamine added, "I have come to fully realize anew that a thorough review of the Japan–U.S. Status of Forces Agreement is necessary."

Because of this and subsequent incidents by U.S. servicemembers on Okinawa, including another rape of a local woman by a U.S. Marine, the governors of fourteen Japanese <a href="prefecture">prefecture</a>s in which U.S. military forces were stationed urged the ruling <a href="Liberal%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Japan%29">Liberal Democratic Party</a> "to secure a true Japan–U.S. partnership through a revised Status of Forces Agreement". On July 2, 2003, Japan and the United States opened negotiations into modifying the SOFA, but the negotiations failed to produce any change to the current agreement.

In October 2005, Brown was arrested and charged with kidnapping an 18-year-old Vietnamese-American high school student from a flea market in <a href="Milton%2C%20West%20Virginia">Milton, West Virginia</a>, on October 2, 2005. According to the police, Brown, allegedly upset that collectible coins he had purchased a few weeks before were worthless, returned to the flea market representing himself as a police officer, handcuffed her, and drove the girl to Kanawha County under the pretense of taking her in for questioning. The girl escaped from Brown's car a few hours later after realizing he was not an officer, according to West Virginia State Police. After the arrest, the USMC demoted Brown to <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%29">Captain</a> and involuntarily retired him at that rank on February 1, 2006. On August 14, 2009, Brown entered an <a href="Alford%20plea">Alford plea</a>, meaning he did not admit guilt but did not contest that prosecutors had evidence to prove his guilt, and was convicted on a felony charge of attempting to commit kidnapping and a misdemeanor petty larceny charge in Cabell County, West Virginia Circuit Court. Brown was sentenced to three years probation, two years of which were to be spent in home confinement, and agreed to pay restitution and all court costs.

Interstate 70 in Colorado

Interstate 70 (I-70) is a transcontinental <a href="Interstate%20Highway">Interstate Highway</a> in the United States, stretching from <a href="Cove%20Fort%2C%20Utah">Cove Fort, Utah</a>, to <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore, Maryland</a>. In <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, the highway traverses an east–west route across the center of the state. In western Colorado, the highway connects the metropolitan areas of <a href="Grand%20Junction%2C%20Colorado">Grand Junction</a> and <a href="Denver">Denver</a> via a route through the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. In eastern Colorado, the highway crosses the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a>, connecting Denver with metropolitan areas in <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> and <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. Bicycles and other non-motorized vehicles, normally prohibited on Interstate Highways, are allowed on those stretches of I-70 in the Rockies where no other through route exists.

The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) lists the construction of I-70 among the engineering marvels undertaken in the Interstate Highway system, and cites four major accomplishments: the section through the <a href="Dakota%20Hogback">Dakota Hogback</a>, <a href="Eisenhower%20Tunnel">Eisenhower Tunnel</a>, <a href="Vail%20Pass">Vail Pass</a> and <a href="Glenwood%20Canyon">Glenwood Canyon</a>. The Eisenhower Tunnel, with a maximum elevation of and length of , is the longest mountain tunnel and highest point along the Interstate Highway System. The portion through Glenwood Canyon was completed on October 14, 1992. This was one of the final pieces of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic, and is one of the most expensive rural highways per mile built in the United States. The <a href="Colorado%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Colorado Department of Transportation</a> (CDOT) earned the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> for the completion of I-70 through the canyon.

When the Interstate Highway system was in the planning stages, the western terminus of I-70 was proposed to be at Denver. The portion west of Denver was included into the plans after lobbying by Governor <a href="Edwin%20C.%20Johnson">Edwin C. Johnson</a>, for whom one of the tunnels along I-70 is named. East of <a href="Idaho%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Idaho Springs</a>, I-70 was built along the corridor of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20Colorado">U.S. Highway 40</a>, one of the original transcontinental <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">U.S. Highways</a>. West of Idaho Springs, I-70 was built along the route of <a href="U.S.%20Route%206%20in%20Colorado">U.S. Highway 6</a>, which was extended into Colorado during the 1930s.

I-70 enters Colorado from <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrent</a> with <a href="U.S.%20Route%206%20in%20Colorado">US 6</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20%28Colorado%29">US 50</a>, on a plateau between the north rim of <a href="Ruby%20Canyon">Ruby Canyon</a> of the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> and the south rim of the <a href="Book%20Cliffs">Book Cliffs</a>. The plateau ends just past the state line and the highway descends into the <a href="Grand%20Valley%20%28Colorado-Utah%29">Grand Valley</a>, formed by the Colorado River and its tributaries. The Grand Valley is home to several towns and small cities that form the <a href="Grand%20Junction%20Metropolitan%20Statistical%20Area">Grand Junction Metropolitan Statistical Area</a>, the largest conurbation in the area regionally known as the <a href="Colorado%20Western%20Slope">Western Slope</a>. The highway directly serves the communities of <a href="Fruita%2C%20Colorado">Fruita</a>, <a href="Grand%20Junction%2C%20Colorado">Grand Junction</a> and <a href="Palisade%2C%20Colorado">Palisade</a>. Grand Junction is the largest city between <a href="Denver">Denver</a> and <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a> and serves as the economic hub of the area. The freeway passes to the north of downtown, while US 6 and 50 retain their original routes through downtown. US 6 rejoins I-70 east of Grand Junction; US 50 departs on a course toward <a href="Pueblo%2C%20Colorado">Pueblo</a>.

I-70 exits the valley through <a href="De%20Beque%20Canyon">De Beque Canyon</a>, a path carved by the Colorado River that separates the Book Cliffs from <a href="Battlement%20Mesa">Battlement Mesa</a>. The river and its <a href="tributaries">tributaries</a> provide the course for the ascent up the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, the first of several <a href="tunnel">tunnel</a>s built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of <a href="Parachute%2C%20Colorado">Parachute</a> and <a href="Rifle%2C%20Colorado">Rifle</a>.

East of the city of <a href="Glenwood%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Glenwood Springs</a>, the highway enters <a href="Glenwood%20Canyon">Glenwood Canyon</a>. Both the federal and state departments of transportation have praised the engineering achievement required to build the freeway through the narrow gorge while preserving the natural beauty of the canyon. A section of roadway features the No Name Tunnel, Hanging Lake Tunnel, Reverse Curve Tunnel, 40 bridges and <a href="viaduct">viaduct</a>s, and miles of retaining walls. Through a significant portion of the canyon, the eastbound lanes extend <a href="cantilever">cantilever</a>ed over the Colorado River and the westbound lanes are suspended on a viaduct several feet above the canyon floor. Along this run, the freeway hugs the north bank of the Colorado River, while the main line of the <a href="Union%20Pacific%20Railroad">Union Pacific Railroad</a> (formerly the <a href="Denver%20and%20Rio%20Grande%20Western%20Railroad">Denver and Rio Grande Western</a>) occupies the south bank.
To minimize the hazards along this portion, a command center staffed with emergency response vehicles and <a href="tow%20truck">tow truck</a>s on standby monitors cameras along the tunnels and viaducts in the canyon. Traffic signals have been placed at strategic locations to stop traffic in the event of an accident, and <a href="variable%20message%20signs">variable message signs</a> equipped with <a href="radar%20gun">radar gun</a>s will automatically warn motorists exceeding the design speed of one of the curves. The USDOT makes provision for bicycles, which are usually prohibited along Interstate Highways, along the freeway corridor in Glenwood Canyon.

The highway departs the Colorado River near <a href="Dotsero%2C%20Colorado">Dotsero</a>, the name given to the railroad separation for the two primary mountain crossings, the original via <a href="Tennessee%20Pass%20%28Colorado%29">Tennessee Pass</a>/<a href="Royal%20Gorge">Royal Gorge</a> and the newer and shorter <a href="Moffat%20Tunnel">Moffat Tunnel</a> route. I-70 uses a separate route between the two rail corridors. From this junction I-70 follows the <a href="Eagle%20River%20%28Colorado%29">Eagle River</a> toward <a href="Vail%20Pass">Vail Pass</a>, at an elevation of . In this canyon I-70 reaches the western terminus of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Colorado">U.S. Highway 24</a>, which meanders through the Rockies before rejoining I-70. US 24 is known as the Highway of the <a href="Fourteener">Fourteener</a>s, from the concentration of mountains exceeding along the highway corridor.
Along the ascent, I-70 serves the <a href="ski%20resort">ski resort</a> town of <a href="Vail%2C%20Colorado">Vail</a> and the ski areas of <a href="Beaver%20Creek%20Resort">Beaver Creek Resort</a>, <a href="Vail%20Ski%20Resort">Vail Ski Resort</a> and <a href="Copper%20Mountain%20%28Colorado%29">Copper Mountain</a>.
The construction of the freeway over Vail Pass is also listed as an engineering marvel. One of the challenges of this portion is the management of the <a href="wildlife">wildlife</a> that roams this area. Several parts of the approach to the pass feature large fences that prevent wildlife from crossing the freeway and direct the animals to one of several underpasses. At least one underpass is located along a natural migratory path and has been landscaped to encourage <a href="deer">deer</a> to cross.

The highway descends to <a href="Dillon%20Reservoir">Dillon Reservoir</a>, near the town of <a href="Frisco%2C%20Colorado">Frisco</a>, and begins one final ascent to the <a href="Eisenhower%20Tunnel">Eisenhower Tunnel</a>, where the freeway crosses the <a href="Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a>. At the time of dedication, this tunnel was the highest vehicular tunnel in the world, at . As of 2010, the facility was still the highest vehicular tunnel in the United States. The Eisenhower Tunnel is noted as both the longest mountain tunnel and highest point on the Interstate Highway System. The tunnel has a command center, staffed with 52 full-time employees, to monitor traffic, remove stranded vehicles, and maintain generators to keep the tunnel's lighting and ventilation systems running in the event of a power failure. Signals are placed at each entrance and at various points inside the tunnel to close lanes or stop traffic in an emergency. There are several active and former ski resorts in the vicinity of the tunnel, including <a href="Breckenridge%20Ski%20Resort">Breckenridge Ski Resort</a>, <a href="Keystone%20Resort">Keystone Resort</a>, <a href="Arapahoe%20Basin">Arapahoe Basin</a>, <a href="Loveland%20Ski%20Area">Loveland Ski Area</a>, <a href="Berthoud%20Pass%20Ski%20Area">Berthoud Pass Ski Area</a> and <a href="Winter%20Park%20Resort">Winter Park Resort</a>.

The freeway follows <a href="Clear%20Creek%20%28Colorado%29">Clear Creek</a> down the eastern side of the Rockies, passing through the Veterans Memorial Tunnels near <a href="Idaho%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Idaho Springs</a>. Farther to the east, I-70 departs the US 6 corridor, which continues to follow Clear Creek through a narrow, curving gorge. The interstate, however, follows the corridor of US 40 out of the canyon. The highway crests a small mountain near <a href="Genesee%20Park%20%28Colorado%29">Genesee Park</a> to descend into Mount Vernon Canyon to exit the Rocky Mountains. This portion features grade-warning signs with unusual messages, such as "Trucks: Don't be fooled," "Truckers, you are not down yet," and "Are your brakes adjusted and cool?" <a href="Runaway%20truck%20ramp">Runaway truck ramp</a>s are a prominent feature along this portion of I-70, with a total of seven used along the descent of either side the Continental Divide to stop trucks with failed brakes.
The last geographic feature of the Rocky Mountains traversed before the highway reaches the Great Plains is the <a href="Dakota%20Hogback">Dakota Hogback</a>. The path through the <a href="hogback%20%28geology%29">hogback</a> features a massive cut that exposes various layers of rock millions of years old. The site includes a nature study area for visitors.

As the freeway passes from the Rocky Mountains to the <a href="Great%20Plains">Great Plains</a>, I-70 enters the <a href="Denver">Denver</a> metropolitan area, part of a larger urban area called the <a href="Front%20Range%20Urban%20Corridor">Front Range Urban Corridor</a>. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the <a href="LoDo">LoDo</a> district, the common name of the lower downtown area of Denver. Through the downtown area, US 40 is routed along <a href="Colfax%20Avenue">Colfax Avenue</a>, which served as the primary east–west artery through the Denver area before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, US 6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 corridor to join <a href="Interstate%2076%20%28west%29">Interstate 76</a> on a northeast course toward <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>. The freeway meets <a href="Interstate%2025%20in%20Colorado">Interstate 25</a> in an interchange frequently called the <a href="Mousetrap%20%28Denver%29">Mousetrap</a>. From I-25 on to <a href="Interstate%20225">I-225</a>, I-70 serves—together with those two Interstates—as part of an inner <a href="beltway">beltway</a> around Denver.
I-70 has one official branch in Colorado, <a href="Interstate%20270%20%28Colorado%29">Interstate 270</a>, which connects the interstate with the <a href="Denver-Boulder%20Turnpike">Denver–Boulder Turnpike</a>. Where these two freeways merge is the busiest portion of I-70 in the state, with an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> of 183,000 vehicles per day. While <a href="Colorado%20State%20Highway%20470">State Highway 470</a> and <a href="E-470">E-470</a> are not officially branches of I-70, they are remnants of plans for an I-470 outer beltway around Denver that were cancelled when the allocated funds were spent elsewhere.

Leaving Denver, the highway serves the redevelopment areas on the former site of <a href="Stapleton%20International%20Airport">Stapleton International Airport</a>; runway 17R/35L crossed over the Interstate at the runway's midsection. East of <a href="Aurora%2C%20Colorado">Aurora</a>, I-70 rejoins the alignment of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20Colorado">U.S. Highway 40</a> at Colfax Avenue. The freeway proceeds east across the Great Plains, briefly dipping south to serve the city of <a href="Limon%2C%20Colorado">Limon</a>, which bills itself as Hub City because of the many rail and road arteries that intersect there. I-70 enters Kansas near <a href="Burlington%2C%20Colorado">Burlington</a>, a small community known for having one of the oldest <a href="carousel">carousel</a>s in the United States.

As first proposed in 1944, the western terminus of I-70 was <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, along the corridor of US 40. The portion across the Rocky Mountains was added to the plans, after lobbying by Colorado officials, following the US 6 corridor. The origins of both the US 40 and US 6 pre-date the U.S. System of numbered highways, using established transcontinental trails.

Before the formation of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">United States Numbered Highways</a>, the U.S. relied on an informal network of roads, organized by various competing interests, collectively called the <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a> system. The surveyors of most trails chose either <a href="South%20Pass%20%28Wyoming%29">South Pass</a> in <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> or a southern route through <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a> to traverse the Rocky Mountains. Both options were less formidable than the higher <a href="mountain%20pass">mountain pass</a>es in Colorado, but left the state without a transcontinental artery. When the planners of the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway">Lincoln Highway</a> also decided to cross the Rockies in Wyoming, officials pressed for a loop to branch from the main route in <a href="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, enter Colorado, and return to the main route in Wyoming. While the Lincoln Highway was briefly routed this way, the loop proved impractical and was soon removed.
After losing the connection to the Lincoln Highway, officials convinced planners of the <a href="Victory%20Highway">Victory Highway</a> to traverse the state. The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail. The highway crossed the mountains along a trail blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, cresting at <a href="Berthoud%20Pass">Berthoud Pass</a>. After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco</a>-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20Colorado">U.S. Highway 40</a>.

While <a href="U.S.%20Route%206%20in%20Colorado">US 6</a> was also one of the original 1926 U.S. Highways, the road originally served the portion of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. The highway was not extended to the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Pacific coast</a> until 1937, mostly following the <a href="Midland%20Trail">Midland Trail</a>. Around the time the U.S. Highway system was formed, the portion of the Midland Trail through Glenwood Canyon, known as the Taylor State Road, was destroyed by a flood. When US 6 was extended, the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> was rebuilding the road through the canyon and the <a href="Public%20Works%20Administration">Public Works Administration</a> was nearing completion of a new highway over Vail Pass. In western Colorado, US 6 was routed <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrent</a> with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20Colorado">US 50</a> from the Utah state line to Grand Junction and eventually replaced <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Colorado">US 24</a> from Grand Junction to near Vail. To keep these routes over the Rockies competitive with alternatives in other states, the Colorado Department of Highways relied on ingenuity to keep the roads safe. The department pioneered new machines to clear snow and various bridge and culvert designs to protect the roads from flooding.

Governor <a href="Edwin%20C.%20Johnson">Edwin C. Johnson</a>, for whom one of the tunnels along I-70 was later named, was a primary force in persuading the planners of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> to extend the highway across the state. He stated to the Senate subcommittee:

You are going to have a four-lane highway through Wyoming. You are going to build two four-lane highways through New Mexico and Arizona. Colorado needs to be able to compete with our neighboring states. We do not want to take anything away from them. We do not want them to get way out ahead of us, either, because these interstate highways are going to be very attractive highways for the East and West to travel on.

Colorado held several meetings to convince reluctant Utah officials they would benefit from a freeway link between Denver and <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>. Utah officials expressed concerns that, given the terrain between these cities, this link would be difficult to build. They later expressed concerns that the construction would drain resources from completing Interstate Highways they deemed to have a higher priority. Colorado officials persisted, presenting three alternatives to route I-70 west of Denver, using the corridors of US 40, US 6 and a route starting at <a href="Pueblo%2C%20Colorado">Pueblo</a>, proceeding west along <a href="U.S.%20Route%2050%20in%20Colorado">US 50</a>/<a href="U.S.%20Route%20285%20in%20Colorado">US 285</a>/US 24. In March 1955, Colorado officials succeeded in convincing Utah officials with the state legislature passing a resolution supporting a link with Denver. The two states jointly issued a proposal to the <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> that would extend the plans for I-70 along the US 6 corridor. Under this proposal the freeway would terminate at <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20Utah">I-15</a> near <a href="Spanish%20Fork%2C%20Utah">Spanish Fork, Utah</a>, linking the <a href="Front%20Range%20Urban%20Corridor">Front Range</a> and <a href="Wasatch%20Front">Wasatch Front</a> metropolitan areas.
Congress approved the extension of I-70; however, the route still had to be approved by the representatives of the U.S. military on the planning committee. Military representatives were concerned that plans for this new highway network did not have a direct connection from the central U.S. to <a href="southern%20California">southern California</a>; and further felt Salt Lake City was adequately connected. Military planners approved the extension, but moved the western terminus south to <a href="Cove%20Fort%2C%20Utah">Cove Fort</a>, using I-70 as part of a link between Denver with <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> instead of Salt Lake City. Utah officials objected to the modification, complaining they were being asked to build a long and expensive freeway that would serve no populated areas of the state. After being told this was the only way the military would approve the extension, Utah officials agreed to build the freeway along the approved route.

The first Colorado portion of I-70 opened to traffic in 1961. This section bypassed and linked <a href="Idaho%20Springs%2C%20Colorado">Idaho Springs</a> to the junction where US 6 currently separates from I-70 west of the city. The majority of the alignment through Denver was completed by 1964. The <a href="Mousetrap%20%28Denver%29">Mousetrap</a> reused some structures that were built in 1951, before the formation of the Interstate Highway system. The last piece east of Denver opened to traffic in 1977.

Planning on how to route the freeway over the Rocky Mountains began in the early 1960s. The US 6 corridor crosses two passes: <a href="Loveland%20Pass">Loveland Pass</a>, at an elevation of and Vail Pass, at . Engineers recommended tunneling under Loveland Pass to bypass the steep grades and <a href="hairpin%20curve">hairpin curve</a>s required to navigate US 6. The project was originally called the Straight Creek Tunnel, after the waterway that runs along the western approach. The tunnel was later renamed the <a href="Eisenhower%E2%80%93Johnson%20Memorial%20Tunnel">Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel</a>, after U.S. President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> and Colorado Governor <a href="Edwin%20C.%20Johnson">Edwin C. Johnson</a>.

Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of <a href="fault%20lines">fault lines</a> in the path of the tunnel that were not discovered during the <a href="pilot%20%28experiment%29">pilot</a> bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. A total of nine workers were killed during the construction of both bores. Further complicating construction was that the boring machines could not work as fast as expected at such high altitudes, and the productivity was significantly less than planned. The frustration prompted one engineer to comment, "We were going by the book, but the damned mountain couldn't read". The first bore was dedicated March 8, 1973. Initially this tunnel was used for two-way traffic, with one lane for each direction. The amount of traffic through the tunnel exceeded predictions, and efforts soon began to expedite construction on the second tube (the Johnson bore), which was finished on December 21, 1979. The initial engineering cost estimate for the Eisenhower bore was $42 million; the actual cost was $108 million (equivalent to $ million today). Approximately 90% of the funds were paid by the federal government, with the state of Colorado paying the rest. At the time, this figure set a record for the most expensive federally aided project. The excavation cost for the Johnson bore was $102.8 million (equivalent to $ million today).
The tunnel construction became unintentionally involved in the <a href="women%27s%20rights%20movement">women's rights movement</a> when <a href="Janet%20Bonnema">Janet Bonnema</a> was accepted for an engineering technician position in the construction of the Straight Creek Tunnel in 1970. Bonnema was restricted from entering the tunnel itself, however, due to the miners' superstition that women who entered underground mines and tunnels would bring bad luck. In 1972 Bonnema filed a $100,000 class action suit against the <a href="Colorado%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Colorado Department of Transportation</a>, citing Title VII of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a>. As Colorado voters had passed the <a href="Equal%20Rights%20Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a> that year, the state settled Bonnema's case out of court for $6,730. Bonnema entered the tunnel for the first time on November 9, 1972, prompting 66 workers to temporarily walk off the job; most returned the next day. She continued with the project until the tunnel opened.

While designing the Eisenhower Tunnel, controversies erupted over how to build the portions over Vail Pass and Glenwood Canyon. The route of US 6 over Vail Pass has a distinctive "V" shape. Initially engineers thought they could shorten the route of I-70 by about by tunneling from Gore Creek to South Willow Creek, an alternative known as the Red Buffalo Tunnel. This alternative sparked a nationwide controversy as it would require an <a href="easement">easement</a> across federally protected lands, through what is now called the <a href="Eagles%20Nest%20Wilderness">Eagles Nest Wilderness</a>. After the <a href="U.S.%20Secretary%20of%20Agriculture">U.S. Secretary of Agriculture</a> refused to grant the easement, the engineers agreed to follow the existing route across Vail Pass. The engineers added infrastructure to accommodate wildlife, and had significant portions of the viaducts constructed offsite and lifted in place to minimize the environmental footprint. The grade over Vail Pass reaches seven percent.

<a href="Glenwood%20Canyon">Glenwood Canyon</a> has served as the primary transportation artery through the Rocky Mountains, even before the creation of U.S. highways. Railroads have used the canyon since 1887 and a dirt road was built through the canyon in the early 20th century. The first paved road was built from 1936 to 1938 at a cost of $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million today).

With the Eisenhower Tunnel finished, the last remaining obstacle for I-70 to be an interstate commercial artery was the two lane, non-freeway portion in Glenwood Canyon. Construction had started on this section in the 1960s with a small section opening to traffic in 1966. The remainder was stopped due to <a href="environmentalist">environmentalist</a> protests that caused a 30-year controversy. The original design was criticized as "the epitome of environmental insensitivity". Engineers scrapped the original plans and started work on a new design that would minimize additional environmental impacts. A new design was underway by 1971, which was approved in 1975; however, environmental groups filed lawsuits to stop construction, and the controversy continued even when construction finally resumed in 1981. The final design included 40 bridges and viaducts, three additional tunnel bores (two were completed before construction was stopped in the 1960s) and of retaining walls for a stretch of freeway long. The project was further complicated by the need to build the four-lane freeway without disturbing the operations of the railroad. This required using special and coordinated blasting techniques. Engineers designed two separate tracks for the highway, one elevated above the other, to minimize the footprint in the canyon. The final design was praised for its environmental sensitivity. A Denver architect who helped design the freeway proclaimed, "Most of the people in western Colorado see it as having preserved the canyon." He further stated, "I think pieces of the highway elevate to the standard of public art." A portion of the project included shoring up the banks of the Colorado River to repair damage and remove flow restrictions created in the initial construction of US 6 in the 1930s.
The freeway was finally completed on October 14, 1992, in a ceremony covered nationwide. Most coverage celebrated the engineering achievement or noted this was the last major piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic. However, newspapers in western Colorado celebrated the end of the frustrating traffic delays. For most of the final 10 years of construction, only a single lane of traffic that reversed direction every 30 minutes remained open in the canyon. One newspaper proudly proclaimed "You heard right. For the first time in more than 10 years, construction delays along that stretch of Interstate 70 will be non-existent."

The cost was $490 million (equivalent to $ million today) to build , 40 times the average cost per mile predicted by the planners of the Interstate Highway system. This figure exceeded that of <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20Arizona">Interstate 15</a> through the <a href="Virgin%20River%20Gorge">Virgin River Gorge</a>, which was previously proclaimed the most expensive rural freeway in the United States. The construction of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon earned 30 awards for the <a href="Colorado%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Colorado Department of Transportation</a>, including the 1993 Outstanding Civil Engineering Achievement Award from the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">American Society of Civil Engineers</a>. At the dedication it was claimed that I-70 through Glenwood Canyon was the final piece of the Interstate Highway System to open to traffic. For this reason, the system was proclaimed to be complete. However, at the time there were still two sections of the original Interstate Highway System that had not been constructed: <a href="Pennsylvania%20Turnpike/Interstate%2095%20Interchange%20Project">a section</a> of <a href="Interstate%2095">Interstate 95</a> in <a href="central%20New%20Jersey">central New Jersey</a>, that was not completed until 2018 and a section of I-70 in <a href="Breezewood%2C%20Pennsylvania">Breezewood, Pennsylvania</a>.

When first approved, the extension of I-70 from Denver to <a href="Cove%20Fort%2C%20Utah">Cove Fort</a> was criticized in some area newspapers as a road to nowhere; an information liaison specialist with the U.S. Department of Transportation in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore, Maryland</a>—the eastern terminus of I-70—claims people have asked "did we think Baltimoreans were so desperate to get to Cove Fort that we were willing to pay $4 billion to get them there?" However, a resident engineer with the USDOT has called the extension one of the "crown jewels" of the Interstate Highway System. In Colorado, the freeway helped unite the state, despite the two halves being separated by the formidable Rocky Mountains. The Eisenhower Tunnel alone is credited with saving up to an hour from the drive across the state. Prior to I-70's construction, the highway through Glenwood Canyon was one of the most dangerous in the state. With the improvements, the accident rate has dropped 40% even though traffic through the canyon has substantially increased. The Colorado Department of Transportation is considering the nomination of various portions of I-70 as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, even though the freeway will not qualify as historical for several decades.
The freeway is credited with enhancing Colorado's <a href="ski">ski</a> industry. The ski resort town of <a href="Vail%2C%20Colorado">Vail</a> did not exist until I-70 began construction, with developers working in close partnership with the Department of Transportation. By 1984, the I-70 corridor between Denver and <a href="Grand%20Junction%2C%20Colorado">Grand Junction</a> contained the largest concentration of ski resorts in the United States. The towns and cities along the corridor have experienced significant growth, luring recreational visitors from the Denver area. As one conservationist lamented, I-70 "changed rural Colorado into non-rural Colorado".

One accident at the <a href="Mousetrap%20%28Denver%29">Mousetrap</a>, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>es for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> overturned. The situation was made worse as no one answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking from one of the torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned the driver to avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was <a href="Grandfather%20clause">grandfathered</a> into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.

In 2014, <a href="mile%20marker">mile marker</a> 420 was altered by CDOT to read "Mile 419.99" following repeat <a href="street%20sign%20theft">thefts</a> of the original sign due to the significance of the number <a href="420%20%28cannabis%20culture%29">420 in cannabis culture</a>.

CDOT plans to rebuild the elevated section of I-70 between Brighton Boulevard and Colorado Boulevard in Denver as a below-grade highway and widen other sections between I-25 and Chambers Road in Aurora, beginning construction in 2018. The $1.2 billion project, financed through a <a href="public%E2%80%93private%20partnership">public–private partnership</a> with <a href="Kiewit%20Corporation">Kiewit</a> and <a href="Meridiam">Meridiam</a>, would add a new <a href="express%20toll%20lane">express toll lane</a> and build frontage roads; the below-grade freeway would have a park built over the top between Clayton and Columbine streets. The project has attracted controversy from activists opposed to highway expansion, including lawsuits filed over changes to federal air quality standards that would allow the project to be built.

Chrisye

Chrismansyah Rahadi (; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his <a href="stage%20name">stage name</a> of Chrisye (), was an Indonesian <a href="progressive%20pop">progressive pop</a> singer and <a href="songwriter">songwriter</a>. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%20Indonesia">Rolling Stone Indonesia</a>" declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time.

Born in Jakarta of mixed <a href="Chinese%20Indonesians">Chinese-Indonesian</a> descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a> in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and <a href="Guruh%20Sukarnoputra">Guruh Sukarnoputra</a> to record the 1976 indie album "<a href="Guruh%20Gipsy">Guruh Gipsy</a>".

Following the success of "Guruh Gipsy", in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: "<a href="Lilin-Lilin%20Kecil">Lilin-Lilin Kecil</a>" by <a href="James%20F.%20Sundah">James F. Sundah</a>, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album "<a href="Badai%20Pasti%20Berlalu%20%28album%29">Badai Pasti Berlalu</a>". Their success landed him a recording contract with <a href="Musica%20Studios">Musica Studios</a>, with whom he released his first solo album, "<a href="Sabda%20Alam">Sabda Alam</a>", in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, "<a href="Seindah%20Rembulan">Seindah Rembulan</a>". Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>.

Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in "Rolling Stone Indonesia" list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine. Several of his albums received <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">certification</a> of silver or gold. He received two lifetime achievement awards, one in 1993 from the BASF Awards and another posthumously in 2007 from Indonesian television station <a href="SCTV%20%28Indonesia%29">SCTV</a>.

Chrisye was born Christian Rahardi in Jakarta on 16 September 1949 to Laurens Rahadi, a Chinese-<a href="Betawi%20people">Betawi</a> entrepreneur, and Hanna Rahadi, a Chinese-<a href="Sundanese%20people">Sundanese</a> housewife. He was the second of three sons born to the couple; his brothers were Joris and Vicky. The family lived on Talang Street near <a href="Menteng">Menteng</a>, <a href="Central%20Jakarta">Central Jakarta</a>, until 1954, when they moved to Pegangsaan Street (also in Menteng).

While attending GIKI Elementary School, Chrisye befriended the neighbouring Nasution family; he became especially close to Bamid Gauri, with whom he played badminton and flew kites. He also began listening to his father's record collection, singing along to songs by <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>, <a href="Frank%20Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a>, <a href="Nat%20King%20Cole">Nat King Cole</a>, and <a href="Dean%20Martin">Dean Martin</a>. After graduating from elementary school, Chrisye attended Christian Middle School III Diponegoro.

<a href="Beatlemania">Beatlemania</a> reached Indonesia while Chrisye was in Senior High School PSKD Menteng, and increased his interest in music. Responding to Chrisye's desire to play an instrument, his father bought him a guitar; Chrisye chose the <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a>, as he considered it the easiest to master. As they could not read music, Chrisye and Joris learned to play by accompanying their father's records and songs recorded from the radio. In time they began playing at school events, with vocals by Chrisye. During this period he began smoking in school; when caught, he was punished by being forced to smoke eight cigarettes at once, in front of the assembled pupils. However, this failed to cure his habit and he eventually became a <a href="chain%20smoker">chain smoker</a>.

In the mid-1960s, the Nasution siblings formed a band; Chrisye and Joris watched them play songs by <a href="Uriah%20Heep%20%28band%29">Uriah Heep</a> and <a href="Blood%2C%20Sweat%20%26amp%3B%20Tears">Blood, Sweat & Tears</a>. In 1968 Chrisye registered at the <a href="Universitas%20Kristen%20Indonesia">Christian University of Indonesia</a> (UKI) to fulfill his father's wish that he become an engineer. Around 1969, however, Gauri invited him to join the Nasutions' band, Sabda Nada, as a replacement for their bassist Eddi Odek who was ill. Pleased with his performance, the Nasutions asked him to stay as a permanent member. The group had a regular gig at Mini Disko on Juanda Street and freelanced at birthday and wedding parties. When Chrisye had a chance to sing while performing <a href="Cover%20version">covers</a>, he attempted to sound as much like the original artist as he could.

The group was renamed Gipsy in 1969, which they considered more macho and Western-sounding. The schedule for the band, which had no manager, became increasingly busy, since they had begun giving regular performances at <a href="Taman%20Ismail%20Marzuki">Ismail Marzuki Park</a>. As a result, Chrisye decided to drop out of UKI; in 1970 he transferred to Trisakti Tourism Academy, where he considered the study schedule to be more flexible.

In 1972 Pontjo Nasution offered Chrisye the opportunity to play in New York. Although ecstatic, Chrisye was afraid of telling his father, who he thought would disapprove of the idea. He eventually fell ill for several months, during which time the rest of the band left for New York. After Chrisye discussed his fears with Joris and his mother, his father agreed that he could drop out of college to join Gipsy. After his health improved, in mid-1973, he left with Pontjo to meet Gipsy in New York. That same year he dropped out of Trisakti.

While in New York, Gipsy performed at the Ramayana Restaurant, which was owned by the Indonesian gas company <a href="Pertamina">Pertamina</a>. The band, housed in an apartment on <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a>, performed in New York for almost a year, providing Indonesian-themed music and covering songs by <a href="Procol%20Harum">Procol Harum</a>, <a href="King%20Crimson">King Crimson</a>, <a href="Emerson%2C%20Lake%20%26amp%3B%20Palmer">Emerson, Lake & Palmer</a>, <a href="Genesis%20%28band%29">Genesis</a> and Blood, Sweat & Tears. Although Chrisye became upset that he could not fully express himself through covers, he continued to work.

Upon returning to Indonesia at the end of 1973 Gauri and his brother Keenan introduced Chrisye to former president <a href="Sukarno">Sukarno</a>'s son, the songwriter <a href="Guruh%20Sukarnoputra">Guruh Sukarnoputra</a>. As the Nasutions worked with Guruh to prepare for their next project, Chrisye began to write his own songs; in doing so he noted that he had difficulty with lyrics that included hard consonants, and worked to avoid them. The following year, he went back to New York with another band, The Pro's. In mid-1975, with several weeks left on his contract, Chrisye's parents called from Jakarta to tell him that his brother Vicky had died of a stomach infection. Unable to return home immediately, Chrisye became distracted by thoughts of his family and began to find playing difficult. As the band returned to Indonesia, Chrisye "cried for the duration of the flight" and sank into a depression.

Chrisye stopped playing altogether until the Nasutions invited him to rejoin Gipsy for their new project with Guruh, who offered Chrisye several songs in which he would be lead singer, with lyrics written especially for him. Overcoming his depression, he joined the group as they practised at Guruh's house in <a href="Kebayoran%20Baru%2C%20South%20Jakarta">Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta</a>. The band often rehearsed late into the night; the indie project mixed Western rock and <a href="Bali">Bali</a>nese <a href="gamelan">gamelan</a> and was produced collaboratively. Recording took place in mid-1975, with only four songs completed in the first several months. It was released to critical acclaim in 1976, with a production of 5000 copies. The success of "Guruh Gipsy" convinced Chrisye that he could sing as a soloist.
In late 1976 Chrisye was approached by songwriter <a href="Jockie%20Soerjoprajogo">Jockie Soerjoprajogo</a> and Imran Amir, head of <a href="Prambors%20FM">Prambors Radio</a>, who asked him to provide the vocals for the Prambors Radio Teenage Songwriting Competition; Chrisye refused, as he did not want to sing an Indonesian pop song. Several days later <a href="Sys%20NS">Sys NS</a>, an employee of Prambors, approached Chrisye while he was meeting with Guruh and <a href="Eros%20Djarot">Eros Djarot</a>. Sys emphasised that Prambors needed Chrisye for "<a href="Lilin-Lilin%20Kecil">Lilin-Lilin Kecil</a>" ("Little Candles"), composed by <a href="James%20F.%20Sundah">James F. Sundah</a>. After hearing the lyrics, Chrisye agreed. The song was recorded in Irama Mas Studio in <a href="Pluit">Pluit, North Jakarta</a>, and included on an album with the other contest winners. Originally the ninth track, "Lilin-Lilin Kecil" was placed in the lead position to increase the album's marketability after the original format sold poorly. The song then took off, receiving much airplay; the album was the best-selling of the year.

After the success of "Lilin-Lilin Kecil", in mid-1977 Pramaqua Records approached Chrisye and offered him a contract for an album, "<a href="Jurang%20Pemisah">Jurang Pemisah</a>" ("Dividing Canyon"). Working with Jockie, Ian Antono, and Teddy Sujaya, Chrisye recorded seven songs for the album; Jockie did two more. Although he was pleased with the results and had high hopes for the album, Pramaqua decided it was not commercially viable and refused to promote it until Chrisye's subsequent album "<a href="Badai%20Pasti%20Berlalu%20%28album%29">Badai Pasti Berlalu</a>" took off. After his unsuccessful attempt to buy up all the stock, the album was released, but because the general public considered it a sequel to "Badai Pasti Berlalu", the sales were poor. Although the cassettes reached radio stations throughout the country, Chrisye later described the album as selling "as warmly as chicken shit".

That same year, Chrisye and several artists including Djarot and Jockie recorded the soundtrack for the film "<a href="Badai%20Pasti%20Berlalu%20%28film%29">Badai Pasti Berlalu</a>" over two months. After the soundtrack won a Citra Award at the 1978 <a href="Indonesian%20Film%20Festival">Indonesian Film Festival</a>, Irama Mas studios approached the group to do a soundtrack album for a flat fee. With Chrisye and <a href="Berlian%20Hutauruk">Berlian Hutauruk</a> on vocals, the soundtrack was rerecorded in album form in Pluit over 21 days. It was released under the same name as the film, with a picture of actress <a href="Christine%20Hakim">Christine Hakim</a> on the cover. The album included Chrisye's first songwriting credit, "Merepih Alam" ("Fragile Nature"), but sales were stagnant for the first week until radio stations began to play the singles.

Chrisye's <a href="tenor">tenor</a> voice and performance on "Badai Pasti Berlalu" led Amin Widjaja of <a href="Musica%20Studios">Musica Studios</a> to ask him to sign with Musica; Widjaja had been scouting him since the release of "Guruh Gipsy". Chrisye agreed on condition that he be allowed creative freedom, to which Widjaja reluctantly agreed. In May 1978 Chrisye began work on his first album with Musica, "<a href="Sabda%20Alam">Sabda Alam</a>" ("Nature's Order"), incorporating several songs by other artists and some written by himself, including the title song. He recorded it after locking himself in the studio with the sound engineer and arranger; despite Amin's wanting to monitor their progress, Chrisye refused to allow him access. The album, greatly influenced by "Badai Pasti Berlalu" and drawing on the <a href="double%20tracking">double tracking</a> technique pioneered by the Beatles (in which the vocals are recorded twice to achieve fuller sound), was released in August that year. Heavily promoted in a campaign during which Chrisye was interviewed on the national television station <a href="TVRI">TVRI</a> and on radio, the album eventually sold 400,000 copies.

The following year Chrisye recorded "<a href="Percik%20Pesona">Percik Pesona</a>" ("Stain of Enchantment") with Jockie. Produced after Amin's death, the album featured songs written by Chrisye's close friend Junaidi Salat, as well as Jockie and Guruh. The album's title was chosen by vote; the titular song was not released as a single. "Percik Pesona", released in August 1979, was a critical and commercial failure. After discussing the issue with other artists, Chrisye blamed the album's failure on its similarity to "Badai Pasti Berlalu". As a result, following a period of contemplation, he began branching out into different genres. That same year he was on the panel of the Prambors Teenage Songwriting Competition, held on 5 May.

After deciding that romantic pop songs influenced by <a href="easy%20listening">easy listening</a> would suit him best, Chrisye began recording his next album, "<a href="Puspa%20Indah">Puspa Indah</a>" ("Beautiful Flower"). All but one of the songs were composed by Guruh Sukarnoputra; the album also featured the English-language "To My Friends on Legian Beach". Two of the songs, "Galih dan Ratna" ("Galih and Ratna") and "Gita Cinta" ("Love Song"), were used in the 1979 film "<a href="Gita%20Cinta%20dari%20SMA">Gita Cinta dari SMA</a>" ("Love Song from High School"); Chrisye played a minor part in the film's sequel, "Puspa Indah Taman Hati" ("Beautiful Flower in the Heart's Garden"), as a singer. Due in part to the popularity of the film, "Puspa Indah" was well received and sold well; "Galih dan Ratna" and "Gita Cinta", released as singles, were also commercially successful.

In 1980 Chrisye appeared in the <a href="Cinema%20of%20Indonesia">Indonesian film</a> "<a href="Seindah%20Rembulan">Seindah Rembulan</a>" ("As Beautiful as the Moon"); at first reluctant to accept the role, he was convinced by Sys NS that it would be fun. He later regretted the decision, considering the film crew unprofessional and often fighting with director Syamsul Fuad. The following year, he released "<a href="Pantulan%20Cita">Pantulan Cita</a>" ("Reflection of Dreams"), a collaboration with Jockie. After the album flopped, Chrisye took a long <a href="sabbatical">sabbatical</a>.

Although popular with <a href="groupie">groupie</a>s, Chrisye had rarely dated. But in early 1981 he began courting Guruh Sukarnoputra's secretary, Gusti Firoza Damayanti Noor (Yanti). Yanti, of mixed <a href="Dayak%20people">Dayak</a> and <a href="Minangkabau%20people">Minang</a> ancestry, was a former singer and came from a musically inclined family; she would often discuss music with Chrisye while he waited for Guruh, and he would also see her when visiting her brother Raidy, one of his friends. When she moved to Bali to work at a five-star hotel there for several weeks, Chrisye followed her and told her that he would marry her when she returned to Jakarta; although this was not a formal proposal, Yanti accepted. In 1982 Chrisye converted to Islam, as Islam does not permit <a href="Interfaith%20marriage%20in%20Islam">interfaith marriages</a> between Muslim women and non-Muslim men, and changed his name to Chrismansyah Rahadi; Chrisye at the time had been growing increasingly discontent and disillusioned with Christianity. On 12 December 1982 he married Yanti in a <a href="Minangkabau%20wedding">Padang-style wedding</a>.

Driven by his poor financial position and invigorated by Djarot's return from Germany, Chrisye began work on his next album with Djarot and Jockie in early 1983. Aciu Widjaja, the new manager of Musica, speculated that they required a new sound; as such, Chrisye, Djarot, and Jockie mixed <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a> with Chrisye's standard romantic pop and drew influences from <a href="The%20Police">The Police</a>. The resulting album, "<a href="Resesi">Resesi</a>" ("Recession"), was released in 1983. The album was well received, selling 350,000 copies and being certified silver; the singles "Lenny", "Hening" ("Silent"), and "Malam Pertama" ("Wedding Night") received much airplay.

After "Resesi", Chrisye collaborated with Djarot and Jockie on the 1983 album "Metropolitan". The album, drawing on <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a> influences and dealing mainly with issues facing youth, was well received, later going silver; the single "Selamat Jalan Kekasih" ("Goodbye Dear") also became a hit. That year, Chrisye and Yanti had their first daughter, Rizkia Nurannisa. The following year, Chrisye, Djarot, and Jockie collaborated again on "Nona" ("Miss"), which featured <a href="social%20criticism">social criticism</a>; the album spawned four singles and went on to be certified platinum. Despite "Nona" warm sales, after some influence from Aciu, Chrisye decided to look for a new sound and broke off his partnership with Djarot and Jockie in mid-1984.

Chrisye approached <a href="Addie%20MS">Addie MS</a>, a young composer, and asked him to help with the next album. Addie, despite feeling that he was not in the same class as Djarot and Jockie, accepted, and suggested using similar melodies as in "Lilin-Lilin Kecil" and "Badai Pasti Berlalu". The resulting album, "<a href="Sendiri">Sendiri</a>" ("Alone"), with songs by Guruh and Junaidi Salat, included harps, oboes, <a href="cor%20anglais">cor anglais</a>, and a string section. Spawning three singles, the album sold well and earned Chrisye his first <a href="Anugerah%20Musik%20Indonesia">BASF Award</a>.

In late 1984 Chrisye approached another young composer, Adjie Soetama, to help him prepare his next album. Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time; therefore the two used a lighter style. Recording for the new album, titled "<a href="Aku%20Cinta%20Dia">Aku Cinta Dia</a>" ("I Love Her"), began in 1985, with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf. The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a <a href="jam%20session">jam session</a> led by Adjie and immediately decided that it would be the lead single. The album called for more emoting, which Chrisye – known as having a stiff stage persona – struggled to deliver, though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography. Upon its release, "Aku Cinta Dia" sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold. That same year, Chrisye and Adji Soetama released "<a href="Hip%20Hip%20Hura">Hip Hip Hura</a>" ("Hip Hip Hurray!"), and another collaboration, "Nona Lisa" ("Miss Lisa"), was released in 1986; the later two albums had similar beats and rhythms and sold well, although not as well as "Aku Cinta Dia". On 2 March 1986 Chrisye and Yanti had their second daughter, Risty Nurraisa.

Despite the success of the trilogy, Chrisye and his family continued to struggle financially; twice they had to sell their family car to raise cash. This led Chrisye to briefly consider quitting the music industry. In 1988 Chrisye recorded "Jumpa Pertama" ("First Meeting"), and the following year he released "Pergilah Kasih" ("Go Away Dear"). He later recalled that the album, with an arrangement by Younky Suwarno, had a "beautiful touch". The title song, "Pergilah Kasih", was written by Tito Sumarsono and used to make Chrisye's first music video; the video, directed by Jay Subyakto, was the first Indonesian song to be shown on <a href="MTV%20Southeast%20Asia">MTV Southeast Asia</a>.

On 27 February of the following year, Chrisye and Yanti had twin sons, Randa Pramasha and Rayinda Prashatya. In 1992 Chrisye recorded a cover single of <a href="Koes%20Plus">Koes Plus</a>' song "Cintamu T'lah Berlalu" ("Your Love has Passed") with arrangement by Younky; the music video was again broadcast on MTV Southeast Asia and became the first Indonesian music video to be broadcast on the American version of MTV. The following year, Chrisye paired up with Younky again to record "Sendiri Lagi" ("Alone Again"), a project which required four months of planning and another four months of recording; the music video for the title song was also circulated on MTV South-East Asia.

Although "Sendiri Lagi" did fairly well, in the beginning of the 1990s Chrisye began to feel pressure from the increasingly visual-oriented music industry and growing amount of young talent. He again began considering leaving the music industry, feeling as if he had already "reached the finish line". Despite reassurances from Yanti that many singers continue to perform into their sixties, Chrisye observed that increasing numbers of established acts were being pushed aside by newcomers. While in this state of despair, Chrisye was approached by Jay Subyakto and Gauri Nasution, who offered him a solo concert at the Plenary Hall of the <a href="Jakarta%20Convention%20Centre">Jakarta Convention Centre</a>, which had never before hosted a solo concert by an Indonesian artist. Unconvinced he had sufficient fans to fill the hall, Chrisye initially refused.

Gauri tried for several weeks to persuade Chrisye to commit to the concert, and following Chrisye's introduction to <a href="Erwin%20Gutawa">Erwin Gutawa</a>, who was scheduled to handle the arrangements, Jay Subyakto succeeded in convincing him that it might be the last chance to revive his career. Lacking the necessary funding, they approached RCTI in search of sponsorship but were refused, and laughingly told that they should try holding a concert at the <a href="Monas">National Monument</a>. Undeterred, Chrisye, Subaktyo, and Gutawa put together a group of artists and began rehearsals. Around the time of RCTI's fourth anniversary, the television station relented and agreed to fund the concert as part of their celebrations; the thousands of tickets available sold out within a week.

The concert, entitled Sendiri to demonstrate that "100% Indonesian" concerts could be successful, was held on 19 August 1994. Chrisye performed a set that included his greatest hits and several duets, among them "Malam Pertama" with <a href="Ruth%20Sahanaya">Ruth Sahanaya</a>, in front of a full orchestra conducted by Gutawa. Chrisye recalled later that the audience – children and adults – had memorised the lyrics to his songs, classics and recent releases; he said that this gesture made him feel incredibly small. Invigorated by the concert's success, Chrisye went on tour to <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>, <a href="Surakarta">Surakarta</a>, and <a href="Bandung">Bandung</a>, using a convoy of 24 trucks and buses to transport the necessary equipment; those concerts also sold out.

Following the success of his Sendiri tour, Chrisye began to explore the possibility of producing an album of his early hits, remastered by Gutawa. On the condition that they use an Australian orchestra to provide backing music, Gutawa agreed to an acoustic-flavoured album. Aciu also agreed, despite the expected cost of <a href="Indonesian%20Rupiah">Rp</a> 600 million (US$70,000). After basic recording in Jakarta, Chrisye, Gutawa, and sound engineer Dany Lisapali spent two weeks in Studio 301 in Sydney finishing off the album. The Philip Hartl Chamber Orchestra provided the music; the mixing and mastering was also completed in Sydney. "<a href="AkustiChrisye">AkustiChrisye</a>" was released in 1996 and sold well.

After "AkustiChrisye", Gutawa suggested that Chrisye try a new style, with more serious songs. The two soon began collaborating on "<a href="Kala%20Cinta%20Menggoda">Kala Cinta Menggoda</a>", again using an Australian orchestra. Chrisye, however, found himself unable to record one of the songs, "Ketika Tangan dan Kaki Berkata" ("When Hands and Feet Speak"), written by poet <a href="Taufiq%20Ismail">Taufiq Ismail</a> and based on verse 65 of the Qu'ranic sura <a href="Ya%20Sin">Ya Sin</a>; he would break into tears after singing only a couple of verses. Eventually, the day before he was to leave for Australia, he completed the song with Yanti's support. On 11 October Chrisye performed "Indonesia Perkasa" ("Powerful Indonesia") at the opening ceremony of the <a href="1997%20Southeast%20Asian%20Games">1997 Southeast Asian Games</a>; the song was written for the event. The following month he released "Kala Cinta Menggoda". The music video for the titular song, directed by Dimas Djayadiningrat, won the MTV Video Music Award for South-East Asia on 10 September 1998; Chrisye went to <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to accept the award at the <a href="Universal%20Amphitheatre">Universal Amphitheatre</a>.

Chrisye began work on a rearrangement of "Badai Pasti Berlalu" in 1999 at the request of Musica Studios – although he felt that the original album was fine – and once again teamed up with Gutawa. The new album, which retained the title "Badai Pasti Berlalu", cost Rp.800 million (US$95,000) to produce and promote, in part owing to the cost of employing an Australian orchestra, the <a href="Victorian%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Victorian Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. After its release, the album sold well, breaking even within three months and selling 350,000 copies. The album led to Chrisye's second sold-out solo concert at the Plenary Hall of Jakarta Convention Centre, known as the Badai concert, and he received numerous offers to perform at venues throughout the country. He later told "<a href="Kompas">Kompas</a>" that he felt as if he had reached a dead end, having tried all genres available. He continued performing, singing "Indonesia Perkasa" at the opening ceremony of the 15th <a href="Pekan%20Olahraga%20Nasional">National Games</a> on 19 June 2000 in <a href="Sidoarjo">Sidoarjo</a>, <a href="East%20Java">East Java</a>.

In 2001 Chrisye released the studio album "<a href="Konser%20Tur%202001">Konser Tur 2001</a>" ("Concert Tour 2001"), which included two new songs and several old ones. The music video for one of the new songs, "Setia" ("Loyal"), was controversial owing to its portrayal of a woman in tight clothing. Soon afterwards, Chrisye decided to cover some of what he considered the most important Indonesian songs since the country's independence in 1945, ranging from songs from the 1940s like <a href="Ismail%20Marzuki">Ismail Marzuki</a>'s "Kr. Pasar Gambir & Stambul Anak Jampang" ("Kroncong of Gambir Market and Stambul of the Cowlicked Child"), to the late 1990s such as <a href="Ahmad%20Dhani">Ahmad Dhani</a>'s "Kangen" ("Longing"). It also featured a song written exclusively for the album by Pongky of Jikustik and two duets with <a href="Sophia%20Latjuba">Sophia Latjuba</a>. The album, "<a href="Dekade">Dekade</a>" ("Decade"), was released in 2002; by October 2003 it had sold 350,000 copies. On 15 December 2002 Chrisye participated in the Bali for the World – Voices of Stars concert at Kartika Beach Plaza to raise funds for the victims of the <a href="2002%20Bali%20bombings">bombings on 12 October</a>; other acts involved included <a href="Melly%20Goeslaw">Melly Goeslaw</a>, <a href="Gigi%20%28Indonesian%20band%29">Gigi</a>, <a href="Slank">Slank</a>, and <a href="Superman%20is%20Dead">Superman is Dead</a>. On 12 July 2004 Chrisye held a third concert, Dekade, at Plenary Hall. The concert, with a set that contained numerous classics included in "Dekade", featured duets with Sophia Latjuba and several of the original performers, such as <a href="Fariz%20RM">Fariz RM</a> with "Sakura" and A. Rafiq with "Pengalaman Pertama" ("First Experience"); Gutawa's orchestra again provided the music.

Chrisye then began work on his last studio album, "<a href="Senyawa">Senyawa</a>" ("One Soul"). In collaboration with other Indonesian artists including <a href="Project%20Pop">Project Pop</a>, <a href="Ungu">Ungu</a>, and <a href="Peterpan%20%28band%29">Peterpan</a>, he also produced the album, replacing Gutawa. The song "Bur-Kat" ("Say It Quickly"), with Project Pop, marked his first attempt at <a href="rap">rap</a>. Released in November 2004, the album was well received by the market, but <a href="Sony%20Music%20Entertainment">Sony Music Entertainment Indonesia</a> complained that the names of their artists were featured on the cover. As a result, the album was withdrawn, and re-released without the offending names.

In July 2005 Chrisye was admitted to Pondok Indah Hospital, complaining of breathing difficulties. After 13 days of treatment he was moved to the <a href="Mount%20Elizabeth%20Hospital">Mount Elizabeth Hospital</a> in Singapore, where he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Although concerned about losing his hair, which he considered part of his image, he underwent the first of six rounds of <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> on 2 August 2005.

Chrisye's health improved in 2006 and in May and November he undertook long interview sessions with his biographer <a href="Alberthiene%20Endah">Alberthiene Endah</a>. He also released two compilation albums, "Chrisye by Request" and "Chrisye Duets"; however, he reportedly did not feel well enough to release new songs. By February 2007 his health was again in decline.

Chrisye died on 30 March 2007 at his home in Cipete, <a href="South%20Jakarta">South Jakarta</a>. He was buried in <a href="Jeruk%20Purut%20Cemetery">Jeruk Purut Public Cemetery</a>, South Jakarta. His funeral was attended by hundreds, including Indonesian celebrities such as his collaborator <a href="Erwin%20Gutawa">Erwin Gutawa</a> and singers <a href="Titiek%20Puspa">Titiek Puspa</a>, <a href="Ahmad%20Albar">Ahmad Albar</a>, Sophia Latjuba, and Ikang Fawzi.

One hundred days after Chrisye's death Musica released two compilation albums. Entitled "Chrisye in Memoriam – Greatest Hits" and "Chrisye in Memoriam – Everlasting Hits", they contained fourteen hits from albums ranging from "Sabda Alam" to "Senyawa". On 1 August 2008 Chrisye's last single "Lirih" ("Gentle Voice"), written by Aryono Huboyo Djati, was released. The song's existence had been kept secret, and the recording date is unknown; Djati has said that it was recorded "for fun". A music video directed by Vicky Sianipar and featuring <a href="Nazril%20Irham">Ariel Peterpan</a>, <a href="Giring%20Ganesha">Giring</a> from <a href="Nidji">Nidji</a>, and Chrisye's widow was released later.

According to Jockie, one of the main reasons that Chrisye was chosen to record "Lilin-Lilin Kecil" was that he had a unique voice with a soft <a href="timbre">timbre</a>, which went well with the keyboards used; Jockie, however, felt that Chrisye's voice lost its dynamics when mixed with mellow music, which led him to give their collaboration "Jurang Pemisah" more of a rock feel. Gutawa compared Chrisye's voice to a blank sheet of paper, able to be applied to anything. Sys NS wrote in 2007 that he had been looking for "someone with the voice of an angel" to sing "Lilin-Lilin Kecil", and in his opinion Chrisye fitted the role perfectly.

A writer for the Indonesian magazine "<a href="Gatra%20%28magazine%29">Gatra</a>" described Chrisye's on-stage persona as "stiff", with very little movement. Alex Hasyim, who did the choreography for "Aku Cinta Dia" and "Hip Hip Hura", recalled that Chrisye was in a cold sweat on their first day of practise and eventually created his own dancing style as he could not follow Hasyim's instructions.

Chrisye chose his own costumes and at times experimented with different colours and designs. In all his music videos he preferred to wear the same style of shirt, quipping in an interview with "<a href="Kompas">Kompas</a>" that he would only wear a different one if he had fallen into a ditch.

Chrisye has been described as "legendary" by several journalists. In their 2007 list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%20Indonesia">Rolling Stone Indonesia</a>" ranked "Badai Pasti Berlalu" first. Three of Chrisye's solo albums were also on the list: "Sabda Alam" at 51, "Puspa Indah" at 57, and "Resesi" at 82. "Guruh Gipsy" was selected as the second-best album of all time. This was followed by the selection of four of his songs ("Lilin-Lilin Kecil" at number 13, "Merpati Putih" at number 43, "Anak Jalanan" at number 72, and "Merepih Alam" at number 90) as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time; Guruh Gipsy's song "<a href="Indonesia%20Maharddhika">Indonesia Maharddhika</a>" placed at number 59. In 2011 they listed Chrisye as the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Eros Djarot described him as having a great voice, but somewhat shy and generally unwilling to discuss social issues.

According to data from the <a href="Asosiasi%20Industri%20Rekaman%20Indonesia">Indonesian Recording Industry Association</a>, the original "Badai Pasti Berlalu" is the second-best-selling Indonesian album of all time, with nine million copies sold between 1977 and 1993. In 1990 the music video for "Pergilah Kasih" was the first Indonesian music video to be shown on MTV Hong Kong; the video clip for "Sendiri Lagi" was voted the best Indonesian music video of all time in the fifth episode of "Video Musik Indonesia".

In 2009 many Indonesian artists, including <a href="Vina%20Panduwinata">Vina Panduwinata</a>, Ahmad Albar, <a href="D%27Cinnamons">D'Cinnamons</a>, and <a href="Sherina%20Munaf">Sherina Munaf</a>, performed 20 of Chrisye's songs as a tribute in the "Chrisye: A Night to Remember" concert at the Ritz Carlton, Jakarta. The sold-out concert also featured <a href="testimonial">testimonial</a>s by his wife and children. Another concert, described as Chrisye's fourth, rather than as a tribute concert, was held on 5 April 2012. Entitled Kidung Abadi Chrisye (Chrisye's Eternal Ballad) and held at Plenary Hall in the Jakarta Convention Centre, it featured a <a href="holographic">holographic</a> representation of the singer performing with Sophia Latjuba, <a href="Once%20Mekel">Once Mekel</a>, Vina Panduwinata, and Gutawa's daughter <a href="Gita%20Gutawa">Gita</a>. The concert included a new song, "<a href="Kidung%20Abadi">Kidung Abadi</a>" ("Eternal Ballad"), written by Erwin and Gita Gutawa and made using 246 previously recorded syllables.

Alberthiene Endah has written two biographies of Chrisye. The first, "Chrisye: Sebuah Memoar Musikal" ("Chrisye: a Musical Memoir"), was published in 2007 and details his childhood, career, and struggle with cancer. The second, "The Last Words of Chrisye", was released in 2010 and covers the final years of his life. Another book, "Chrisye, di Mata Media, Sahabat & Fans" ("Chrisye, in the Eyes of the Media, Friends, & Fans") was released in March 2012.

In 2017, a biopic film depicting on his life journey was scheduled to be released in September, directed by Rizal Mantovani and starring Vino G. Bastian as Chrisye. Filming began in February 2017.

Chrisye received numerous awards during his career. In 1979 he was selected as the Favourite Singer of the Indonesian Armed Forces. His albums "Sabda Alam" and "Aku Cinta Dia" were certified <a href="gold%20record">gold</a>, and the albums "Hip Hip Hura", "Resesi", "Metropolitan", and "Sendiri" were certified silver.

Chrisye received three BASF Awards, sponsored by the <a href="BASF">BASF</a> cassette production company, for best-selling albums; his first was in 1984 for "Sendiri", followed by one in 1988 for "Jumpa Pertama" and one in 1989 for "Pergilah Kasih". He received the BASF Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994 for his contributions to Indonesian music; the same year he received the BASF Award for Best Recording Artist. In 1997 he received an <a href="Anugerah%20Musik%20Indonesia">Anugerah Musik Indonesia</a> for Best Male Pop Singer. The following year "Kala Cinta Menggoda" won nine AMIs, including Best Album; Chrisye himself received awards for Best Male Pop Singer, Best Recording Singer, and Best Graphic Designer (shared with Gauri). In 2007 he posthumously received the first <a href="SCTV%20%28Indonesia%29">SCTV</a> Lifetime Achievement Award, which was accepted by his daughter Risty.

Aciu Widjaja, now President-Director of <a href="Air%20Asia">Air Asia</a>, described Chrisye as a simple man and said that one time, when he, Chrisye, and several others had gone overseas Chrisye was the only one who did not look for brand-name clothing or world-class restaurants; instead he ate at a food court and bought what he felt was comfortable. In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him. Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.

After his marriage to Yanti, she ended her singing career to become a housewife. When the couple had children, Chrisye often had little time to spend with them as he was busy performing or recording; however, he attempted to spend as much time with them as possible. In a 1992 interview, he said that his children did not want to follow in their parents' footsteps and become singers because they had seen the stresses it put on the family.

Chrisye released 31 albums during his lifetime, 1 with Guruh Gipsy, 21 studio albums, and 9 compilation albums. His solo albums after "Sabda Alam" all sold more than 100,000 copies. In a 1992 interview with "Kompas", Chrisye said that he fell ill after recording each of his albums, blaming the pressure to promote them.

Chrisye also released many singles, several of which were used as theme songs for Indonesian soap operas: "Pengalaman Pertama" was used for the serial "Ganteng-Ganteng Kok Monyet" ("Very Handsome, But Like a Monkey!"), "Cintaku" ("My Love") from the remastered "Badai Pasti Berlalu" was used for "Gadis Penakluk" ("The Maiden Conqueror"), and "Seperti Yang Kau Minta" was used for "Disaksikan Bulan" ("Witnessed by the Moon").

Launched on June 26, 1941, by <a href="Richard%20Field%20Lewis%20Jr.">Richard Field Lewis, Jr.</a>, WINC was Winchester's first radio station. It remained in the hands of the Lewis family until sold to North Carolina-based <a href="Centennial%20Broadcasting">Centennial Broadcasting</a> in 2007. The station's current <a href="Radio%20format">format</a>, established in 1996, consists mostly of <a href="Conservative%20talk%20radio">conservative talk</a> programs and top-of-the-hour news from <a href="Fox%20News%20Radio">Fox News Radio</a>. Sports programming from <a href="Virginia%20Tech">Virginia Tech</a> is also broadcast. Prior formats heard on WINC include <a href="middle%20of%20the%20road%20%28music%29">middle of the road music</a>, <a href="adult%20contemporary%20music">adult contemporary</a>, and <a href="classic%20hits">classic hits</a>.

Several milestones have occurred during the station's 75 years of history. WINC was the station on which <a href="country%20music">country music</a> singer <a href="Patsy%20Cline">Patsy Cline</a> made her debut in 1948, when Cline asked the leader of a "hillbilly band" for a chance to perform with them on air. In the late 1950s, the station's chief engineer, Philip Whitney, designed a <a href="CONELRAD">CONELRAD</a> alarm device for FM stations to warn listeners in the event of an enemy attack during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. Whitney also created many of the <a href="radio%20control">remote control systems</a> used by radio stations. He was awarded for his work by the <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Broadcasters">National Association of Broadcasters</a> in 1970. WINC had difficulty renewing its license in the early 1970s, as it was airing 22 minutes of commercials per hour—in excess of what the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) permitted. The station encountered further trouble in 1988 when a local prosecutor called one of its promotions an "illegal cash lottery"; a judge disagreed. In that same year, the news department at WINC received an Associated Press Broadcasters Association national award for "Best Radio Spot News".

The entirety of WINC's program schedule began <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a>ing on sister-station <a href="WZFC">WZFC</a> on January 31, 2018.

<a href="Richard%20Field%20Lewis%20Jr.">Richard Field Lewis, Jr.</a> was a graduate of the <a href="UC%20Berkeley%20College%20of%20Engineering">College of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley</a>. He founded <a href="Fredericksburg%2C%20Virginia">Fredericksburg, Virginia</a>-based radio station <a href="WFVA">WFVA</a> in 1939. Before that, he had worked at <a href="KTIE">KFXM</a> in <a href="San%20Bernardino%2C%20California">San Bernardino, California</a>, as chief engineer. Lewis filed the initial application for a new station in Winchester, Virginia, with the <a href="Federal%20Communications%20Commission">Federal Communications Commission</a> (FCC) during the week of November 10, 1940. He applied to have WINC broadcast on AM 1370 at 250 <a href="watt">watt</a>s, and the application was approved on February 4, 1941. In early March 1941, the FCC assigned the WINC <a href="call%20sign">call sign</a>, derived from the first four letters in Winchester. In June 1941, WINC announced it would join the <a href="Blue%20Network">NBC Blue Network</a> the following month.

At 6:57am, on June 26, 1941, WINC began broadcasting for the first time, becoming Winchester's first radio station. Instead of the frequency of AM 1370 applied for, WINC launched on AM 1400. At launch, the station broadcast at 250 watts day and night. Two weeks later, on July 13, Virginia Senator <a href="Harry%20F.%20Byrd">Harry F. Byrd</a> and Governor <a href="James%20Hubert%20Price">James Hubert Price</a> attended the dedication of the station. The first announcer on WINC was Grant Pollock, who had been hired as the station's commercial sales manager. Pollock came to Winchester from NBC Radio in Los Angeles. At the time of WINC's launch, Winchester had a population of 12,095, with only 2,968 radios.

Throughout the station's existence, WINC's studios have been located at 520 North Pleasant Valley Road in Winchester. The address at launch was 520 Kerr Street, later incorporated into Pleasant Valley Road.

Less than six months after the station's first broadcast, WINC carried live descriptions of the <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> and President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Roosevelt</a>'s "<a href="Infamy%20Speech">Infamy Speech</a>" the following day. With the United States entry to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, WINC participated in the war effort on the air and at its studios. The <a href="Winchester%2C%20Virginia">City of Winchester</a> erected an <a href="Aircraft%20Warning%20Service">Aircraft Warning Service</a> station, manned by volunteers, beside the WINC facility. The station aired an hour-long special program called "Virginia Schools at War Mobilization" on February 22, 1943. The program involved approximately 618,000 schoolchildren and teachers from around the state, war-savings staff, and state and civic dignitaries. The special, broadcast live from <a href="Mount%20Vernon">Mount Vernon</a>, was carried on 13 other Virginia stations and on <a href="WOL%20%28AM%29">WWDC</a> in Washington, D.C. WINC participated in another wartime broadcast, this one in late January 1944, to encourage the public to buy <a href="War%20bond">War Bonds</a>. A total of $150,525 in bonds were sold during the two-hour program, broadcast on 13 stations in Virginia and one in Washington, D.C.

On June 15, 1945, the NBC Blue Network formally changed its name to the <a href="Cumulus%20Media%20Networks">American Broadcasting Company</a> (ABC). WINC remained an affiliate of the renamed network. In the same year, C. Leslie Golliday was hired as the station's production manager. Golliday also built and launched two stations of his own: <a href="WEPM">WEPM</a> in <a href="Martinsburg%2C%20West%20Virginia">Martinsburg, West Virginia</a>, in 1946 and <a href="WCLG%20%28AM%29">WCLG</a> in <a href="Morgantown%2C%20West%20Virginia">Morgantown, West Virginia</a>, in 1954.

The station began carrying <a href="Standard%20Oil">Standard Oil</a>'s "Your Esso Weather Reporter" <a href="radio%20advertisement">spots</a> on April 22, 1946. The Esso programs included the "latest weather prediction and [a] brief commercial". WINC began carrying programming from the Keystone Broadcasting System (KBS) and <a href="Langlois%20%26amp%3B%20Wentworth%2C%20Inc.">Lang–Worth Feature Programs</a> in 1946 and 1948 respectively. Both Keystone and Lang-Worth were <a href="transcription%20disc">electrical transcription</a> networks. Programming from Lang-Worth was removed from the station's schedule in 1951, while Keystone programming remained until 1960. Richard F. Lewis, Jr. launched <a href="WINC-FM">WINC-FM</a>, <a href="sister%20station">sister station</a> to WINC, on November 18, 1946.

A January 1947 contest on WINC was responsible for knocking out the entire telephone system for the city of Winchester. Mark Sheeler, a disc jockey at WINC, gave a "wolf whistle" as the signal for Winchester area "housewives" to call the studio. The first one to reach him would win "a free pair of nylon hose and a $10 handbag". The station received around 4,000 simultaneous phone calls; the first call to get through was from the telephone company. Sheeler was informed that his contest was jamming local phone lines. He quickly made an on-air announcement calling off the contest.

On August 8, 1947, WINC applied to move from 1400 to 950 AM. In the same application, the station requested an increase in the station's power to 1,000 watts during the day and 500 watts at night. More than two years later, the application was dismissed and WINC remained at its original frequency and power.

Fourteen-year-old <a href="country%20music">country music</a> singer Virginia "Ginny" Hensley, who later became <a href="Patsy%20Cline">Patsy Cline</a>, began her career by making her broadcast debut on WINC in 1948. Hensley asked "Joltin'" Jim McCoy, the leader of a "hillbilly band" called "The Melody Playboys", about to perform on the station, for a chance to sing with them. She told the band leader, "If you just give me a chance to sing with you, I'll never ask for pay." Cline continued to perform regularly on Saturday mornings on WINC. In 1948 and 1949, respectively, <a href="Bing%20Crosby">Bing Crosby</a> and <a href="Bob%20Hope">Bob Hope</a> visited WINC, where they were interviewed on-the-air. Crosby and Hope were each in town for the city's annual <a href="Shenandoah%20Apple%20Blossom%20Festival">Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival</a>.

WINC joined the <a href="NBC%20Red%20Network">NBC Radio Network</a> (previously named NBC Red) on November 1, 1951, after more than ten years as an ABC affiliate (previously called NBC Blue). WINC rejoined ABC Radio, carrying both networks' programming, on January 18, 1952, but dropped NBC programming in 1953. WINC became one of the flagship members of the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> Baseball Network, established in May 1952. The station added the long-running <a href="Voice%20of%20Prophecy">Voice of Prophecy</a> program on June 3, 1953. On October 18, 1957, WINC owner Richard F. Lewis, Jr., died, and control of WINC passed to his widow, Marion Park Lewis. Ownership of the station was transferred again on January 31, 1964, from Richard F. Lewis Jr., Inc., a company owned by Marion Park Lewis, to Mid-Atlantic Network Inc., a corporation wholly owned by the Lewis family.

The station applied for and received a construction permit on August 9, 1958, to increase its broadcasting power from 250 to 1,000 watts, both day and night. The FCC approved the application in January 1961 but only for a daytime power increase. In 1959, WINC engineer Philip Whitney designed a <a href="CONELRAD">CONELRAD</a> alarm device for FM stations. The CONELRAD system allowed for early nationwide warnings in the event of possible enemy attack during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. Whitney is also credited with creating many of the <a href="radio%20control">remote control systems</a> used by radio stations, including the microwave remote control system. The <a href="National%20Association%20of%20Broadcasters">National Association of Broadcasters</a> presented Whitney with its annual Engineering Award on April 7, 1970, for his work.

In the 1960s, the station hosted interviews with several prominent figures. <a href="Paul%20Harvey">Paul Harvey</a>, in town for a speaking engagement, broadcast his "News and Comment" program from WINC studios on April 14, 1962. President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>, visiting for the <a href="Shenandoah%20Apple%20Blossom%20Festival">Apple Blossom Festival</a> in 1964, was interviewed live on the station. The station was the first in Winchester to announce the assassinations of <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> in 1963 and <a href="Assassination%20of%20Robert%20F.%20Kennedy">Robert F. Kennedy</a> in 1968.

While attempting to renew the station's license in early 1971, Mid-Atlantic Network ran into trouble with the FCC due to the quantity of commercials the station was airing. The station was carrying 22 minutes of commercials an hour according to a letter from then-FCC Broadcast Bureau Chief Francis R. Welsh. Welsh said in the letter that the FCC was not convinced the amount of commercials served the community in a positive way. At the time, the FCC allowed no more than 18 minutes of commercials per hour. However, the station's license was ultimately renewed on May 14, 1971.

Part of WINC's programming in 1977 included daily political commentaries from former California governor <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a>. WINC remained an <a href="Cumulus%20Media%20Networks">ABC Radio</a> affiliate in 1978, carrying its American Contemporary Network with a <a href="middle%20of%20the%20road%20%28music%29">middle of the road music</a> format. WINC added <a href="adult%20contemporary%20music">adult contemporary</a> music to its format in 1980. In 1981, the first year for which <a href="Audience%20measurement">ratings information</a> is available, WINC led all other area stations with a 16.3 rating. The station dropped the middle of the road music in 1982, airing only adult contemporary music. In 1985, WINC removed ABC Radio's "American Contemporary Network" from its schedule in favor of ABC's "American Entertainment Network", while continuing to air an adult contemporary format. The station increased its nighttime power to 1,000 watts in 1986. The news department at WINC received an Associated Press Broadcasters Association national award for "Best Radio Spot News" in 1988.

The local prosecutor, <a href="Winchester%2C%20Virginia">City of Winchester</a> Commonwealth's Attorney Paul Thomson, filed suit against WINC and sister station WINC-FM in June 1988 for a promotion Thomson called an "illegal cash lottery". A license plate number of a car with a WINC bumper sticker was announced over the air, and the owner was given 92 minutes to call in and choose to accept a prize of $92 or give up the money for a chance of winning $9,200. Thomson compared the contest to the game show "<a href="Let%27s%20Make%20a%20Deal">Let's Make a Deal</a>". On December 19, 1988, Winchester Circuit Court Judge Perry Sarver ruled in favor of WINC stating he did not believe "promotional plans such as was used ... are in violation of the lottery statute". Sarver also said it would require a "substantial expenditure" for the contest to be considered a lottery.

By 1991, WINC was airing a <a href="classic%20hits">classic hits</a> format, which was dropped a year later, returning to adult contemporary. <a href="Talk%20radio">Talk programs</a> were added in 1994 and all music dropped two years after that. Also in 1996, WINC became an affiliate of <a href="Associated%20Press">AP Radio</a>. With the change to News/Talk, WINC garnered only a 2.9 in the 1996 radio ratings. In contrast, sister station WINC-FM received a 12.1 during the same ratings period.

The station's Internet presence also began in 1996, as a <a href="subpage">subpage</a> within <a href="sister%20station">sister station</a> WINC-FM's website. WINC launched its own website in 2008. In 1998, WINC began using the slogan "The Right Side of the AM Dial". The station picked up <a href="CBS%20Radio%20News">CBS</a> and <a href="CNN%20Radio">CNN</a> affiliations in 2000, dropping the Associated Press.

On October 22, 2007, WINC debuted a live and local morning show called "The Winchester Morning Magazine" airing weekdays from to The program, hosted by Michael Haman, featured topics ranging from local general interest to news. The program was cancelled under a year later in September 2008, and the station returned to syndicated programming in the mornings. Also in 2008, WINC began using the "First in Winchester, First in News" slogan.

On May 17, 2007, Mid-Atlantic Network announced it was selling WINC to North Carolina-based <a href="Centennial%20Broadcasting">Centennial Broadcasting</a>. The price of the sale, initially reported at $36 million, also included <a href="sister%20station">sister station</a>s <a href="WINC-FM">WINC-FM</a>, WWRT (now <a href="WZFC">WZFC</a>), and WWRE (now <a href="WXBN">WXBN</a>) in Winchester and <a href="WBQB">WBQB</a> and <a href="WFVA">WFVA</a> in Fredericksburg. Later reports had the price of the sale at $35.972 million.

Centennial CEO Allen B. Shaw, commenting in a "<a href="The%20Winchester%20Star">Winchester Star</a>" interview on the sale, said he had been considering buying the company for several months. At the time of the interview, he did not foresee any changes to the stations. The sale <a href="Closing%20%28real%20estate%29">closed</a> in August 2007, and in the last ratings book under Lewis Family ownership, WINC received a 2.7 rating. The station's ratings have stayed within a two- to three-point range, while the format has remained the same after the sale.

WINC celebrated its 75th year on the air on June 26, 2016. The station aired vignettes with former employees and a classic photo album was added on the station's website.

Sister-station WZFC began simulcasting WINC on January 31, 2018, extending WINC's programming into <a href="Front%20Royal%2C%20Virginia">Front Royal</a> and <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Virginia">Woodstock</a>, as well as parts of <a href="Warren%20County%2C%20Virginia">Warren</a> and <a href="Shenandoah%20County%2C%20Virginia">Shenandoah</a> Counties in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. The addition of the FM simulcast was something Operations manager Mike Herald had considered "for quite some time" but only brought to fruition due to the current political climate. Hearld felt the "conservative lean" of the hosts aired by WINC would "resonate really well with the folks here in <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">the valley</a>" as "<a href="Donald%20Trump">Mr. Trump</a> has made things very exciting". The fact that Warren and Shenandoah Counties voted Republican or "red" by "at least a 30-point margin" in the 2016 Presidential Election and the 2017 Virginia Gubernatorial Election also made it a "natural fit".

WINC carries a <a href="all-news%20radio">news</a>/<a href="talk%20radio">talk</a>/<a href="sports%20radio">sports</a> format established in 1996. The station's weekday schedule starts with <a href="Jim%20Bohannon">Jim Bohannon</a>'s "America in the Morning" newshour followed by <a href="Hugh%20Hewitt">Hugh Hewitt</a>. <a href="Conservative%20talk%20radio">Conservative talk show hosts</a> <a href="The%20Laura%20Ingraham%20Show">Laura Ingraham</a>, <a href="The%20Rush%20Limbaugh%20Show">Rush Limbaugh</a>, <a href="The%20Sean%20Hannity%20Show">Sean Hannity</a>, and <a href="The%20Mark%20Levin%20Show">Mark Levin</a> are then broadcast, followed by "The Jim Bohannon Show" and "<a href="Coast%20to%20Coast%20AM">Coast to Coast AM</a>".

WINC carries five-minute newscasts every hour from <a href="Fox%20News%20Radio">Fox News Radio</a>. The station also has a news department that prepares and broadcasts local news reports. The station is an affiliate of the Virginia Tech <a href="IMG%20College">IMG</a> Sports Network, which carries <a href="Virginia%20Tech">Virginia Tech</a> <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football">football</a> and <a href="Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20men%27s%20basketball">basketball</a>.

Weekend programming on WINC includes "The Pet Show" hosted by <a href="Warren%20Eckstein">Warren Eckstein</a>, "<a href="Sam%20Sorbo">The Sam Sorbo Show</a>", "<a href="Kim%20Komando">The Kim Komando Show</a>", and home-improvement shows "In the Garden with Andre Viette" and "On the House with the Carey Brothers". "The Score", a statewide conservative talk program, hosted by <a href="WRVA%20%28AM%29">WRVA</a>'s Scott Lee, is also heard. The station also airs "best of" editions of previously recorded weekday programming.

1955 State of Vietnam referendum

The State of Vietnam referendum of 1955 determined the future <a href="form%20of%20government">form of government</a> of the <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a>, the nation that was to become the <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Republic of Vietnam</a> (widely known as <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>). It was contested by Prime Minister <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Diem">Ngô Đình Diệm</a>, who proposed a <a href="republic">republic</a>, and former emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a>. Bảo Đại had abdicated as emperor in 1945 and at the time of the referendum held the title of head of state. Though published counts showed Diệm winning the election with 98.2% of the vote, the referendum was widely marred by <a href="electoral%20fraud">electoral fraud</a>. In the capital, <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, Diệm was credited with more than 600,000 votes, although only 450,000 people were on the electoral roll. He accumulated tallies in excess of 90% of the registered voters, even in rural regions where opposition groups prevented voting.

The referendum was the last phase in the power struggle between Bảo Đại and his prime minister. Bảo Đại disliked Diệm and had frequently attempted to undermine him, having appointed him only because he was a conduit to American aid. At the time, the country was going through a period of insecurity, as Vietnam had been temporarily partitioned as a result of the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">1954 Geneva Accords</a> that ended the <a href="First%20Indochina%20War">First Indochina War</a>. The State of Vietnam controlled the southern half of the country, pending national elections that were intended to reunify the country under a common government. Still, the <a href="Vietnamese%20National%20Army">Vietnamese National Army</a> was not in full control of southern Vietnam; the <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a> and <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> religious sects ran their own administrations in the countryside supported by private armies, while the <a href="B%C3%ACnh%20Xuy%C3%AAn">Bình Xuyên</a> organised crime syndicate controlled the streets of Saigon. Despite interference from these groups, Bảo Đại, and even French officials, Diệm managed to subdue the private armies and consolidate government control over the country by mid-1955.

Emboldened by his success, Diệm began to plot Bảo Đại's downfall. He scheduled a referendum for 23 October 1955 and pushed Bảo Đại out of the political scene, hindering the former emperor's attempts to derail the poll. In the period leading up to the vote, campaigning for Bảo Đại was banned, while Diệm's election campaign focused on personal attacks against Bảo Đại. These included pornographic cartoons of the head of state and unverified rumours claiming he was illegitimate and linking him to various mistresses. The government-controlled media launched polemical attacks on Bảo Đại, and police went door-to-door, warning people of the consequences of failing to vote. After his brother <a href="Ngo%20Dinh%20Nhu">Ngô Đình Nhu</a> successfully rigged the poll, Diệm proclaimed himself president of the newly created <a href="Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Republic of Vietnam</a>.

The defeat of the <a href="French%20Army">French Army</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Dien%20Bien%20Phu">Điện Biên Phủ</a> in 1954, followed by the <a href="Geneva%20Conference%20%281954%29">Geneva Accords</a>, led to a divided Vietnam. The French-backed <a href="State%20of%20Vietnam">State of Vietnam</a>, led by former Emperor <a href="B%E1%BA%A3o%20%C4%90%E1%BA%A1i">Bảo Đại</a>, provisionally held control south of the 17th parallel. <a href="Ho%20Chi%20Minh">Hồ Chí Minh</a>'s <a href="Viet%20Minh">Viet Minh</a> held the north under the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20Vietnam">Democratic Republic of Vietnam</a>, which Hồ Chí Minh had proclaimed in 1945. The agreements stated that nationwide elections were to be held in 1956 to unify the country under a common government. In July 1954, during the transition period, Bảo Đại appointed Diệm as Prime Minister of the State of Vietnam.

On 11 October 1954, the border was closed by the <a href="International%20Control%20Commission">International Control Commission</a>, after a period of 300 days during which free passage between both halves of Vietnam had been allowed. Under the Geneva Accords, anti-communist military personnel were obliged to evacuate to the south, while communist forces were to be moved north. Civilians were free to move to whichever zone they preferred. During the 300 days, Diệm and U.S. <a href="CIA">CIA</a> adviser Colonel <a href="Edward%20Lansdale">Edward Lansdale</a> staged a campaign to convince people to move to South Vietnam. The campaign was particularly focused on Vietnam's Catholics, who were to provide Diệm's power base in his later years, with the use of the slogan "God has gone south". Between 800,000 and 1,000,000 people migrated to the south, mostly Catholics. At the start of 1955, <a href="French%20Indochina">French Indochina</a> was dissolved, leaving Diệm in temporary control of the south.

At the time, Diệm had little authority beyond the gates of his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diệm resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing the head of state to be weak and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the <a href="French%20Far%20East%20Expeditionary%20Corps">French Expeditionary Corps</a> maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.

Diệm faced challenges to his authority from four more groups. The <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> and <a href="Cao%20%C4%90%C3%A0i">Cao Đài</a> religious sects had private armies that controlled the <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a> and the areas west of <a href="Saigon">Saigon</a>, respectively. The <a href="B%C3%ACnh%20Xuy%C3%AAn">Bình Xuyên</a> was an armed, organised crime empire that controlled much of Saigon with a 40,000 strong private army, while the Vietminh still controlled much of the rural area. Diệm's <a href="Vietnamese%20National%20Army">Vietnamese National Army</a> (VNA) was led by General <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Hinh">Nguyễn Văn Hinh</a>, a French citizen who loathed and frequently disobeyed him. Bảo Đại sold the operating license of the national police to the Bình Xuyên, effectively putting administrative control of the police in the hands of a crime syndicate.

Amid growing French and US skepticism of his ability to provide stable rule, Diệm forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the <a href="Battle%20of%20Saigon%20%281955%29">Battle for Saigon</a>. After a brief but violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence and control of the police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, who had tried to dismiss him in the middle of the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên. In addition, General Paul Ely, the head of the French presence in Vietnam, tried to impede Diệm; his troops put road blocks against the VNA and gave intelligence to the Bình Xuyên.

Buoyed by his successes, and fueled by increased hatred of both the French and Bảo Đại after their attempts to prevent him from dismantling the Bình Xuyên, Diệm became more confident as he went about consolidating his hold on power. On 15 May, Diệm abolished Bảo Đại's Imperial Guard; its 5,000 men became the 11th and 42nd Infantry Regiments of the VNA. Diệm then stripped Bảo Đại of his extensive crown lands. On 15 June, Diệm had the Council of the Royal Family at Huế declare that Bảo Đại be stripped of his powers, and that he, Diệm, be made president. Bảo Đại's relatives condemned him for abdicating as head of state, and for his links with France and the Bình Xuyên. Historians have speculated that the royals agreed to turn on Bảo Đại so Diệm would not seize their assets.

On 7 July 1955, the first anniversary of his installation as prime minister, Diệm announced that a national referendum would be held to determine the future of the country. On 16 July, Diệm publicly announced his intention to not take part in the reunification elections: "We will not be tied down by the [Geneva] treaty that was signed against the wishes of the Vietnamese people."

Diệm contended that the Communists would never allow free elections in the north, so therefore South Vietnam must strike out on its own and establish a separate, non-Communist state. This was echoed by the Saigon press, which ran articles assailing communist elections as shambolic, rigged, and meaningless; at the time, the northern half of Vietnam had a greater population than the south. A month earlier, North Vietnamese Prime Minister <a href="Ph%E1%BA%A1m%20V%C4%83n%20%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng">Phạm Văn Đồng</a> wrote to Saigon asking to begin negotiations over the specific details of the elections. While the Americans were happy to avoid elections because of fears of a communist victory, they hoped that Diệm would enter the dialogue over planning matters and wait for North Vietnam to object to a proposal, and thus use it to blame Ho [Chi Minh] for violating the Geneva Accords. The Americans had earlier advised Diệm, who had been acting in defiance of Bảo Đại, that continued aid was contingent on Diệm establishing a legal basis for usurping the head of state's power.

On 6 October 1955, Diệm announced the referendum would be held on 23 October. The election was open to men and women aged 18 or over, and the government arranged to have a polling station set up for every 1,000 registered voters. The poll was contested by Bảo Đại, who had spent much of his time in France and advocated a monarchy, and Diệm, who ran on a republican platform. According to historian Jessica Chapman, it was a choice between "the country's obsolete emperor and its far-from-popular prime minister, Ngo Dinh Diem". In announcing the referendum, Diệm portrayed his decision as being motivated by a love of democracy and popular discontent with the rule of Bảo Đại. The prime minister cited a plethora of petitions from various social, religious, and political groups calling on him to stage a plebiscite to remove Bảo Đại, claiming he was motivated by these "legitimate and democratic" sentiments. Lansdale cautioned Diệm against electoral fraud, confident that Diệm would win a free election: "While I'm away I don't want to suddenly read that you have won by 99.99%. I would know that it's rigged then." U.S. officials thought that a fair election would have seen Diệm poll between 60% and 70% of the vote.

Under the Elysee Accords and the subsequent legislation that created the State of Vietnam in 1949, Bảo Đại's position as head of state was neither permanent nor indefinite. Sovereignty was presumed to rest solely upon the people, with Bảo Đại being a mere conduit. As a result, the referendum itself was within the law. Diệm had not been elected to his post, so he saw the referendum as an opportunity to rebuff opponents, who claimed that he was undemocratic and autocratic. The event also gave Diệm an opportunity to boost his prestige by defeating Bảo Đại in a head-to-head contest. It was previously agreed that a National Assembly would be elected first, but Diệm went ahead with the plebiscite, which meant that he would have total power if he deposed Bảo Đại before a legislature was formed.

U.S. diplomats were concerned that the move would be seen as a power grab, as Diệm was organising and driving an electoral process in which he was a candidate. The Americans felt that a legislature should be formed first and that the body should oversee the referendum, but Diệm ignored their advice. Ambassador <a href="G.%20Frederick%20Reinhardt">G. Frederick Reinhardt</a> informed Washington that Diệm had no intention of allowing a level playing field for the opposition, and that the foreign press had already made much of Diệm's democratic pronouncements being a facade. The Department of State agreed and opted to avoid trumpeting the referendum as an exercise in democracy for fear of attracting negative reactions to their foreign policy. Nevertheless, U.S. officials in Vietnam were pleased with the referendum, as they saw it as an opportunity to strengthen South Vietnam and avoid defeat to the communists, as they saw a republican model as being more robust.

Having declared his disdain for the 1956 reunification elections, Diệm saw the referendum as the first step in creating a long-term state to rule over South Vietnam. He repeatedly said that the creation of a legislature and a constitution for his new state would follow the referendum.

Diệm reportedly saw the poll as an opportunity to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify his refusal to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.

One of Diệm's main themes was that the referendum would usher in a new era of unprecedented democracy: "This shall be but the first step made by our people in the free use of our political rights." The day before the poll, Diệm said: "This 23 October, for the first time in our country's history, our men and women will exercise one of many basic civil rights of a democracy, the right to vote." A government proclamation four days before the poll said: "Dear compatriots, proclaim your will forcefully! Go forward firmly in the path of Freedom, Independence and Democracy!"

Diệm ran a personal attack campaign against the head of state, for whom campaigning was prohibited. The army and national police went about enforcing the ban on pro-Bảo Đại and anti-Diệm activities. Police went from door to door, explaining the consequences of failing to vote. They organized conferences in rural villages and addressed the populace with loudspeakers. In general, Diệm's line of attack was to portray Bảo Đại as a drunken womanizer who was preoccupied with immoral pleasures and unconcerned with the problems of the populace. Vietnam's monarchic tradition was built on <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a> and the emperor's <a href="Mandate%20of%20Heaven">Mandate of Heaven</a>, and Diệm's campaign claimed Bảo Đại had lost this mandate through his debauched lifestyle. According to <a href="Joseph%20Buttinger">Joseph Buttinger</a>, who was based in Vietnam as the second in command at the <a href="International%20Rescue%20Committee">International Rescue Committee</a>, the methods used to influence the poll were "outrageous". Donald Lancaster, a journalist who covered the poll, said "Whereas Bao Dai was given no opportunity to defend himself, the government-controlled press proceeded to overwhelm him with scurrilous abuse." Diệm later banned Bảo Đại from entering the State of Vietnam.

Diệm's advertising included the parading of giant pageant-style floats of Bảo Đại through the streets of Saigon, depicted with <a href="bags%20of%20money">bags of money</a> on his shoulders, a <a href="deck%20of%20cards">deck of cards</a> in his hands, and with naked blonde women and bottles of <a href="cognac">cognac</a> in his arms. This was a reference to the head of state's reputation for opulence, gambling and womanising. In particular, the blonde hair referred to Bảo Đại's purported penchant for European mistresses with whom he liaised on the French Riviera. Bảo Đại's dummy was accompanied by that of a Frenchman putting gold into his pockets, thereby questioning his nationalist credentials. Posters and effigies associating Bảo Đại with a pig's head were disseminated, while a prominent newspaper composed and encouraged the people to sing insulting songs about Bảo Đại.

Walls and public transport vehicles were plastered with slogans, including "Beware of the evil king Bảo Đại's preference for gambling, women, wine, milk, and butter. Those who vote for him betray their country." Aside from referring to his opulent lifestyle, other slogans such as "Bao Dai, puppet king selling his country", and "Bao Dai, master keeper of gambling dens and brothels", referred to his alleged softness towards the communists. The radio was used to verbally abuse Bảo Đại, who was accused of treason and corruption in these broadcasts.

On the other hand, the bachelor Diệm was described as the "hero of the people" and "father of all children". The slogans exhorted the populace to vote for the prime minister because "To vote for the revolutionary man Ngo Dinh Diem is to build a society of welfare and justice". They portrayed Diệm as a patriotic and nationalist anti-communist, proclaiming "To kill communists, depose the king, [and] struggle against colonialists is a citizen's duty in Free Vietnam."

Diệm's government-controlled press overwhelmed Bảo Đại with endless personal propaganda attacks, with special editions of newspapers being devoted to polemical biographical accounts of the former emperor. This allowed Diệm's campaign to condemn Bảo Đại with much more salacious detail than was possible through mere slogans. This started in August when the daily newspaper "Thoi Dai" started a three-week series that disseminated unsubstantiated and scandalous details about Bảo Đại's life. These were written by editorialist Hong Van, who called Bảo Đại a "dung beetle who sold his country for personal glory". Van claimed Bảo Đại was the illegitimate son of Emperor <a href="Kh%E1%BA%A3i%20%C4%90%E1%BB%8Bnh">Khải Định</a>, alleging Khải Định had been infertile and married a maid, before claiming the maid's son, by another man, as his own. The paper claimed Bảo Đại was "big like a lubber, had many children, and was very fond of women" while Khải Định was uncomfortable with females, hinting that the different personalities were inconsistent with a common biological lineage.

Capitalising on anti-French sentiment, the paper went on to discuss Bảo Đại's upbringing in France, claiming that he was already womanising as a teenager because of his European upbringing. Bảo Đại later married an ethnic Vietnamese French citizen, who became Empress <a href="Nam%20Ph%C6%B0%C6%A1ng">Nam Phương</a>, who had been raised Catholic. The editorials accused her of being a French agent and claimed she had treated the queen mother badly, a serious character flaw as Confucianism strongly emphasized respect for elders. Hong Van went on to claim that Bảo Đại's sequence of Gallic lovers was an indication that colonial officials were successfully using sex to turn the head of state into a puppet of France.

The culmination of the newspaper campaign was a satirical pornographic cartoon, entitled "The Story of Bảo Đại". It summarized the scandalous depictions of the head of state made by "Thoi Dai" in the preceding weeks and was published on 19 October, four days before the referendum. The pictures featured full frontal nude depictions of Bảo Đại and his mistresses, with genitalia clearly visible, including a frame showing a naked blonde performing an erotic dance for the head of state.

Aside from painting Bảo Đại as a sexually insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked the head of state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him as being too soft in his dealings with French colonial authorities, and for serving as the head of state of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Vietnam">Empire of Vietnam</a>, a puppet regime set up by <a href="Imperial%20Japan">Imperial Japan</a> after they invaded during World War II. They also accused him of ceding half the country to the communists. The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed he had no choice, but Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.

Diệm used the Ministry of Information's electoral education campaign as a partisan political tool. Instead of using it purely to explain the democratic process, the campaign was used to extol Diệm and his allies. After explaining what democracy was, a pamphlet outlined why "Deposing a chief-of-state is a vital act." After elaborating on the powers of the head of state, the pamphlet went on to champion Diệm as an anti-communist who could defend people's freedom, while explaining why Bảo Đại was unfit to lead, saying that he did not have respect among the international community.

On 15 October, Bảo Đại issued a statement protesting against the referendum. He urged the governments of France, the United Kingdom, the United States, India and even the Soviet Union not to recognise Diệm, asserting that he was an obstacle to the reunification of Vietnam under the Geneva Accords. He accused Diệm's poll of being "a governmental activity which conforms neither to the profound sentiment of the Vietnamese people nor to the common cause of peace".

On 18 October, he made the token gesture of formally dismissing Diệm. The following day, he denounced "the police methods" of Diệm's "dictatorship" and warned the Vietnamese populace "against a regime that was bound to lead them to ruin, famine, and war". Bảo Đại accused Diệm of trying to foment conflict between the French and the Americans. On the eve of the poll, Bảo Đại stated "I can even tell you that I know the percentage of favourable votes that Mr. Diem has decided to obtain."

The staging of the election was subsidised by foreign funding. The United States government and a combination of American Roman Catholic charities contributed US$2 million each. <a href="Ba%20C%E1%BB%A5t">Ba Cụt</a>, a leader of an anti-government <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> religious sect, distributed a pamphlet condemning Diệm as an American puppet, citing the funding as proof and further asserting that Diệm was going to "Catholicize" the country. The Vietnamese Socialist Party, which was affiliated to the Hòa Hảo, claimed Diệm had "bribed the world of laborers and young students to petition in support of Diem's rise to chief-of-state and to petition in favor of deposing Bao Dai", using the American election funding. Another Hòa Hảo rebel leader, General Trần Văn Soái, assailed Diệm's undemocratic regime and declared the referendum illegal. He invited "friendly countries and the people of Vietnam to distrust this political maneuver". Diệm had earlier told a cabinet minister that there was only one political party – Nhu's outfit, and went about eradicating opposition by force. Opponents claimed Diệm's declarations about the value of democracy were hollow.

Lansdale advised Diệm to print his ballots in red, while those of Bảo Đại were printed in green. In Vietnam, red is associated with good luck and prosperity, whereas green is often associated with a <a href="cuckold">cuckold</a> and bad luck. Diệm's red ballots pictured him with youthful and modern-looking people, while Bảo Đại's photo was placed in old-fashioned robes, which he never wore. In addition, Bảo Đại's portrait showed him to appear dazed and bloated, while Diệm and those surrounding him were smiling and appeared to be energetic. The ballot claimed that a vote for Diệm would be a vote for democracy, stating "I depose Bảo Đại and recognise Ngô Đình Diệm as Head of State, charged with the commission of setting up a democratic regime." Bảo Đại's ballot read "I do not depose Bảo Đại and do not regard Ngô Đình Diệm as the Head of State charged with the commission of setting up a democratic regime." The voters would place the red or green ballot into the box, according to their preference, while discarding the other, which meant the voting was actually not secret.
The logistics of the referendum were organised and supervised by Diệm's brother and confidant, Nhu, who was the leader of the family's secret <a href="C%E1%BA%A7n%20Lao%20party">Cần Lao party</a>, which supplied the Ngôs' electoral base. Reports of violence and intimidation were widespread. During the referendum, Nhu's staff told voters to throw away the green ballots. Those who disobeyed were often chased down and beaten, with <a href="pepper%20sauce">pepper sauce</a> and water sometimes being forced into their nostrils. The violations were particularly flagrant in central Vietnam, a region over which another of Diệm's younger brothers, <a href="Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20C%E1%BA%A9n">Ngô Đình Cẩn</a>, ruled. Cẩn was based in the former imperial capital city of <a href="Hu%E1%BA%BF">Huế</a>, home of the <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20Dynasty">Nguyễn Dynasty</a> and a source of support for Bảo Đại. He stifled this support by ordering the police to arrest 1,200 people for political reasons in the week leading up to the vote. In the city of <a href="H%E1%BB%99i%20An">Hội An</a>, several people were killed in election violence on the day of the poll. Voting started at 07:00 and ended at 17:00.

Diệm's government formulated procedural regulations ostensibly designed to ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent election fraud. In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes in Saigon, although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that only half of the registered voters in Saigon had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale <a href="ballot%20stuffing">ballot stuffing</a>.

Diệm's regime had announced that 5,335,668 people were eligible to vote, but when the results were declared, there were 5,784,752 ballots. Diệm's government claimed his candidacy had been endorsed by the mother of Bảo Đại, although Diệm had ordered the military to confiscate her family's property and evict her from the land. The near unanimous voter turnout and support for Diệm was replicated in highland and <a href="Mekong%20Delta">Mekong Delta</a> swamp areas, which were not even under the control of the government and its <a href="Vietnamese%20National%20Army">Vietnamese National Army</a>. In some districts of the Mekong Delta, overwhelming tallies for Diệm in excess of 90% of the registered voters were recorded, even though the <a href="H%C3%B2a%20H%E1%BA%A3o">Hòa Hảo</a> warlord <a href="Ba%20Cut">Ba Cụt</a> and his army had prevented voting.

The referendum was widely condemned for being fraudulent. Historian and writer Jessica Chapman said "Even Diệm apologists like Anthony Trawick Bouscaren and American CIA officer Edward Lansdale concur with the prime minister's harshest critics on the conclusion that the South Vietnamese government was either incapable of or unwilling to hold a truly free, representative plebiscite". A CIA report written in 1966 adjudged the poll to be the most heavily manipulated in the first 11 years of South Vietnam's history. The U.S. government privately concluded that the monopoly Diệm had on the media and the election campaign was a greater factor in the victory than intimidation and the fact that the voting was effectively public. Reinhardt cabled Washington, saying that the "referendum proved [a] resounding success for [the] Diem government". He indicated that the poll results were not necessarily a reflection of reality by adding that the result did not show that Diệm had majority support but that he was able to control the country, effectively unchallenged. The U.S. government was heartened by Diệm's apparent ability to negate communist and other opposition.

The scholar <a href="Bernard%20B.%20Fall">Bernard B. Fall</a> stated that "there is not the slightest doubt that this plebiscite was only a shade more fraudulent than most electoral tests under a dictatorship". The American journalist <a href="Stanley%20Karnow">Stanley Karnow</a> cited the dubious plebiscite as evidence of Diệm's "mandarin mentality". Chapman wrote that "... no amount of unilateral campaigning, anti-Bảo Đại sentiment, or Confucian political restraint could explain Diệm's 98 percent margin of victory in a politically heterogeneous South Vietnam. Corruption and intimidation must have played a significant role." Buttinger said that while the monarchy was "another rotten relic of Vietnam's past" and Bảo Đại "its last, unworthy representative", fraud and intimidation were unnecessary as Diệm would have won easily in any event. Historian David Anderson said the victory "was not a true representation of Diệm's power or popularity. The emperor's weakness, the disarray of the political opposition, and other such factors explain his triumph".

Three days after the vote, Diệm proclaimed the creation of the Republic of Vietnam, naming himself as its president. He said "The October 23rd plebiscite in which [the people of South Vietnam] took such an enthusiastic part, constitutes an approval of the policies pursued thus far and at the same time augurs a whole new era for the future of our country." Diệm reiterated that he would not partake in national reunification elections, saying that they would be futile unless "true liberty" came about in the communist North Vietnam, which impressed American observers, who feared a total communist takeover.

Having claimed the election was entirely without irregularities, the United States government hailed Diệm as a new hero of the "free world". Senator <a href="Mike%20Mansfield">Mike Mansfield</a> (D-MT) claimed the referendum "was a reflection of their [the Vietnamese people's] search for a leader who would respond to their needs ... they sensed that Diệm could provide that kind of leadership." Mansfield had been a professor of Asian history before entering politics; as a result his opinions about Vietnam were more influential and held in high regard by his fellow senators. Archives of policy discussions show that the Americans were concerned more about the negative image created by Diem's autocratic and antidemocratic style among the international community, rather than its possible effects on national cohesion. The US State Department spokesman said "the people of Viet-Nam have spoken, and we, of course, recognise their decision". An official congratulatory statement from the department said "The Department of State is gratified that according to reports the referendum was conducted in such an orderly and efficient manner and that the people of Viet-Nam have made their choice unmistakably clear ... we look forward to a continuation of the friendly relations between the Government of Viet-Nam and the United States."

Reaction to Diệm's victory among the American press varied with geographic location. Newspapers in the Midwest hailed Diệm's win as a triumph for democracy and extolled the new president as a champion of democracy. However, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said that the extreme margin of victory made "Diem's administrative control look more pervasive than is thought to be the case by a number of observers here." However, the paper also obligingly claimed the poll a "sound democratic procedure" and a "public tribute to a strong-willed leader". "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" called it an "overwhelming endorsement" and dubbed Diệm a "beacon of light, showing the way to free people".

Diệm's victory was seen as a blow to French stature in Vietnam, as the former colonial power had helped to set up Bảo Đại's State of Vietnam in 1949. They consistently opposed Diệm and his policies, and unsuccessfully tried to impede him. The U.S. media regarded Diệm's victory as a signal that the United States would be the only Western power in South Vietnam. Some felt that this would enable Diệm to rule effectively without French hindrance, while others felt that this would leave too much of a burden on the American government. The French media and diplomatic corps viewed the result as a humiliation. Before the poll, French officials had privately predicted Diệm would dissolve the French High Command and use any victory as justification for scrapping the national reunification elections. The French media viewed the poll as undemocratic and a plot by the Americans to sabotage any prospect of national reunification, but France recognised the Republic of Vietnam soon after.

Diệm severed economic relations with France on 9 December 1955, and withdrew from the <a href="French%20Union">French Union</a> shortly afterwards. Neither the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> nor <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">communist China</a> overtly objected to Diệm's actions in creating a new state in the southern half of Vietnam. Nevertheless, by the time of Diệm's <a href="1963%20South%20Vietnamese%20coup">deposal</a> and <a href="Arrest%20and%20assassination%20of%20Ng%C3%B4%20%C4%90%C3%ACnh%20Di%E1%BB%87m">assassination</a> in 1963, France bought 46.3% of South Vietnam's exports and accounted for most of the foreign investment in the country. French cultural influences and the language remained prevalent.

In January 1956, with no legislature and constitution in place, Diệm used his absolute power to dissolve the Revolutionary Council by launching police raids on the members, forcing those from the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo who had rallied to his side to go on the run. As a result, they turned against him.
